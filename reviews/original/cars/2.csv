0,8,Very underrated,"I'm actually shocked by how low the ratings are for this movie. I thought it was the best Cars film and a pretty solid film in general. It follows Lightning McQueen in a completely different role, that of the aging star who is out of touch with the times. It is heartbreaking, it is dramatic and it is compelling. I never knew I could feel so sorry and yet so hopeful for such a has-been."
1,8,Solid conclusion to Cars Trilogy!,"Way better than I expected. After being slightly disappointed by Cars 2, this was a pretty good return to form for the Cars franchise. I thought it definitely could've been much better, though. A lot of the scenes were unneeded and once again, did not have the magic the first one has. But somehow, it still finds its way and manages to be a formidable sequel and satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Although, was it really the conclusion? It seems like they could do another, but they just don't make enough money. Hopefully we'll see a fourth that just completely blows people away. Other than that, I don't have much else to say, pretty forgettable but still pretty funny and entertaining."
2,7,An improvement over Cars 2,"While another sequel to Cars was still not needed, Cars 3 is at least closer to the quality of the original. With more of a focus on Lightning McQueen and his internal struggle, the story has a lot more depth than Cars 2. The story isn't original by any means, but it's told in an interesting way and is a pretty fun watch."
3,8,Thats a ending!,"Yes! Love this ending of cars! 1 and 3 are the best, 2 more for fun. I enjoyed this movie a lot! Just for a fun night"
4,8,Ignore all the bad reviews! This was a good movie.,** Possible Spoilers **
5,4,Good enough,"Cars 3 is not like the rest of the Cars movies, though it tries recapture some glory from the first movie. Didn't mind the new characters, they were interesting in their own way. However, it would have been good to also have some of the old characters in there as well, and not just at the beginning and at the end. Other than that, the story is okay, with some action (though, they could have added some more) and a great twist in the end, that, at least, helped pull the movie out of the cliché pit. Finally, the special effects were nice, with the cars almost looking like real ones, especially at certain scenes, where even the scenery looked real. So, overall, 4 out of 10."
6,3,Shocking Ending...and not in a good way.,"In this one, Lighting struggles to keep up with the new young techno cars on the circuit and has to go find his racing mojo. Along the way he meets a young racing car who is ironically his trainer, as it turns out she is the one who needs the training from Lighting. Lighting teaches her his techniques whilst trying to improve himself."
7,3,One of Pixars worst films and lacked in story and humor.,"Cars 3 was not my highly anticipated Pixar film since the second movie was just pure boredom. And this series has been running downhill and can never match the first movie which was cute and fun. This third film fails and bites the dust on the track with its sequel problems in lacking a creative plot, fun humor, the characters are no longer fun, and it was quite boring as well. "
8,4,"Never really got into gear, the 'Cars' franchise has run out of gas","Am a big Pixar fan, feature films and short films. As far as feature films go, the 'Toy Story' franchise, 'Inside Out', 'Up' and 'Wall-E' were particularly fantastic, while 'Presto', 'One Man Band', 'Geri's Game' and 'Piper' were particularly great short films."
9,9,Speed with heart,"#Cars3 is speed with heart. It's fun, exciting and emotionally endearing. The first film was about a lost small town USA and the humbling of a cocky racer. The second movie didn't quite know what it wanted to be, part espionage, part mistaken identity, part global tournament, all wrapped up in a poor attempt to address friendship. But this third installment is about the racer becoming the mentor while at the same time honoring the legacy of a very important person in McQueen's life, Hudson Hornet, who's voiced by the the late great actor whom we cinema deeply miss seeing on screen, Paul Newman."
10,7,"entertaining, moving, has a good moral for children, and a quantum leap up from Cars 2","Aside from what should be obvious to most of those who are over the age of 5 - merchandising, merchandising! I can hear Yogurt from Spaceballs say (which this movie does try to sort of, kind of, almost satirize but doesn't quite get there, and I'll get to that later) - I wondered going in why Pixar would make Cars 3. The first Cars, one of those unlikely passion projects for John Lasseter, was fine though not remarkable unless one didn't mind getting their Paul Newman fix (last movie too!) if it meant wading through the ""comedy"" of Larry the Cable Guy, and the sequel was one of the most mediocre films of the past decade, from anywhere (again, Larry the Cable Guy as the protagonist). But then I thought that this was exactly why it would be interesting to see the movie - what would the Pixar creative team come up on this one. What they came up with was a good movie, no more but no less either."
11,2,An uninspired borefest,"I am one of those guys who actually liked the first Cars film. That one had a soul. Then came the second installment, which was even better - one of those rare sequels that did not feel forced or redundant."
12,7,Good Sequel! Better than the Cars 2,The first Cars movie was awesome and it jumpstarted a lot of rip-offs tv shows for children. talking cars or talking planes everywhere nowadays... cars was the origin and of course there have been two sequels to that movie. while the first sequel felt forced onto the franchise this one here fits perfectly. a great continuation about how his career would develop over the years. he's not a rookie any more... he's not as fast as he used to be... he needs to find out how to solve this... the hints about where the story goes are subtle and reach the right conclusion in the end. and its feels like this might also be the final movie for the franchise but who knows...<br /><br />it a solid 7. if you loved the first one you will love this one as well
13,2,Why,"Even my son was asking throughout then entire 1 hour middle portion of the movie , ""why aren't they racing, is he gonna race Jackson storm ..."". I just kept saying yeah son eventually. Then it's the female that ends up racing in the end and my 5 year old son experience his first episode of disappointment and fraud. How do you explain to a 5 year old that it's politics and the moral of the story is no longer innocent heroic comebacks but now it's about equal opportunity and forcing ideas on young minds. Kids just want to see a good , animated race movie AS ADVERTISED!!! Instead it's 10 minutes of racing, and an hour and a half of training and build up that leaves you asking yourself... did this have to be nearly two hours long?! Garbage"
14,1,Awful!,"Review:<br /><br />What an awful movie! I'm not a big fan of the previous movies, so I was hoping that Pixar would have put some more effort into this one but it was just as bad as the rest. I know that it was made for a young audience but they could have included something content for the adults. The animation was also average, and none of the new characters were that great. Anyway, in this movie Lightning McQueen is finding it tough to challenge the new generation of cars, so he leaves the race track for a while, and he seeks help from an eager young female, Cruz Ramirez, who has a unique, and somewhat brutal method of training. McQueen finds it hard to adapt to her methods, and he shows her the beauty of racing, which was put behind her due to her training. Together they finally build up the courage to challenge the big stars of the race track, and they use some of his old tricks, which made McQueen a star. Boring! Boring! Boring! This is definitely one of those films were the merchandise is much better than the actual movie. With such a top form back catalog, I'm surprised that Pixar spent the time to make a 3rd movie, because there isn't that much that you can do with talking racing cars. Anyway, I'm sure the little one's will love to see these much loved characters back on the big screen but I personally couldn't stand the movie. Rubbish!"
15,10,Loved this!,I absolutely loved this film from start to finish. Actually I loved the movie first part when Lightning is blindsided by new generation of race cars and the music during that part is nice too. I loved Lightning crashing scene as finally he learns his lesson of being too proud of himself. But the middle part is like the first film very boring and I actually almost fell asleep. So if there is a Cars 4 please make the middle part more exciting. But overall way better than Cars and Cars 2.
16,5,Lost focus,*** This movie is both politically correct and sexist. This is common with most movies today ***
17,4,"Old Cars, New Cars, I Say, Two Stars","Three movies and countless Mater-shorts later, I still want to know how a world inhabited by live automobiles could exist with our own landmarks. Following from the previous installments, Cars 3 wants me to believe older cars are made of older models, and newer cars are made of newer models, never mind their biology of reproduction. But now it wants me to believe crabs live on their beaches. It even continues to parody itself by putting up ""re-tire-ment"" ads on the freeway. ​ Even by the standards of Pixar's nonsensical world, it still makes no sense. Each act felt increasingly made up on the spot throughout production, with a phoned-in self-contradicting message thrown in last minute. This stated logic just raises more questions than answers, like, why does such a franchise exist from a studio made famous for telling emotive stories for a new generation of storytellers? Yet, as long as parents know about the ""good messages"" of their kids' programs, we can rest easy at night, right?"
18,7,"It's a Way, Way, Way Better than Cars 2","If you came out of Cars 2 disappointed you're not alone, the bad spy stuff, the melodramatic plot and the awful characterization. This film is visually fantastic having Lightning McQueen take part in a customary mid life crisis in a racing, mafia and sports movie. This part is a little bit boring but you can ignore it because it becomes an awesome race towards the end. I hope they don't make a fourth it will be a bad reboot featuring a ugly yellow car."
19,4,Last lap for Lightning McQueen?,"The franchise may be close to the last checkered flag. CARS 2 was a letdown from the original and now we have CARS 3 and hate to say...a busy disappointment. The legendary Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson) has just about ran all the tread off his tires as a new generation of blazing-fast racers seem to be close to forcing him out of the sport he loves. Lighting will need some tips from a young technician, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) and some much needed inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet to even have the chance to prove he can still race with the best of the young generation."
20,5,"In 2017, this film series has finally run out of gas. And the bad news is.. that's a good thing.","Cars 3 is a predictable, anticlimactic, decently acted, and full of small continuity errors film, yet it still features some of the best visuals in animation to date. Although this film was still enjoyable at times, I never really connected to the characters like I did in the original film over ten years ago. Sure this film was good enough for young kids, but to me it wasn't, and I decided to give Cars 3 an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. Sadly the Cars franchise had such great promise when it originally took to the road back in 2006. Now in 2017, this film series has finally run out of gas. And the bad news is.. that's a good thing."
21,1,Worst,My kids feel asleep. Does that say it all. It was slow pace and very little funny moments. We saw despicable me 3 last week and it was great and they laughed forever. This was a wast of money and time. My kids said they felt like we was in the theater for days later. They can't tell me one single moment from the movie.
22,9,An incredible comeback for the Cars franchise,There will be spoilers...
23,1,Dreadful,"1. Awful. ! 2. Boring. ! 3. Endless. ! 4. Repetitive. ! 5. Nerve wrecking nonsense. ! 6. Just plain stupid. ! 7. The first ""Cars"" is wonderful. The third ""Cars"" belongs in the trash."
24,2,"Not as bad as Cars 2, but almost","This movie did everything to assassinate the things we loved about the original cars, and replaced it with some sort of your heroes aren't your heroes anymore baloney. Worse yet, some of the beloved characters are AWOL, only to be replaced with stale and one-dimensional characters. Essentially, the entire movie centers on one central idea, and nothing else. Unfortunately, that central idea is akin to telling the audience to end their admiration of the first movie and get ready for some sort of Cars 4 where the first movie is gone. "
25,5,"Bland and uninspiring, but a massive improvement on Cars 2","From a purely merchandising point of view, Pixar's Cars franchise is nothing short of a masterstroke. Even if the films, spin-offs, and straight-to-DVD shorts aren't up to scratch - and they aren't - children will be sure to ask mummy and daddy for the latest sleek toy, no matter how obscure the character. In response, the Cars movies have added numerous forgettable new characters with each film, adding to their extensive range of collectables in the process. It's a cynical approach, but merchandise has always been Disney's bread-and-butter in their quest to seemingly own everything. As a result, Cars 2 was a huge disappointment; a half- arsed sequel to a movie that had already left many underwhelmed, which took the central story off on a random tangent and promoted the annoying sidekick to the central hero. Still, it made lots of money, so a trilogy-closer was inevitable."
26,3,One of the worst endings for a movie ever,Who thought it would be a good idea to retire Lightning McQueen after receiving a barrage of age-related abuse from the new 'rookies'? Great message! In the previous film we saw Mator get all kinds of power-ups to make him go faster but in this film they can't make McQueen go 10mph+ faster with a hi-tech training facility.
27,4,"Forgettable entry and, hopefully, the last.","The trailers for this movie would lead you to believe that the Pixar staff wanted to transpose a ""Rocky III"" type comeback onto their landscape with McQueen being the next Balboa. I get it. It's a formula that can work and usually does in the hands of skilled movie-makers."
28,2,Extremely depressing movie,"I am not going to lie, I loved the first cars. It was a great movie in my opinion. After the disaster of Cars 2 I was looking forward to seeing what was going to happen to the franchise."
29,8,Revving Up to A better Story,"""I am Speed!"" A quote that will live on forever in the minds of the 2000 generation, movie quote boards, and the status of Disney fans. For those not remembering the quote, or not realizing what this review is about, it is Lightning McQueen's catchphrase in the famous Cars series. Pixar's work about living Cars took the world by storm long ago, but a flat tire left it stranded behind its cousins. After a detour with the second installment, Cars 3 attempts to change tires and redeem itself on the winner circle. And it's my job to commentate and analyze the movie. Let's rev up and take off with another Robbie movie review. "
30,8,A good closure of the series,"I thought it was surprisingly good and a well thought of ending four the series. It was funny and realistic, easy to relate to and get involved with the story."
31,5,One of the most dissapointing movie experiences I've ever sat through,"First off, I want to say that when Cars 1 first came out, I loved that movie and I sill love it today. I was about 6 when Cars 2 came out, I liked it when I was younger, but now I don't. Now, I'm 13 and this came out on Netflix a little while ago. Boy, was I dissapointed. "
32,5,Bad plot ruins movie.,"Cars 3 begins great, the whole atmosphere of Cars 1 is back. The races, the scenery when the truck rides through the country, even the music of Cars 1 reappears. Lots of fascinating details everywhere (anyone notice the Mclaren headquarters?). The story starts intrigueing, but soon takes a turn for the worst."
33,4,The creativity tank runs dry,"In retrospect an animated movie about anthropromorphized vehicles maybe never really had any long-term prospects but still surprising to see how quickly the series ran out of gas. By the second installment the characters already played the ""let's go to Europe"" card. By number 3 our hero - Lightning McQueen - (get it, his name is a reference to actor / racer Steve McQueen, aren't Easter eggs fun!) gets replaced. Maybe Thewestchestarian missed something but the plot features ""2.0"" (it actually says it on Jackson Storm's paint job) racers replacing McQueen's generation (which is what he did in the first film - aren't callbacks fun!). Yet the car/human hybrid, McQueen passes his baton to seems to also be a first generation car? Unwisely, this installment ventures into math which is the natural enemy of pathos. Storm cruises at 207MPH with gusts up to 214MPH but our heroine Cruz (get it? ""Cruz"" like in ""cruising"" in a car - aren't puns fun?!) tops out at 193 during training. So how is she keeping up? <br /><br />Anyway, the plot not making a lot of sense and the abundant overuse of references, puns, and callbacks is not actually important. Pixar made it's name through snappy dialog (see anything Mike says in Monsters, Inc.), powerful emotional moments (see first vignette in Up), and sheer artistry (see all of Wall-E). Cars 3 just delivers little of the first 2 and the, perhaps unfairly, moviegoers have grown accustomed to the art in the Cars universe after two previous outings. <br /><br />In short, kind of a meh outing but at least they kept Daniel Lawrence Whitney's Larry the Cable Guy in check in this one."
34,1,"WORST CLIMAX, FALSE ADVERTISING,","Film makers say that a bad movie clearly falls apart. You can easily break it down for analysis, unlike a good one. ITS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THE TERRIBLE CLIMAX OF THIS MOVIE WAS WRITTEN FIRST AND THE REST OF IT WAS JUST MADE UP ARTIFICIALLY FOR IT. Trailer advertised something else. Think of a Batman movie where Batman is having a nice time in Hawaii beach and some unknown guy does all the ninja stuff to defeat the villain. Enough said."
35,4,rocky 3 or rookie 5,"The Movie reminds me Rocky 3, our hero loses face on a younger rival, his mentor does not exist anymore, it is necessary for him to find other reference marks."
36,2,"Cars 3 is a disgraceful end to a well loved franchise. This is not the Cars 2 we wanted, just a mess of stolen plots and tropes.","Okay, before I start I will say that I am a 33 year old woman who loves film, music, games, nature and technology. I am not hating on this because I don't like women characters, I am not some ""negative nobody"" as people who dislike this film have been called, who doesn't like new things. I generally see things that I do not like here. "
37,1,Horrible,"I warning you all right now SPOILER ALERT. So one might believe that this film would be about lightning feeling bad after his big wreck and wanting to train and work hard to beat the car that made him feel that way but no it's about him training while everyone is tearing him down with the excessive old age jokes, and telling him that he will never be fast enough to beat the car who caused him to feel that way in the first place but despite that lightning continues to train and failing at every point which by this time who would think he would see some progress but no it's quite the opposite he gets slower and the cherry on it all toward the end of the movie it's the big race against the character Storm so lightning starts the race after the first lap he quits and sends in this flat character Cruz to take lightning's number and finish the race despite the character Cruz has no racing experience and she magically beats all the new racers including lightning's rival Storm but it gets worse after the race lightning retires from racing(despite throughout the whole movie him saying that he will never retire) and lightning becomes Cruz's coach. It gave no closure to lightning's story and not to mention the character Doc is dead without any explanation but magically the truck that trained Doc and was older than Doc was still alive which again makes no sense. So to sum it up lightning retires and becomes a defeatist. Don't watch unless you want your kids to be disappointed."
38,2,Stalled in pit lane....,"As a huge supporter and fan of the first CARS film, and not caring at all for the 2nd, this one was phoned in, lacked the ""SOUL"" and interest of the original. The parts are there, the deep drama and personal problems but it failed to flow. Just plodded along from thing to thing until the big climax ending. The ending was fine, but I have zero desire to ever watch this again, and won't be buying the disc, and WILL be watching the original again to re-feel everything that was missing here. "
39,3,Painfully unoriginal,"Took the kids to see this early after release, figuring I'd enjoy myself as well since the original was pretty well done. Sadly, I was mistaken."
40,5,this is a OK movie,"this movie was actually OK not as bad as i thought and when i saw the trailer i thought it was going to be terrible but it wasn't that bad this movie was boring most of the time. the writing was OK thought. even thought it was really slow paced i could still understand the pilot, point, and message in this film. the characters weren't that great either because they didn't feel original enough. overall this movie is not original. the jokes weren't funny either. overall a OK movie but could of been way better. it had a few good qualities but a lot of bad ones. this movie needs much more work."
41,2,Feminism Propaganda that Destroys the Legacy of Lighning,"This was made with feminism in mind. I assume these movie in 2016-2017 were so far in production, they were already enthralled in the feminist agenda, and had Hillary Clinton invested in their movies and wanted to push that agenda."
42,1,They killed McQueen! and put somecar else on the screen...,"What happened?... Are they trying to shutdown some ""old"" franchises?... this movie is a total anti-climax, you go in full of expectations and go out trying to forget it... to keep the good old memories... it is sad... they completely abandoned the universe created in Cars 1 and 2 and all other spin-offs... they tried to do something new, a new perspective, but did not develop anything beyond a scratch deep... nothing makes any sense... no fun... no logical connection among story developments... I will try to forget it... but it will be though... in the end there is no hero left..."
43,5,how to destroy a good movie,"Till the end, I was very pleased with story and liked where it was going. It was really good to see McQueen and his challenge through the movie."
44,5,"More original than the first, irritatingly flawed.",With a Toy Story 3-esque story of accepting change and moving on Cars 3 could have been a great and truly touching movie. 
45,8,"Relax folks, McQueen doesn't die.","I had to say that since so many people were kept away and buy this one fear. The movie is what I hoped it would be. And yet, ended in such a way that I did not expect and was thankful for at the same time. It is a slow movie, so know that going in. Loved all of it."
46,1,Even Mater cannot save this one.....,This is a classic example of Hollywood culture of trying to force a sequel even though you have no thought of idea.
47,1,Definitely not what was advertised. You lied Pixar :(,"I love anime, video games and comics of all kinds. Disney, Pixar, you get the picture. My whole family is like this. I loved the original cars and thought cars 2 was good too. So when I saw the posters and trailers for cars 3, I thought hey! A cool looking comeback type movie. I was so disappointed, as was everyone else I know who watched this movie."
48,10,Awesome,"Cars 3 is probably just as good as the first one. Way better than Cars 2! It is really emotional. It has some good laughs! The story is amazing! The characters are great. I liked the new trainer Cruz Rameriez's character. We get some older cars and new younger generations like Jackson Storm. Good Ending (NO SPOILERS I PROMISE!). If you really like Cars 1, you're gonna love Cars 3!"
49,9,Everything you hoped for and didn't get in Cars 2,"They realized that when they make a movie just so they can continue to merchandise the brand, people will probably be angry. Well, it took them a few movies to realize it (Cars 2, Planes, Planes 2), but that's right, folks, Cars 3 wasn't a horrible, plot-less, mess of an excuse for a toy commercial. Instead it was heartfelt, eclectic, smart, and finally delivered the sequel that Cars deserved, just a few years and a total flop later."
50,1,Not what I was expecting,"Not what I was expecting, *spoiler alert* franchise killed lightning McQueen, he never recovers to race again. Huge disappointment for my son, it was literally the death of lightning McQueen."
51,1,Disappointed,"There are so many disappointments with this film, I don't know where to begin. So I'll start herefirst, the tag-line that, ""you can't turn back time, but you can wind it up again"" is not mentioned at all by any character in this film. As it turns out, Lightning can't wind it up again. **SPOILER ALERT** In fact, he is too old to finish the race and needs a young girl car to do it for him. Did Disney not learn anything from The Simpsons?? You don't have to age animated characters. From the previews, I was led to believe that Lightning would wreck, overcome his impediments to win the race and show us all that we can do anything we put our minds to. Instead, Disney, was so busy being PC by making a girl win that they actually WERE being ageist. When you pay to see Lightning win, and he doesn't cross that finish line, you have failed as writers. I will now move on to the poor characterization of Cruz. From the color chosen for her, her dialogue, her lack of humor or connection-she was flat. "
52,1,How awful this was,"When Cars the original came out I was seven years old I followed the ""trilogy"" to where I am now 18 and let me tell you something... this was not how I wanted lightning to end his career I mean Jesus was this movie awful. I would rather have watched the big bang theory on repeat for the rest of my life."
53,,"""Cars 3"": 3rd in Pixar Series Needed Some Fine Tuning","2 out of 5 stars (has some good moments, but is overall bad)"
54,2,Weak story with all the wrong plot choices,"This movie had no dimension beyond Lightning McQueen trying to win one more race only to never actually race one more race. The other characters of the original movie make scarce appearance, and we basically spend the whole movie watching Lightning McQueen get ready to race the final big race but then never actually race the big final race (because he ""passes the torch"" to this flat and uninteresting new racer car called Cruz Ramirez who is about as interesting as a 1982 Toyota Corolla)."
55,2,"Everybody saying ""this is the Cars 2 we wanted"" are wrong or lying. This movie is disappointment made form.","Okay, before I start I will say that I am a 33 year old woman who loves film, music, games, nature and technology. I am not hating on this because I don't like women characters, I am not some ""negative nobody"" as people who dislike this film have been called, who doesn't like new things. I generally see things that I do not like here. That said, here's what I have to say."
56,6,"The Weakest Pixar Film to Date,","Cars 3 is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great voice cast. It certainly has its moments, a pleasure as always to see these lovable characters once again, particularly Lightning McQueen and Mater, who have a terrific back and forth with one another as always. There is also a very sweet, hard hitting message as we see McQueen accepting his fate and realising it is his time to pass on the torch, the final fifteen minutes certainly serves as an effective finale to the series. "
57,1,Disappointment for Cars' fan children,"My son was born in 2006, we watched first movie maybe a hundred times, and second one several times. Cars was like Star Wars for us. And 3rd movie? At the end of the movie my 11 years old son was so upset to see Mc Queen as a retiring loser car, he only said: ""I'll never talk about Mc Queen, this is the end"". Bugs Bunny does not get old, why did you have to retire Mc Queen so early? And we hate that yellow car, Cruz, it can never replace Mc Queen. Mc Queen is red, how could you turn it to blue?! This movie is a big disappointment, we'll try to forget it"
58,1,Can this movie be anymore PC?,"All i have to say, way to completely ruin the franchise and take a dump at the mcqueen's legacy. Doesn't Disney already have enough female protagonists as it is? Yes, Cars 1 did great, Cars 2 was terrible, but cars 3 is horrible. I am honestly surprised to see that the third installment has got almost same ratings as Cars 1. "
59,1,Thought we would finally see McQueen win......we never will it seems.....,"The movie starts with Lightning as a 10 year veteran in the racing world and at the top of his game. Then the racing board, for some reason, lets all these new hybrid cars force all the older racers out, except Lightning, who crashes. Months later, with no mention of his injuries or his trauma, Sally gets Lightning to go back to racing. After meeting his new boss, Lightning gets a trainer called Cruz, to help get him back in shape. But Cruz is clearly not a good trainer as she spends more time trying to get Lightning to name his tires, nap, goes overboard on the excessive age-shaming, and he ends up losing his temper."
60,5,The Vidiot Reviews...,Cars 3
61,6,"Better than reviews say it is, worse than I expected to be","First of all, let me get this out of my system: I've seen many 1-2 stars reviews out there. While I understand why those people are upset I think 1/10 is way too low. The movie isn't inherently bad, it's not a disastrous mess of burning oil like some reviewers make it to look. But it's not great either."
62,4,Easily the most disappointing Pixar film,"Yes that's right, this film is even more disappointing than the abomination that was ""Cars 2"". There are some truly atrocious creative choices made towards the end of the film which I will discuss in a moment. Let me first point out, however, that there is some good in this film. The first act does an alright job of setting up the stakes and character arcs. We are introduced to the new characters and it moves a long at a pretty fast pace. The second act, though a bit meandering and slow, explores Lightning McQueen's relationship with Doc Hudson. It was easily the most poignant part of the film and gave good closure to Doc's character, something ""Cars 2"" failed at altogether. Additionally, the animation is absolutely sublime and Randy Newman's score beautifully echoes that of the first movie. Where the film completely and utterly fails is the third act. Spoilers follow. The biggest issue with this film is Cruz Ramirez. She weighed down the movie in the first and second acts, and in the third act, renders Lightning useless. The film sets up an underdog story with Lightning's crash and subsequent recovery but never delivers this. Instead, Lightning gives up in the middle of the final race in Florida and passes the torch onto Cruz who, despite this being her first race and her only training for two weeks, magically wins. Lightning, the beloved racer from the first film, is completely cast aside for the annoying, moronic, and horrible Cruz. It's PC-pandering at its worst. Cruz is a complete Mary-Sue. She didn't have a shred of likability in the first two acts, but I could tolerate her because it was still Lightning's story. The third act feels like it was written by new-age feminists who completely miss the point of the ""Cars"" movies and don't at all understand the concept of a narrative character arc. What is most devastating is the fact that we never got to see Lightning rise up through the ranks, beat Jackson Storm, and finally become the fabulous racer we know he is. We never got to see Lightning WIN. The film leaves you totally deflated and empty; flustered and angry that Pixar, a studio that has proved again and again its deftness at storytelling and filmmaking craft, has fallen to the collectivist propaganda that is plaguing some films lately. If you were a fan of the first ""Cars"" film, a fan of Lightning McQueen or even a fan of great movies in general, please PLEASE avoid this one. You will only be let down like I was. I repeat, DON'T WATCH IT."
63,5,Underwhelming disappointment.,"Let me just say this, I am NOT a huge fan of the sentient vehicle series. Cars 1 was fine, Cars 2 was borderline terrible, Planes was boring and Planes 2 was god awful. And while this movie is better than both Planes movies and Cars 2 to some extent, it still fails on many levels. I won't spoil anything but lets just say that even though it isn't boring, it is still a lousy movie and doesn't deserve the 7.2 out of 10 IMDb has given it. It didn't improve much over Cars 2. This was simply a waste of Pixar's time and money. I would've been OK with it if it was DisneyToon making it (they're the people responsible for Planes 1 and 2) because then I would have no reason to see it. But since Pixar made it I thought it would be something of decent quality. However it fails on many levels and I would not recommend it at all. If you like the sentient vehicle movie series regardless of quality then fine, see it. But be prepared for a movie that has no saving grace other than the fact that the animation is good. The animation is what earned this movie 4 stars in my book. That's the only thing good about it."
64,1,"apart from good graphics, not much excitement here","I wanted to like this movie based on the earlier ones and took my kids... was I wrong, it was awful. The whole movie is based on the red car trying to get his mojo back because he's too old or needs work, and in the end he basically quits. And still gets called the ""winner."" I don't like to overly analyze movies or entertainment and will watch and enjoy things with any reasonable message about self-empowerment, until that entertainment tries to shove a ridiculous message at people --- defeatist. More or less inane level propaganda, and about how NOT to succeed at something at that. If you want to see a real comeback movie, and one that makes a little sense, just rent any Rocky. 1 through 7 (or whatever they are on....) There are tons of other good ones."
65,1,PC crap!,"Let me start by saying I love the Cars movie franchise, so when I first saw the trailer and the poster for this latest instalment, I was very excited."
66,1,Please don't watch the movie if you liked cars 1,In which movie does the main protagonist chickens out before the final showdown (boss fight or the race in this case) and says to his trainer that you have been training with me so you can go and win it for me.
67,1,A disgrace to the original Cars,"I am a huge cars fan, I absolutely loved the first movie, the second movie was still really good, but the first was a classic. "
68,3,oh my god,Nononononononononononononononononon nonononononononono !!!!!
69,6,Fastest,"Better than ""cars 2"" and I like how we go back to the old racing roots since the first movie and learned more about McQueen"
70,6,The Real Sequel.,"Forget Cars 2 ever happened. This is a fitful sequel to end the franchise. The story of a hot shot at the end of his career and the future that awaits him. This is all about Lightening McQueen. It's a much better story. His trainer and protégée, Cruise, made for a pretty nice touch, and pleasantly voiced by Cristina Alonzo. It's still Cars, but it's no disaster."
71,7,Why?,Could've been great but the ending ruined it. Idk why they decided it would be a good idea to have that girl race at the end.
72,8,True sequel,"After the Cars 2 spy adventure spin-off which I still liked but didn't really advance the story anywhere, Cars 3 returns to form and shows us again why we loved the original so much. Now this still doesn't quite top the original for me, as the story in that just works so perfectly but Cars 3 gets really close."
73,8,"A very unpopular opinion, I know","I have been a huge fan of the Cars franchise ever since the first movie. I was really excited to watch it, since as a kid I was very much into sports cars and racing games. So this movie, which was actually good, seemed like a dream come true for me. I really liked the sequel too (that's a review for another time) and I was really disappointed to know that other people don't like this movie. So my hopes went up when I heard the third movie is also coming."
74,4,Review from a Pixar fan,"I have been a big Pixar fan ever since the first Toy Story. I have seen almost all the Pixar movies and I can say this is their worst movie after The Good dinosaur... and unfortunately dinosaurs and cars are probably my son's favorite objects and I was just a bit disappointed they couldn't get them right. I don't have anything more to say except graphics is the usual great quality from all Pixar movies but it still hasn't kept me from falling asleep. Overall, a poor movie by Pixar 's lofty standard but if u lower your expectation you might enjoy it."
75,5,Meh. Kind of boring.,"Another movie about Lightning McQueen! I was pretty surprised Disney added yet another sequel to this series. As much as I love Disney, the ""Cars"" movies never seem to grab me. In particular, ""Cars 3"" was very predictable and quite boring. "
76,9,Why cars 3 is one of the biggest surprises in Pixar history,"Cars 3 is the real cars 2, when I heard this movie was in theaters, I was a little scared but when I went to go see it in theaters, I was surprised, it's suprisingly on par with the original but not as good as the original for one reason, this movie is not original, say I put rocky 3 and talledega nights in blender, blend them together and u basically have this movie, but that's the only problem in this surprise of an amazing movie."
77,8,The emotional comeback,"This movie is a great ending to the Cars trilogy (2006-2017). Among other themes, Cars (2006) was about respect and racing, Cars 2 (2011) about accept and espionage, and this one about pride and career. It's similar to the first one, and it's a great continuation. The story of the first one is slightly better, but the emotional part of this one is slightly better than the first one, in my opinion. The important story about racing is a lot more relatable and interesting than it was in Cars 2. When we follow the career of Lightning McQueen and his past and the potential future, it gets very special and personal, because that's what the Cars universe is all about. The feelings truly hit me several times, especially when McQueen crashed, when he found out how much he meant to Doc Hudson, and when he realized his career was over. This movie did really hold on to the common thread from start to finish, and is emotionally the best movie in the trilogy."
78,2,Recycling with a new PC twist,"Forget race-o-rama, the time for femme-o-rama."
79,7,More cars,"So another cars movie. It's almost funny, that one of the weaker Pixar movies got as many sequels as Toy Story got (one of their best series). Now as I said in the Cars review, just because this is inferior to the other Pixar movies does not make it bad. And you can also say, just because this is predictable (an adult but I would reckon many ""older"" kids can see where this is heading, no pun intended), does not make it bad."
80,3,The Death of Lightning McQueen and Radiator Springs.,"So, I have always been a huge fan of Cars and it's franchise. I was 9 years old when the first movie came out and as a kid I became obsessed with the movie. At the age of 20, I can say that I still love the original movie as much as I did when I first saw it in theaters all those years ago. "
81,3,"Boring, meandering plot","This moving was really boring. The plot was slow and there was no action. There were several particularly slow scenes. Even my kid got bored and we left the theater early. Turns out I forgot my keys, so we had to go back in. My kid changed her mind and we watched until the end and it still sucked. What a letdown. She has no interest in cars anymore. I guess it's more Paw Patrol and Doc McStuffins for us."
82,8,Not a bad ride.,"So after the lackluster sequel that was Cars 2, Cars 3 redeems itself. Coming full circle, the story revolves around Lighting McQueen in a classic story about an old athlete having to compete with new blood and making the decision about weather he's a seasoned racer or just over the hill."
83,3,Below average and boring,"I have watched Cars 1 more than hundred times along with my son. Will be able to watch again without getting bored. But the Cars 2 not living up the expectation. But Cars 3, is just plain, boring and lame. The dialogues and story line are no way in line with the Cars 1 level. And the climax (making McQueen out and replaced by another car, really?) made it worse. Hope they will end this series now."
84,7,Faithful sequel!,"As you may know, the previous sequel was acting more like a Mater spin-off, but this one is closer to the first movie. In fact, if you never watched 2, then your not missing out on anything, surprisingly, this wasn't directed by Lasseter, who worked on the first 2, instead it's Brian Fee."
85,1,last is the worst,at one point i thought i was listening to an audio book.mater was left out.worst story line .lightning mcqueen retirement processes went through a long long scattered short stories.too much dialogue used and less cinematic expression.i think they want to sell more toys this time as they changed macqueen's get up 5/6 times.too many new characters and none of them could touch your heart.so the movie PLANES 3!!! coming soon.
86,3,This movie is a CAR-tastrophe,This is the proof that when you delay a movie that everyone was waiting for (Incredibles 2) to force one that no one wanted.
87,1,Pixar 1995-2017 ?,The Good:
88,7,A retrospective on a pretty decent animated trilogy,"**I first wrote this review on 11/15/17 but it never got published. If something seems off or outdated, this is the reason why.**"
89,6,"Good movie, better than the first I think","I was not expecting this to be this mature, one of Pixar's best opening 15 minutes that sets up the surprisingly compelling comeback story for Lightning. The Cars movies were not really my cup of tea and I'm of the belief that the second one is actually better than the first because of it's utterly ludicrous nature. But, to this movies credit, the racing scenes are gorgeous especially the training sequences. I think the design of the cars has always been pretty ugly, specifically the mouths, but here everything that doesn't have to do with the design of the cars is really fantastic stuff that Pixar should be proud of. I was also surprised about the emotional angle of this movie and how it really snuck up on me, with an emphasis on Doc and how he influenced McQueen, more offscreen of course, the movie is able to balance it's main arc much better. Having not seen a Pixar movie in a while, the brisk pacing was certainly welcome and the writers really did a great job mixing old footage from the first Cars in with ""vintage"" footage we'd never seen of Doc Hudson and such. It didn't bog down the story and actually added to the weight of it, I felt myself getting a bit emotional at a few points despite not having an emotional connection to the first movie. Finally, it was nice to see Doc and Lightning have a better relationship portrayed than the one they had in the first film, one of the reasons I never really connected to it was because I never felt that Doc actually liked Lightning."
90,5,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Jay And Nick both enjoyed the first Cars Movie. It was not Pixar's best work, but it was still enjoyable. The second one was horrible. It was pointless and there was just no reason for it to be made. This one, however...while it's better than the 2nd Movie it's still not as good as the first. It leaves off where the 2nd one left off...Lightning Mcqueen is still in action and is still stronger and faster than ever...until the day someone by the name of Jackson Storm (voiced by Armie Hammer) turns up and is beating Mcqueen at every race and every step of the way! Mcqueen needs to train harder if he is to beat Storm, and it wont be as simple as he thought! All the characters were good, mostly the new ones. Don't go in expecting for all he old characters like Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) to be in it much. Mater and all the other characters were only in it for 8 mins! That's not to say that all the new characters are bad, they are actually likable and pretty good. The problem with the film is it's not paced well enough for kids and it's not quite likable enough for adults, so it's a tricky movie to rate. The movie is decent at every second that clicks, and it never really gives you anything emotional like so many other Pixar Movies do, but it's probably worth a rent. Only go to see this if you have nothing better to do or you just want to kill 100 minutes. Could have been so much more! 2.5/5 stars- Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers."
91,10,McQueen gets retired.,"I've seen this movie at the cinema in its premiere and I bought it on DVD almost two years later. I was very pleased as we get to see McQueen's career coming to an end. Idk why so many people hate this movie, things must come to an end, people."
92,5,Pleasant roads ahead! Not as bad as you might expect,"I've never been a fan of the ""Cars"" franchise, but I was curious about this one. The first trailers seemed to indicate they were going for something far more serious and visceral. Turns out that most of the marketing was a bit of a lie. It's not the change of tone I was hoping, although it's not as bad as you might expect."
93,7,"It's not wonderful, but it sure is good!","Cars 3 is a great movie in the Cars trilogy and perhaps by far the best, with fun moments and a plot that is functional enough to entertain the family, although it is not impressive, but manages to please by delivering what is necessary to close the trilogy."
94,1,What a huge turnoff. The hero became a quitter because of PC,IMDB is my source of movie infos for over 20 years. I've never made single comment on movies here. This crap had me making the first one.
95,4,The car is a real boy,"I had a difficult time getting emotionally attached to the characters, something any good Pixar film would easily do. I'm guessing that it's probably because of the unwritten, but still unbroken social barrier between cars and humans, wherein I am unable to feel sympathy for a car. I was more emotionally affected by the animated short presented before the film, titled ""Lou"", in which the main character was an amalgamation of lost toys; to be fair, though, I did very much enjoy the short."
96,2,What happened?,"What happened? <br /><br />Obviously Cars is over. <br /><br />My sons were disappointed that it was the end of cars. They didn't get into it when they realized that it was a girl car that will lead the so called next movie. Plot wasn't exciting and didn't keep us entranced like the other movies.<br /><br />They don't want any toys.<br /><br /> Lightning McQueen is done... Just like Doc Hudson, didn't need to kill him off, that was horrible. What a shame.<br /><br />My daughter... Fell asleep. Besides, she likes dolls. Which I understand, she's a girl. I respect that.<br /><br />Good luck next time."
97,9,Heartwarming and inspiring - old school Pixar,"Now a car of a certain age, Lightning finds himself falling behind as the next generation of high tech race cars take the field. "
98,1,hate it,"I love lightning Mcqueen and he is like one of the heroes in my childhood. But Car 3 is all about this hero ""fading"" and he even accepted it in the end. Doc's ""death"" remains mystery in Car 2 and Car 3, and this is unbelievable since cars older than him remain healthy. <br /><br />And i absolutely hate the ""new painting"" for lightning Mcqueen. Boys we are talking about the ""the end"" of that fabulous red color, which Disney are still printing for thousands of merchandises. This is like the Tangled, without the long hair, Rapunzel is just a normal girl. <br /><br />I started the movie hoping to see THE Lightning Mcqueen, not a second Doc. <br /><br />disappointment is not enough to express my anger. Congratulations Disney, you have ruined another series."
99,4,Boring and Predictable,This was a MASSIVE step down from the original. Even the sequel was better than this movie. It feels like Pixar just wanted to give Closure to the franchise and make a quick buck in the Laziest way possible. If you are a fan of Cars 1 or 2 I still suggest seeing it......when it's available for rental.
100,9,"This is for kids first, don't forget that.","Sadly, remember, this is for children first. The negative reviewers here are 18 and over. Other than the uncharacteristically bad sound track, this is a good way for Pixar and Disney to end the Cars franchise. Much better than 2 and Planes. It basically finished the cycle. Now, if Disney were to go for another, that would be in bad taste. Sure, it follows along the trend of girl power that has flooded much of Hollywood action and fantasy movies, but it still stands out as a top performance. No, it's not like a true Nascar race, but the first one wasn't either. There is only one clone after another in NASCAR with no one vehicle having an edge. So, if you praised Cars and not this one because of technical inaccuracy, then you're a hypocrite. This one follows a great storyline, and no, they didn't show McQueen having a defeatist attitude in the end like all the negative reviews harp about. No 3 year old is mad because of the ending. No 14 year old is either. Yes, the story touches on life decisions, but not bad ones. It doesn't get preachy like Up or Inside Out with adult problems or themes. It shows basically what other sports do on a daily basis. As you get older and slower, you can either quit, or you can keep on pushing yourself and use your experience and smarts to keep competitive. It teaches children to use everything available if they want to succeed and not waste opportunities. It teaches children to see things through other people's eyes. It teaches children that even though they may have been counted out, written off, or never even given a chance, that they can succeed if they give it there all and just do it. Don't overthink life. Have fun, just breath. Also, just because you don't have the best, you don't have the most, you aren't the richest, that you can still succeed and still win. And you can be happy right where you are as long as you're giving it your all."
101,1,Boring and disappointing,"My son and I have really enjoyed the past two movies in the franchise. We were, therefore, very surprised to find this presumably final outing to have little of interest or to amuse. I don't write film reviews but hopefully will save someone else their time and money... Flashy nonsense Straight to video!"
102,8,Better than the first 2,This's a return to form for Pixar and the Cars franchise. It's much better than the 2nd one which was more like a spin off like Car Toons: Mater's Tall Tales. Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) is getting older and unable to keep up with the new enhanced drivers. Desperate to win he tries to train using new equipment with disastrous results.
103,5,Just end it already.,*Originally posted on TheLittleBinger.com* 
104,10,the most emotional of the franchise,"This is the movie where lightning mcqueen crashes and feels he lost his tocuh. Also is the movie where he remembers most doc hudson, and becomes a mentor himself in the process. Is more emotional than you think, and more deep than people see. Is about recognizing we all get old and we need to teach new generations what we know."
105,6,Meh,"Probably the best Cars movie in the entire series, and that doesn't say much. Cars 1 was alright, Cars 2 was a disaster. This series has been quite inconsistent but it brings it back to its roots. Little focus on Mater and more on Lightning McQueen since he is a more interesting character. The music is alright, the visuals are amazing, which judging by the shot of the poster, the director is obviously a visual type director. Seeing Lightning McQueen take on the mentor role feels of-putting given the little focus he got in the previous film, but it's done right in this film. Lightning isn't a mentor the whole time until the last half hour of the movie. Overall the story is fine, not bad, not good, the characters are the same characters, the new characters are fine. Okay movie, your kids will like it, and if you're a die hard fan of the Cars series than you might too. An okay movie with an unsatisfying conclusion."
106,1,"A terrible Sequel, they completely destroyed the character for the sake of PC","The first two Cars movies were classics, in my opinion. My kids loved them. And when we heard there was a new Cars movie coming out in Summer of 2017, we were really excited. Then, we went to the movie theater, and saw the film. It starts off with a really good story, about how Lightning McQueen is getting too old for racing, and younger cars are dominating the racing track. He crashes. He has to go to rehab with a new trainer, played by Alonzo. Okay, still good. The second part, and especially the climax of the movie is why I gave this a ""Rotten"" Review. In the climax, Mcqueen is racing against the new and improved cars, and he literally gives up. he just let's the trainer take over, and she wins the race for him. This is what upsets me. I get that Disney wants to include more strong female characters, which is amazing. but you can't just replace the characters we all know and love with the new female characters! At least give Mcqueen a happy ending before replacing him with alonzo's character. What are you teaching our kids, to give up and let someone else do the task for you? the one star is for the poignant plot at the start and the beautiful animation throughout. Seriously, kudos to the animators at Pixar. I've heard about the grueling process it takes, and they really put out some great work here."
107,7,Am massive Improvement after It's awful predecessor,"""Cars 3"" Is directed by ""Brian Fee""."
108,10,"Kids should go to this movie, parents MUST see this movie",Apart from pain in the neck because of the bad seat I ended up -far left of the first raw which is about 5 meters from the screen- everything was truly amazing.
109,10,A movie that improves on the last one...,"When Cars first came out in 2006, it became a hit for pixar and Disney under their new ownership. The film would sell even more on DVD and bluray and spawn merchandise, as well as two sequels and a spin off film about Planes and a sequel that didn't lift off at the box office. Now here comes Cars 3, a movie that is better than Cars 2 and brings back the nascar theme that the first movie fit so well. It's also rated G, which means everyone from 2 to 102 can enjoy it. I saw it in 3d and it's worth seeing in 3d. The short that precedes it, Lou, is really good. Stay after the end credits for a bonus scene!!!"
110,10,"Does this film manage to redeem the ""Cars"" series? Check out my review below to find out!","""Cars 3"" (2017), I had no desire to see this movie. After the terrible scar left by the abysmal ""Cars 2"" (2011), I knew that this apparently existent franchise had run out of gas, and was barely spewing out fumes at this point. One night, I saw that it was coming on TV. So, I thought to myself: ""why not? I think I'll give it a chance, it can't be as bad as 'Cars 2', it can't be!"" I watched it, and much to my surprise, it wasn't just better as ""Cars 2"", it was also just as great as the first movie! ""Cars 3"" has an excellent story, phenomenal voice acting, stunning animation and a great soundtrack. The plot is, Lightning McQueen gets into a devastating crash, but still works to prove to a new generation of racers that he will always be the best race car on Earth. Now, when I first saw the story synopsis, I was kind of worried that it'd be too much like the first film and be too pedestrian. Kind of an ironic thing to say about a movie depicting cars! Any way, the plot of this movie focuses more on Lightning McQueen and other brand new characters, which is already a huge improvement over ""Cars 2""! Mater is in this film, but he's been reduced to a smaller role. That opened the door for more excitement and storytelling. I was fully intrigued during the whole movie, all the way from beginning to end. Granted, the story is a bit similar to the first film, but it's handled in a smart way. One of the best things about it is, that it's a more serious plot with more going on. I won't go into any details about the story. But, it's a great plot with a good message that's rarely seen in movies. On top of that, it did get a couple of laughs out of me. For that reason alone, that makes this film a winner! This was the kind of movie I was expecting for ""Cars 2"", but it turns out I just had to wait a film later. I'm happy to say, that it was worth the wait! As for the voice acting, it's just as strong as the plot. The whole cast nails their respectable characters, and they definitely help bring them to life! As for the animation, it's fantastic. Of course, that goes without saying, since it's made by Pixar! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Randy Newman is phenomenal. His film scores are usually well written and composed, and the one for this movie is no different. ""Cars 3"" is a great redemption film for this series. It healed all the wounds left by the awful ""Cars 2"", and then some! Granted, it's not quite as good as the first movie, but it's definitely worth watching once in a while though. It makes me wish that this was the sequel for ""Cars"" (2006). ""Cars 3"" should have been ""Cars 2"". It would've made so much more sense, and it would've meant so much more to this franchise. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Cars 3"" yet, you might be surprised. But, if you're just getting into the ""Cars"" films, I highly recommend skipping ""Cars 2"", and going straight to this one. Trust me, you won't be missing anything. After being subjected to ""Cars 2"", ""Cars 3"" is just the movie I needed as well as the series. It goes to show that even though we deal with a few lemons once in a while, there's always hope for redemption!"
111,2,Predictable and Boring,"Took my kids a boy and girl to see this and within the first 30 minutes, my little girl rolled her eyes and already knew how the story would end. Disney is ruining these classic movies with whatever agenda they have. Almost all things Disney these days are predictable and unimaginative. My son didn't like it, neither did my daughter and at the end of the night, I wanted my money back."
112,1,A massive disappointment from pixar,"What have pixar done to the Cars franchise. I mean some of the poster art and trailers spoke of something great and powerful, where the lead character would take a serious hit and have to re-train and beat an awesome rival. Well no that is not the case it would seem."
113,8,Nice ending of a three lap race,"The ""Cars"" trilogy is probably my least favorite part of Pixar's filmography and still, I hold it at a well respected place. Pixar rarely misses and even their mediocre animated features are still above the rest that are out there. <br /><br />""Cars 3"" is brought something better than its predecessor and that's heart. Heart of a dying old race car's career that can be interpreted as the fading career of an acting generation. A generation that lived in better times, a generation that is not angered towards their fellow people for living their own life and not offending anyone."
114,2,Disappointed,It was the best movie series i could have watched from my childhood. i loved it more than any Disney movie . i did not expect that it would take such a twist. Lightin Mc Queen was my hero. he is supposed to be racing not to be instructing someone how to win a race . this movie ruined the series for me. I feel horrible after watching this movie. i wished i never watched it. Cars and Cars 2 were both awesome movies but this movie is not worth watching. But if you want to ruin the series for yourself then it is up to you. i seriously did like the humor by Mator but the whole Mc Queen not racing gave me chills.
115,3,it was disappointing just like my grammar skills,!!!!SPOILERS!!!!
116,8,The best Cars movie,"Lightning McQueen is humiliated when he crashes in a race won by arrogant - and very fast - upstart Jackson Storm. After moping about for a while, McQueen decides he is not ready for retirement. He finds a news sponsor, but has a rocky relationship with Cruz Ramirez, the trainer provided for him: her ideas about training are very different to his, and he can't help thinking back to his mentor Doc Hudson. And it is a fact that he is getting older and slower."
117,6,Strangely... Not really for kids,"Cars 3 was pitched as the comeback for the Cars franchise. After the complete disaster of a movie the second one was, this was supposed to be a ""back to basics"" sequel to get movie goers back into the seats and liking Lightning McQueen and the gang all over again and reminding you how good the first one was. But if you are taking your kids, it's a complete misfire. Even my 5 year-old leaned over and asked me if I was enjoying the movie. When I said yes, he said, ""Good. This movie is for you -- It's not for me."" And he was absolutely right."
118,6,"Easily the best of a generally bad bunch, this one subverts expectation and is an entertaining watch because of it.","'Cars 3 (2017)' is much more a sequel to the original film than its spy-spoofing successor, managing to race its way to the front of the three with ease thanks to its compelling character arcs and convincing comeback plot that, while not entirely original and pretty predictable, does a nice job of subverting the general expectation attached to it and is actually rather entertaining throughout, feeling like a natural progression for the franchise. The side-characters are sidelined in favour of a more focused affair with a streamlined story and seemingly less overtly childish humour, making this a solid entry into Pixar's catalogue that's enjoyable and actually somewhat emotionally resonant. 6/10"
119,6,The Best of the Worst,"The fact that this is my favourite Cars movie and I only give it 6 stars (6.5) out of 10 is really saying something about the trilogy as a whole. I don't like the Cars trilogy. I think for the most part, the movies are weak and boring. The reason I prefer the third one is because I think it has a better storyline than the other two, and even though I see lots of reviews where people are complaining about how it ended, I personally like the ending. I think they did a good job with it.<br /><br />Yet still, all in all it just isn't on par with the other Pixar films. If it weren't for the Cars trilogy, the lowest rating I'd give to a Pixar movie would be 7/10, which is pretty darn good."
120,8,"Don't know why everyone hates this, such low ratings.","Cars was an amazing movie , given it was made 12 years ago from Cars 3 although it's not too old. I really enjoyed seeing the characters again, Sally, Mater , Sherif, Philmore etc.<br /><br />Brought me back to those days when I was a kid.<br /><br />Nostalgia."
121,10,Such a great improvement over Cars 2!,"So I personally loved Cars 1, I liked Cars 2 but I didn't love it, but this is easily the best of the Cars movies. This movie is so underrated in my opinion. It could've been a bit darker, but it had just about the right level for a Pixar sequel. In fact, I feel like this would've been good as the story of Cars 1, let alone be the story of Cars 2. So good job Pixar! Two thumbs up!"
122,8,I don't get why everybody hates this..?,"I was quite excited for this film. This film had a lot of expectations to live up to so the pressure was kind of high for the makers. But honestly, I think they nailed it. *SPOILER*"
123,5,Very unfortunate script & plot given it's place in the series...,Our family has been big Cars fans since 2006. My boys(while outgrown them) have tons of Cars toys. Their room is still decorated in the theme. We've been to DL to Carsland 2012.
124,6,Mary Sue Becomes A Racer,"This was a completely disappointing effort. I think we have to acknowledge that Pixar's tank is empty at this point. It was a very muddled, confused story, with minimal plot, just a few set pieces strung together. "
125,7,Visual treat for Kids,"Pixar has changed the way animation movies are received. They have excelled in catching audience's minds through Toy Story, Wall-E, The Incredibles and Inside out. Cars were not probably the one among them."
126,8,Hidden sub plot.,"Just like the Toy Story's movies. The sequels have hidden plots. Like the illegal eastern European organ trade. Or how younger generation surpasses the elder. Without learning from the Elder's mistakes,"
127,7,Recommend that you give this a viewing,"I agree 'Cars 3' improves upon 'Cars 2', not by much though."
128,1,Not nice at all... Disappointment,We all expect our lead character McQueen to win or do something interesting every time but this movie is all opposite.... It's just about his retirement..... It talks about new generation racers who are better than the old ones.... Everything McQueen had is hopelessness... He loses all hope and hands over his career to a girl racer making himself retired..... he declares himself shower than the others and takes up a blue paint in memory of Hudson hornet and becomes a crew chief... Cars has always been my favourite Disney movies since my childhood but thus movie made me real upset...I was really not expecting this...... It is surely the worst Disney movie ever....
129,7,Basically the generic sports movie but it's actually interesting.,I guess this is the sequel that a lot of people hoped cars 2 would be.
130,9,While Not The Best Pixar Film It Did However Become The Best One In The Franchise,"When It comes to the Cars franchise, these films aren't well received and people say It's their worst film, to me I did love these films when I was young, to this day I still like the first movie, sure It has problems like how the world was created and It's predictable, but It doesn't turn It In a bad movie, I didn't take everything around the film seriously like how cars are now people, how they eat and jokes/Visual gags all that stuff, I seen films where I don't ask questions and I just enjoy the ride."
131,10,Very good movie.,"The movie in general was a great movie, it had a great story line and a great ending. I love the fact how they brought back the old memories of Doc Hudson in the movie, it was like the story was really based around him! The movie ended perfectly when lightning came in the pits and switched with Cruiz to give her the chance that she always wanted. It ended perfectly, I would 100% give this movie a 10 and in my opinion is the best out of all 3."
132,10,Great Reflection on the Original,"Just saw this film at an early family showing before the actual release, and I have to say, it was a great companion to the original! By that, I mean, you see from Lightning McQueen's perspective exactly how Hudson felt in the original film."
133,2,Kids don't even like it,This didn't hold my 4-year-old grandson's attention more than a few scenes and he's a huge fan of Cars. The story of aging just doesn't register with kids; the unfairness of being edged out by younger models is not something they care about. The plot of corporate greed is so far from kids' understanding as to be invisible. Even if they did get it - younger and richer would be better any day.
134,7,"(6.8/10) Definitely better than Cars 2, but not as good as the original","After the disastrous trainwreck known as Cars 2, I didn't really have any hope for this movie, but I was happy to hear that they were going back to the racing side of Cars. Cars 3 is the finale of the Cars series and it does tie up the franchise in a positive way, but it's not perfect. Some scenes do drag on for too long, the jokes don't land all the time and I'm still quite confused as to how Smokey (Doc Hudson's trainer) outlived Doc, but aside from that, the movie is good and it's nice to see that Pixar decided to end the series on a high note. If you like the first Cars movie and wanted to see how it's story continues, I'd recommend watching Cars 3."
135,9,Return to Form For Pixar Franchise,"Watched Cars 3 featuring the Voice Talents of Owen Wilson(Zoolander No.2) as Lightning McQueen, Armie Hammer(The Man From U.N.C.L.E) as Jackson Storm, Cristela Alonzo(The Angry Birds Movie) as Cruz Ramirez, Larry The Cable Guy(Blue Collar) as Mater , Bonnie Hunt(Zootopia) as Sally Carrera, Chris Cooper (The Muppets) as Smokey,Nathan Fillion(Con Man) as Sterling ,John Ratzenberger(Inside Out) as Mack featuring The Late Paul Newman(Cars) as Doc Hudson and Richard Petty(Speedway) as Strip ""The King"" Weathers. The film also excellent character development and story glad this was more focused on Lightning McQueen as Cars 2 should've been also Cruise Ramirez was one the best characters though she was annoying at times but it didn't hurt the film to much was brilliant amazing Musical Score by Randy Newman(Toy Story) also Amazing Direction by Newcomer Brian Fee(Monsters University) A Return to Form For Pixar Franchise 9/10"
136,5,Meh...,"I have watched Cars 3 a couple of times, so now I have decided to write a review for it."
137,6,A decent watch,"There comes a time in every great sportsperson's life when somebody younger, faster, stronger comes along and knocks them off their perch. The legendary racer Lightning McQueen is no different. Out of nowhere, McQueen is beaten to the chequered flag by rookie racer Jackson Storm, the first of a new breed of racers. Struggling to keep pace like he used to it looks like McQueen's days in the sport are numbered. With a point to prove however, McQueen decides he wants to continue racing; and with the help of trainer Cruz Ramirez works to improve his speed with the aim of returning to the track to beat Storm."
138,7,Same old plot with some notable improvements.,"I'm usually a huge fan of Pixar films. However, I'm not wild about the Cars franchise. Something about these anthropomorphized vehicles is a little too cartoonish for me. Granted, the first movie in the series was the only film to make me care about the outcome of a NASCAR-type race. While the visuals are definitely improved in the 11 years since the original film came out, this end cap of the trilogy feels like a rehash of what worked before."
139,7,A great installment to an iffy franchise,"I saw Cars 3 in the theaters with a group of adults without ever seeing Cars 2. The film holds up as a sequel to the first movie. I recently rewatched all three movies and in all honesty, you really don't need to watch Cars 2."
140,9,Passing The Torch,Believe it or not it's been 11 years since the story of a hot shot young racing car named Lightning McQueen first enchanted young viewers with his story of learning there is more to life than just being the top car. That story talked about learning what it was to have deep rooted friends and family. Here we are all those years later and the third movie in the series is out on disc. What makes it special is that time has passed in the story as well.
141,,"Great summer fun and social issues, too.","""You'll never be the racer you once were. You can't turn back the clock, kid, but you can wind it up, again."" Smokey (voice of Chris Cooper)"
142,8,Seems to upset idiots,"When someone does something you don't like, some people's first instinct is to call them a ""snowflake"" or if they're slightly more honest ""liberal""."
143,6,A giant mess of two story lines put into one movie.,"By the end of this movie, people will wonder why the rest of the movie even exists. The story and plot for the third movie in this series seems relatively unfinished, as if the story line should have been split into two different movies. The story doesn't know what it wants to be, and this becomes very apparent during the film's climax and resolution. "
144,4,Ultimate Anti-Climax,"To be honest the story started really solid and quite interesting with (by what the trailer told to be) a more mature and unorthodox approach to the cars franchise. After Cars 2 I personally expected a large improvement, and for the most part, there was."
145,10,Excellent finale of a trilogy!!!,This movie shows how seasons change in life and how McQueen adapts and takes on new challenges with aging and maturing. Quite an excellent adaptation!!!
146,1,Has nothing to do with Cars.,"Useless movie. I had a hunch that i was useless already and therefor i did not see it at the movie theatre, and of course that hunch was proper. Its totally crap and just dont see this garbage with your children. Its not Cars, see it as a standalone movie, separated from cars and cars 2, even the voices are different in certain aspects."
147,10,Should have been Cars 2,"I honestly don't understand why this film has such a weak rating on here and wasn't better received with the critics. I fully admit it plays oddly after Cars 2 but that has much more to do with that film than with this one. This film is a natural extension of the story of the first film. It plays perfectly as a McQueen's second act in learning to slow down and appreciate other pleasures in life besides racing. It furthers the generational, and technological, strife fits in well with the first film. Best of all the story has been streamlined and this is the most polished of the Cars films."
148,9,Really Good Pixar Movie,Cars 3 is one of the Pixar movies I was excited about watching mainly because I really like the first one and the second one is alright I know right crazy I said alright well oh well anyway this movie really hit me this is one of those Pixar movies I have seen that is really emotional to watch like finding dory is up their toy story 3 and finding Nemo and wall-e are the ones are the saddest out of those but to me Cars 3 tops all that of course at first what I heard about this movie was not good so I was still really worried about mainly because I heard that lighting Mcqueen does not even race at the end is why it took that many years to see because of just that because mainly people are just picky but I am glad I picked this up today because i wanted to see what is this about and i am very glad i saw this and i really liked it and this is for sure of my fav pixar movies here is why mainly because of lighting Mcqueen as an character is the best he has ever been in the other movies he was not that good he really only cared about his fans in the first which bothered me a lot when rewatching that movie in cars 2 all round his character he once again only cared about the race and that is why we focus on mater but in this movie he is awesome in he actually improves his character a lot cruise is good also at first i am like this character is gonna be a waste nope the beginning of the movie is the best i know that people don't think that but i do the best part of these three movies are the races that is why cars 2 is still solid for me mainly because of that the very first race and Mcqueen crashes really hurt and it sad even watching stuff like that happen but having character like that is tuff to see might just be me idk Storm as an villain is a nice addition nothing to hard to focus on him in the movie to take away from McQueen side the race at the end is good not the best mainly because of Cruise but it's ok for this movie i am not too happy on it but i can be fine with it so all round this movie is a big surprise did not aspect this movie to be this good for me so I give Cars 3 an A-
149,5,"A better ""Cars"" movie than the previous, but still pretty basic","I went into this movie expecting to not like it a whole lot, and I wasn't wrong, as the Cars movies are notorious for being the worst that Pixar has to offer. This movie is simply just 'okay'. Some of the best choices in this film were moving away from the last one and moving back towards the ""strengths"" of the original film, focusing less on Mater and more on Lightning McQueen and his racing career. This sounds like a positive, however the first half of this movie is an absolute SLOG, with the pacing of a Saturday morning cartoon, introducing new characters that are supposed to be longtime friends of Lightning that we've never met before, trying to form some kind of sentimental connection that was never there to begin with. The plot is relatively predictable, and operates as a comeback story, but the way it executes it toward the end and the message it brings through is actually pretty positive. The whole film is centered around Lightning not being the fastest car anymore, and him training with his new trainer Cruz to become faster, while along the way forming a personal connection with Cruz, who really wants to not be a trainer, but rather desires to be a racer. Lightning eventually realizes he can't be the same racer he used to be, and following in the footsteps of his former race coach, puts Cruz in the final race and moves on to a new stage of his life, accepting his old age and moving forward with something new. I really like this, however the execution could've been a whole lot better, as the jokes really aren't too funny and the story is pretty predictable, and really holds the hand of the viewer, as well as including a whole lot of side characters that never really do a whole lot. As a kids movie though, it's perfectly suitable, and I can definitely recommend this for any family to see. 5.2/10"
150,8,3rd Cars entry improves upon lackluster predecessor,"Surprisingly, this was actually pretty good. Though, parts of it were a little rehashed from the first one. (It even has the same opening. I thought the projectionist had started the first movie by mistake.) And some of it does feel like ""We're doing what more-or-less the first one was, except Lightning is Doc and the new character is Lightning."" But thank goodness they learned from Cars 2 that people don't like Mater. He's barely in this one! There were some jokes that were pretty funny, and I didn't see the ending coming to be honest. And having it appeal to both genders by adding strong characters of both genders is a good bonus. (Yes, girls can like race cars. Before you ask: No I am not a girl.) This one was a little less kid friendly than the other 2, though. Not because it's inappropraite, but it does deal with themes of getting older and making way for the next generation, and how you're going to be remembered after you die. For the target audience of 5 year olds, that's pretty heavy! But I feel it was done well, and in a way kids could understand. Is it Pixar's best? Not even close, but it's certainly better than ""Brave"" and ""The Good Dinosaur.""<br /><br />Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars"
151,,Nice and fun for children,"This animated film tells the story of a tracing legend, who is losing luster because youngsters are rising fast in the leagues."
152,7,"For fans of the first one, Cars 3 is a nice U-turn to form as it confronts remaining in the race","Pixar is back in theaters to bring life to areas we normally don't see it insoyay! It happens to be a third Cars moviesoyay? I've spoken with a lot of film and animation fanatics who don't see the Cars series as anything worth mentioning. It's spoken around circles as only kids entertainment and a way to sell a ton of toys (Disney has made over a billion on the Cars toys alone). Is it worth a lot of the backlash? Though there is some nostalgic value over the original Cars, as I consider it the last animated movie from my childhood before going to college, I think people have gotten too harsh on it."
153,6,Rocky,"Champion Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) faces new competition from arrogant hi-tech rookie Jackson Storm. His friends are forced into retirement and replaced by the new generation of racers. He starts losing to Storm and a final crash ends his failing season. With the new season approaching, he faces self-doubt and the press expects his retirement. He gets new owner Sterling and new trainer Cruz Ramirez."
154,8,You finally feel the heart in Act 3,Movie Title: Cars 3 (Theatrical)
155,8,""" One of the best trilogy ends i ever see""","Cars was is a classic,Cars 2 was a disappointment,Cars 3 is simply one of the best closing trilogy's i ever see (at least in animation)."
156,2,A dumpster fire of a film,Cars 3 is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. A truly soulless film that should have never been made.
157,4,Boys can't have nice things,"Another reviewer said it perfectly. Introduce subplots to tease ideas for new generations to build ideas of superiority. First agism. Second sexism. Every single Hollywood film today is replacing a particular group of human with a very particular other group of ""super human"". Next stop - segregation and division."
158,8,Finally has that Pixar magic which has been missing from this franchise,"I'm not a huge fan of the Cars franchises, even though I might one of its soul defenders because I actually really enjoyed the first cars movie which I thought had a good message of slowing down and enjoying life, not just speeding by missing out on what life has to offer. Cars 2 however was probably the worst Pixar movie ever made, so I was none too pleased when I heard they were making a Cars 3. It all changed when we all saw the teaser trailer however (which was very dark) and I found out that they have a new writing team and producer for this one. So I was open-minded when I walked into Cars 3, hoping for something good. I have to be honest, I really liked it a lot. It's a Cars film with Pixar level story telling which is something we have not seen in any of the Cars films so far, including the first one. As much as I liked the first one though, it does lack a bit on Pixar level story telling. What I mean by this is that the movie (Cars 3) had some emotional moments, characters who are supposed to be there for the fun of it didn't outstay their welcome, and the movie was generally fun and pleasing. I say give Cars 3 a watch for enjoyment and amusement."
159,7,Quite an improvement,"I'm not the biggest fan of the ""Cars"" franchise, but it's very easy to say that ""Cars 2"" was the worst Pixar movie ever made. I mean, none of the other ones come even close. This is a massive improvement because of one major thing. The previous movie had the annoying Mater as the main character instead of Lightning McQueen! Now we have him in the background as the comic relief where he belongs. There are some quite funny parts in this. I especially like when Lightning is on the simulator and he's on fire. Well, literally I mean. Now there is another problem this film runs into. It does kind of focus too much on the character Cruz."
160,2,2 stars for visuals and sound,The movie is just like every other PC snooze fest that Disney are pushing out. The Mexican female becomes the star of the show. LM basically becomes irrelevant. It's a little bit like writing superman out of a superman movie.
161,7,Good movie,"Very good and beautiful movie.<br /><br />Even if it looks like a kids movie, you could find much more than that when watching it:)<br /><br />I recommend!"
162,1,Awful for the Children and fans of Part 1,It's funny how they completely ruined McQueen here and now in 2021 they're trying to milk McQueen series. Seriously? An unknown character takes over out of nowhere and McQueen becomes completely useless. The animation is good but the ending ruined it.
163,,Lightning McQueen gets neutered,"I hate to hate on this movie I really do, but it just misses in so many places. I'll only mention a few. This review will have spoilers! Lightning McQueen was an awesome confident character , now he's only a shell of himself. it's not even the same character anymore. It makes it out to be a good thing - and he is nicer, but evidently that means you can't be competitive and you must give up... Also, I'm kinda tired of every Disney movie feeling the need to push feminist propaganda - and if you miss this in the movie - well, tell me your trick - I'd love to know how you do it. And finally BIG SPOILER HERE: the ending is completely stupid - he doesn't even finish the race - he stops midway through and lets the young female protégé finish for him - yes you know, the one who was always told she couldn't do it and that she wasn't allowed in the race - Blah...blah...blah.... IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STINKIN RACE! This is a movie for kids that decided to tackle the issues of ageing and sexism.... I just want to take my kids to a movie that is for kids."
164,6,First is almost always the best...,"I expected more from this movie. Much more.... The first one, almost 11 years ago, was soooooo good! A lot of fun, with really inspired and lovable characters: Mater (almost everybody's most beloved character), Luigi, Guido, Doc, Ramone, even Sally and yes (why not?), even Lightning McQueen! You felt like you've got in a so coherent and real universe of humanized cars. Very humanized and with simple and believable stories. The entire movie was simple but well cooked, with an incredible sense of humor, with good, decent and tasty jokes ... and therefore beautiful! I just loved it! "
165,8,Best Cars Film Yet!,"Cars 3 is a great new chapter in the Cars series. While it doesn't soar to the heights of other Pixar films, it still is the best Cars film yet."
166,9,A Fantastic Film You Must Call It a Sequel,"Bad film and Pixar's worst film, and the very place where Pixar's uneven road, which is the Cars franchise, gets very rough. But Cars 3 smoothens it. The main goal of Cars 3 was to improve the damage caused by Cars 2, after it made Pixar fall into a gorge and finally came back up and renovated the damage caused. It's a really enjoyable film. Sure the film doesn't have that much of a huge humor but is funny, but had rude humor. The main focus is on Lightning's end of his racing career. It was an emotional journey and was the best animated film of 2017 until Coco and Ferdinand got released. Sure, the story was predictable but it possibly wouldn't be a very good film if they kept it unpredictable. The problem I find is Cruz can sometime be more obnoxious than Mater. But overall, it improved Cars 2, which was a waste less cash grab of a sequel."
167,9,"A Homage To ""Real Racing""","In my opinion, I think from what I've heard about this movie before, that it is SEVERELY underrated."
168,7,"Hit with the kids, so-so to me","Lightning McQueen is no longer a young stud, he's got a lot of wear on his tires and a lot of mileage on his engine. Early on he finds out that newer, younger, sleeker more streamlined vehicles are the future in racing."
169,8,"Pixar, Inc., tries to give NASCAR some advice on how to salvage . . .",". . . an entertainment product already in universally acknowledged decline and teetering on the Abyss with the imminent retirement of most of its ""Glory Years"" stars. Pixar's CARS 3 bestows more than mere lip service upon the so-called Fair Sex. When CARS 1 & 2 Hero Lightning McQueen (#95) finally sees the light and recognizes that his stymied Trainer Chick Cruz's pent-up enthusiasm for racing AND WINNING after she bests him in a practice run is as authentic as Brandi Chastain whipping off her jersey to celebrate a soccer victory, Lightning turns over his ride to Ms. Cruz toward the end of a big race and her path to a NASCAR triumph for the Womenfolk glides forward on Cruise Control from there. Now that Danica Patrick's Fiancé Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. has won at Talladega, the NASCAR Powers-that-Be MUST insure that Ricky's car is within shouting distance of the lead during the final pit stop at next year's Daytona 500 (which Danica could be sitting out on some pretext, such as Pregnancy). THEN, at this critical juncture, Ricky could feign a cramp, Danica could slip into his driver's seat, and worm her way through the field to take the Checkered Flag! This would not only allow Danica to burn her Drawerful of Green Participation Ribbons, but also give NASCAR a big boost in the butt!"
170,7,A very good sequel!,"My daughters don't watch many cartoons with me anymore, so I was hard pressed to get anyone to watch this with me. I finally got the chance on a plane, and I liked it a lot! I can barely remember the second movie, so this one gets second place for me. Bringing it back to racing and character development, it was a good way to cap off the trilogy."
171,10,28 Year Old Female Writes Biased Review,"I was 16 when the first Cars movie was released and from then on I've been in love with the characters and their stories. The second movie was lackluster for me, it just didn't have the heart of the first (although I do love Mater). This movie was a return to the Cars franchise roots. It was very real and really hit home for me. Things do change, our heroes do age and it can be sad. This movie brings me to tears everytime. This franchise has been such a huge part of my life for so long and watching the characters grow up isn't always easy when you want things to stay the same. "
172,10,Wow! This one is in my 10 star club without a hiccup!!,"I'll try not to spoil it for you if you didn't watch yet, but I can't help but talk about the profound meaning this movie has."
173,9,More Than a Rocky vs Drago Story Line,(Flash Review)
174,6,Cars 3,"The first computer-animated film from Disney/Pixar was good fun, while the second film went a little off road adding a spy spoof plot, but this third entry gets back on track with the motor racing being the primary focus once again. Basically, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and other racers of the Piston Cup racing series are struggling to win against next-generation rookies like Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer) who use advanced technology and training methods. As Storm's success attracts other rookies, the older racers retire or are pushed out. In the final race of the season McQueen suffers a nasty crash trying to overtake Storm leaving him badly injured. After recovering McQueen decides to return to racing, but his sponsors have sold the team to a new owner named Sterling (Nathan Fillion). McQueen is assigned by Sterling to train under Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), but McQueen fails to adapt to the modern training methods. Sterling tries to force him to retire, but McQueen refuses, instead offering to retire if he does not win the first race of the season. McQueen tries to train on nearby Fireball Beach but ends up spending most of his time teaching Cruz how to drive on the sandy terrain. McQueen then tries joining a race at the famous dirt track called Thunder Hollow, going incognito, only to inadvertently enter a figure-8-style demolition derby. Cruz also enters the race and wins, being the last racer on the track, but McQueen is humiliated when his identity is discovered. Distraught at the apparent waste of training time, McQueen rages at Cruz and in the process accidentally breaks her trophy. Cruz reveals that she wanted to be a racer herself, having watched McQueen all her life, but always felt intimidated and outclassed by the other racers. She resigns as McQueen's trainer and heads back to the training centre. Feeling guilty and low on options, McQueen calls his friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) for advice. He suggests that McQueen track down Smokey (Chris Cooper), who trained his old friend and former trainer Doc (Paul Newman, posthumously using unused audio), in Doc's hometown of Thomasville, Georgia. Before heading there, McQueen catches up to Cruz to reconcile and convince her to rejoin him. In Thomasville, McQueen meets up with Smokey, who reveals that despite the fact Doc never raced again, he found new happiness in training McQueen. After McQueen accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and his friends help McQueen learn new tricks to gain an advantage the race trick, using Cruz as his sparring partner. But during the final practice race, Cruz overtakes him, and he suffers a flashback to his crash, his confidence is shaken. At the race in Florida, the odds are against McQueen and Sterling are forcing him into retirement, but he proves the doubters wrong gradually pushing up the ranks. Cruz meanwhile is ordered back to the training centre, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. Overhearing the exchange and remembering Cruz's dream of racing, McQueen instead has his crew outfit her to take his place, which includes painting on her his #95. Cruz has a shaky start but is able to push up the ranks thanks to McQueen coaching her with a combination of his advice and her own training methods. Eventually, she ends up right behind Storm, who feels threatened. Storm tries to intimidate Cruz, even to the point of ramming her against the wall in the final lap. But Cruz, pinned by her wheels to the wall of the track, uses a trick of flipping herself out and over Storm, overtaking him, and winning the race. As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling makes an offer to join his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer from legendary owner Tex Dinoco. As McQueen started the race that Cruz finished using the same number, he gets a share of the win, thus winning a bet with Sterling. Sometime later, McQueen and Cruz return to Radiator Springs, it is revealed that Tex, after seeing Sterling's callousness, has bought Rust-eze from him. Also, McQueen has covered himself in Doc's racing colours, he decides to continue racing and become Cruz's trainer, just like Doc Hudson did for him. Also starring Ray Magliozzi as Dusty, Tony Shalhoub as Luigi, Bonnie Hunt as Sally, Kerry Washington as Natalie Certain, John Ratzenberger as Mack, Kyle Petty as Cal Weathers, Lewis Hamilton as Hamilton, and Cheech Marin as Ramone. The characters are likeable, the humour is fine, the story is engaging enough, the use of vibrant colours and stylish vehicles is wonderful to watch, and the racing and high-speed sequences are genuinely thrilling, a really enjoyable animated comedy fantasy. Good!"
175,2,One final lap...I hope,"Well this is better than 'Cars 3', if that's any help at all."
176,6,"From the Studio that brings You Originality, Comes a Complete Lack!","Let's be perfectly frank here. Pixar is one of those companies that is known for making high quality children's film. ""WALL-E"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Up"", the Toy Story trilogy are all classics made by this studio. Cars is easily their least loved franchise. Yet it is the second franchise to get a full trilogy. So, why does Pixar spend time and energy producing these films that have little to no artistic merit. The answer is to sell toys. The Cars franchise has no reason to exist other than to sell the dozens of toy cars that are created with each movie's release."
177,7,Cars 3 was quite an enjoyable latest installment in the series even though I wasn't fully alert during some of it...,"Let me say right off the bat that this third installment in the Disney-Pixar Cars series didn't have many laughs, at least from my perspective. And it's a possible result of that that I felt myself fighting sleep during the middle part. But by the time of the ending climax, I was wide awake and was starting to really enjoy what was going on by that time. Oh, and what a nice surprise to find out Paul Newman's voice tracks that was unused in the first one was provided in this one since he's now been dead for 9 years! I may have to watch this again to really understand the whole thing but for the most part, I really liked Cars 3!"
178,7,Not that much good and had a disappointment.,"The only thing I hate about this film is that McQueen was in supporting role. The plot is a little poor and so, I like previous films."
179,8,Cars 3: A Thrilling Ride for Both Fans and Newcomers Alike,"Cars 3 is a high-speed adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat. This third installment in the Cars franchise proves to be the best yet, offering a compelling storyline that both fans and newcomers will enjoy."
180,8,don't take in consideration the bad reviews,"All of the bad reviews come from people disappointed by the fact that their hero aged and had to retire. I think that its a beautiful representation of how to respond to progress and moving their legacy on and should not receive any hate for that. Children should accept that as in life people do not stay young forever and times move on, the younger generation taking the place of the old, nothing lasting forever."
181,5,Ungreased Lightning,"Though it's been over a decade since I last saw the first two Cars, I can't recall getting THIS distracted with how this Sentient Car world works. Are there Humans? There are animals, crabs at least. And when they crash and pieces are left everywhere, are those body parts? Where do they keep their money since it's established money exists?"

183,6,The sequel that Cars 2 should have been,"Cars 3 is the sequel that Cars 2 should have been, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good. It's okay. The story is a retread of the first movie and some of the plot points seem forced. Plus, they cram so many characters into the movie that none of them can get any real traction. Pixar needs to stop focusing on merchandising and get back to creating quality animated films."
184,,"Almost As Good As The First One, If Not Better","Surprisingly well-made, emotionally involving & leaving the bitter taste of its forgettable predecessor in the dust, Cars 3 is an unexpected delight that shows that the esteemed studio isn't afraid to step into the universe that dented its then-perfect filmography to rectify the errors & leave behind something better. Almost as good as the first film, it is an emotional, poignant & nostalgic finale that brings Pixar's most middle-of-the-road franchise to a satisfying, if not memorable, conclusion."
185,1,Once again changing the main character,The movie was pretty good the only part i didn't like about this is<br /><br />It was suppose to be lighting McQueen<br /><br />But when it's time for him to shine<br /><br />and then He gets replaced.
186,1,How can you turn a kids hero into a cheating loser in 10 minutes,"So Cars 3 starts with a good storyline in my opinion. I can understand that Lightning gets older and winning isn't as easy as it was in his ""younger"" years."
187,7,Old Vs New/Girl Power,"I saw ""Cars 3"", starring the voices of Owen Wilson-The Zoolander movies, The Cable Guy; Cristela Alonzo-Cristela_tv, Hey It's Fluffy!_tv; Nathan Fillion-Castle_tv, One Life to Live_tv; Larry the Cable Guy-A Madea Christmas, Delta Farce and Armie Hammer-The Birth of a Nation, The Lone Ranger_2013."
188,6,The end of a franchise that was never really worth our interest.,"I never really wanted to see the ""Cars"" movies. As I said before, I was already an adult when they appeared, and I particularly felt the almost invasive force of the propaganda machine that, by all means, tried to foist the film on us, almost in the same way that Jehovah's Witnesses go to people's homes to sell their perspective of religion. ""Cars"" was everywhere, and the merchandising involved was a billion-dollar business in itself. Therefore, I preferred not to see them. I don't like to feel that things are being forced on me. I saw this film, the last of the trilogy, right now."
189,7,The new age begins!,"Having seen enough animated feature that possible eligible for the 2018 Oscars, I'm really disappointed with the result of some of the big titles. Yes, including this one, not big films, except 'Coco' are up to any impressive. The bright side is, after a long time, 2D animation might win. This was an okay film. Though I liked the story outline, but did not like how it all was narrated."
190,1,Worst,"Throughout the movie, we watched Lightning train to get past the storm. And what happened next? Yes, an inexperienced rookie raced instead of the Lightning and beat the next-gen fastest car. I don't want to say anything more."
191,8,The Best of Pixar's Worst,"With Fate of the Furious, Pirates 5, Wonder Woman and Logan, 2017 may go down in cinematic history as ""the year of the franchise fix"", and Cars 3 would certainly fit in that group. In what is easily Pixar's worst franchise, they have finally turned the curved corner from the mediocre original and the downright unbearable second. A film of simple plotting, stunning animated visuals, and tons of big childish fun, Cars 3 works as distraction until Pixar's next true masterpiece comes along. In 3, Lightning McQueen is far from the cocky car we first met. No longer the freshest wheels on the track, he spends the film doing everything he can to keep up with the rookies, with their new technologies and upgraded engines. The predictability comes off as a little empty sometimes, but there are some interesting u-turns taken. The training montages are great, the voice acting is improved, there's way less Mater and the final race is easily the best of the series. Specifically, the thematic parallels to Pixar are unique; pioneers in the ubiquitous CG-animation field who refuse to give up their mantel at the top of the heap no matter how long-in-the-tooth they get. Unfortunately, when the movie slows down to (over-)explore these things, we start noticing how little we actually care about these decade-old characters. For every decent joke, there are three lame ones. The villain is a two-dimensional missed-opportunity. Logically, there is a lot to overlook in order to fully enjoy Cars 3 as a thinking adult. Luckily, I was able to do just that, with Pixar providing just enough style, fun and introspection to cross the finish line."
192,7,"Instead of slowing down or crashing and burning, this entry to Pixar's Cars manages to be a smooth enough ride.","Cars 3 is the latest entry to Pixar's Cars franchise. The movie features the return of Lightning McQueen as he's much older, yet he continues racing, and as he does so, many rookies come in and steal the show. When McQueen gets the urge to beat Jackson Storm, his current rival, he ends up crashing and he needs to make the decision to either retire or continue his racing career."
193,7,Fun Disposable Family Entertainment,"I probably risk nothing in saying the Cars (2006-Present) universe and its interchangeable characters are the least interesting in Pixar's stable. More often than not the ensemble learns nothing from their adventures, and any lessons that the audience can gleam from under the hood is drowned out by the the franchise's incessant chirpiness. Yet if we close our eyes and pretend Cars is not part of the same studio that brought us Toy Story (1995), WALL-E (2008) and Up (2009), you might just realize that the whole enterprise is actually kind of okay. Cars is by no means great as there are enough problems within three movies to drive a truck through but they're not exactly Maximum Overdrive (1986) either."
194,10,"Great film, Enjoy.! ignore the bad reviews.","I don't know how people can think this movie is a 1/10 when truly this movie leaves us with a true message , that nothing lasts forever & that it's okay to move onto the next stage of our lives with no fear. For what it looks like the people who rated this movie 1/10 they are the ones attached to everything & lack the ability to adapt to change."
195,10,Even better than the first two!!,"Cars 3 is without a doubt the best in the series no matter what. Lightning McQueen knew that Cruz Ramirez would be a newcomer for Dinoco the fact that Tex Dinoco bought Rust-eze. The theater was crowded when I saw it on opening day in June 2017. Wow. Overall, I give this a five out of five. Check out Cars 3 if you never saw it."
196,8,This is the end.,This is the decent ending to a great first movie. I wasn't very sure that bringing my 12 yo son to this would be a good idea.
197,5,More of the same baffling bewilderment,"So we got a third one. Hopefully this will be the last. And it seems like it will be, but Toy Story 4 proved to us that Pixar is always capable of conjuring up more of the same. Bu whereas that movie was actually a pretty neat continuation, Cars 3 is anything but."
198,1,LIKE A RUBBISH FINAL,Please delete cars 3.Cruz Ramirez the worst chracter in this film nobody like him
199,7,Cars 3,"7/10 - my least favorite Cars yet, but still worth a chance"
200,4,Disney what's wrong with you,"So female's are the new heroes. I get the political agenda and for the most part of it I'm fine with it since this is a phase that will eventually go away, followed by the next phase. Cars 4 probably will have a transgender car as the main star..."
201,6,"Cars 3 (2/3 great, 1/3 complete franchise destroyer)","Overall this movie was, to be honest, I don't even know how to describe it. If I could remove the ending of this film I would give cars 3, 8 to 10 stars but, sadly you can't do that. The movie does a great job setting up this underdog story where lighting must overcome incredible odds or his career as a racer is over. I like how in the movie lighting tries to improve his chances first by technology but when that doesn't work, he goes back to what helped him in the first movie, DOC. The movie does a great job with these two acts but the third one completely sh**s on itself. Lighting, from the very beginning of this film has been fighting left and right to keep his career as a racer. He says multiple times how racing isn't about money, or stuff, its about the thrill, its about going 200 mph, its about the fun, and its about the love for the sport, and this is why he will never stop. He trains and learns all he can for the big race at the end of the movie and then, wait for it, he....... QUITS "
202,,not bad but not really needed,"You can't beat the clock; that's the central theme of this sequel which finds an aging Lightning McQueen in the twilight of his racing years and unexpectedly derailed by a new generation of younger and faster cars. Still convinced that he has a lot left in his tank, McQueen decides to explore some new, innovative training methods to keep up with his youthful competition, but will that be enough to keep him in the game? Has more depth and emotional resonance than Cars 2 (thanks in large part to the presence of Doc Hudson), along with a colorful cast of characters and some truly laugh-out loud moments, it's just never really awe-inspiring, and never seems truly necessary. Fortunately, a short running time keeps it from wearing out its welcome. **½"
203,7,"Looks great, but...","At the narrative arc of Pixar's ""Cars 3"", racecar Lightning McQueen, voiced by whimsical Owen Wilson, asks racecar trainer Cruz Ramirez, voiced by earnest Cristela Alonzo, to join him to find legendary racing mentor Smokey, voiced by sage Chris Cooper. Cruz is McQueen's hired trainer to get him back into winning racing form, following his devastating crash. Cruz grew up watching McQueen win. He is her hero. Being the female racecar in the ""men's club"" racing circuit, her dreams of becoming a racer might never be. Thus, she settles to be a trainer. She tells Lightning, ""I wanted to be you!"" "
204,6,"Lessons on Aging, Delivered by Antropomorphic Cars","Now on the home stretch of his career, the tables have turned on racing legend Lightning McQueen: suddenly out-muscled by a sleek, younger generation, he's struggling to keep pace as the wily veteran amid a fleet of impetuous rookies. Much more in-line with the original film, to the point that *nothing* is mentioned of the wacky sequel, this is a natural, role-reversing progression of the themes presented during the franchise's first lap. It can be blunt and obvious, but at heart this is a kid's movie and I appreciate the effort to mix a little extra meaning into the destruction derbies and Hot Wheel paint jobs. The whole package looks great, of course, as one might expect from a major Pixar effort. There's tons of variety in the scenery, which is just stunning (the cars themselves occasionally seem glaringly flat by contrast), and the race scenes (particularly McQueen's big crash at the end of the first act) are vivid enough that you'd be forgiven for overlooking the giant eyeballs behind each windscreen. I wouldn't place it in the pantheon of greats in the studio's past, but it's at least a deserving successor to Cars 1, if not an essential conclusion to that story. They could've just doubled down on Tow Mater and his international slapstick hijinx, raked in the bucks and called it a day, but instead we received something a little more contemplative and deserving of a feature-length. Kudos for that."
205,4,Bad,Cars 1 and 2 was so good.<br /><br />But this movie is completely trash.<br /><br />Big disappointment.
206,3,Titanic Dissappointment,Cars 3 made me cry for watching such a pathetic excuse of a Rocky type of Film.
207,6,This third film takes precisely for its affective side but it's time for the franchise to slow down and get off track,"Cars is by far Pixar's most controversial creation. Although it is a box office success and passion for many kids around the world, it is undoubtedly the most masculine universe among all those created by the company. In any profitable film franchise, the decision to adjust the tone of the following episodes according to the age of the fans who grew up with the original film is, say, somewhat risky (from the point of view of the businesses that run in this sector). Pixar could make ""Cars"" forever and in the same way, since the animation is not like ""Harry Potter"", with actors of flesh and blood, who age and mature, as well as its audience."
208,10,*BEST Cars Movie Ever!!,"If you loved Cars when it came out in 2006 and liked Cars 2 for the fun spy theme, you won't be disappointed in Cars 3. It doesn't matter what anyone else says, this movie had me grinning from ear to ear the whole time. Whenever I wasn't exclaiming: ""That was so good!"" Maybe those who swim in the dark waters of other films can't handle the heart this story offers us, but I love it. And I'm a guy who really enjoys the action/ adventure movie category! Yet animation gives us something entirely different.<br /><br />Cars 3 is it's own unique style of different, but relatable characters and quirky one-liners bring us back to home...where laughter rings clean and true... where our grandparents lessons are what we teach our kids... where it's not all about you, but how you help others be who they are. I don't know about you, but that's the kind of movie we all need to experience."
209,8,"Great movie, but the hate is understandable.",*SPOILERS - I DO TALK ABOUT THE PLOT*
210,10,Is very good yes should watch,"The writers really brought out the relationship in this movie. The way cruz and lightning mcqueen bond together especially near the end of the movie is truly wonderful and brings a tear to the eye. I loved the character development of lightning mcqueen as he realises the potential of cruz and ends up letting her race for him. There are some truly hilarious moments that made me want to scream. The voice actors in this movie i felt were hand picked for the job and made the movie feel so realistic i wanted to be there. Personally it stands as one of the best Pixar animations of all time. i don't care about what other professionals say, i love this movie."
211,5,Such a bad sequel,I kind love the beginning I thot it gonna he the best of all time but the ending was so bad
212,9,That was great!,What a beautiful ending of a great story!
213,10,10/10,"A great movie from 2017 along with Coco, Lightning Mcqueen meets Cruz Ramirez in this film and they even made a reference to Coco by putting the town of Santa Cecilia and a car from this says Santa Cecilia mi pueblo proving that he is from there in México."
214,10,I wonder if the bad reviewer and I saw the same film..,"Truly emotional, fun, and motivational!"
215,7,"""Cars 3"" wasn't tuned enough to get out from the garage","The anthropomorphic Cars universe returns to the race after a criticized pit stop called ""Cars 2"". On this occasion, emblematic Lightning McQueen retakes the wheel to run into the crude law of reality: the retirement. His components don't evolve, his environment do, therefore, while the beloved car stands up against a new horde of technological newbies, must choose which direction he will take for his future: he decides when he's done."
216,2,I litelarry could not watch this it is so bad,The movie is just dumb this whole i watched this movie i thinked about how good movie cars 2 was compered to this.
217,9,Cars 3,"I didn't think a good Cars movie was possible, but I was pleasantly surprised."
218,10,THE PERFECT ENDING OF THE SEIRES,"Amazing film, 100% recommended for any racing fan or genre audience, the animation, story, jokes, racing, and really a great film, it's so hard not to spoil the movie because it's soo good if you're reading this watch it it's GREAT."
219,1,Garbage,"Yeah kids, just give up when it gets tough. Especially if you do it for defunct woke social agendas. A series originally created to highlight perseverance fell hard and far."
220,8,A big step up,Much better than the second film. Here the feelings from the first movie comes back because it follows up with the first movie. This should have been the second film instead. You get to know about Doc more that you didn't know in the firs movie. Howewer it is a bit similar to the first movie when they are doing the races. But otherwise it is a great movie and a worthy sequel to the first one.
221,7,Better than it's predecessors...,This film is a nice ending to the franchise and also introduces a few new characters! 
222,7,Cars 3 is the best one in the series yet,"Cars 3 may not reach the heights of Pixar's finest achievements, it certainly stands as not only the best Cars, but the most mature one as well. Cars 3 is a lovely, clever and entertaining generational tale with tons of heart, a simple and effective storyline, wonderful candy-colored visuals and winning voice work from the talented cast of returning regulars and welcome newcomers. The best part is where Mcqueen decides to give Cruiz a chance of her career, this is where Pixar is best at creating emotional and joyous environment. A good improvement on its predecessor 'Cars 2', had its own laughs and emotions. Would love to see If Cars 4 is made on future."
223,6,And Cars finished in second place.,"I did like Cars 3, but since the bar was set rather low that is saying little. While an improvement over the confused Cars 2 by miles, the end of Pixar,s most unnecessary franchise isn't that rivetting."
224,8,10x better than the 1st and 100x better then the second!,"When I was a kid I was a huge fan of the cars movie. Unfortunately, then came the second one. For the last three months I have been anticipating this movie but was also worried about it. I can tell you now this is one of the best Pixar animations I have ever seen. I am not just saying this out of my own perspective. This movie contains humor, stellar animation, a very good story that will get the viewer's attention and suitable content. Pixar has done it once again and also took feedback from the second movie's review. Take that, Planes: Fire and Rescue. If you are older than 18 you will still love this action packed fun comedic and emotionally entertaining film. See it!"
225,10,best outta the trilogy!,Definitely the best Pixar movie ever in my opinion and the best Cars movie. It was definitely a great experience and the best out of the movies and I have the 3 movies on DVD. The crash was kind of sad but overall it was just fun.
226,6,Hopefully the end,"Cars has never been the successful series like Toy Story, but with the merchandise profits, it kept a steady output. It's quite interesting a world ruled by cars felt the need to copy mankind. I would assume they would build something more suitable for them. That's just a question that comes up every time I watch this series. This hopefully concludes a long winded series, that should've concluded after the first. This leaves the series in a concluding style that brings the central character full circle. Not a great arc for the character, but it's an arc. At least this film maintains the heart component that fits most Pixar films, compared to the previous film, which was a complete dud."
227,9,Great way to end the franchise!,"I saw this movie with my sister and we thought that this was an awesome way to end the Cars Trilogy! The plot was so inspirational for me to say the least. As well as a wonderful set of elements that made this a great family film! When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was on hype overload. For me being a huge Cars fan, I thought that it was worth it!!! If you get the chance, catch it! if you don't, you will regret it later!"
228,6,"Ask me, Ask me if the cars are going to crash. Ask me.",The 'idea' for this particular story is brilliant. How can you outdo yourself when you have achieved everything in your respective field (irrespective of what field you are in). You either bow out graciously or do what this film says.
229,10,Wow! What a film! And a movie with history repeating itself.,"First off, let me say I have watched the two previous Cars films and was looking forward to this 3rd part. Now, that it's been 11 years that Lightning McQueen has been a star of Cars, he's starting to get old. "
230,9,Cars 3,"Aside from what should be obvious to most of those who are over the age of 5 - merchandising, merchandising! I can hear Yogurt from Spaceballs say (which this movie does try to sort of, kind of, almost satirize but doesn't quite get there, and I'll get to that later) - I wondered going in why Pixar would make Cars 3. The first Cars, one of those unlikely passion projects for John Lasseter, was fine though not remarkable unless one didn't mind getting their Paul Newman fix (last movie too!) if it meant wading through the ""comedy"" of Larry the Cable Guy, and the sequel was one of the most mediocre films of the past decade, from anywhere (again, Larry the Cable Guy as the protagonist). But then I thought that this was exactly why it would be interesting to see the movie - what would the Pixar creative team come up on this one. What they came up with was a good movie, no more but no less either."
231,9,The Franchise hasn't run out of gas!,"I love Pixar films. Movies like Toy Story and Monsters Inc create stories with characters we admire and love. Now after two movies, it's time for Cars to have its third and final film."
232,,Worst plot twist ever,The plot twist was completely horrible. Worst of all 3 movies.
233,8,"A final, trilogy, a preparing for the next sequel, I don't know.","During the most recent Piston Cup, Lightning McQueen (Wilson) becomes aware that he is being outpaced by newcomers, including the flashy Jackson Storm (Hammer). Following a bad crash, he must decide whether to learn how to compete in a changing world or retire like so many of his contemporaries."
234,,Great fun!,This film is a great sequel for the original Cars film (if you just ignore Cars 2). The magic of the first film is brought back again through a very unexpected but strong storyline. The film will leave you very satisfied with Lightning's story and provide some good laughs as well as some potent emotional moments. The music lives up to the original too with some great songs and a strong soundtrack. Would highly recommend to anyone who loved the first film!
235,10,"Great for fans of trilogy, Great for newcomers",Cars 3 is really impressive Disney movie with great animation and beautiful story.
236,9,The end of the story,"And here we go again.Mc Queen races against a new car with the help of Ramirez.Of course Mate is next to him.Emotions,humor and a fine scene to the destruction derby makes the end of the CAR franchise unforgettable."
237,10,Haters Can Die In A Fire,Cars 3 is the best movie all the haters are just losers with no social life's because this movie is awesome so all the haters can be idiots on this movie cars 3 is the best movie Haters can die in fire this movie is so awesome my little brother liked this movie and my family like this movie so lets settle this Cars (2006) 10/10 Cars 2 (2012) 5/10 Cars 3 (2017) 10/10 So That's It So Haters Can Die In A Fire
238,6,He's still Lightning fast,*** (3/5)
239,9,Underrated because of the title,"If it weren't for the bad reputation of Cars among critics, particularly after the not so good second instalment, this film would be much higher rated."
240,10,"McQueen suffers a crash and has to get through an era of Next-Gen racers. He trains with Cruz Ramirez, so he can get back into the sport.","What can I say but excellent, incredible, brilliant, the real Cars 2 (cars 2 wasn't bad, but, it wasn't really the thing I expected...) This movie was so great that I went to Target and bought some Mattel die-casts after the movie. Board up my doors and windows before I spend all of my money on tickets to see it again. My whole family cried, because when my brother and I were very young, Cars was a huge part of our lives. Well, I guess DisneyPixar in general as well. For all the people who rated 1/10, it may be their opinion, but I think Cruz was hilarious, McQueen was powerful, Mater held the right lever of ""protagonist"" in this movie, and they payed true tribute to the late Paul Newman."
241,7,Children will love it...but I hope there will be a new animated trilogy,"This movie extracts the idea of TDKR/Logan where the McQueen is struggling with old age and tries to redeem himself. However, the script in Cars 3 is more coherent and clear and it goes back to Pixar's strongest strategy which is to appeal to our deepest emotions, whether to take the bold step of retirement or not."
242,10,?,"I try to teach my children that their choices matter, to others as well as themselves. I try to give them the knowledge I have gained in life to help ensure a happy adulthood for them. By no means do I promise them a stress-free, choice-free life. That being said, I am really surprised to find so many negative reviews. This movie had so many great messages, yet was filled with action, comedy, and all around entertainment. The only conclusion I can come to is that many people were disappointed that it wasn't nonstop tractor tipping and eating ""bad pistachio ice cream"". As far as the kids go, (and we own 1 & 2, which they love) they actually voted Cars 3 as their favorite. If you see the full 3 minute preview before watching the movie, you should not be too surprised at the narrative (I did not see the TV aired preview, but if it did not contain a lot of the same information, I could see how that may leave people disappointed and upset)."
243,5,1.... If it weren't for the visuals.,As a fan of the original Cars this was utterly disappointing. Not only is the screenplay boring and uninteresting but also the message of the film is awful. This is not something I expected from this studio that has given us films with heart and soul in them.
244,6,I wanted to like this movie and I did ... but ...,I'm a fan of the cars franchise. So is my daughter. The first movie I loved for its brilliant adult jokes hidden in a children's movie and had something for everyone from the bored parents watching it to the children who dragged mum and dad to watch it.
245,9,Cars 3: A High-Octane Conclusion to the Series,"""Cars 3"" is the latest installment in the popular ""Cars"" franchise and it delivers a satisfying conclusion to the story arc that began in the first film. The animation is top-notch, with stunning visuals and an attention to detail that is truly impressive."
246,4,Pixar has lost it's soul,"Yet again another sequel from Pixar that fails to capture the magic, spirit and wonder that Disney does so well. With lightning McQueen's story taking a dark turn, crashing in one of his races, he becomes a washout and must learn how to be a racecar again while the next generation of racecar comes in in the embodiment of Storm. Sure there are some good sequences and entertaining moments, but mostly just a dull and tiresome story seeing Lightning McQueen trying to rebuild himself with none of the magic of the original, even Cars 2 had entertainment value, this one left me feeling nothing"
247,6,"It worked again, in that inimitable Cars way","I always have to get past my ""but who built the cars"" skepticism before I can settle in and watch a Cars or Planes movie. It's like listening to Shakespeare being performed. Give me 10 minutes and I'm into it."
248,6,Pleasant film has good visuals and middling plot,Rating
249,9,The haters can go suck it!,"This movie is great and easily the best Cars movie. It has great writing, amazing animation, and memorable characters. What's to hate about it? Along with the first one it's one of my favorite animated movies of all time."
250,7,"Before the ""storm""","Great animation, great action, great story! Great, great, great! I love it. It's so family-friendly and enjoyable. I guess there's hardly anyone that can't like it. It got my attention since the beginning and there's probably the reason I watched it until the end. It's adorable, a dream come true for kids, and for adults, who didn't lose their teenage spirit. Another Pixar movie, another success! Well done, guys!"
251,9,"These ""1 Star"" Reviews Don't Know The True Spirit of Cars","After seeing this film with my two siblings, we claimed that it was well worth our time and agreed that it was better than both of the two previous Cars installments. When I returned to IMDb, I felt that this film was being robbed with the stream of over-exaggerated 1 star reviews that I saw."
252,9,Cars 3 is a movie with heart and a message to boot,"There have been a deluge of animated movies in the last couple of years with tired jokes, flimsy premises no soul. Now cars 3 is not a funny movie, it has a couple of laughs here and there but nothing noteworthy. But it is a movie with a powerful message. That self- belief is important but it is even more important for somebody to believe in you. For somebody to help you understand that anything in the world is possible if you set your mind to it. It is, in the end, a movie about an underdog. Although I saw it coming at the beginning of the second half, the twist near the end was predictable but satisfying. If you are expecting a movie that kids will enjoy, then no, cars 3 would not be that. This is a movie for teenagers and adults who are stuck in a 9 to 5 job, people who had dreams and could have achieved greatness had it not been for people around them telling them that it is wrong to dream and not everybody can fly. If you can get the inherent message then cars 3 is the movie for you. ""Tell me your dream and I shall give you wings to fly, for the birds do not own the sky."" - Ritesh Shergill"
253,9,Why all the poor reviews?,I have been a huge fan of the cars movie ever since cars 1 and i think all movies are great. McQueen is getting old so the concept of this movie makes since.
254,7,Actually good,"Cars 3 is a very touching and interesting animated movie by Pixar. I found this film to be very good and emotional by the end. The characters are great and watching this film it brought back so many memories from watching the first Cars movie. This trilogy has a lot of negative opinions and reviews but really just because it is from Pixar people seem to hold it on a higher standard than other animated films but if you look at these films without the Pixar name, they are actually good and there is a lot of enjoyment to be had."
255,6,"Innocent, Unwanted, Unessesary","As a kid who was five when the first Cars was realeased, why is lighting passed his prime. The story feels forced and unjust, but once again the film is innocent enough, and I can't really say anything terrible about it. Definitely not in Pixar's best but hey at least it was a smoother ride than the last one."
256,8,"Not as good as the first one, not as bad as the second one","Cars 3 is a third movie in Pixar's Cars franchise. We don't know if it's the final one, but it just might be. It does give off that kind of feel though since in this one our lead is facing aging and being replaced by the rookies (exactly what he was in the first one)."
257,10,The Best story but not for kid!,"This is the BEST story ever among all series, but yes this story is NOT for children. The children will not understand how the world works when the young replace the old and the old are supposed to give space and support the youth. This is the fact, how good the old but they cannot beat the youth in term of physical matter. Cars film tells about the athlete's life when the senior have to retire when they get old. It's normal but children cannot accept this easily of course. It will make them down! And Disney failed to bring this story more interesting for children. Even the new yellow car character is lack of charisma compared to McQueen."
258,8,A great story behind Cars,"Everyone who simply complained about lightning getting old and slower then the new racers is just ridiculous. Unlike Cars 2, which I wasn't a fan of, this tells a sad story behind racing. In the end it has a positive outcome and everyone is happy. If you watched the first Cars you wouldn't be whining about lightning getting slower unless you're a 8 year old. The storyline is amazing as it goes into depth about Doc's past and even brings up Doc's Pit Chief. It's a very touching addition from the 1st movie. "
259,7,Road to die,"The third chapter of ""Cars"" saga is better than the second. I was ready to see another commercial sequel, instead I found a movie that explores the soul of the characters more than the second film, that was too much eccentric and various with the spy story."
260,,"First half not good, second half pretty enjoyable","It's rare to see a movie that gets better as time progresses, generally, in movies, it's the opposite, really strong first act, then it gets downhill from there."
261,10,STOP LOWERING THE RATING!!!!!! HIGHER IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast cars, the legendary Lighting McQueen finds himself pushed out of the sport that he loves. Hoping to get back in the game, he turns to Cruz Ramirez, an eager young technician who has her own plans for winning. With inspiration from the Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns, No. 95 prepares to compete on Piston Cup Racing's biggest stage."
262,10,Great Way To Finish Out The Series!! (Hopefully Not The End),This movie was absolutely amazing it showed that Lightning Mcqueen has gotten really old and is now in his later years and actually is showing how much of a lesser racer he is now to all the new competitors and especially the biggest one and the way they show Lighting Mcqueen coming through to train through his old age and to be a great racer again is amazing and also meeting his friend that is his trainer and becomes his friend and the way she comes out in this movie is amazing I love the way it showed her and his relationship its like a teacher to a student or a mentor for him its amazing and the ending wow I did not expect that at all I thought it would be like every other Cars movie but it wasn't it actually captured what happened with Lighting Mcqueens mentor except with a little difference but it is amazing what happens at the end and even after the ending it shows how you can have two things instead of one and that's amazing they just make this an amazing movie but I wouldn't say its the best cause it's not fully a Lighting Mcqueen movie if you see the ending then you know what I mean but this is definitely my second favorite out of the serious and Cars 1 is my #1 because mostly you can never beat the #1 but this movie was fantastic though and a great finish to the series hopefully not the end of it but it was a great movie for that if it was the finish. But that's how I felt about it worth every cent I paid.
263,8,Enjoyable for all ages,"I have a general love for animation, but I usually let my child dictate opinions on these type movies. He loved it. I liked it. The animation itself was beautiful to behold. I saw it at a drive-in which is evening more impressive because it wasn't the best screen. I was amazed at what Pixar is able to do with their animation. The pavement and water looked awesome. The story was decent. There was a ""twist"" of sorts at the end that I thought was cute. All in all it was a decent addition to the Cars line up. The kids will enjoy it. I enjoyed some of the humor. Its not funny like Archer, but I wouldn't let my six year old watch Archer either. Have some popcorn and enjoy."
264,6,'Cars 3' Review,"'Cars 3' is, in summary, a decent film despite not matching regular Pixar standards. "
265,7,An unnecessary but still enjoyable sequel.,"For some reason, Pixar keeps making ""Cars"" sequels after they make a great sequel to their previous classics. For example, after ""Toy Story 3"" we get Cars 2. After ""Finding Dory"", we get ""Cars 3"". I honestly don't know why they keep making them though. They aren't great movies as I think the second film is an absolute train wreck and they don't even make as much money compared to the other movies Pixar has made; the second film once again didn't make as much money as ""Toy Story 3"" made a year earlier. However, the series makes money in the toy department, I know that for sure, but I'm a film critic, so I have to look at the movies. So now we have ""Cars 3"", a movie that no one wanted, but still got anyway. Is it as good as the first film? It it as bad as the second? I'll tell you."
266,6,"Honestly, I think people missed the point.","I think fair to say that Cars is probably the Pixar Franchise that's loved the least on their roster. You have fans of the first movie, but most people have it on the bottom of their favorites list I notice. I rarely have heard anyone say they liked Cars 2 because I for sure didn't, and I loved the first one. This movie is miles better than Cars 2 (no pun intended) I don't see how anyone can argue that. I'm not going to talk about the corporate monger that produces these for the sake of selling toys because we all know these movies do, I'm reviewing the movie as a movie and as a Pixar one especially. This one at least brought back that classic American feel you get from the first movie. McQueen learns a new lesson, and it ends the story in a way that makes sense. People are only arguing it's not a worthy ending because they had expectations and wanted things to play out a certain way, but again they miss the point of what McQueen learns by the end of the film. Yes he wanted to race one last time, but the point was he had to give someone else their chance to follow their dreams via Cruz. The imagery of new drivers and technology that's beyond McQueen's generation continued to show him that his racing days were numbered and that he must make the realization that he'll grow old out of it just like everyone else. By following the training steps of Doc Hudson he learned that Doc's greatest joy in life wasn't just racing, but it was being McQueen's mentor and passing on his knowledge to a new generation. That's essentially what the film goes for, it concludes the story in a Rocky III sort of way and it works. This movie was made for the fan of the first Cars who appreciated it for scenes like when Sally showed McQueen the history of Route 66, with James Taylor playing in the background. If you appreciated the first movie like I did because of Paul Newman's performance as Doc and his relationship with McQueen then you're going to love this film. There's a certain emotional resonance it has with that relationship and they digitally recreate Paul Newman's role in a poignant way. As a movie for kids I would say if they really like Cars 1-2 they will most likely enjoy this one as well. If they sorta like the other two then I would say pass. The pacing is different from other animated films and it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. That's why they have films like Despicable me 3 which require less attention and deliver more cutesy animation because some people think that's satisfying enough. In comparison to other Pixar films I would say I enjoyed it more than Finding Dory and Monsters University. But I liked it more on the level of the Good Dinosaur. It's serviceable, but not great. You go for certain elements like the animation. The visuals in this movie are beautiful. In a similar way like the Good Dinosaur, the way they did the forests and the beaches I really felt like I wasn't watching an animated movie. I think Pixar's in a creative phase where they have many original ideas they're working on but it's not ready to start producing within the next 3 years henceforth why we're getting all these sequels. I understand Coco is suppose to release later this year and I'm really looking forward to that. Cars 3, not the best animated movie I've seen this year, but it's an entertaining one. It might not be the right movie for newcomers who haven't seen the first one at least but I recommend it for people who enjoy the first for the reasons I did."
267,6,Cars 3,"For those who are following the ""cars"" franchise this one will be more engrossing. The storyline is engrossing as the practice sessions, though car race aficiondos will be wonderi ng whether a car substitution is allowed or not. But what the heck ? Enjoy !"
268,8,Lightning mcqueen returns.,"At this point you are probably thinking that the cars movies are getting to a point when they need to stop but this movie is the best of the cars movies the animation is good, the characters are likeable and the story is just brilliant. The only problem is that even though the story is good, it can get predictable."
269,9,Just Brilliant,"I loved this film, great entertainment, great graphics, great sound effects, great visual effects, great plot, great sequel, funny, moving towards the end, a shame that the Hudson Hornet died great story great racing great car design, this film has everything Cars and Cars 2 had, apart from the Hudson Hornet brilliant family entertainment."
270,9,CHANGING OF THE GUARD,"This Cars film is, in my opinion, the most emotional, being able to relate and come to terms with age. Lighting McQueen was suppose to be going through intense training to help him get his edge back, but instead, he gets his edge and then some. I started watching this series about 13 years ago when my children were small and now like in the series changing of the guard, I watch Cars 3 with my grandchildren. I believe this Car film to be one of the best out of the III."
271,7,A good time,"I know that isn't saying much as the first was mediocre, and the second terrible, but this is a nice heartwarming story that is actually about racing, but also about legacy and deciding what you want to be in life."
272,7,"Best ""Cars"" movie so far","What we liked about the first one (and not the second) was the simplicity and innocence in the story with a good heart and intention made for younger audience. This installment carries all that, one might say this is the sequel the original cars movie deserved. The themes this movie carries is very much similar to the original and at times feels like you are watching the first movie itself with certain characters switching places, but nevertheless its much better than the last one and worthy of a sequel. And as always Pixar's animation is beautiful to watch."
273,7,Just as good as the first one (a short review),"Want to go see a movie with a theater full of kids who are bored after 15 minutes of a movie? Well here's your flick. The first half of this movie are BORING. Almost every kid in the theater was stir crazy from lack of humor, or any real story. It picks up a bit by 3/4 in, but doesn't make up for the first half being flat out mediocre. Overall not terrible like Cars 2, but geez is this one ever keeping in the vein of the Cars franchise quality wise."
274,6,Thoroughly meh,"Overall decent film, until the last act.<br /><br />This is the feminist equivalent of American Idol, the fantasy to go from unknown to number one instantly. You would think even girls would complain."
275,6,The Mary Sue aspect killed it,"""Cars 3"" returns to its roots, and expands on its world without jumping the shark. The story and its beats are predictable, but it's the character focused parts of the film that keep it interesting since most of the film spends too much time referencing the first, as well as flashing back to moments that happened minutes ago, and it gets repetitive. The first half was the roughest to get into since it rushes exposition in order to get to Lightning's crash scene, which ends up not being that big of a deal anyways so it just makes the film longer than it had to be. What saves the film though was the 2nd half, where we finally get to slow down, and take in the story. If you enjoyed the first film, you'll find some comfort here. It's still one of the weaker PIXAR films to date, but it's not bad either as it eventually provides some new ideas to make it worth your time, and I appreciated it for being practical."
276,6,Back to the Basics,"Cars 3 follows Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), amidst all of his former racing pals retirements, McQueen feels himself being pushed in that direction, but he doesn't want to retire yet.<br /><br />He begins training with a much younger trainer to get his groove back so he can take on the new young racers."
277,9,"A big step for the Cars franchise, Cars 3 is great!","For more than 20 years, Pixar Animation Studios has produced several of different classics. Some are excellent films with in-depth storytelling, like Toy Story 3 and Inside Out. Others have upset the critics and the box office records, like Cars 2. Well, Cars 3, however, fits this category of a ""fresh"" Pixar movie. After the mediocre sequel Cars 2, Pixar decided to step up this franchise's game by pitching a third entry. The movie studio also realized that die-hards of the series would enjoy the third movie being more in tune with the original. The extensive advertising that went into the film, all featuring the crash of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), the veteran racing champion, was targeted more towards adult viewers. Unfortunately, the film appealed more towards younger viewers. Cars 2 grabbed adults more because there was a massive spy subplot incorporated into the film, which threw the franchise off-track. As the film progresses the chemistry between Lightning McQueen and Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), McQueen's high-tech trainer, develops from total strangers to close friends. During the final race, for example, McQueen sacrifices his position in the race to give Ramirez her chance to win her first Piston Cup championship. While this sounds very heroic, the reality is that National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) rookies must enter the rookie division to compete in national championships. However, Cars 3 makes an exception to the reality because this is an entertaining, children's film, not a documentary on how to become a race car driver and retire. Although this is a poignant story about retirement and learning from elders, Cars 3 still manages to be defined as a comedy and family- friendly film. Almost no one was expecting a happy ending to a movie where the main character nearly dies in the teaser trailer. The overall tone makes the targeted audience feel welcome and glad to have attended an incredible film. Randy Newman's score transformed the movie from a sad drama to a happy, fun comedy, using themes from the original, including ""The Big Race"" which is nostalgic for many people. Although it surpasses Cars 2 is storytelling, the film almost saved this flat- tired animated franchise, but, in the end, does not match the high standards of Cars. Cars 3 is the perfect example of how a sequel should be constructed and created, using nostalgic scores and kid-friendly jokes for audiences of all ages to laugh. While animated ""threequels"" like Shrek the Third and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs are charming comedies for fellow audiences, only Cars 3 produces comedy, drama, and nostalgia for audiences of all ages."
278,,"Despite Having A ""Flat Tire."" Cars 3 Takes The Checkered Flag This Year (includes Spoilers)","Car racing is very hard and the racing culture for the racers and fans should start early on in their adolescents. Great movie that truly depicts the real struggles that exist when your mentor is gone. Very true especially for car racing.Unlike ball players who frequently change teams and settle in different parts of the world and yet be able to play well. Racing is one man and one mentor for life and when the continuity is gone then all is gone. This movie reflects that theme clearly in words, emotions, sentiments and all. The end of most races are dramatic for the winners as always and this movie brings forth that excitement completely. From the start to end the movie had no pause or slow time. I saw most audience glued to their seat but smaller kids seemed distracted. This movie is an example of an animation mostly for teenagers and adults and not smaller kids. I gave this movie 7.5"
279,,Professional car racing movie in cartoons,"Cars 3 is a good movie. It is not a waste of money. Its funny, sweet and entertaining. The visual experience is amazing."
280,9,Ignore the haters,This movie completely ignores the fact that Cars 2 exists (which is good) and it pretty much picks up where the first one left off. The opening scene of this movie is similar to the opening scene in the first Cars movie but i think the first one did it better.
281,7,Good but not great.,"It was a good movie in all, and just saying: Jackson Storm is way meaner then he appears in the trailers. He is not like bullying Lightning McQueen or anything like that, he is just kinda hard on him. The movie is well put together and has its funny moments. Anyway really good movie and hope in a few years they will make another one (probably not) so go do yourself a favor and see it!!!"
282,9,It was a really good movie after all.,"Nice story of a new friendship for McQueen and a good setup for him to take a new road in future Cars installments.In ""Cars 3,"" Lightning McQueen suddenly finds himself blindsided by a new generation of blazing fast racers. He's seeing himself and his fellow race mates forced to retirement. Refusing to be told when he should call it quit, McQueen is determined to get back in the game, acquiring the help of a new sponsor and a young trainer who's secretly wanting to be a racer. But all that only brings McQueen to the doorstep of his own inspiration, the late fabulous Hudson Hornet. This enlightenment will prove once again whether or not Lightning McQueen still has what it takes to be a champion."
283,7,"Someone like it, while others don't","Actually i'm not the fan of Cars franchise on Disney movie, but i think this movie is quite nice. The story is simple, but have many good point on morale message. Some people may not realize it, but the morale message is connected from the Cars 1 & 2. And that is really similar with our life ! Cars 1 teach us to have big dreams even we are only ordinary people. Cars 2 teach us to not forget our family, friends when we already successful. Cars 3 teach us something different in life ! I don't want to spoiler it, just watch and you will learn something on your life. "
284,7,You will learn something different on your life !,"At best this film is mediocre. The experience is quite forgettable and the characters from previous films are not expanded on in any way other than Lightning. However even when they tried to expand upon Lightning's character, they failed because they attempt to advance the plot by making him go against everything set up for him from the 1st film (a similar instance happened with Cars 2)<br /><br />The ending of this film is trying way too hard to be a feel good kind of movie where everyone lives happily ever after, however it comes off as very forced and unnecessary. The best I can say about this film is that the animation is stellar and it was better than Cars 2."
285,4,Mediocre Pixar disappointment,"I took my 4 year old and 2 year old sons to this movie. They both loved it! I also thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought they really brought back a lot of the basics that made the original Cars so successful. My 4 year old has been obsessed with Cars for 2 years now, so I consider myself a bit of an expert as I have seen each movie over 20x :) This movie had a lot of teachable moments for my children. I love that it showed the friendship and respect that the 'old' race cars had for each other. It also made it clear how important it is to accept change. And it showed, that if you work hard for something, you can achieve it. I think Cruz is an awesome character and I love that they transitioned McQueen into her mentor as Doc was for him. Overall, I think it was made well and they got back to basics and made it more about racing and core relationships."
286,8,Back to Basics,This is great it's much better than the second was but still not quite as good as the first in my opinion this is what the 2nd one should have been
287,,A definite improvement,"Was shaping up to be a pretty good ""comeback story"", but they poached it with feminism. Brainwashing from a young age is a shameful deed indeed, but what do you expect from a Disney movie? The ending was just about as unrealistic as they come. You'd be wise to throw this movie in the trash."
288,4,Offensive,"Never seen negative review so foolish, the third installment came with such a fresh idea. Its not about Lighting McQueen race and winning but to progress an idea that the new deserving generation should get a chance and be mentored by the old.I knew that movie has did this so brilliantly.I am an Indian and loved this movie from the beginning to the end. I gave it 10 rating on Imdb for that."
289,10,I loved the movie,It's a film that the ending makes you feel like it's trying to turn the screws on people watching it. It did achieve its objective
290,2,Wierd ending,I saw the first cars when i was a kid and i totally enjoyed it as i did with every Pixar film. When i saw the second one i was a teenager and i didn't really love it but still was a good film for kids though.
291,9,The third one the greatest..,"A great family movie to watch on a Saturday morning, but it is predictable at times and most adults could get board"
292,6,A good KIDS MOVIE,"Cars 3 is directed by Brian Fee and stars Owen Wilson once again as Lightning McQueen, we also see Armie Hammer join the cast along with Chris Cooper and Cristela Alonzo. The story takes place some years after Cars 2 and focuses on an aging Lightning McQueen fighting for his place in the modern racing sport, when a next generation of racing cars begins to emerge. I have quite nostalgic feelings about the original Cars film since I was a kid when I first saw it. Of course now I do see it's not one of the best Pixar movies but I still enjoy it. As for Cars 2 I don't really care for it. For me it's a very mediocre film that bring nothing new to the table. Is Cars 3 an improvement then? I think it is due to one very important thing, the racing! Racing is finally back along with McQueen as the focus of the film and for that reason alone it's better than Cars 2. Cars 3 also successfully introduce some new characters, Cruz Ramirez(Cristela Alonzo) is a welcome addition to the universe and Jackson Storm(Armie Hammer serves as a decent villain. Also the animation is, as expected from Pixar, really great especially in the second act. The few points i've mentioned are what in my opinion makes this film an improvement over Cars 2 but unfortunately it's a very mediocre film. Although the focus of the film is on Racing it's still unfocused and feel like 2-3 movies slammed into one. And due to this it's hard to grow emotionally attached to any of the characters. But up until the third act I was fine with the film and thought it was as good as the original, but when a specific choice is made in the third act the movie lost me. I could have been fine with the direction the film took if I had been invested in the characters but I wasn't. Cars 3 is a fine kids film that adults also can find entertaining, but doesn't hold up compared to the other Pixar films. Final rating: 6/10 ⭐️"
293,7,Back on track,"First of all, all those claiming it was predictable, are lying. The movie wanted you to think a certain way and cleverly hid any notion of turning out how it did."
294,8,Surprisingly good,"My five year-old son and I waited an entire year for Cars 3 to be released. This highly anticipated movie had a lot to live up to, since my son has been conjuring up many scenarios as to how the plot would unfold. He's a huge Car's fan, and we literally counted the days before the June 16 release."
295,8,"Kid tested, parent approved!",I remember being blown away by Cars when I took my 6-year-old son to see it in 2006; we watched the DVD so much that we had most of the lines memorized by the time he was 7.
296,8,Didn't Expect to Like it So Much,"Cars (2006) was pretty good. Cars 2 (2011) was a total mess, but the third time's the charm for Lightning McQueen and company. I looked forward to this movie for a long time, watching and re-watching every trailer and clip. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. This movie has everything - nostalgia, conflict, a great story, a terrific soundtrack and plenty of homages to the original film. The only thing it's missing, strangely, is McQueen's famous catchphrases ""Ka-chow!"" and ""Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer"" (although variations of his ""I am speed"" monologue are there in abundance). Then again, this movie definitely has a more serious tone than the previous Cars films, so perhaps cheesy catchphrases would seem out of place. I certainly didn't miss them. The events of Cars 2 are not mentioned at all, which is a good thing if you ask me. Oh, and can I just mention how spectacular Pixar's graphics are these days? The best thing about this film, thought, is not that Lightning is a much more sympathetic character than he used to be (let's face it, he was pretty self- centered through most of Cars, and was barely in Cars 2 at all). Nor is it the fact that Mater, who we saw far too much of in Cars 2, is largely kept in the background for this film (and thank goodness!). He only features prominently in a few brief scenes, and for the first time since the first film, his comedy bits are actually funny. No, the best part of this film is a cheerful, spunky yellow sports car (she doesn't seem to be based on any real- life make and model, although she loosely resembles a Jaguar F-type) named Cruz Ramirez. She steals the show (in a good way) and I found myself rooting for her even more than McQueen. More than anything else, this movie is Cruz's story, and her character could even be seen as a feminist message of hope. It's no Wonder Woman, but Cars 3 certainly does more to help close the gender gap than its predecessors (in fact, one scene directly addresses sexism in the racing world, though it's not strictly about Cruz). A few moments even reminded me of another excellent sentient-race-car film, Herbie Fully Loaded (which I highly recommend, even if you're not a NASCAR fan). There's also a number of touching tributes to the late Doc Hudson, whose character arc in the first film is clearly echoed in parts of McQueen's journey in this one. Rusty and Dusty, who were voiced by the Car Talk guys in the first film, are in this one as well, although, since one of them died, his character doesn't say much (although what few lines he does have are expertly edited together, seemingly from old Car Talk recordings, the same way Doc's lines were derived from Paul Newman's voice recordings left over from Cars). The only real downside to Cars 3 is that it doesn't work very well as a standalone film. While you could get the overall gist of it if you've never seen Cars, it works much better when thought of as a continuation of the first film. If I were watching the trilogy for the first time, I would watch Cars and Cars 3 back-to- back, skipping Cars 2 (it contributes nothing relevant to the time line, and if you're really in love with the Cars universe, you can always go back and watch it later.) TLDR: Cars 3 was better than either of the two previous films. Watch the first Cars if you haven't already, then go see Cars 3. It rocks!"
297,9,Third time's the charm!,"I didn't like Cars 1 much, but thought Cars 2 was quite good.<br /><br />This movie ignores completely what happened in Cars 2, and just focuses on the end of McQueen's career.<br /><br />Has some funny moments but others could be eliminated."
298,6,Did Cars 2 exist?,"Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time Piston Cup racing legend, finds himself overshadowed by Jackson Storm, an arrogant rookie who belongs to a new generation of racers that use the latest technology to improve their racing performance. This causes McQueen's fellow veterans to either be retired or fired by their sponsors to make way for the new rookies. In the final race of the season, as he tries to catch up to Storm and the other leaders, McQueen suffers a violent, nearly fatal rollover crash, leaving him badly injured."
299,10,Stop Giving Bad Reviews And Higher The Rating!,"I am huge fan of cars movies but this one disappointed me please make its 4th part any show Lightning McQueen is back with his new look & skills because kids and children want to watch it.Pleaase Pixar Animation Studios & Walt Disney Pictures make a new part for kids,children and cars movie fans."
300,9,Please make 4th part,"Pixar's awe-inspiring world with beautiful story telling continues on with Cars 3. Not only targeting children of all ages but having some motivational messages spread throughout the movie. Ending the beautiful trilogy, taking what was good from the original one that we all loved and adored."
301,9,Sweet Childhood Memories,"As a Pixar fan, I think Pixar did an amazing job on this movie. The movie has great graphics, they gave a good message, and it actually relates to the racing concept. It's definitely worth your time and money, and both kids and adults will love it. I personally LOVED it myself, and I think Cruz Ramirez will be a role model to a lot of women and girls."
302,10,Amazing!!!,I have to stop after 45 mins. It was really so monotonous and so boring that I have no hope its gonna be any fun.
303,1,The most boring animated movie I have ever seen.,Everyone that said that Lighting just quit doesn't get the point (or points) of the movie. Lightning decided to give up his last chance for someone else to have their first chance. He also realized that there's more to life than personal glory. Helping others succeed can be even more rewarding. This is very much in line with the first one where he gives up the piston cup to help The King finish his last race.
304,8,It seems like some don't get it,"Rate it 8 out of 10. Great philanthropy expressed in this movie. Dream it. Then believe it. Well worth the watch, and the 3rd installment adds much needed value and heart to the series. I've been waiting to watch Cars 3 ever since I saw the trailer 6 months or so ago. I loved the concept / purpose and how it lit the fire within myself. I had a choice to watch the well-reviewed Wonder Woman movie, however I picked Cars 3 because I felt it related to me much more."
305,8,Worth my time and money to watch,"I really liked this movie for the whole 1 hour 20 minutes before the end, it was really good and I liked it was a way bigger step up from Cars 2.....but the ending did NOT pay off. That's why I only gave it 7 stars instead of like 8-9"
306,6,"Good, until the end",Read my full review here: www.havekidwillteardrop.com/2017/06/15/movie-review-disney-pixars- cars-3/
307,9,So much fun!,I saw all 3 movies and the last one is the worse i expect that the end will be a comeback of mc queen but again the PC staff stop doing this staff people come to see a good movie with the hero and they stick u the girl to be equal its a movie who meant to be fun not everything have to be PC.
308,3,Disappointing movie,This movie was so much better than cars 2 because mater didn't have as much screen time which made it good and worth the time when you see it but this is a very funny movie with everyone calling lightning mc queen old and he is the one still there because all the newe young cars are faster than him and it also shows that women can race to and one thing I wasn't expecting was that it was surprisingly emotional and sad at times but I think that the first cars movie slightly beats by not far
309,9,Solid and funny good sequel,"Sad to say, but the legendary first Cars movie that every kid grew up on has been ruined by these meaningless sequels."
310,5,Sad to see a potentially good trilogy ruined,"There are so many reviews saying that movie sucked. I understand, it wasn't way you expected and but all in all the movie was good. It had heart and soul not like the Cars 2. I can feel how much heart and thought put into the movie. I loved it. Hope you do too. It's realistic. Funny thing to say to animated movie about cars. :D"
311,8,Why so sad?,"This was just what I wanted, a nice story with lots of heart. Many parts resembled those from the Rocky-franchise, which I love. If I have any complaints it's that the story, though pleasant as it was, it was very paint-by-numbers. I knew from the second Cruz revealed her ""secret"" what was going to happen. The story was simple and predictable but I still found myself enjoying it. The slow pacing allowed me to feel emotions. You get too tired from all the explosions and aliens in most other movies that it was nice to have just a story. It felt very grounded and soothing."
312,8,Very enjoyable,"Having grown up with the original Cars (2006) and playing with all the Lightning McQueen merchandise, it would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit excited for Cars 3. And I was excited. Was ready to see Pixar redeem itself from the failure that was Cars 2 and hopefully get back to what they're best at: entertaining animations that emotionally grab audiences. "
313,6,"Fine, sub-par with other Pixar films","Inspiring, exhilarating, exciting, humorous, and more, all that was Cars 1 you will find in Cars 3. The classic is back. Love the sounds, exhaust, the reflections, shadows, smoke from the tires, the feel of the race track, down to the debris found on a hard run road, it's all there. Back to the country, the roots, receiving life lessons from the Old Pros. Finding what's important in life, the good in people, inspiring others. No political agenda like that in Cars 2, which was a flop. Simply put, if you loved Cars 1 you're going to love cars 3."
314,10,Like Cars 1 then you might like Cars 3,+JMJ+
315,7,"A Good, Decent Film",I don't understand all the hate this movie gets. Cars 2 is a throwaway. Forget it even exists. This is the sequel that Cars deserved.
316,8,Heart for days,I'm surprised by how many poor reviews this film is getting. Cars 2 was pretty weak - and that's not saying the first Cars was that great anyway. But Cars 3 is definitely in a class above. 
317,7,best of the Cars franchise,"This chapter of the cars saga is the Best of all, and in a one momento would hace to happen the mcqueen accidente."
318,10,Good and funny...,"Cars 3 pulls ahead of 1 & 2 but it still can't pull ahead of Pixar's classics. The beginning of the movie was absolutely terrible, it was the same old same old start to a Cars movie, but it still makes up for it's lost ground. IKt really started to pick up at the 45 minute mark, you couldn't blink without missing something. Cruz was very ehh and kind of snarky in the beginning but she ended up becoming a very funny and likable character at the hour mark. Jackson was a pretty weak competitor he really wasn't a part of a lot of the movie. But at the hour and 15 min mark it was clear that Cars 3 was a good movie. Sadly it doesn't have the story or depth of a lot of the other Pixar classics but it still is the best addition to the Cars franchise. 1st quarter 4.5/10 2nd quarter 6/10 3rd quarter 8.5/10 4th quarter 9/10"
319,6,Cars 3 manages to get back on track after a muddy start,"After a flop with ""Cars 2"" Pixar did what they can do best - emotional and touching story with personal growth and ""Arch of the character"". They find a brilliant topic for the sequel that was revealed naturally. The story is about how McQueen accepts reality and finds his new vocation. And the process of changing is really poignant and dramatic. And all the journey of McQueen in sport is looped. So I hope there won't be ""Cars 4"" (as opposed to ""The Toy Story 4""). I love this."
320,7,A path of the master.,"I think Cars 3 was a really well written animation movie which has a lot of conceptual dialogues. It is very entertaining, and very enlightening and sometimes unpredictable. It teaches you how to not let go of your dream and inspires you to fight for it. I recommend this animation to those who want to motivate and entertain themselves."
321,8,Cars 3 was a really well written animation movie,"""Inside out"" for dummies....please be the end of the road."
322,5,Hit the brakes,"I am probably one of the bigget Pixar fans to ever walk the face of this earth. And out of all the moives, Cars has always been one of my favorite movies they have made. I remember as a child watching Lightning McQueen race around the track and feeling tension as I watch his tires pop and he slides out of controll. I remember watching them go tractor tipping and laughing my guts out. I remember the good feeling going away as I watched the flashback of the history of Radiato Springs. That movie was phenomenal."
323,6,Cars 3: The Dissapointment to Long Time Cars Fans,"I was excited to find out that cars 3 was going to be made, however watching it when it was released and finding out what the story was about, if i were told the plot and they didn't make the movie, I would've been happier with this series being left at Cars 2."
324,5,meh.,"The Disney movie franchise Cars is slowing down. They had begun to slow down starting the sequel. When the first movie cars came out there was excitement all around for this highly anticipated Disney movie. The movie came and it was a hit, it goes through the life of a race car and how he meets unlikely friends. Then years later a second movie came out. This movie was set in France and there was still racing but in this movie it was mixed with agents and spies, like a secret agent spy movie but with cars instead of people. The movie was good but like any sequel it wasn't as good as the first. But then this movie came out, what shouldn't have been released had been released,Cars 3. Cars 3 needs to be the end of the line for the cars franchise. The plot of this movie is that the main race car goes into retirement. And as a kids movie no kid is going to relate to this movie whatsoever. Unlike the other movies where kids were interested and could understand. Cars 3 needs to be the end of the line for the Cars franchise. This franchise just ran out of gas."
325,4,Review on Cars 3,This filmwas obviously better than Cars 2. Even though Disney ruined character of Lightning McQueen a bit that was still not empty and also it was very very enjoyable.
326,7,BETTER THAN CARS 2!,"Cars 1 introduced audiences of 2006 into the world of lightning McQueen, a cocky driver with a big potential. The film develops him into a character who cares less of winner and more of sportsmanship. Cars 2 (2011) built on his legacy where it reveals that McQueen is one of the best drivers in the world having won 5 piston cups. Thus allowing him to be invited to the World Grand Prix. Whilst the third instalment Cars 3 (2017) reveals a car who is well past his prime and is on the out of the racing world. He decides to have more go to prove to himself and his doubters that he can still race. Ultimately decided to pass on his legacy rather than ""beating a dead horse"" and decides to move into coaching. "
327,9,Cars 3 is an excellent addition to the franchise,"Cars 3 absolutely is the best sequel and the most astonishing ending in this trilogy. Compared to Cars 2 which is not so much an official sequel as a unofficial biography, Cars 3 goes back to the sturdy apprenticeship between McQueen and Doc Hudson. I'm glad knowing this sequel will go back to the race track, or the right track, yet beyond my expectation, Cars 3 more focuses on what are not on the race track!!! Hence, if you are up to re-taste an exciting race as if shown in Cars 1, you may be a sort of disappointed, yet trust me, you are bound to find a strong moving in this perfect ending of Cars trilogy. Hundred-looped-race is definitely ended, but legacy will be passed over through hundred generations!!!"
328,8,"NEW ERA of cars, so as NEW LEVEL of this movie !!!",It is very obvious in this movie that the cruz character has been shoehorned in to appease the PC gods. She does not contribute anything to the movie and there would be nothing missing if she would have been left out.<br /><br />It obviously was meant as a story about how if you are not the fastest anymore you can still be the most clever. It would have even including the juxtaposition of the flying through the air into a crash in the beginning and the flying through the air to win in the end. It would have been great and smart and heartfelt. A great lesson about how to use your head to overcome obstacles with using your brain.<br /><br />But instead we got the lesson that boys can't have nice things...
329,1,They had a good script and messed it up with politics,This film singlehandedly ruins the whole cars series of which i am a híve fan.
330,1,Trash,"Now that the cars trilogy is over, its similarity to toys trilogy is more than obvious. Both the trilogies follow the same structure."
331,8,"cars 3 is basically toys 3, let me explain",Better than the second one but not quite as good as the first one a fantastic ending and just a pretty good movie
332,8,Good movie,"I think this is best Cars release but still I can see time differences in different places but this time they are small. So interesting, graphics good and animations great."
333,6,Better than other Cars,"We've watched all of Pixar's films, in release order, over the last 10 nights or so, with just Coco & Incredibles 2 to come tonight. It's been a great journey, seeing some old favourites again & seeing some for the first time."
334,6,"Better than 2, still not Great","This was really, really good! Executive Producer John Lasseter had teased that the film would be a very emotional story and a little bit more akin to the first installation. The film was exactly that. The story was strong, the characters were strong, the visuals were strong, the music was strong (yay Randy Newman), and it was overall a great movie. The film focuses on the future of McQueen's career as well as his relationship and memory of Doc Hudson. Paying tribute to the first installation the movie starts off with McQueens pep talk quickly making lighthearted fun of it. After that the film gets in to the theme of you are never to old for your passion and you should never give up. Through heart felt moments that take us down memory lane the movie teaches viewers to share our passions and always believe in not only yourself, but others. This is shown through mentoring from older racers and the loyalty both Rust-eze and the gang (Mater, Sally, Luigi, Guido) display. The film introduces a few new characters and surprising most are females. Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), McQueens trainer, is a central piece to the plot and become a great role model for younger kids. Miss Fritter (Lea DeLaria) at first is shown as a hard headed demolition derby bus demonstrating you don't always have to look pristine and that some people have a rough exterior, but later she reveals her passions and her depth as a character (also love the reference to Miss Frizzle). Finally one of the elder racers (actual person), Louise Nash (Margo Martindale) admits to having a crush on Doc Hudson, but also brings up the fact that the guys didn't like a woman winning races and she did it anyway because she loved it. Overall the story nearly made me cry out of tenderness and the entire auditorium clapped after the final race as well as the end of the film. Honestly if you haven't seen any of the films you need to watch the first one and this one. Yes they are that good!"
335,8,The best Cars yet!,"I was never expecting Cars 3 to actually be that boring and cliche. The only thing good about the movie was the beginning but that's it. The movie does a good job with the new character Cruz Ramirez, But then overall didn't make Cruz an impact on the movie. So although they do a good job with her character, Her personality was sort of stale and is still overall a forgettable character. Back to what I was talking about, The movie is just sadly all about Lighting McQueen looking to win another race gets another new cliche antagonist named Jackson Storm who really didn't really make an impact in the movie either. He is actually one of Disney's worst villains. Jackson Storm wasn't as wrathful as Jafar from Aladdin or as pure vicious as the Evil Queen from Snow White. He was just calm and just sassy. That's it. Therefore it was obvious that he would lose in the end. Anyway, This movie was nothing but Lightning McQueen and Cruz Ramirez who went from training to bonding with each other only then to lead to an overcliched end with an overrated message. The message is good but we heard that like a million times already. Can't they be original for once like they were in Cars 1? In the end, McQueen obviously gives his spot to hand Cruz the victory against Storm with another overcliched crap ending. They honestly could do a lot better than this. What happened with all the action and Disney drama? Why is it all just the main character bonding with a new character throughout the whole movie which doesn't lead to anything amusing at all. For anything the beginning was good only then to lead to an unsurprising forgettable borefest. I give this a 1/10 because I know they could do a lot better than this lazy writing. Worst of the series."
336,1,Lazy Writing Material,"It's good, that's it...it's still boring as sin and still wants you to buy there merch but hey...it's a film..."
337,7,"Hey can we make a good Cars movie? FINE, ONE",Don't go with the reviews for this one. Lightning McQueen fans will surely enjoy this!!
338,7,Kind of a sad conclusion in the end !,"Warning!, This review was written by a 14 year old me in 2019. The views reflected in the following review are not necessarily shared by me in the current. They're purely kept up because of nostalgia."
339,5,"Had too high expectations, I think.","As someone who grew up watching Cars, finally seeing all 3 movies in a row came with a lot of nostalgia. This story was very well made, and we got to see the development of a reckless McQueen to a much more mature and wise racing car, ending up following the footsteps of the great Hudson Hornet."
340,7,Fabulous McQueen,"This movie deals with heavy themes such as lost youth and mortality. There aren't many jokes, and the movie is more of a drama than any Pixar movie I remember watching. That being said, it is a fantastic film if you're in the mood for it, but I can imagine why kids would not enjoy it."
341,8,Cars 3 - surprisingly not for kids,"Comes to us ladies and gentlemen, the work of works, probably the best film of the best saga of .... The truth is that I do not like Cars."
342,4,Pixar Is in decline,"Despite the negative reviews, I really like this movie. Great animation and story which, to be honest, can be a little better but is still good for me. To me it's far far better than the second movie, it really has the first movie's vibe. The main thing I like about this movie is the feeling. I don't know why but I just had the best feeling while watching it. I believe it's worth your money and time."
343,8,I like it,"Cars 1 was a huge hit, and everyone banked on the success of Cars 1 to make Cars 2 a success, but it failed. It was way over kids' head to understand the plot and storyline of Cars 2, but not every movie can be a success, so we give Pixar that one. Cue up to the teaser trailer for Cars 3, it looks like it's going to be AMAZING! Lightning gets in a HUGE wreck, newer and faster cars, what is Lightning McQueen gonna do??? We were all hooked months ago, and Disney and Pixar knew it. Now cue up to opening day for Cars 3 and people are ready to take their entire families to see the movie, one that should rescue the series, at least, that's what I thought. "
344,6,Disney for Dollar Signs,"The cars series has been a regular fixture in our house for years. Both of our boys love the films and despite them not being highly thought of critically, I have no problem with them and admire their heart, humour and amazing production design."
345,7,The final lap.,"The only funny thing about cars 3 is that none of the characters mention the bs that is the second movie. It's like Pixar said, "" maybe the entire world forgot about cars 2 so let's all just pretend that that movie didn't exist"". 😂"
346,5,Average,"When I saw the teaser of this movie, it sounds like a great movie which I figured focus on Lightning been outperformed by new Gen Cars.<br /><br />It is an interesting premise how Lightning veteran racing career is parallel to his mentor,Doc Hudson.But they kinda pull it too far, which the endings is full of hollywood cliches and expected outcomes.<br /><br />They just don't have as much strong ending in Cars 1 compared to Cars 3.I an kinda disappointed because this premise and story setting is a great potential.<br /><br />It was a good and entertaining movie, but Pixar can do more than that. They have a great idea, but they just lack of great executions."
347,6,"A promising premise,but not a great execution","I've never really been a huge fan of the cars movies. <br /><br />In my opinion cars 1 is okay and cars 2 mediocre at best but cars 3, something completely different. The story is similar to cars 1 but the feeling of the movie is different.<br /><br />I don't know why but I just feel happy when I'm done watching this movie.<br /><br />It just has some really positive vibes to it.<br /><br />I don't know why but it just reminds me of how people can be connected and really there is no reason for anyone not to watch this movie..<br /><br />But seriously I can't express how happy I become when I watch this movie. <br /><br />It could be nostalgia vibes from the first movie.<br /><br />Still I recommend watching it."
348,8,Underrated,Cars 3 Review: Back On Track By - Ed Buskirk Editor: Disney Movie Database
349,8,Cars 3 Review: Back On Track,It's not a movie it's an emotion. Forget review if ur a fan and growed up watching cars franchise then watch it its really so emotional motivational and inspirational the story the characters the visuals omg everything is so perfect really had a great evening and nostalgia kicking in while watching this masterpiece thanks Pixar for such a brilliant movie. It's good to see the old characters after such a long time I still remember the first movie when I was a kid and listening that life is a highway track then after cars 2 now this cars 3 beautiful movie really watch it. In conclusion I just wanna say awesome beautiful and nostalgic movie I loved it.
350,10,It's an emotion and a beautiful masterpiece from pixar,I have watched rhe whole series of cars and I think this would be the best one.
351,8,So touching,LAST WARNING: THIS REVIEW HAS Spoilers. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
352,7,Nicely done! A return to form.,"I saw this at the cinema with 2 friends- 1 walked out,the other fell asleep. After the public complaints of Cars 2 (actually my favourite),Pixar decided to go back to the racing scenes of Cars 1......but overdid it. There's at least 5 different 'training scenes'- tyre-some after the first & a boring storyline that plods along. The writers decided to use old vocal sessions of Paul Newman & write parts of the story around that.... Which is very limiting & it shows. I felt the ending 'swap' was a bit of a cop-out. Although in real life this can be done but where the cars are the actual character-I'm not sure ?!?"
353,2,Worst Cars film to date,"Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) returns in the third installment of Pixar's Cars franchise. Now a veteran of the racing game, McQueen's life in the fast lane is threatened by the emergence of hi-tech, rookie racer, Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer). So as not to get kicked out of the sport he loves, McQueen searches for new racing methods to outmatch Storm. Joining him is racing trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), who has her own dreams to race. The first thing to say is that this film is a massive improvement over its prequel, Cars 2. This film felt like it was more similar in spirit to the original and, also like the original, focuses on McQueen and what racing means to his character (Mater gratefully returns to a supporting role). The film also looks at the importance of racing to the new character, Cruz. Although she possesses a seemingly perky and upbeat personality, she has her insecurities that make it difficult for her to race. In a sense, the film is an underdog story with both McQueen and Cruz as the underdogs. Storm was a decent villain, however he hardly appears in the film, which is kind of a shame. They also bring back Chick Hicks, the antagonist from the first movie, who is an annoying twerp and should just get off the screen. Now the film does start out fairly slow, which might bore some viewers, but it picks up again in the second half. There's also a pretty heartwarming moment in the third act. Overall, as someone who wasn't looking forward to this movie, it was more enjoyable than I had expected. It is vastly better than Cars 2 and felt like there was some actual heart to it.

354,6,Better than its prequel & better than I expected,"***This review may contain spoilers*** So apparently a lot of people complaining about the movie, have no basic comprehension skills or any understanding of how to explain concepts to their kids. They just want their kids to see that you can win no matter what and even if you get old you will still always be the best."
355,8,A fun and motivating movie about working hard and adapting to change.,"If u were planning to see McQueen beat other pixel racers in 10 movies to come u will be disappointed, this one is so much more though"
356,10,Awesome story - nice trilogy if it ends here,The movie is good. Both my kids loved it and wanted to see it again sometimes. 
357,8,"For those that remembers how Cars 1 ends, it's in the same theme","I have really lost interest in Pixar over recent years. Since up, there hasn't really been a groundbreaking Pixar movie. Because of this, and especially after the mess that was Cars 2, I expected this to be extremely mediocre just like most modern Disney movies. But I'm so glad i was wrong."
358,7,"Everyone seems to be missing the point to this movie, they want it to be just another formulaic kids flick","I saw many of us criticizing the film. They may seems OK, yet i doubt with that. It reminds me a change in generation. I first saw the first sequel being a student, with not that rationality in my mind regarding the meaning of life or how its gonna go through the paradigm of shift. Now i see the last one keeping me on the red car character whose high time is about to an end. Movie finishes with a fresh set up on stage. We might see in the next sequel where the new car (of third sequel) will be the hot rod like the second sequel. I will dream my new born baby kid on that character. :)"
359,10,I am positive.,"I'm sure as hell convinced that waiting so long for this movie has definitely helped in the fun of it. Cars 1 was great, Cars 2 was fun on it's own, but not that good of a sequel. Cars 3 gave me that nostalgic feel from the first movie."
360,8,"Out with the old, in with the new","I became well acquainted with Lightning McQueen back when the original movie was released, my son adored it and I'd say I've seen it at least 100 times since. His brothers also loved it, and they were really excited to see this new movie (We'll all just ignore Cars 2). "
361,8,Loved it,"Pixar movies are mostly instant classics because they tell stories about adults with adult problems, yet tell it in a way that is appropriate for kids. The first ""Cars"" movie was a ""Fish out-of-water"" movie, and even though the graphics were phenomenal, it was essentially ""Doc Hollywood."" The problem with Cars 3 is that it is a ""Replaced by new and flashy"" movie that Pixar already did with ""Toys."" Unlike the squeals to ""Toys,"" this one seems forced and rushed."
362,7,"Almost as good as the first, but the first was not great either.","I have read most of the 2-star reviews and I think most of them lose the main point of the movie which I think is the meaning of the new cars. I love Cars 1 and liked very much Cars 2. The soundtracks are perfect for the movies and music seems to be very important in terms of the history. I believe this new Cars 3 lacks a bit of the music side of the previous. But, I believe this movie has a different view and has a bit a the taste of Toy Story 3, the nostalgia and the remembrance of the past are the main point of those last two movies. I really enjoyed and my wife did so. My children of 4 yo liked also, maybe a bit slow for their age. My 11 and 14 yo liked the movie very much. I agreed in many topics of the movie and honor the American car history in many ways. I recommend the movie for most parents, especially for middle-age children."
363,8,"interesting movie, different from previous Cars movies","Turns out this is even better than the first Cars. Superb graphics, a real story line, lots of emotion, relationships, lots of laughs amd a great soundtrack."
364,9,Not just for kids,Wow what can i say! Cars 3 is actually a very good film. If you've seen the first Cars you should definitely see this one. It's way better than the second!.
365,8,Great film!,"This movie was really good. It was a good sequel to the cars 2 (agents) film. To bring all the fans back to High, Racing action. Overall I think Cars 3 is the best one of the franchise. It was a great finally to the Cars franchise as well. Even though we might see a 4th film. I saw this film when it came out in 2017."
366,9,Very great film,It is so bad stupid yellow car i dont even care. It was the last movie and you make it so bad. Fulfilling the stupid dream of a stupid yellow car. If i could make it 0/10 i would it is not good at all.#LETHIMRACE. Loser yellow car much. It is so bad stupid yellow car i dont even care. It was the last movie and you make it so bad. Fulfilling the stupid dream of a stupid yellow car. If i could make it 0/10 i would it is not good at all.#LETHIMRACE. Loser yellow car much. It is so bad stupid yellow car i dont even care. It was the last movie and you make it so bad. Fulfilling the stupid dream of a stupid yellow car. If i could make it 0/10 i would it is not good at all.#LETHIMRACE. Loser yellow car much.
367,1,This movie is awful,"I watched this movie without much expectation after the 2nd one, but in the end, it turned out to be better than I expected. In the first movie, McQueen has gone through a great transformation, from a young racer full of passion but also vanity to a calm, thoughtful and respectable one. We have Doc Houston to thank for that. Then again, in the third movie, he has gone through a second major transformation, something you may experience at your 40s. He is lost, desperate and has no clue how to carry on. Yet, in the dark time, he found hope, not the way he imagined but way much more. He realizes who he is right now, what can he do, and what he should do. If the first movie is about McQueen realizing the meaning of life, this one is about he building his own legacy, just like his respectable mentor Doc Houston. And now, his life is complete. "
368,7,"not a perfect film, but a perfect ending","Cars 3 starts promising but then loses that promise about halfway through the movie. The first part was great. The montage of the races was entertaining and shows what Lightning has become. Then, everything changes with the crash, which was excellently pulled of. Lightning experiences a bit of a depression, but then decides to make a great comeback. It's at this point the movie lost my interest. The rest of the movie is almost entirely about training to be the best race car ever and this training went on for way too long. Sure, this part had some amusing scenes in it, like the demolition derby, and also some scenes dedicated to character development. Eventually Lightning and Cruz decide to go to Hudson's old trainer and from here on out, the movie was saved. The rest of the picture is great with some tear-jerking moments for the true cars fans. I think this movie saved the franchise after Cars 2 and is a great finale for the trilogy. It deserves love, but it is still one of the weakest Pixar films."
369,9,"Cars 3 is good, but not great",Major spoil alerts!
370,8,Loved the movie,First of all i want to say that i am not a fan of cars but I'd like to see how this trilogy will end so i watch it. So i start the movie and i realize that the plot was expected to be easy to understand and with no surprises but at the end of the movie the hole thing change and give a interest in the movie.This change it was not exactly what you expected to see as this is the last adventure of mcqueen. I like the feeling of regardness and love that the last minutes offering to the audience but i expected an amazing end of the mcqueen carreer that i didnt see.
371,6,not what i expected but with some good surprises,"I don't normally get motivated to do many reviews unless I either see a major injustice in representation or I am just blown away by a film. In the case of Cars 3, it is the former, don't take the one star reviews word for it, do give this movie a go. There are a few things to get clear here with the polarity between negative and positive reviews."
372,10,Give this film a chance to grow on you,Great movie with lots of classic Pixar charm up until the ending. I hate the fact that McQueen didn't finish the race and Cruz Ramirez did instead. I grew up watching the Cars franchise and seeing this ending made me scream in frustration. Still a great movie with a lot of plot and story. Glad to see that they acted as if Cars 2 never happened in the movie. Also watch out for the Apple references because there are A LOT. Overall loved it and would highly recommend seeing it.
373,9,Great Movie,"After the disaster Cars 2 was, I was very skeptical about watching this part. (And IMDb's review did not make it sound any better.)<br /><br />Sure, if you all want McQueen to always win, then this movie might not be for you. Of course, since it is an animated movie, there was a possibility of not making them age - and leave him to win. But where's the fun in that? <br /><br />I felt like Cruz many times through the movie, McQueen too has been my hero with whom I grew up. It was nice to see his character grow, from a narcisstic freak to someone you could truly look up to. That retiring does not mean death. There were many messages which I resonate with in the movie, and while it was not as intense as the first movie, it was definitely fun to watch."
374,8,Better than you'd think,"Lot of scenes in the movie follow a predictable pattern, the main plot being how a hero from a previous generation can keep himself relevant in a changing world. And he does it. How he does it is endearing, thought provoking and down right brilliant."
375,8,Brilliant movie with a surprise anti fan boy twist,Where to start with this one.
376,1,Very disappointing,"First watching this with my 3 yo boy. We just love the story line, the character development of Cruz and Mc Queen. And the moral of the story that we can be happy in any life season ! Great one. Can wait for Cars 4 !"
377,10,This is a GREAT MOVIE !,"I think a lot of people have been criticising Disney too harshly for the twist in this movie. While I agree that at first glance it sends a mixed message to viewers especially with regard to ***SPOILER*** lightning giving up on the premise of the trailer. at a deeper viewing this film is in fact a brilliant morale lesson for all ages. Now most reviewers here who have given such bad scores expected a formula that lightning would just overcome the inevitable. But really, this is actually a shallow plot device. Age is a fact of life, you cannot keep winning forever, and you are a fool if you think otherwise. That is the lesson, lightning did beat storm, by doing what most racers could not, giving an opportunity to a bright racer who never gave themselves a chance. Accepting age and channeling all your victories, all your life's lessons, all the skills and experiences into another through teaching is the most unbeatable things anyone can do. Doc realised it and so finally did Lightning. "
378,9,Not how I would have ended it but not as bad as people make out,"It is hard to accept that the final fight is to pass the crown, there is no glory in that .. but for me its a best one a coming of age and ending the series."
379,9,Good ending but could have been improved,Hmmmmm... Okay guys let's make a new car movie. Any idea what should we do? Oh i have an idea let's add a new car for no reason and throw mcqueen in garbage.
380,1,New car before Mcqueen retired? No thanks.,"Cars 3 is a great movie with realistic animation (as realistic as talking cars can get), fascinating storytelling, real emotions and a surprising ending. For now, I consider this movie the greatest of the Cars movies. This is a story that we will all one day experience, and that makes this masterpiece even better."
381,9,Greatest movie of the Cars trilogy,"As a big fan of the Cars movies, my honest opinion on Cars 3 is that it's good, but not very good. It has some flaws, McQueen being called ""old"", McQueen also blaming Cruz for getting themselves into Thunder Hollow, though it was Lightning's choice. Other than the movie itself, the age rating should be something PG, because of McQueen's almost fatal crash. The movie's good, I'd recommend it, but I can't guarantee it'll be the best movie."
382,7,It's decent.,"I liked this movie at first but once you see talladega nights they're the same movie. Why? Main driver wins races. New guy takes over. Main driver fights back and wins the big race. I liked it as a kid but after watching talladega nights and then cars 3 they're the adult and kid versions of each other. Another reason of this is because both lightning McQueen and Ricky bobby get into huge wrecks that change their lives. I think on the track, cars 3 is a carbon copy of talladega nights. Off the track there's some similarities but what ruins cars 3 for me is how dark the teaser was for little kids and also the fact it's an on track carbon copy of will ferrells racing comedy classic."
383,6,Ok but kind of a ripoff,"I planned to go watch this movie with the family (wife, 11 yo, 8 yo), but I took time to read the user reviews on this movie. Then, I told my wife that this movie doesn't seem great. However, we voted and finally, of course we went to the cinema to watch it. The best of the 3 movie remains the first one, but the n°3 is much better than n°2! I liked the story, the fun moments and the message (trust yourself, let your place to others, fight to win, etc). The end is quite unusual and I guess that's why some reviews are negative. If you liked Cars, I would definitely recommend to watch it. All the family said it's a good movie."
384,8,Surprised by the bad comments,There is a lot of bad reviews for this movie and i don't even get if people understood what was going on in the movie. Lots of people talk about taking their younger sons in the cinema and etc. The movie was made for the generation that saw the movie 11 years ago. Most of those people are grown ups now. The movie show the ending of the great story of Lightning McQueen. The graphics where awesome for an animated movie some parts of the crashing of Lightning McQueen felt real and the story was breathtaking. Its a happy ending for Lightning McQueen.
385,7,A great ending for cars,"This was awesome, because how they managed to make this movie great and that the climax was very interesting. Lightning McQueen, Cruz Ramirez and Jackson Storms are very great characters that made this movie very awesome, and even though it was tough for Lightning he never quit and got what he wanted and that is to continue in the sport he loved."
386,8,Why was it Awesome?,"Cars 3 poses as a savior for the franchise. The director offers a decent emotional story line with a little pinch of humor.It had a deeper meaning than its predecessors and is a fine movie made by Brian Fee. Mcqueen uses doc as an inspiration and sees something unique in Cruz just like what doc had seen in him. Instead of the usual hero McQueen becomes by winning the race at the end, he does accept his days were gone and puts his life on Cruz. This may give more possibilities for a new part and i hope this is not the last one.At some instances it also promotes feminism and reaches to the youth of today.Still, pixar failed to give that emotional punch that McQueen's career end.It is a good film with a good concept but could have been built better with the given deep message. The film is quite good."
387,7,Cars 3 saves the franchise(This may contain spoilers),"Listen, this is my first review for any movie on IMDb or anywhere else, but I felt obligated after reading so many negative reviews. This is such a feel good movie for people of all ages. It does have to do with passing the torch, but also the emotions that comes along with busting your butt and coming up a bit short. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, sit back, and just enjoy the ride. It's the same Cars universe that everyone has come to love and this one is pretty high on my list of recent Disney greats. "
388,8,Settle Down Negative Nobodys!,"Pixar did a good job on the look of this movie, the graphic quality increased, making the scenery more beautiful. For me, the first movie is the best of the trilogy, but ""Cars 3"" is much better than Cars 2. The story begins with Lightning at the height of his career, world famous and winner of several championships, but faster and modern cars appear. Mcqueen suffers an accident and everyone questions his stay in races, but he doesn't wanna give up and wants to defeat his new rival at all costs. McQueen gets a female trainer (Cruz) but finds out she's incompetent, so he will teach her to run for real. Then Mcqueen decides to look for the former trainer of Doc Hudson (Doc is mysteriously dead but his instructor is alive and well). Lightning did not accept that he would have no chance against Storm, to make matters worse, Cruz overcame him in all races. So he was completely unmotivated for the championship and in the middle of the race he gives up and asks to be replaced by Cruz.Incredibly Cruz surpasses all the cars (much more experienced than her) and win. McQueen becomes the ""new Doc Hudson"" getting the colors of Doc and Cruz is hired by Dinoco. Concluding: McQueen came to be seen as an incapable old man, leaving his legacy to Cruz, but remains world famous and loved by all.Lightning just had to accept that he is not the best in the world anymore. This was very sad and disappointing for me and for anyone who loved the first movie, but even so Pixar managed to make a acceptable end to the trilogy."
389,7,Deconstruction of the character Lightning McQueen,Totally holds up as a family movie.<br /><br />Brings a sense happiness to all audience members. Great to show the world keeps moving and that if we do too can make the best of it.
390,10,One of my favourites,"Lightning McQueen is back in the 3rd installment of the Cars franchise. This movie sees a huge array of newcomers take center stage and swarm the piston cup taking over the place of veteran racers in favor of new ""next generation"" racers that would become the competitions new roster as veteran racers become replaced one by one. "
391,8,An action packed adventure filled with development and humor,"As I sit here, in my mid 30's, raising two children, I find myself in an interesting place with regards my work/life balance. I'm a military helicopter pilot but it's getting harder to deploy for long periods at a time; my parental social life is worlds away from that of the young single junior pilots. In short, I'm not the speediest race car on the track anymore."
392,8,Great movie about becoming a parent and Female Empowerment,I want to see Mcquuen in the other film. I am sad cause Hudson Hornet died. That's tragedy. :( By the way This film must contain Mcquuen forever. We called that film Lightning Mcquuen in our childwood not Cars.
393,10,Good but Mcqueen can't go anywhere.,"Cars was the first Pixar movie that was... good. Not perfect and not very good, just good. And second movie was one of the biggest mess, maybe even it's the biggest. So it was kinda interesting, what will be Cars 3: good as Cars 1, bad as Cars 2 or great as many other Pixar movies."
394,6,"Good sequel, but still doesn't hold up as Pixar movie","Usually I'm pretty even-tempered when it comes to movies--they are for entertainment, so just sit back and enjoy, you know? Cars 3 has good moments and good jokes, sure. Unfortunately, it's also burdened by a old-school mentality that made me uncomfortable when I thiught about how it is primarily a kids movie.<br /><br />Too many small jokes or details instantly came off as racially tone-deaf. Just as bad, it felt like the writers didn't even realize the possibility of a misstep on their part.<br /><br />A better example is the backstory for one of the female characters. It easily could have been written in a more forward-thinking, healthy example for young girls. It would have created a more interesting character, too, instead of the usual weak girl who needs a big male role model to make something of her.<br /><br />I love watching Disney movies, and I was entertained by this one too. But I was intensely disappointed--no, disgusted--by the problems at Disney that were revealed in the Cars 3 storywriting."
395,1,Old and wrong,"How can a Next gen etc. Supersonic car like jackson storm competes with stock cars(nascar cars) thats ridiculous. Who thought this is a good idea to broke our beloved lightning mcqueen? It was made to hurt for people who like mcqueen, our childhood hero. The directors from original didn't made it maybe that's why. Whatever the case, who really said okay to mcqueen and other racers lose so desperately? Like he comes from the back of the track and becomes winner soo easily. What kinda car is this, if he ables to do that, can go that fast make him race with last gen cars. Btw he is already last gen next gen car which makes it more dumb. I'm so angry about this movie I don't even wanna write more, I will cut it short. Trying to show or giving the message that ""woman should do the things that men do too"" was not the place, you can't include that in here, not in this movie for god sake. The story was so boring even the some scenes are good because the concept was bullshoot nothing would matter anyway. It was so boring to watch. So disappointed with the third installement. Which makes it even worse is they put the story at a place that how can you make another movie on top of this? How can you save this franchise to going downward spiral. It's too late and it's your fault. Yes I'm talking to you, to whomever idea was to produce this and saying okay to this."
396,1,0/0 (From a Cars Lover),"I absolutely loved this movie. I give it a 10/10 because I could relate to it and I thought it was inspiring. I actually was able to foreshadow what was going to happen next. I could really relate to Cruz R. She had a similar story to mine except she wasn't a failure. I recommend this movie, it's great."
397,10,Great!,I'm disgusted at the reviews this was the best of the cars series and the fact that most people think this is worse than card 2 what on Earth are you on this is just mental and the reason they keep on making them is because it makes them a ridiculous amount of money.
398,7,Wow,That Yellow car doing nothing in this movie other than reminding Mcqueen that he is old. At the end he just give up the race and ask the trainer to finish the race for him. What the moral here?
