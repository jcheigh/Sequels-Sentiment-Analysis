0,7,Not as good as the previous movies but still solid,"There are two main things that happen in this film. One is the return of Po's father. The other is the bull-like creature, Kai, swinging his luminous daggers around and stealing people's chi. In terms of storyline it's simple, but all over the place at the same time. Kai is on his way to steal the chi of Po and the others to become even more powerful than he already is. After Po is reunited with his father, it is made clear to him that that only a chi master can defeat Kai; so Po must journey to the secret panda village in order to master chi before Kai comes to get him. It turns out Pandas were historically chi masters Eventually Kai finds where Po is and there's a battle."
1,8,awesomeness achieved,"Kung fu panda is a concept so ridiculous that we think to ourselves.. it is actually genius. Jack Black returns as the lovable Po, and shows us just why we missed him so much in the years we had to wait. These films always deal with acceptance and Kung Fu Panda 3 is no exception, with an added family element. I give praise for this for the simple reason that Bryan Cranston is AWESOME and really stands out in a movie that already has some brilliant stars, he was so funny and heartwarming as Po's biological father and makes a welcome addition to the cast."
2,6,From complexity to oversimplification: the journey is complete,"As a certain character once said, a James Bond movie is only as good as the villain. The same rule actually applies to just about any story with some kind of confrontation, with the best of such stories having villains which you even want to relate to."
3,10,A worthy inclusion to the series.,"While not really outdoing the first two films, Kung Fu Panda 3 has all the trappings of a fine third entry in an acclaimed film franchise. Some of the humor feels sillier compared to the prequels, but eventually gets better as the conflict is developed. The film is fast-paced and gripping as it delivers a successful blend of action and comedy, served with heartfelt father-son moments that continue to warm my heart. It also doesn't eschew the philosophy or the magical score that aided the first two films in a great way."
4,8,Kung Fu Panda 3 takes it's next step in another beautiful and funny story about the martial arts,"Time to go back into the world of DreamWorks animation. I had read more information about the company's corporate shakeup that not only involved several people replace and relocated, but it also involved the closing of the Northern California studios and the reduction of the output of feature films. It seemed like a formidable movie fiscally, until the release of last year's Home, which I mentioned that I didn't care for. I guess I wasn't the only one as the critical reviews were tepid, and the box office numbers were low (not a failure, but not even close to a hit). Has DreamWorks truly learned?"
5,9,Just as awesome as the first two. Skadoosh!,"There's a reason why the ""Kung Fu Panda"" franchise is one of the most successful of all-time, and I'd like to believe that that reason is because the writers and the creative talents behind it know how to solidly move the story forward, even with the same characters, they know how to make them evolve without losing the charm and the heart that made the first and the second film effective."
6,10,A Quality Family Film For All Families.,"In the Chinese Spirit Realm, Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) fights against the spirit warrior and collector Kai (J. K. Simmons) and has his chi stolen, but not before he warns Kai that Po (Jack Black), the Dragon Warrior, will stop him. Kai disregards this and returns to the mortal world. Meanwhile, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) announces his retirement and passes the role of teacher to Po. He discovers that teaching kung fu is hard, as the Furious Five members Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Monkey (Jackie Chan) are injured as a result. Po is demoralized as a teacher, but is advised by Master Shifu to be himself."
7,6,"Not bad, but not a grand installment or anything like that","Meh...It's alright but it's still the weakest in the trilogy in my opinion. The first one dealt with the build up of Po learning kung- fu and learning to become the Dragon Warrior. It's usually always intriguing to watch the underdog overcome obstacles. The second one dealt with Po putting his kung-fu skills to the test and is the most action packed one in the franchise so far. And revolved around getting over the past hurts and scars while trying to become a better person in the here and now. This one deals with Po finding his roots and origin. Like I said, it's a alright watch but it's actually quite forgettable. The action isn't all that memorable and the story just needed more meat to it. This would have been fine as a TV movie or 3 or 4 episodes as a Saturday morning show. It's a alright movie, that is actually quite watchable but I am not excited to see it again. The whole family dynamic aspect of this movie just wasn't all that fun to sit through. I give it props for trying something different and trying to bring in something more than just action. But I just couldn't gravitate towards it all that much."
8,,Fails To Replicate The Formula That Made Its Predecessors Instant Classics Right Away,"The third chapter in DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda series may have the effervescent wit, lighthearted flavour & exciting kung fu action of the earlier chapters but it lacks a compelling story, weighty character evolution & the awareness of where to draw the line for this latest entry fails to find the near-perfect balance between its genre elements, something its predecessors excelled at with relative ease."
9,10,Whoooaaaahhhh!!!!,"So being a huge fan of Kung Fu Panda, I may be a little biased, but Kung Fu Panda 3 delivers!!! I was so excited to the see the movie as I think this story line has some aspects of awesomeness!!! Jack Black leads and all star cast of actors that bring not only great animation, but also solid entertainment from start to finish. "
10,,So funny and amazing,"Not quite as good as Kung Fu Panda 2 since it does rehash some plot elements from Kung Fu Panda 2, but Kung Fu Panda 3 is still a solid entry in this kung fu fighting franchise."
11,8,Dragon Warrior Rising,This is my review of Kung-fu Panda 3 (Spoiler free)
12,8,Sublime animated picture.,The Good Stuff (in order of awesomeness) 
13,8,Funny and Gorgeously Animated,"Kung Fu Panda is yet another solid entry in the Kung Fu Panda film series. It should be noted that while it's subjective, my opinion is that Kung Fu Panda 3 is ever so slightly the weakest of the franchise, but that's not a knock on the film. Kung Fu Panda 3 is often funny, beautifully animated, and features great characters. This is another great animated film for the entire family, that will surely delight people of all ages."
14,7,"Not as good as the previous two films, still very colourful and entertaining","The first 'Kung Fu Panda' film is a solid film, colourful and fun with thrilling action and engaging characters. The second film is even better, darker and more emotional while never forgetting to be entertaining, with the best villain in the series."
15,9,Another great movie,"I went with my 14-year old son to watch Kung Fu Panda 3. We both loved it. It's definitely a feel-good movie. We've watched every Kung Fu Panda movie, and we are definitely fans. The cast is incredible! Jack Black is awesome as Po, as usual. We particularly enjoyed the music score (which nicely emphasized the emotional parts) and the artwork. I appreciated that there were morals woven into this movie, especially with regard to finding your true self, appreciation of what it means to be a family and the importance of family, and Po's learning about chi, the life force in all living things. This all added depth to Po's character. There were, of course, many funny moments in the movie that made us both laugh. At the end of the movie (and we always stay to the very end, reading all the credits), the artwork was particularly beautiful, where they took images from the movie and made it look like an ancient, Chinese watercolor. We left feeling very good about having spent time together at this movie!"
16,6,Bearable,"Kung Fu Panda 3 meets the minimum requirements in what fans of the first two films would expect: jokes about weight, Po's still struggling with handling Kung Fu (even though he became the ""dragon warrior"" at the end of the first film) and questions of how to determine what true family is. Sadly, the film itself lazily meets these expectations without providing much else for its fan base."
17,9,Feel the Thunder..again!,The third installment of the epic animated Kung fu Franchise is here.
18,3,Nothing more than a cash-in,"The third instalment of this animated franchise is by far the weakest. It lacks the fresh origin story of the original and well-developed expansion of the sequel to instead deliver a retread and mish-mash of previous themes and tropes. The action is broader, the villains more outlandishly supernatural, and sadly the silly humour is back and threatening to overwhelm. The ensemble cast remains fun, but the format is wearing thin by now and this feels like nothing more than a cash-in."
19,4,Kung Fu Panda 3,"Too many overweight panda jokes. Unlike the last two movies, they aren't funny."
20,10,Best of the series so far!,"I walked in Kung Fu Panda 3 with high expectations and they were met, and more! The other two KFP films are gold, and DreamWorks shows that they can top themselves every time with their characters and story lines. The fight scenes are amazing, the animation is top-notch, the characters are lovable and the voice cast is lively-what more can you want? This comedy had me and the audience laughing throughout the entire experience, and I don't have one complaint about this gem of a film! The 3-D effects are also worth the extra money- not the best I've ever seen from an animation, but pretty good. The score by Hans Zimmer is also beautiful, it's completely fitting for every scene. Get your kids, grab some 3-D glasses, get some popcorn and sodas and prepare for an awesome thrill ride."
21,5,Missing the Unique Spirit of the First Two,"The third film in Dreamworks enduring martial-arts-comedy franchise has managed the near impossibility of being simultaneously too predictable and too nonsensical. As a fan of the first two films, I often found myself defending them against detractors who claimed they were too prone to the narrative downfall of the ""deus-ex-machina"" (an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation). With Panda 3, that fight has become too much to wage. With story beats that are beyond lazy, we've abandoned the majestic fighting of the first 2, leaving us with nothing but childish humor and tons of unearned yet expected emotions. The story finds Po (played by the ever-perfect-for-the-role Black) trying to best a particularly tough new baddie, all the while discovering that his birth-dad is still alive and residing within a hidden community full of pandas. The new villain has a completely inexplicable backstory, but is mostly cool enough to make up for it, and the village of bears is plenty cute and funny. It even provides a respectable example of non-traditional parenting for modern times. Unfortunately, it's all surrounded by the tired ""be yourself"" morality that kid's films can't seem to get away from. Sure, the animation is as beautiful as ever, the score is cool, and there are a handful of genuine belly laughs. Unfortunately, the overpowering sense of laziness in the script drags down this otherwise successful family outing, a product of trying to squeeze too many stories from one small beginning. Kung Fu Panda 3 is missing the unique spirit of comedic fun and adventure that bolstered the previous two films to the top of the Dreamworks animation stable."
22,6,Good animation! Good 3D! Story wise same old! same old!,At start it felt like that I have entered that awesomely animated familiar environment of kungfun with our favourite panda. 
23,8,fun family franchise,"Oogway loses his battle with General Kai who steals his chi and escapes back to the mortal world. Shifu assigns Po to teach the Furious Five but he's horrible at it. His dumpling eating record is beaten by panda Li Shan who is looking for his lost son. They eventually realize that Po is his son. With Kai defeating every master and stealing their chi, only a master of chi could defeat him. Po struggles to master the art and Li Shan suggests returning to the panda's secret hideaway to learn. Shifu and the Furious Five are taken by Kai. Only Tigress manages to escape to warn Po."
24,10,Who are you?,"Well this is the third Panda movie where this central question leads to the climax. While this may seem rather repetitious, it bears repeating. Can the viewers actually take this message to heart and apply it to their own lives, we'll see wont we."
25,10,Every Bit as Good as the Others,"I enjoyed the first two Kung Fu Panda movies a lot more than I thought I would and I had a feeling that this one was going to be every bit as good as the others. I'm happy to say that I wasn't wrong. It's weird how well these films are able to combine humor and action while appealing to both children and adults. Plenty of other children's movies have been able to pull off the humor but the action has remained really well done throughout the entire series. Anyway, let's get to the plot."
26,7,Spirit Warrior,Round three. Fight!
27,9,Absolutely beautiful to look at,"Panda Po, despite being a bit of a numskull, has got quite good at kung fu, and Shifu retires, what with there being nothing further he can teach him other than how to control chi (which Shifu can't do anyway). This coincides with meg-chi thief Kai escaping from the spirit world, where he had been exiled by turtle spiritual master Oogway, and coming to steal chi from Po and everyone else in the panda village, where Po has been living having recently met Li, his birth father."
28,10,The most awesomeness of the awesome line of awesomeness filled awesome movies,"I loved the previous two movies. So when I went in to watch this, I had high expectations. By the end of the movie, I was in tears. I think I had not expected so much depth and....goodness from an animated feature film. "
29,7,Inspiration is... skadoosh!,"Too bad, just when you think you can retire and lead a peaceful afterlife, there's a villain you defeated half a millennium ago asking for a rematch, even Kung Fu Masters can't get a break! "
30,9,One of the Best Animated Movies Ever Made. In The Top 15.,"Whenever I go into a Dreamworks movie, I have very low expectations. I expected Kung Fu Panda 3 just to be another style and no substance movie. From the trailers, it looks average at best. But when you actually see the movie for yourself, you will be blown away. I can't say if Dreamworks is actually getting better for myself, but their last few films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 and Home have been better than what they have released in past years. I really think this is one of The Top 15 Best Animated Movies Ever Made. 15 or 14 would take the spot. Here is why."
31,9,Panda Team Has done it again !!,The 3rd part is as hilarious and awesome as the first two movies. Keeping up the story-line and interest in a 3rd movie is really difficult but the kudos to the whole team. 
32,6,"Funny, but probably the cheesiest of the trilogy.","There's some good news about Kung Fu Panda 3, and there's some bad news. The good news is that it's genuinely funny at times and the animation is stunning(perhaps as good as we've seen from Dreamworks) and the movie works well enough to be enjoyable. The bad news is, it could have been much more. When Po meets his biological dad for the first time, it should have been an emotional, touching moment; instead it was played for laughs. And instead of making the villain Kai a threat to respect, they just made him goofy. Plus, the ""Furious Five"" get barely any screen time and the new characters are hardly worth mentioning. Also, the main idea of this movie being about ""who am I"", is practically a rehash of the first two movies. Yet with all its faults, the movie is still enjoyable if you take it for what it is, a funny, but cheesy third movie in the Kung Fu Panda trilogy."
33,8,Great finale,"I really like the premise of this film. Po finally manages to meet his father and the other pandas. There is a great threat that defeats the old masters and is now coming for the pandas. Whatever is Po to do? He is way over his head but he finds a way. This film has everything we love from the Kung Fu Panda series - action, comedy and emotions."
34,8,"This time no Skadoosh, but Chi time.","Three successful films in an animation franchise is a great achievement and according to the production house, yet another 3 films are going to hit the screens in a decade of time. So if you are an animation fan, especially 'Kung Fu Panda' and Po's fan, brace yourself for the future treats. This film was amazing. After two wonderful adventures, now this story has calmed down a bit with simplicity. Visually, it was spectacular with all those fight sequences, but the story was quite dramatised with enough comedies and then the final battle to conclude the 3rd installment on a high note."
35,7,A fitting trilogy-capper,"It seems that whenever an animated film is a hit nowadays, a sequel is a given and the idea of a franchise gets the studio heads salivating. The quality tends to decline as the movies go on, with the exception of the Toy Story films, yet as long as the money piles up they'll just continue to churn them out - the increasingly unbearable Ice Age franchise being the worst offender. It was never in doubt that the hugely successful Kung Fu Panda (2008) would get a sequel, and when it came it was surprisingly good; a feast for the eyes backed by Gary Oldman's fantastic vocal performance and a serious undertone of genocide. It's taken 5 years for number 3 to finally arrive, so was a third instalment truly justified?"
36,8,"weakest of the trilogy, but still a decent one.",SPOILERS 
37,6,I feel that this one is too rushed,"I feel that this one is too rushed, so it seems very hasty to start, carry and turn. The new characters are particularly impressed. The new female panda blurs the relationship with the tiger. The whole scene is like entering the Wow documentary: the mist of Pandalia"
38,7,Wait,Wait who the hell is rating those movies now why is it so overrated
39,9,I Love Kung Fu Panda,"When Po's long-lost panda father suddenly reappears, the reunited duo travels to a secret panda paradise to meet scores of hilarious new panda characters. But when the supernatural villain Kai begins to sweep across China defeating all the kung fu masters, Po must do the impossible-learn to train a village full of his fun-loving, clumsy brethren to become the ultimate band of Kung Fu Pandas. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a 2016 3D American-Chinese computer-animated action comedy martial arts film, produced by DreamWorks Animation and Oriental DreamWorks, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It was directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni. The film was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, produced by Melissa Cobb, and executive produced by Guillermo del Toro. It is a sequel to the 2011 film Kung Fu Panda 2 and the third installment in the Kung Fu Panda franchise. I love KUNG FU PANDA"
40,4,Deceiving..Simply,"Not as good as the previous movies, what a let down."
41,8,Another Legend of Awesomeness,"SKADOOSH! A word that seems to hold no meaning for many was the trademark word for an animated film franchise that's beloved by many. Kung-Fu Panda is a tale about Po the clumsy, food loving panda who also is a master of martial arts. Over the last eight years, Po and his fellow animal fighters have tackled one overlord after another to save China. And this weekend yet another villain rears it's anthropomorphic head to face our heroes. However can a third adventure maintain the fun its predecessors have or does it flop like so many sequels? "
42,8,The first two was good,"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a darker and scarier follow-up to the 2008 original, adding horrific layers of background and culminating with a shocking reveal of parental identity. Its themes of tenacity and self-knowledge are brought to gratifying fulfillment while maintaining the saga's charming lightness of touch. Emotionally, emotionally, and artistically, it is as amply proportioned as its lovable warrior hero."
43,,A perfect trilogy..,Most sequels are either a boom or a bust. But after seeing Kung Fu Panda 2 I know which direction they were heading towards and seems like I was right. Kung Fu Panda 3 has some resued forms of humor but was still a worth seuqel notheless.
44,7,Entertaining and funny but flat story,"After the fantastic first movie where Po is a classic hero after being a loser, where the villain has his own story and where the others play a role making Po the character he is, came a second movie with a dark, deep and personal story greatly told, and now we have just an excuse to make Po even more bada** fighting a villain nobody cares for and who came out of nowhere. This makes me sad because it was getting more ""mature"". But I understand it is a kids movie, so it's still entertaining and pleasant to watch, and I'm pretty sure the kids love this movie."
45,8,The Next Great Franchise is Upon Us! Skudoosh!!,"So far this film completes a very fun and very solidly made franchise that will go nicely with my Kung Fu Panda collection. DreamWorks really impressed me with this one. Proving that Shrek the Third was just a hiccup (no pun intended). And I love it when I struggle to say which film is the best out of the franchise, that means they made a great franchise. One thing that DreamWorks knows how to do is keep you guessing. People always assume the film is going to do badly but actually ends up hitting a home run, this is no exception. If DreamWorks keeps this up, they can overrun Pixar as they are going through a weak time right now with the exception of Inside Out. DreamWorks continues to impress with year after year of good to great films. Heck I think Home is better then Cars 2. Now what stands out about the film itself is it isn't afraid to take chances. And more times then not actually ends up paying off. The voice talent is well, talented. Each character whether its returning ones or new ones each of them does a marvelous job. Bryan Cranston, Kate Hudson, and especially J.K. Simmons who literally blends into the character. I couldn't imagine him talking behind the microphone because he didn't use his actual voice rather made the character his. The negatives I have is that it doesn't spend time with the characters we've come to enjoy. Tigress even though she was in it more then the other Furious Fives, but I still would like to see her in action more then they did. They completely shun the other characters like Viper, Mantis, Crane, and Monkey. They sort of pushed them aside and made room for the newer characters. Which is fine, but after coming to know and love these characters especially Tigress, I would liked to have seen more from them. Also, the story seems overdone especially the villain. Even though I like J.K. Simmons as the character, the character himself is just Ti Lung all over again (sorry if I misspelled his name). And is the third time a villain has underestimated Po with the same question, ""Is he the one destined to stop me?"" Or something along those lines. But despite those mistakes the film makes up in shire courage. DreamWorks could have easily been lazy and made this another Shrek the Third, but thank heavens it wasn't that. I had a lot of fun watching this as a full grown adult, so kids should have a blast with this film. Like in DreamWorks fashion this is a film worthy of the entire family and you deserve it so you can get the bad taste of Norm of the North out of your mouths. This is how animated film are meant to be. DreamWorks proves they are still one of the best in the business, maybe the best right now. Check it out, you will regret it if you don't. Now to grade: Animation: A+ Characters: A Voice Acting: A Story: B+ Risk Value: A+ Music: A- (Best score by Hans Zimmer in a long time.) Overall: A"
46,5,Fun but all to familiar.,"'Kung Fu Panda 3' is, of course, the newest chapter in the Panda trilogy. This one, much like the others, plays off of its predecessors. With 'Kung Fu Panda 3' the Dragon Warrior finally meets his father. His real father for that matter. This naturally throws off the mojo of everyone around him. Especially his goose step father....thing. Aside from this singular plot point this film is nearly identical in structure to its predecessors. Po is asked to accomplish a seemingly impossible task with in a paper thin time frame and as he is going about this he (for some reason) has a sort of identity crisis. And, just as the story needs him to, he over comes right on time."
47,,"Fast-paced, colorful, great 3D effects ...","This fun movie starts at a brisk pace and continues till the end ... kind of like it's catering to an ADHD crowd. There's a constant flow rolling, tumbling, flying, running and crashing. And if that's not enough, at several points in the movie, the screen actually splits into 3 parts with things happening in each pane. "
48,7,The soul,The soul
49,8,The next chapter of the furious five,"In the third installment of the awesome Kung fu panda series, a new enemy Kai escapes the spirit realm by stealing the chi of the Kung fu masters as way of returning to the mortal world. Meanwhile mister shifu is considering retirement and passes on the teachings of Kung fu to po. While the first teaching turns into a disaster but pro ends up being reunited with his biological father li at a dumpling contest. Pro also gets the chance to also meet the pandas at the village where they are living. What makes pop a great character is now he matured in the dragon warrio that he was meant to be and brings about his Kung fun journey full circle. It also reveals the past of master ooguay as well."
50,5,Kung Fu Panda 3,"The first two films are pretty much the same quality, good fun for the kids and not bad for the grownups, I had the feeling that the third film in the trilogy would be exactly the same, but I was prepared for that. Basically, in the spirit realm, elderly tortoise Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) fights against his old comrade turned adversary, spirit warrior yak Kai (J.K. Simmons), who has defeated all the other kung fu masters in the realm and taken their chi. Kai traps Oogway and takes his chi but is warned that he will be stopped by the Dragon Warrior, he takes this as a challenge and returns the mortal realm. Meanwhile, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) announces his retirement from teaching and passes the role of teacher to the Dragon Warrior, Po (Jack Black), who realises that teaching kung fu is not as easy and injures the Furious Five. Po feels crushed with his failure, but Shifu advises Po that instead of trying to be like him, he should try to be himself. Po returns home where he meets a panda, Li Shan (Bryan Cranston), who turns out to be his long-lost biological father. They quickly bond with each other, much to the jealousy of Po's adoptive father Mr. Ping (James Hong). After introducing Li to Shifu and his friends, the Valley of Peace is invaded by an army of jade zombies, or ""jombies"", which Kai has created from the chi of past kung fu masters. After defending the valley from these creatures, Po and the Five learns through research that Oogway and Kai were once brothers-in-arms and close friends. After Oogway was injured in battle, Kai carried him to a village of pandas who healed him with their mastery of chi. The pandas taught Oogway how to utilise chi to help others. However, Kai wanted the power for himself and tried to steal the chi from the pandas, forcing Oogway to banish him to the spirit realm by ending his life. To defeat Kai, Po must learn to master the use of chi himself. Li offers to teach him by taking him to his secret panda village. While Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to deal with Kai, Mr. Ping stows away to try and drive a wedge between Po and Li. Although Po is eager to learn chi, Li tells him he must first learn the relaxed life of a panda in the village. Kai takes the chi of every kung fu master in China, including Shifu and the Furious Five, except Tigress (Angelina Jolie), who escapes the subsequent destruction of the Jade Palace. She finds Po and the other pandas to warn them that Kai is coming. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po begs Li to teach him the secret chi technique, Li confesses that he lied about knowing it, fear he would lose his son again. Heartbroken and enraged, Po walks away and isolates himself to train vigorously and prepare to fight Kai. Mr. Ping realises that Po has become happier with his biological father in his life, so he tells Li that Po being mad at him is part of being a parent, but that Po will forgive him. Ping then tells him that Po will need them both to stop Kai. Li goes back to Po and says the pandas will help him fight Kai and his army. Realising what had previously made him fail as a teacher, Po agrees and teaches them to use their everyday activities as kung fu skills. Kai arrives and sends his minions to capture Po, while the pandas, Ping, and Tigress fight them, distracting Kai. They defeat the jombie army, but when Po tries to use his signature Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai to send him back to the spirit realm, Kai reveals that it only works on mortals, not spirit warriors. Kai and Po fight each other, until eventually Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold on himself while gripping Kai around the neck, transporting them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, and Kai subdues Po and begins to steal his chi. Using what they learned from Po, his friends and family use their chi to empower him. Po breaks free and harnesses their chi to create a giant dragon figure and quickly overpowers Kai. After taunting Kai, Po then gives him the power which overwhelms him, destroying him and restoring all the fallen masters and the Five to normal. In an ethereal golden pond, Oogway appears to Po and informs him that his journey as the Dragon Warrior is complete, he is declared to be his successor. Po chooses to return to the mortal world, and he and his extended family all return to the valley, where they continue practicing kung fu and chi. Also starring Jackie Chan as Monkey, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Lucy Liu as Viper, David Cross as Crane, Kate Hudson as Mei Mei, Wayne Knight as Big Fun / Hom-Lee, Al Roker as Sum, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc, Blue Peter's Radzi Chinyanganya as Mi, Pax Jolie-Pitt as Yoo, Knox Jolie-Pitt as Ku Ku, Zahara Jolie-Pitt as Meng Meng, and Shiloh Jolie-Pitt as Shuai Shuai. Black remains likeable as the title character, Simmons is suited to voicing the big villain, and the supporting cast also do well. As I expected, the quality of the story, the animation and everything else was just the same as before, but there is nothing wrong with that, it was a fun family animated comedy adventure. Worth watching!"
51,9,Almost as good as the original,"The story has more then single level. And while all planes are simple by themselves, they give a nice aftertaste. Which is rare for kid movie."
52,4,Part 3,It is part 3 of an animated film that should be enough to tell you the level of quality you shall see. It has the cash in quality of any animated part 3 or direct-to-DVD product out there. There is no story or pacing. The voice cast of the originals show up for two or three lines and then vanish simply to obey their contracts. It is one of the most overly used story lines in the genre and one just simply has to roll with the punches hoping your children laugh. It is a cash in and you are watching it for your children or something in that regard. Any other reason other than that leaves to me ask then why are you watching this?
53,6,Decent,It was a decent movie but previous movies were much much better.
54,8,About as good as I could expect from a third installment.,"Don't set you expectations too high for a third installment, in any series or franchise. It was a given this movie would borrow heavily from the first two, wouldn't be as deep in character development (most of the main characters are mostly already defined), and the film would probably follow the same overall theme of the first two. I went in expecting this much, and is pretty much the only reason I didn't rate the movie higher. I really enjoyed it."
55,8,Twizard Rating: 76,"Everything happens so fast in this new Kung Fu Panda installment, just like it did for the previous two. Though hardly necessary, the people seem to respond well to continuing this franchise, so here it is."
56,2,Greatly disappointed,"I am a great fan of this franchise and I am very disappointed with this part. This movie had glimpses but it was not the complete movie like the last two. The beginning lasted till the end, and the end, ended abruptly where Po and rest of the panda's master the forgotten technique and defeat the most powerful Kai in a breath. "
57,9,Solid Trilogy,"No sure how they can make 3 consecutive marvelous movies like these but they did. Not even Toy Story is on the same level because Toy Story 2 was just an okay movie, Toy story 3 had good moments that's about it. And the Lion King movies...well lets say they should have stopped at 1. Shrek is nothing."
58,5,"Not as clever or funny as the other two, but still good","Kung Fu Panda 3 is definitely my least favourite in the trilogy, it has the least interesting villain and the film's characters a bit less ingenious. It still gets praise for the action sequences and animation but I feel like the stakes are lower and it's lost a bit of heart that made the original so great, as well as this I just didn't find the jokes or humour as funny as in the first one, more cringe inducing than anything else in the delivery of some."
59,9,A very epic and satisfying conclusion.,"There are two animation studios out there that know how to make their sequels better than the original movie. The first one is notably Pixar and the second in my opinion is DreamWorks. Most of the sequels they have done in their franchises notable their second movies have stunned me by how they improved upon their predecessors. ""Kung Fu Panda"" was no exception. The second film not only stepped up the comedy and action, but really succeeded in its drama. So when they announced a third movie, I was both eagerly excited and yet very nervous due to having bad memories of ""Shrek the Third."" I went in the feeling the same and left very satisfied. ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is easily the best out of the franchise as it does contain all of the elements that made the second film fantastic and builds to make a very satisfying conclusion to the series."
60,6,No match for the predecessors.,"Ambivalence reloaded ! The innocent humor, the charm of all the characters continues to impress, 10/10 for that ! The philosophical nerve seems lost except when first Shifu and then Po exemplify 'I ence reloaded ! The innocence, splendid humor and the charm of the characters, even the new Pandas, continues, 10/10 for that ! Animation - as splendid as ever The philosophical nerve seems to be gradually dwindling, there were only two times I felt it - once when both Shifu and Po practice 'I am trying to turn you into YOU' and when Master Oogway reveals that he chose Po as he had seen the past and through the future. The villain, Kai, fails to make a mark, seems more like a backstreet goon. The plot itself is cliched and handled hastily, for example, how can accomplished masters like Ox, Croc. make a mistake of directly engaging Kai and losing their Chi ? The end(everyone 'donating' their Chi, the Spirit Well etc.) is unbecoming, especially, when this movie is desperately attempting to resemble the first part. Even Hans Zimmer disappoints - no welcome additions to the earlier classics !"
61,4,Very Poor and Unnecessary Sequel,"Personally, I don't understand how Kung Fu Panda 3 has a higher IMDb rating than the first or second films. Maybe as more people rate it, that number will drop but don't take it as representing the quality of the film. "
62,1,Stale Popcorn,"Aside from decent graphics, this ""movie"" is nothing more than a recycled, old, stale storyline. It is the same story as ""Finding Nemo"" and every other ""oh my son"" flick made in the last fifty years. Father loses boy, boy finds father. Journey in between with perils, hazards, and a strong woman to play off of. In this one though, there are ridiculous fight scenes reminiscent of 1970's martial arts films that ripped off Bruce Lee (this is how, of course we get Kung Fu). "
63,9,This movie rocks.,(SPOILER ALERT)
64,6,The best of the movies so far...,"I must start by stating that ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is every bit as good as the previous two movies, and then some..."
65,5,Some funny moments but the first movie was better! 5/10,"Review: After the great first movie in this franchise, I wasn't that impressed with the second movie but this movie was slightly better. It still lacked the humour and originality of the first film and I did find Po (Jack Black) quite annoying in parts but it's still a watchable movie, especially if you watch it with kids. I liked the relationship between Po and his father and the showdown at the end was half decent but the animation wasn't in the same league as Pixar, and after 3 movies, Po still isn't taking his ""Kung Fu Master"" skills that seriously. The different Pandas brought a new flavour to the film, and I did find the little ones cute but the whole franchise seems to have hit a dead end. The main problem that I found with the film is that Po is still saying and doing silly things, whilst mastering an art form which can save the village, against the evil bull looking character, Kai (J.K.Simmons), so it was a bit of a weird mixture. The whole Chi concept wasn't bad but I was just hoping for more laughter throughout the film. Average!"
66,7,An exuberant and delightful sequel.,"I rate the original Kung Fu Panda so highly it comfortably makes my top five animated movies of all time. Yes, of all time. And the second one, widely disregarded by most critics, is not that far behind it in my eyes. Well this trilogy-closer proves the law of diminishing returns to be true by continuing the slight downward trend of the series, yet it still kicks, punches and rib tickles its way to being an entertaining experience for all ages. Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger unleash everything including the comedic kitchen sink in an attempt to garner laughs, littering this follow-up with inventive visual gags, hilarious dialogue (often helped by Jack Black's endearing delivery) and cheeky in-house references. The comedy doesn't always land without a hitch but it is of a high enough standard that the few damp squibs float by without much notice, and they've also struck a nice balance between obvious jokes for the kiddies and subtler quips for the adults. Where there's a noticeable dip in quality, however, is with the martial arts sequences; the fights lacking the ingenuity and complexity of the previous volumes, despite being passionately directed and beautifully realised. A venture into the spiritual realm allows the gorgeous animation to thrive even more than normal, though it's a shame the cut-and-paste narrative didn't get the same level of attention from those operating behind the scenes. This is undoubtedly Black's show and his voice work as the bumbling Po is outstanding yet again. Elsewhere in the gigantic ensemble cast, newcomer Kate Hudson makes the biggest impression with her hysterical delivery as the confident ribbon-dancing Panda, Mei Mei. Although it may have lost the spark of brilliance existing in the first instalment, KFP3 is nevertheless an exuberant and delightful adventure."
67,7,I enjoyed the film; about as much as the last installment.,'KUNG FU PANDA 3': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)
68,7,Kung Fu Panda 3 is another enjoyable outing from DreamWorks Animation,"I hadn't seen the previous Kung Fu Panda movies for a while so watching this helped me get a little reacquainted with the story and characters. In this one Po's actual dad comes back. Things seem to go well for them but, as one would expect, there's some trouble ahead...There were both touching and funny moments throughout and it was quite fun seeing it all put together. Po's identity goes into play here and when we learn some of his family story, it's quite something to be inspired by. Kudos to DreamWorks Animation for the work they did and do in many of their films. And, as always, I like to recognize many of the famous voices that got involved. So on that note, I recommend Kung Fu Panda 3."
69,6,Not even close to the 2nd or even 1st one,"The story is identical to the second one, they just used fewer jokes. Again its about Po needing to figure out who he really is and that all his powers come from within and from his friends. While the first and second movies were also great for adults, this one is only for children. Even for adults who like most animation movies this movie just feels stupid. They should have stopped after the second one and let the franchise die with dignity."
70,9,"Amazing Visuals, Beautiful Soundtrack, Above Average Movie",Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third installment of the (hopefully) six-part Kung Fu Panda series. 
71,3,kids cartoon,"the animation is beautiful, seriously, some of it looks real; the ground, grass, cherry blossoms, hairs on the characters ... the list goes on, truly an awesome job on the animation. the plot was great, if I had read a short plot of this movie I would have said 'Yes I want to see this' I Loved the first two movies so much that I contemplated getting a kung fu panda tattoo, I love China and everything about it; it's history, culture, guilin mountains, obviously cherry blossoms even fiction about China, one of my favorite books is 'bridge of birds' and I love james hong's voice, he's in the top 4; james earl jones, morgan freeman, jen taylor and james hong. but everything else about the movie I didn't like, the joke writers were juvenile and story writers were pedestrian. 3 out of 10."
72,6,"Not as good as the second, but still enjoyable","So, I've been waiting for this movie since I saw the second in 2011. I figured that this one wouldn't compare to that one, but I knew I'd be content if I just enjoyed it more than the first. I did."
73,10,Could be my favorite Panda movie of the franchise.,"SOooo.. we went and saw Kung Fu Panda 3. It was AWESOME. It could very well be my favorite in the Panda series. The villain was REALLY well animated and his design ROCKED. The art direction was simply stunning and the movie was the perfect balance of thrilling kung fu action and silly comedy. Ever time it felt like the tone could be getting too serious and dark,, it would lighten right back up again and make you laugh - not in a trite way, but in a way that felt really suited to the tone of the Panda movies. My 4 year old daughter loved it and even my son, at 17 mos old, who kept getting tired of sitting still, would continually get pulled back into the movie by the awesome action. After the movie, the kids WERE Kung fu pandas for quite a while, it was adorable. GO SEE this movie!! I am sure we will see it again. I also LOVED the use of the Imagine Dragon's song ""I'm so sorry"" as Kai's theme.. its totally baddass and PERFECT for a Kung fu villain. loved it. go see it."
74,6,Decent and fun addition to the series,"The second installment tackled mainly the story of Po, particularly about his origin and what happened to his parents. This is another journey in ""getting to know oneself"" story-line, and in this third installment, a similar story-line was told. Albeit similar, it was rather told in another level of perspective, a supposedly more profound perspective. More profound in a sense that the knowledge of oneself reaches a certain threshold such that the responsibility to share it with others comes in at a ripe time and becomes another level of journey in ""getting to know oneself"". Then, it becomes pedagogical, and the film's story shows us a compelling idea of the true meaning of teaching. Teaching in a sense that you transform others, not to become like the teacher, but to become like themselves with their own potentials realized. "
75,7,Kung Fu Panda 3 wasn't good.,"Nothing in this movie is funny at all. Po is a character, who was amazing, who makes dumb ""jokes"" throughout the whole movie. The character development is weak and the plot should have been more serious. The ""comedy"" in this film ruins the whole movie. The other movies in this series are better than this."
76,8,I heard some Kung Fun Masters can win a battle just with a dramatic entrance.,"Dreamworks has brought us another installment to the awesome Kung Fu Panda series, but this time they have made it in conjunction with the Chinese government who co-funded it. The vibrant visuals, whimsical world, and colorful characters that define this series are once again at play and as strong as ever, but with a script that(while competent) is below the standard of the first two."
77,7,"The Worst of the Trilogy, but Still Plenty of Fun","I was super excited to see this movie. Of all the upcoming 2016 movies, this was at the top of my list of to-watch movies. Having loved the first two, I wanted to make sure that I caught this one in theaters. While it's not phenomenal, nor is it as good as the others, it's still a very fun watch. "
78,7,"Okay, need more of furious 5 & less panda","Not as good as the first but definitely better than the sequel. Storyline is okay (simple, straight to the point - no twist or gasp moments), lack in action for kung fu panda movie standard so far. Lacking the magic from the first movie, maybe because it features less actions and more comedic? Idk. One thing for sure this needs more of the furious 5. Sensei only appeared in ridiculously short period of time despite being the popular character from this universe. Glad that po's adopted dad received more screening time & emotional engagements. Great sound scores and animation as always though compared to the previous movies, this one lacks colours (i mean first & second movie consist of explosion of amzing eye catching colour, this more like one tone). Witherway, highly recommended."
79,7,"See ""Kung Fu Panda 3"". The chi is strong with this one.","A good film franchise shows the audience something new with each successive film, but also respects, relates to and builds upon its predecessors. By that definition, the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies make up a very good film franchise – with the critical and audience ratings, and box office numbers, to back up that assessment. Each of these movies is designed to stand alone (and does), but before reviewing ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" (PG, 1:35), it seems like a good idea to take a look back at how these films got us here."
80,8,Was it worth the wait?,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is directed by Alesandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh. The movie stars Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, J.K. Simmons, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and many more great actors and actresses. First off, when I heard the were actually doing a third one, I was a little worried because it's been so long since the second one. In the end my worries were completely wrong and Kung Fu Panda 3 was great. The animation, acting, soundtrack was amazing and it felt great to be back in this world. Jack Black as Po is always great but this movie had a great villain also. Having J.K. Simmons as the villain was just fantastic. The theme for the villain was just as great as he was. The animation was Fantastic, best animation in the series yet. The only problems I had with the movie was that once the movie started, you know where it's going and how's it going to end but you can still have fun with the movie. Overall Kung Fu Panda 3 was another movie in this series. The animation, actions, and everything was great as before. It didn't bring anything new to the table but you can still have a lot of fun with it."
81,7,"Impressive visual, light humor and delightful character, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a weighty fun for all.","Nowadays movies incorporate 3D for simple gimmick and they are not often used to create a unique style of their own like ""Kung Fu Panda 3"". It's a mix between cool motion, nice setting and intricate painting-like visual which dance smoothly on the big screen. The story is pretty straightforward with the usual panda shenanigans, but it holds up nicely and surprisingly has both good villain and family value."
82,7,"Has a lot of heart and great action, but the emphasis on humor takes away much of its potential","Kung Fu Panda 3 is a good animated film, but it isn't quite up to the standards of the past two films. While the animation is gorgeous and it has a lot of interesting premises, it also suffers from becoming too distracted with humour."
83,6,Kung Fu Blanda,"It's official. ""Madagascar"" is the only perfect Dreamworks trilogy. How this got an 80% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me. It's not completely horrible, but it's not amazing either. It's just ok. It just exists. It's ""meh."" The plot is pretty much ""Madagascar 2"" all over again. In fact, it's pretty much every Dreamworks sequel with a ""2"" in the title all over again. Main character meets long lost parents. Whoop de doo. Dreamworks has only done this in ""Shrek 2,"" ""Madagascar 2"", and ""How to Train Your Dragon 2."" Think of a better plot for sequels, Dreamworks. There's not much originality here. There's even a scene after Po first meets his dad where they fanboy over all the ancient Kung fu artifacts (you know, like how Po did in the first one.) Even some of the dialogue is rehashed word for word in this scene. Also, some scenes from earlier in the film are later reused again, literally exactly the same. Lazy!!! The ending also feels ripped from the last Harry Potter. The villain steals the souls of the other Kung fu masters in order to become immortal . (Horcruxes.) There's more similarities but spoilers so...but trust me, if you've seen Harry Potter 7, you've seen this. There are some positives with the animation though. It's incredibly detailed. Close ups of the pandas' arms deserve to be freeze-framed so you can appreciate every individual arm hair. But plot wise, and even humor wise, this plot had nothing new to offer. Stay home and watch the first movie, and every Dreamworks sequel with a ""2"" in it. You'll pretty much be getting this anyway.<br /><br />Grade: C+. 6/10. 2.5/5 stars"
84,6,More Kung Fu fighting,"Jack Black is back voicing Po, the happy go lucky panda who is content to be the Dragon Warrior and come to save the village when required."
85,7,And again,"You know for a third part this is pretty decent. But it's still beginning to lose its attraction. Or probably will, who knows what they will come up with in part 4? Jack Black seems to enjoy himself, Shi-Fu (aka Jackie Chan) and the rest are having the time of their life voicing those animated animals and their adventures."
86,,A funny and entertaining adventure with a positive message,This film tells the story of Po the panda being chosen to be the teacher of Kung Fu. He also becomes the dragon warrior and tries hard to save the day despite his apparent shortcomings.
87,8,"What it lacks in dramatic heft, it makes up for with visual splendor.","If I wasn't such a fan of the 'Kung Fu Panda' franchise, I would only give its third installment a 7/10. Anyone who has enjoyed the past films will feel right at home with this one."
88,6,Po reunites with his father and takes on a special mission.,"This is the third installment of the KUNG FU PANDA franchise. Beautifully filmed and directed by Alessandro Caloni and Jennifer Yuh. Brilliant coloring in a stunning and very affecting Asian style. And of course, Jack Black is back as the dumpling craving Po, who had to go against tough odds to become a Dragon Warrior. The story is written by Jonathan Aiebel and Glenn Berger, and is sure to please the whole family from toddler to grandparents(who probably are in charge of the primary viewers of this fun fest)."
89,8,Kung Fu Panda 3: A Roaring Good Time,"Get ready to return to the wonderful world of Po and the Furious Five in Kung Fu Panda 3! This movie brings back all the charm, humor, and heart that made the first two movies so beloved, while also introducing some new characters and exploring some deeper themes."
90,8,The Kung Fu Panda Series:Part 3.,"Despite having heard about them for years,I have never got round to seeing any of the movies in the Kung Fu Panda series.During the last week of Easter,a friend asked if there were any good family movies out that she and her kids would enjoy.Taking a look at the family flicks that had recently arrived,I was happy to spot that the third Panda title had just come out,which led to me getting ready to see a panda perform kung –Fu for the first time."
91,7,"Formulaic, but it's got heart to spare","Aside from a few new side characters, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" doesn't offer up anything game-changing; nothing that diverts from proved success. And depending on what you're looking for, that can either be a positive or a negative. It's a positive for me."
92,7,A Tale of My Two Dads,At least it was three times better than Shrek the Thirdeven though that had a more clever title.
93,6,Not upto the mark set by it's predecessors,"The movie starts out good. It has a nice build up at first but this build up never leads to a climax. In each movie, Po has mastered or at least realized and actualized an aspect of kung fu. The aspect chosen for this movie had no build up. Po throughout the movie learns an integral skill of kung fu and the whole process is beautifully depicted but in the end the climax is rather sudden and a little too-good-to-be-true. The movie has a great villain which just keeps on improving with each movie. The character of the villain is explored in depth but I felt similar justice was not done to the Furious Five, Shifu or Po. The movie seemed a little rushed in the end which could have been converted into a whole other movie."
94,7,Po's journey continues,"One of the things I appreciate about the Kung Fu Panda movies is that the main character is on a continuing journey. Some movie sequels just more-or-less reset their characters for every movie, but Po went from bumbling nobody to hero in the first, then continued and improved as hero in the second, and reaches a new level in 3; it's clear if they keep making movies he will wind up being the grand old master (at which point he'll need to find a bumbler of his own to train."
95,7,Not a bad chapter in the Kung Fu Panda trilogy.,"This is Dreamworks' second animated sequel to ""Kung Fu Panda,"" a story about noodle-shop worker-turned Dragon Warrior Po Ping, a giant panda. He reunites with his biological father, Li, and joins his panda family in a secret, luscious valley beyond the mountains. He must train the pandas to help China defeat supernatural villain Kai, whose goal is to defeat all the Kung Fu masters and gain an unmatched superpower."
96,10,Must watch all three,I would rate this better then shawsank redempton.
97,8,Fun,"Since I was fat during my school years, this animation gave me motivation. Panda's third animation. The voiceovers were great. The subject was not bad either. Po is always fun to watch."
98,3,Don't judge a sequel by its first part.,I was hoping for a lot and expected a lot and above all a lot of fantasizing but unfortunately we arrived at the same point as at the beginning of the movies.<br /><br />it's practically the first part again just this time it makes less sense because of what we have experienced so far so many characters are suffering from flanderization.<br /><br />Almost all characters have become more stupid and can not notice the simplest connections and it does not matter if that is just funny it's just not tolerable for this movie.<br /><br />But what I find most sad is this film has neither heart nor mind.
99,8,Lovers Of The First Two Should Enjoy This Third Installment,"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" does not deliver any surprises to anyone who saw the first two films. But it is still a high quality film."
100,7,The Vidiot Reviews...,Kung Fu Panda 3
101,3,Good enough,"Paw is the dragon warrior and he had saved China. So this time he has to become a teacher. Plus, as the second movie had suggested, he has to find his real family. The movie is not as good as the previous two had been. It's hardly funny and the story seems to have been copy paste from the first one. Though the family reunion seemed promising, it failed to entertain. Actually the conflict between the two dads, the goose and the panda, was more interesting than the whole remaking the panda in Paw. The actions scenes were okay, not too much thankfully, and they started from the second half, which made the first half kind of boring to some point. So, 3 out of 10, because I was really looking forward for this movie and it didn't live up to its prequels."
102,9,An enjoyable prequel to the Kung Fu Panda series,"I can recall seeing the first Kung Fu Panda movie a few years ago yet I haven't seen the second one as I passed on that,but yesterday my brother,my mom and myself all went to see this in 3D yesterday....so was it worth the wait?"
103,7,Beautiful but Narratively Stuck in Suspended Animation,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third in a franchise that is said to ultimately comprise of six films. In the first one, our protagonist Po (Black) realizes his potential as the Dragon Warrior. In the second, Po comes to understand his mysterious past and finds inner peace. In this movie, Po comes to understand what Chi is and teaches kung fu to a village of pandas seemingly in one afternoon. What is Po going to do next; become the hero of colonial China?"
104,10,Absurdly Spectacular,The marketing led to me to believe that this would be sub-par to the first two - a quick buck off a franchise name.
105,5,Great,"I just got back from watching the movie in theaters and it was pretty good (way better than I thought it would be) I liked the story line, and most of the characters. The one I didn't like, and most people would agree, is Mei Mei (lol) Any one else think she's creepy? I actually didn't think they needed another movie, but it introduced a lot of Po's background. To tell the truth I thought a lot of it was stupid (I think they meant to make it that way) Well I need a last line so, I give this movie a 5 out of 10 because its not the best movie I've seen (not the worst I've seen either) Great movie for the kids, an all-around funny movie :)"
106,6,Fun Sequel for all to watch,"The First Kung Fu Panda was a great little film, that spawned couple of sequels and TV shows. This is the second official cinema release sequel to that film, and it starts of exactly the same way as the its predecessors with Po imaging great battles and playing with his action figures. The story in this third installment is arguable the weakest one, even can go and say that it contradicts the entire second film. Kung Fu Panda 3 revolves around Po learning how to be a panda again. It is full of his typical jokes and misunderstandings and his clumsiness. However the film does lack an interesting villain and a strong story."
107,5,Really nice villan,"The villain of this cartoon is the most disturbing and powerful of the saga and this is very nice, for the rest, however, the cartoon is ugly and not too inspired, really too inferior to its predecessors."
108,7,Po stays lovable yet again,"Three installments in, the novelty of Jack Black voicing a clumsy, dopey and constantly awe-stricken warrior panda who overcomes all his obvious deficiencies has worn thin. That's a fact of any franchise that leans on the same conceit over and over. Still, there's something eternally lovable about Po the ""Dragon Warrior"" that makes ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" more enjoyable (or easier to stomach) than most of its animation franchise contemporaries."
109,7,Good but not great,The end of the Kung Fu Panda trilogy - though whether or not it stays a trilogy is quite another matter - where Po once again has to learn new skills and unlock old secrets of kung fu in order to face yet another foe even more powerful than the ones before.
110,7,Another Great Sequel!,"I don't know how they do it. Shouldn't sequels be awful? At least that is the rule of thumb but they somehow gave us another funny film with great visuals and action. I love the action, it just looks so good. Anyway, this film is about Po finding his father and having to battle a new boss villain. The villain is a grandmaster and the fight scenes are great, except for the final battle; which was lacking on the fist-to-fist kind of stuff but it is all good, this is just an animated eye-candy kind of flick. The comedy wasn't laugh out loud funny but more of an ""awwwww, look at that little cute thing, and that cute thing! And that even cuter thing!"" If you liked the other Panda movies you'll like this one. I'm giving it a 7.5 out of 10."
111,6,"A fun and entertening film, but so far, the franchise has shown itself to be an arc that is never completed and is repeated endlessly","In 2008, Dreamworks presented us with the first part of the adventures of the panda Po, a clumsy bear that would be the reincarnation of the ""warrior dragon"" according to an ancient prophecy interpreted by the master Oogway. The film was nominated for an Oscar for best animation the following year, but it didn't. In 2011, his sequel was also highly successful at the box office and received an Oscar nomination, but he also did not win. Now, we have reached the third part of the adventures of Po and his friends, the Furious Five, and Dreamworks again delivers a fun movie that works for both kids and big guys who like good animation."
112,7,Still Holds Strong For the Younger Viewers,"This third installment is under the direction of newcomer director Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh Nelson. After a five year sabbatical, the film is voiced by the cesspool of talented performers including Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, Dustin Hoffman, J.K. Simmons, Angelina Jolie,and Kate Hudson among others. Continuing his efforts into his ""legendary adventures of awesomeness"", Po (Black) truly has his work cut out for him. There are two threatening burdens that come his way. The first being something from the outer world and then there's something more closer and personal. The main thing on a lot of people's mind is does this movie truly hold up? Or is this movie just an excuse to put a hole in your wallet?"
113,6,"Funny, very funny, albeit mediocre in overall","The movie franchise still retains its likability by having it's third installment full of chuckles. There are tons of laughter here and there spread out to both main and side characters. It feels like there's only little room to breathe between those comedies, except for those small parts where the movie goes nostalgic of Po. Yet this has the movie driven into an unbalanced state as it felt lacking in other terms. The movie's pace feels to fast as there's little transition between scenes. The villain gets into the movie very quickly, relying only to an old character that's supposed to be dead already. The conflict and its resolution also feels too much forced that the movie ends quite abruptly. Then again the movie's fun laughters will suffice to bring good ratings in."
114,6,kinda felt weird...,"Compared to the other kung fu panda movies, this one was a bit of a strange experience, at first i wasnt able to figure out why but now i think i can say why. there are 2 reasons as to why this movie fell flat, number one is the inclusion of ""chi"" in this movie, its a magical thing that plays a heavy influence on the movies plot, im not going to get into the exact details of what it is (go watch the movie if you want to know how it works) but the problem is that its magic, in a kung fu panda movie. now the previous 2 movies did have some magic in them, but it was never nearly this heavily plot relevant by any means, the last 2 movies were mostly about learning self discipline and control, not controlling magical forces to defeat a ""spirit warrior."" at best, the magic in the past 2 movies was just the icing on the cake, here though this the main focus, which made me feel like i was watching some fanfiction written by an 8 year old. now for the second problem with the movie; the villain kai, or more specifically, his abilities. the movie is very inconsistent with kais abilities, he seems to have the ability to instantly turn people into his own jade zombies if he can just get within 5 feet of them, but for some reason he only does it when the plot needs him to, all the other times he just ""fights"" everyone for seemingly no reason until the writers decide thats enough and he turns them into jade zombies. the movie never explains how exactly his powers work and it seems like the writers did that on purpose to make things easier for them. also the movie had a few major conveniences throughout it, which was annoying. im not gonna spoil it here but youll definetely notice it, especially the one during the final battle. overall it it just fell flat in my opinion, give this one a watch if you want but dont expect it to be as good as any of the previous ones"
115,8,Good Sequel That Feels Like An Ending,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is the second sequel to Kung Fu Panda, a movie that is another Dreamworks hit, and this one feels like it could have been an ending (sadly, it's still going on, with spin-off shows like Paws Of Destiny and the upcoming The Dragon Knight, and director Jennifer Yun Nelson being open to the idea of a fourth film as long as Po is the focus)."
116,5,Good But Predictable,Today went to see this wasn't expecting much from the film but haven't seen the second film but was aware of the film area of focus. If you have young children then you will enjoy this film. However if your an adult it's a pretty simple film an you can often work out what might happen next. Few scenes where we had the classic sad story but all end is good. I feel the whole thing was very basic and nothing special if my girlfriend didn't have a thing for pandas wouldn't have seen this. Jack Black plays very well and has a great group of supporting cast with some known names. Will have to see the other film before this but was very good with it's colours and could understand why this would be liked by a younger child audience. If you have kids they will adore this but you will need find many jokes for the mums and dads. I love animation but this isn't anywhere near as good as a Disney film.
117,7,Panda chi,This Is another good installment of the series with the same great voice cast like Jack black as po is the best in the Kung Fu panda series.
118,10,It was never about the fighting,"As Tigress says to Po you cant win this with kicks and jabs, and so many reviewers failed to get the point. Ultimately this is about enlightenment and leaving the self behind. Po did not win in the spirit world by defeating his opponent but by giving him what he wanted."
119,9,Kung Fu Panda 3 has pulled its weight fairly well.,"Remember when this franchise took a left turn down a serious and emotional alley in the second film? Well, DreamWorks certainly didn't turn around on this one. The character of Li Shan, Po's father, is a central presence, and might possibly be the most sympathetic character in all of Kung Fu Panda. From what we saw in the second film, he was a loving father and husband who was fiercely protective of his family when threatened, and he is re-introduced as a gentle soul who wants only to be with his son. But like any of us, he isn't perfect, as well-intentioned as he may be. Which is why I'm also glad Mr. Ping got a bigger role in this film, as he is a perfect foil to Li Shan. There are some very heartfelt moments between them and Po that brings depth to the family dynamic, and it's all the better to see that the Dragon Warrior loves both his dads very much."
120,10,great,Great this movie is awesome and its much better than boss baby this movie is full of comedy and I really like it
121,5,A disappointment,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is good, but it could have been great. That's a shame. The core of the movie is solid, with enough of both heart-warming and heart-stopping moments, but the majority of the movie is really unfunny filler. As per usual, the majority of the cast have maybe two lines in the entire movie, far too much time is devoted to slapstick shenanigans and most of the plot is info-duped at the end."
122,8,A huge improvement over the last one,"They definitely made the right choice with bringing in Po's real dad, he's hilarious, also, this movie doesn't just focus on the fight scenes, it's got real character development and actual stakes! A huge improvement."
123,8,A movie that is supposed to be made by China,(This review is including all three Kung Fu panda movies)
124,8,Not nearly enough awesome Kung fu.,"The clear and obvious conclusion of this trilogy, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is filled with the same jokes and action of its predecessors. Even the music (an interesting rendition of an Imagine Dragons) is a not-so-subtle or apologetic nod to the climax of this film. While the kung fu is still amazing (as it should always be with the control of CGI), there almost seems to not be quite enough of it."
125,9,Quite artistic but the movie is aimed at kids.,"I gave it a 10 because my nieces and nephews loved it, I got quite a few of them.One of them wanted me to give it a '20 bagillion stars on that movie website.' They all listened to the theme by Hans Zimmer while on the way to the theater. They were excited and they enjoyed the movie. Some of the scenes were brilliant in how they blended 2d animation with 3d animation.Quite artistic but the movie is definitely for kids more than than adults. Story is lacking. But looking at all my nieces/nephews enjoying it I felt I should review it more for the kids I went with than for cynical beings like me. They liked this more than Inside out and Good Dinosaur. But then again are pixar movies aimed at kids? Pixar always seems to have someone die in their movies. Dreamworks doesn't .I am hoping this grosses in a lot of money so Dreamworks can keep on making more movies for kids."
126,10,The most visually stunning animated movie of all time. The best of the three Kung Fu Panda films.,"Kung Fu Panda 3 continues with the adventures of Po(Jack Black). After the events of Kung Fu Panda(2008) & Kung Fu Panda 2(2011), Po, Tigress(Angelina Jolie), Crane(David Cross), Mantis(Seth Rogen), Viper(Lucy Liu) & Monkey(Jackie Chan) continue to protect the Valley of Peace. Shifu(Dustin Hoffman) tells Po, that he has to move on to the next phase of his training. Po's biological father Li(Bryan Cranston), is finally reunited with his son. However, everything doesn't stay rosy, as Oogway's(Randall Duk Kim) old nemesis, the evil Kai(J.K. Simmons), returns. Now, it is up to Po, with the help of the Furious Five, Shifu & a motley crew of pandas, to put an end to Kai & his reign of terror. "
127,9,"With beautiful visuals, good comedy, thrilling action, and nice heritage lessons, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a worthy addition to the franchise","In 2008, DreamWorks Animation attempted to make an animal wuxia martial arts action comedy with more focus on story and character development. That movie was Kung Fu Panda, the story about Po, an overweight fanboy who gets chosen as the Dragon Warrior improbably by Master Oogway to defend the Valley of Peace from Tai Lung. The Furious Five and Master Shifu doubted him at first and tried to kick him out, but Po managed to embrace himself and defeated Tai Lung. The movie was well-recieved both critcally and financially in USA and China and launched a new franchise for DreamWorks."
128,7,Good,"Kung Fu Panda 3 The third part of DreamWorks' renowned franchise tells the story of how Master Shifu's main teaching is to make Po learn the Chi mastery technique. But the panda is distracted by the arrival of his real father, Li. Li then takes Po to the secret village of the Pandas. In the midst of it all, the mighty Kai gathers the strength to return to the living world and take what he thinks is rightfully his. The plot, in turn, moves forward, instead of telling one more story that won't evolve at all, the script presents a good story, and one that shows a great evolution in the characters, and that's very good. Visually the movie is flawless, the animation is very well done and the fight scenes are great. The movie's humor is also a plus, the script has lots of jokes and the vast majority will make the audience laugh. The film's villain is perhaps the film's weak point, it's generic and not at all charismatic, in this regard, other films do better."
129,9,Kung fu panda 3,"Time to go back into the world of DreamWorks animation. I had read more information about the company's corporate shakeup that not only involved several people replace and relocated, but it also involved the closing of the Northern California studios and the reduction of the output of feature films. It seemed like a formidable movie fiscally, until the release of last year's Home, which I mentioned that I didn't care for. I guess I wasn't the only one as the critical reviews were tepid, and the box office numbers were low (not a failure, but not even close to a hit). Has DreamWorks truly learned?"
130,8,KUNG FU PANDA 3,"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" may have the series' weakest villain, it is still a fantastic entry (or finale if they don't make more) featuring huge laughs, an emotional story featuring Po and his dads, a memorable villain score and fantastic action elevated by fantastic animation. Plus it gets points for (probably) a more accurate portrayal of Chi than Mulan 2020."
131,,Fun,"Fun movie! The problem with DreamWorks movies is that they don't have confidence in their story. Thinking the kids will get bored, they race the story at a frenetic pace. If only moments lingered and dwelled, this could have been a *great* movie."
132,7,I really noticed the enhanced graphics,"What I really noticed in this was the enhanced animations, it seemed like they had really done something in the rendering process and that reflected on the style, color and animations, it was all very sharp and beautiful."
133,8,Naive and whimsical Po is still going strong,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is about what you would expect. A roller coaster ride of gags, goof ups and outrageous martial art outbursts."
134,7,The Student has become...,... WELCOME TO PANDARIA!!!!!
135,7,Skadoosh,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is a movie directed Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh and is written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger. It stars Jack Back, Bryan Cranston, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and J.K. Simmons."
136,10,Kung Fu 3 Review,"Po (Jack Black) has been reunited with his long-lost father Li (Bryan Cranston) - but their cheery reconcilation is interrupted by the fiendish Kai (J. K. Simmons), a demonic warrior who is determined to take down all the kung fu masters...<br /><br />If the closing words are to be believed then this will be ""The End"" for Po the panda, and if so it's a grand farewell. Directed by the second film's Jennifer Yuh Nelson, along with Alessandro Carloni, part three doesn't simply repeat the themes of the previous two but expands them, while maintaining a high hit-rate on laughs and gorgeous production design.<br /><br />Po (Jack Black) has been tracked down by his long-last father (Bryan Cranston), which would be great news if it weren't for the god-like warrior who has come from the spirit realm to destroy every kung fu master. So it falls to Po, who is still a bit dubious about being the Dragon Warrior, to learn who he can be and, in his relationship with his dad, find out where he came from. And we all get a chirpy lesson in the philosophy of ch'i, which is something to do with plants and closing your eyes."
137,7,Kung Fu Panda 3 is just as adorable as its predecessors.,"Po is back with his unceasing shenanigans. The humour he manages to squeeze out with a droll face and his non-stop clumsy acts is just A1. Ice that up with the perfect comic delivery of Jack Black, and we get a Panda that just takes it up to another level of awesomeness. He still gets awestruck by trivial things. Still does all the things that he used to, to throw you into fits of laughter. Kung Fu Panda 3 is yet another installment that doesn't stop at nothing to make you giggle whilst you chomp on your popcorn."
138,6,incredible,What can be said about KFP that has not already been said.
139,8,Kung Fu Panda 3 is highly entertaining with lot of funny moments same as its predecessors.,"Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016): Kung Fu Panda is one of the most memorable animated characters in recent times.I am a huge fan of Po and its adventures as Dragon Warrior along with Furious five.They are one of the most entertaining movies and now its time for third part in the series,Kung Fu Panda 3.How is it??"
140,8,"Wait, What's The Name of That Menacing Water Buffalo Again?","Yes, this movie is supposed to be about Po finding his roots, reconnecting with his father, and saving the remote Panda village from another tragedy. But the film's nemesis, Kai, is the trilogy's best villain, and almost steals the show (along with the chi of all kung fu masters except Po and Tigress), except that nobody can remember his name, which becomes an ongoing joke: apparently that's what happens when Master Ugwai locks you up in the Spirit World for centuries. Remember the Spirit World? No? It wasn't in the first two movies, but the series producers apparently could no longer resist ripping off Avatar..."
141,6,Good but not good enough,The film doesn't fail to meet the standard of a hilarious animation. The action was as good as the previous two of the series. The feature is better. And music fits the Chinese culture very well.
142,8,Kung Fu Panda 3: A Heartwarming and Action-Packed Movie,"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a visually stunning and entertaining film that continues the story of Po, the lovable panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu master. The animation is top-notch, with vibrant colors and detailed action sequences that are sure to delight audiences of all ages. The film also introduces new characters, including Po's long-lost father and a powerful villain, that add depth and complexity to the story. The humor is also on point, with plenty of jokes and puns that will have audiences laughing. Overall, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a worthy addition to the franchise that is sure to please fans of the series and newcomers alike."
143,9,awesome movie,"Kung Fu Panda 3 does not disappoint. It has great animation, great music, and a great story. We loved it. My son, who is 9, enjoyed the story and thought the movie was very funny. The panda theme was adorable as pandas are cute animals. Also, the scary guy wasn't that scary - and was more funny. Jack Black is hilarious and everyone in the theater was laughing. There were some sad moments and some happy moments but you leave the theater feeling uplifted. If you like action movies, you will like this because many things explode but there is no gore. The colors of the film are quite beautiful and lush. Go see it! You will enjoy it. Take your kids."
144,8,Kung Fu Panda 3 : Rocks.,KP 3 resurrects the energy of the story it brought from the first. More funnier and graphically beautiful the film maker establishes strong back story from the first two and also brings the enhancements of the scope of the characters.
145,8,"""The Third Installment Arrives With More Visual Lucidity And Humor""",The dragon warrior finds his family and returns with more verve and visual dynamism than in the previous installments.
146,8,Really good fun,"I think that it was a very good sequel to the first and second and is good that Po finds his father and the panda village and I think it was very good and went into Po's story in more detail and explains how he met his father and who lives in the panda village it also shows different kung fu skills and is a very funny film,it is better than the first one because it had more methods of fighting and had henchman unlike the first one, the second film didn't have as much methods of fighting in and only focused on inner peace and Po understanding that he was adopted, however I think this one answers all the questions that were asked from the first and second films.Overall I think that the film was very good and had lots of elements of comedy in it and was full of kung fu action."
147,7,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is the weakest of the trilogy, yet a great movie","I am personally a Kung Fu Panda fan mainly because of its comedy and its story. I find both the first KFP and KFP 2 the best. With a third installment released, I was expecting a darker story and a really threatening villain just like in KFP 2. When I first heard that J.K Simmons will voice the villain, I had high expectations, given that he portrays his roles very well. However, not all my expectations were met, but this was still a great movie."
148,10,"Congratulations DreamWorks, you have made ""THE PERFECT TRILOGY"".","HOW IS KUNG FU PANDA 3 PERFECT LIKE THE PREVIOUS 2?, this is definitely the funniest of the 3, but it's not as good as the second one, but suprisingly, I prefer this over the first one by 0.000000005% for one reason. This movie has JK Simmons, one of my personal favorite actors, as the villian, kai. And speaking of kai, his theme RULES, I honestly this was the perfect ending to the trilogy, Po finally found his dad, I really appreciate how aware this is of the second movie, because later in the movie, po's dad explains what happened to his wife even though we already knew, that was really touching, does the comedy ruin the emotional tone that this movie has? Suprisingly, no. Does it help? No, do I laugh I at the comedy? Oh you better (bleep)ing believe it. And so the villian in this movie was connected to oogway, wow, all the villians of each movie is connected to one of the main characters. Overall, perfect ending to a perfect trilogy."
149,7,"Third film in the franchise, still offers a new experience","Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third film in the successful franchise and caps off what is a surprisingly quite enjoyable series of films. The first film was a huge success and loved by families and kids everywhere, the second one for me was a slight step down but still alright and this film was actually a good amount of fun. At the third film is where you start to see most franchises getting very repetitive, and while the film follows a similar base plot from start to finish, it still offers a new experience that sets it aside from other animated films. The plot was basic, easy to follow and enjoyable, the humour was there, and the character performances were once again very fun. "
150,7,My Favorite Dreamworks Franchise,Even better than Shrek.
151,7,They forgot one important thing. Their own lesson.,Warning: Big spoilers up ahead. Or down ahead. Whatever.
152,8,the performances still good.,"More kinda like the original, this sequel improves the story of Po and manages to make me apreciate very much this movie.The animation is better than ever, and the performances still good."
153,7,Entertaining,I wasn't expecting this to be fun but both me and the kids where having a good time so Kudos on an underdog kindda of success of a trilogy!!!
154,7,Daddy's Home: Panda Edition,"While decent, this movie really didn't need to be made. It has a central topic of fatherhood which isn't quite as well executed as it could've been. Most of the humor aims to center around the natural humor in fat pandas. This humor feels like the directors changed their target audience to be younger and also to appeal more to Happy Meal toys. They definitely ran out of interesting villains and put in an underdeveloped guy who likes green. I want to say that fighting his own team is well utilized as a battle mechanic here but it honestly doesn't make for exciting action. Decent movie in quality but one that feels pointless."
155,5,Not bad,"I was eager to see if Kung Fu Panda 3 could live up to its two predecessors, as they are two of my favorite animated films. However, while the first two movies had perfect balance in their assets, this installment seems to have its focus on only one thing: the message, making it the cheesiest of the three, and one that made sacrifices of its better aspects."
156,10,I loved it!,I think this is the best one of the trilogy. I hope they make a 4.
157,9,A whole new trilogy to enjoy.,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni. It is written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, and features the voices of Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, J. K. Simmons, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Bryan Cranston, Kate Hudson, and James Hong. I really liked Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2 and I was super excited to see where they're going with the third one. If you've seen the the last two movies on this franchise, you pretty much know what you're getting into, very well animated action set pieces, character moments and a prophecy. In this movie, Po, the legendary dragon warrior, reunites with his long lost biological father. When a new threat arises from the spiritual realms, he then has two challenges in front of him, one supernatural and another very different, but much closer to his heart. Just like the last two, I really liked this movie from start to finish. The animation is glorious but what makes these movies as good as they are, is the character moments that make us feel for them. When they're fighting, you get thrilled at the amazing sequences filled with epic moments and great fighters, when they're not fighting, you're usually either laughing a lot, or feeling a lot. It knows when to be funny and when to get serious, and this is very important in such a movie. Sure, all three Kung Fu Panda movies are pretty similar in themes and emotion, but they're all great and build upon one another nonetheless. The villain Kai, voiced by the great J. K. Simmons, is truly a threat to the world of Kung Fu. He makes his presence known by doing great fights, and doing damage that no previous villain could do. Even though personally I like the second movie the most, and the villain Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) is still overall the best in my opinion, Kai is also very memorable and a strong villain in general. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer is unforgettable and really good, especially the Kai theme that helps him be even more mesmerizing and threatening. I loved this movie, not as much as the second one, but on par with the first one. Overall they're all just really entertaining and memorable animated movies, that are well directed and beautifully written."
158,7,Very good but not great,"Speaking as an adult, who probably should not have watched the movie in the first place, but anyway. For kids, this will be the most awesome movie they will ever see. It's nicely done, lively and full of messages and values such as family and friendship."
159,8,Did I just watch a Dragon Ball episode? Epic and a worthy finale to the trilogy. Dreamworks did it again!,"I have recently rediscovered myself and my taste in animated movies. Until recently I only had eyes for Disney productions and Dreamworks' traditional animation (Sinbad, Prince of Egypt, El Dorado) and their first computer animated Shrek movies. I had memories of watching Kung Fu Panda and not seeing the appeal, now as a 24 year old my eyes have been opened. I believe Kung Fu Panda and How to Train your Dragon are 2 of the best trilogies I have ever seen not only in animation but in movie franchises."
160,8,As good-looking as ever,"Very good, funny and perfect action, Kung Fu fighting is also vivid, the panda baby inside is super cute. Aside from the plot, the animation is as good as ever, and this time the animation incorporates other style elements, a bright, simple paper-cut style. The plot is also reasonable, the Chinese elements are very strong and worth watching!"
161,7,Better visuals - familiar story,"In the spirit realm, Kai (J. K. Simmons) a Chinese black pied bull, comes for and captures the chi of all the masters who have passed there. He is an old friend and brother in arms to Oogway. Oogway banished him to the spirit realm in the past when Kai tried to steal the chi from pandas in their secret valley."
162,6,Good but a little disappointing,"The problem with sequels I see is that studios cash in on the franchise and forget that they still have to provide entertainment to the audience. And the more number of sequels, the lesser the entertainment value. The 3rd of the this series and the one film that ties all the ends, KFP3 is good but I felt could have been more entertaining. The one thing I love about this series is that there is an underlying message about finding oneself and the purpose of one's life. I loved the 1st one because it was funny and I admired the 2nd one because it was about finding inner peace. Well, the 3rd is somewhere between. There are not many funny moments and going into one's self is also not much. Add to that is Po's reunion with his Dad and his extended Panda family which has the funny part but too much on emotion. And finally we also come to know why Master Oogway chose the Po as the chosen one. Another problem is the villain. Part 1 and 2 had great villains, Kai is a weak one. He is not menacing and nor has any great reason to be bad. Overall, its good but I wish there was more on inner peace and meaning of life."
163,4,Least favorite of the series,"This movie was probably my least favorite of the series. It was fun, but very distracting. It is obvious that the idea for Master Kai's weapons, were taken straight from the God of War video game series. Kai is in the Spirit World. And he has blades that can control the spirits of the masters he defeats. And the blades are attached to his wrists by a chain a mystical chain. While Kratos's Blades of Exile are not green and cant control spirits, they do attached to his wrist by a mystical chain. And cant be removed by himself. Much like Kai's. But the Claw of Hades (also from God of War) can control the spirits of the underworld, much like Master Kai's can control the chi orbs of the Masters that Kai has defeated. They just combined the two weapons into one. So they entire movie, I thought I was watching ""This Ain't God of War. Panda Edition"""
164,1,Horrible!!,This movie was just awful. Terrible plot. Stupid characters. And all in all just a boring movie. The whole time I wanted to leave the room but I suffered through it! To not believe the hype!!
165,7,Dramatic Exit,"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is an enjoyable film, if you look at it in a kid's perspective. However it isn't on par with the hilarious and recurring themes of the first one or the dark and emotional impact of the second one. Right off the bat this film is beautifully animated, it has an intriguing premise and lots of potential especially with it's villain, but it did not deliver what it could've been because of its 1 hour and 25 minute run time which makes the film rushed and not fleshed out."
166,7,Fun movie,"The Kung Fu Panda series is well made. It knows not how to overkill it by being released too often, and the stories -though nothing too deep- of course, do build on each other and keep developing characters that are really strong to start with."
167,9,Warm-hearted Fun,"This is my favourite of the current three films. Po is as lovable as ever as he goes on a journey of self-discovery. He is excited to meet his real Dad and a whole Panda clan; but his devotion to his Goose Father and friends at home is never in doubt. The cutest moments belong to Tigress though. She gains a special devotee. While Po hopes to become a Chi Master in time to defeat a returning evil, The Five fight without him. They aren't in that many scenes though, compared to 1 & 2. This is a Panda Adventure. There is plenty of humour and a great deal of heart. The animation is beautiful. The ending is spectacular. There are strong messages about helping people to discover their strengths and that failure is a learning tool. Success comes from trying again and accepting support from others. The important thing is to be you."
168,6,This movie is really bad...(spoilers),"Let's begin with the bad guy, Kai. Talk about wasted potential and several plot holes. He was another ""Good guy turned evil"", but the writers got lazy there. Kai was Oogway's best friend. The dude even carried an injured Oogway for MILES until they found healers to treat Oogway and Kai's first thoughts when he saw that the panda healers had chi? To say ""I want powers now. I'm gonna become bad guy out of nowhere"", so he absorbed the chi of the pandas (never explained how since that was supposed his and Oogway's first time ever seeing chi). Then Oogway used chi to banish him into the spirit realm (again, another plot hole because Shifu said himself that Oogway took 30 years to master chi and this could only be done AFTER he met the pandas and Kai's banishment happened right after they met the pandas). The wasted potential was because they could have gone with the route of Oogway not being much of a saint and actually have betrayed Kai , but no. 180º turn on a character for no reason other than have a conflict for the movie. It wasn't even a subtle or decently written like it was for Tai Lung or Shen."
169,6,Good but...,"Like the previous films this one has amazing visuals and animation. The lighting and textures look so realistic and have improved since the first films release. The music is nice too, I love Kai's theme, I love how it's impactful and menacing. Also, the character design is amazing, I like how they're not afraid to show aging characters, they are maturing and developing even while off camera and I think that's pretty cool."
170,8,Same Formulaic Plot but Still Funny,"Our beloved and adorable Po is most welcomed to return in this ridiculous, playful yet beautiful third installment. The entire animation has exactly the same formulaic plot as the previous two episodes - a villain comes out of no where, the journey in preparing to fight and at the end only the main character can take down the big bad fella; adding on a whole bunch of cheesy moments but it is hilarious and entertaining thanks to Jack Black's well commitment. The Kung Fu adventure is absolutely beautiful and impressive, thanks to the stunning visual effects which heavily covers the Chinese cultures, settings and backgrounds; also the scores by Hans Zimmer who perfectly composes by mixing every single Western tracks with Chinese musical instruments. This family-friendly adventure might be fun without any great moral values as in Disney and Pixar animations but the reunion of this chubby panda with his biological father and the conflict with the adapted parent does generate some important messages that is worth to learn."
171,7,While it's a good film it doesn't hold a candle to the first two,"I loved the first two kung fu panda movies and I even kinda liked the TV series. The series is well known for it's really fun action packed scenes, gorgeous animation, likable cast of characters and simple yet solid story's. I was really hyped to see this film and see how it would turn out and I gotta say that it was disappointing compared to the first two films in the series. But at the same time It's still enjoyable and it still has a number of good things going for it. For one the animation is the best yet and it looks brilliant. The amount of detail in the textures and fur stand out really well. The music is great tho it doesn't beat the first two films IMO. The action scenes are still fun to watch and are well made and the comedy is still hilarious(tho a bit more kiddy then before). The reasons why I feel as tho this film is the weakest of the trilogy is that it feels more rushed and shorter then before as well as the villain. Kai is a weak bad guy IMO and while his voice is pretty cool and his fighting isn't bad, the character isn't as threatening as Shen or Tai Lung due to the writers making him more comical. The films characters are still voiced by the same cast and they all do a good job and the writing is mostly solid.New characters such as LI and MEI MEI aren't very flashed out and the furious five still don't get to do much.Overall I found it to be a solid film in the series but the story could've been much more."
172,6,"Nothing special. Actually, nothing at all.","Many consider the worst second and third entries in a trilogy to be, respectively, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. To justify this sentiment, you'd only have to immerse yourself in the aforementioned films for all of five minutes, or if that doesn't prove sufficient, steel yourself and bump it up to ten. Or you can take my word for it and save yourself the trouble."
173,4,Skidud!,"Saw this around Memorial Day this year. Being a fan of the first two films, I was hoping this one would be as good if not better. Wow! I couldn't have been more disappointed."
174,10,oh boooooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was a awesome movie to watch i watch about 4 times it has good action in the movie PO has learn many things through out the movie and it was a great experienced for him also he goes through a difficult journey also he learns how to harness he new technique to fight a new mysterious foe in the movie also he meets new friends overall this was a great movie to watch
175,7,My Review!,"It focuses on an upgrade to Kung Fu. If you ask me, this part is challenging the first of the trilogy. It's kiddish, sweet and funny. A movie kids as well as adults will remember.<br /><br />So, clear your schedule and the big screens is the right way.<br /><br />P.S: The first one still holds the top rank!!!"
176,6,Although a few typical DreamWorks,"Although a few typical DreamWorks features are still present. Despite the maturity and ""smartness"" of ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" as a whole, the scriptwriters deliberately add stupid jokes, sometimes stretching into entire scenes, which are apparently intended to illustrate the modern mores of youth, but in the end only demonstrate a biased attitude towards children, as if they are unable to understand the serious and even tragic moments of the cartoon. Even J. K. Rowling advised not to consider children stupider than adults, and this advice should definitely be followed by the producers of the picture. Nevertheless, even the attempt to talk about more complex topics in this film deserves respect. ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" turned out to be probably the most adult cartoon in the series."
177,6,Alireza.Akhlaghi.Official,"The third section of Kung Fu Panda, in level of preseries even somewhat stereotyped versions, was made in terms of visual charm.<br /><br />The confrontation between evil force and good force with each other, and the evil that is always defeated, forms the trio of animation, but with a deeper look we find that the core of Kung Fu Panda is in fact the effect of the Chinese Kung Fu on all the different segments of the animal community.<br /><br />Of course, the subject of bulk on these trio is ignored in the confrontation of Kung Fu characters, which goes some way towards parallel Kung Fu philosophy.<br /><br />The mainstream Kung Fu Panda III is based on energy of the collective spirit and its impact, which is well known in shape of the animation.<br /><br />Finding the father and community of the pandas is a kind of triple turning point in animation, so that Panda's character (pou) sought to find his own origins from the beginning.<br /><br />The struggle in the spiritual world with the evil force that all the friends of Pou have captured, in a way different from the before series, together with the energy derived from the collecting spirit, depicted a different, more attractive, and more abstract, space for Kung Fu Panda.<br /><br />Apart from the techniques of making this animation, the lovely characters associated with Poe, more than the previous two series, but as a supplement, the Pandas community was well replaced."
178,2,And let the doo doo flow - no thanks,What on earth happened to this movie series?
179,9,A great movie,It's still a great movie which represents China though I have to admit that they should do something to retrieve its declining scores.<br /><br />It seems that the plot is more exciting than the first one and second one of the series.It is a progress.
180,9,This film is amazing film with great story.,"I watch Kung Fu Banda from the first edition I really like it. the second edition wasn't that much good but still I love it. Now with the third edition it's really fantastic. I am extremely in love with this type of story, a personal hero which give me a very large push in my personal goal and dreams even if it's not real still I believe that the human can do lots and lots of thing so the film was brilliant I really love all the details and the massages in the story how it teach the people to believe in them self and just to focus in that because being your self open unexpected doors in the life and I like to watch more part for this awesome film."
181,7,"Worthwhile, charming and visually-stunning.","Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) is worthwhile, charming, and visually-stunning. Personally, I have found the previous two entries in the series to be thoroughly entertaining. Yet again, this film proves to be tons of fun. It does not feel like a movie that is specifically pandering to kids, and in turn, will end up being enjoyable for the whole family. It also presents a genuinely positive message in an innocent-like manner. The action scenes are really fun and the quippy one-liners remain witty throughout. The voice cast does a decent job, with Jack Black once again being the driving factor. As for complaints, I would say that there are no shocks, twists, or anything that would implicate emotional investment. But hey, I really shouldn't be complaining about that kind of thing. It's Kung Fu Panda 3."
182,7,Didn't see it coming,I didn't expect this part to be good I thought it will be milking for the franchise but I was wrong
183,9,Family entertainer,"Kung Fu Panda is surely one of the best movie series ever made.Animation is good,dubbing is nice along with humor and good fight sequences."
184,6,My Review,"I have a tendency to generalize more than I should, but my comment was directed toward the author's use of the word ""escapism"" in the headline for this article. ""Escapism"" suggests that children have a stressful or ""unpleasant reality"" from which they need to ""escape,"" or forget for a while in order to achieve relaxation or peace."
185,8,A decent way to end a very entertaining trilogy,"Visually, the art was beautifully done, the best plus in this movie. The artists really focus on the details, even the background. However, they still use the same style and no breakthrough. A shame 9/10 The audio was good, background music is awesome. Voice actors also nailed their roles, especially Bryan Cranston, J.K.Simmons and Jack Black, they were able to make the characters as if they are alive. Making the character development the more deep 8.5/10 The plot was so bad though, it's basically the same as the 1st one but with hundreds more of plot holes. They were good enough to squeezed in comic relief in intense scenes which is both good and bad because it gets annoying after a while. 5/10 Overall : 7.8/10"
186,7,Decent kids movie,Po the lovable Panda continues his journey of enlightenment by mastering Chi in order to combat an ancient re-incarnated spirit. The movie is pleasant and engaging without ever having the level of threat the villains in the first two movies generated.
187,10,Brilliant!!!!!,"This has got to be alongside how to train your dragon, one of the best dreamworks animation films of recent years! "
188,7,A Great Movie to Take Kids to That Adults Wont Hate,"The new installment to the Kung Fu Panda franchise, which might be the last we see of our fury friend, thus capping off the trilogy. While Kung Fu Panda 3 is certainly enjoyable and kids will like it, there are certain elements it didn't take away from the previous movie, and one of its main struggles is this one seemed more like a kids movie than the other previous two, as the first two had certain elements that made it more enjoyable for adults. The message in this movie is pretty good for kids, but the way they go about displaying isn't as good as the first two. I am a huge fan of Kung Fu Panda 2(and Dreamworks in general), and what works well in that movie is the darker tone it takes, as well as the message that we have to accept our dark pasts. Anyway back to KP3, the voice acting is superb, the action is actually really great at times, and while it does seem to run the series full circle it isn't better than its predecessors. Again great movie to take your kid to for a fun time, especially for an animated movie in January(I'm looking at you Norm of the North)"
189,9,The panda returns!,"Living large and loving life, Po realizes that he has a lot to learn if he's going to fulfill the next challenge from his beloved instructor. After reuniting with his long-lost father, Po must transition from student to teacher and train a group of fun-loving, clumsy pandas to become martial-arts fighters. Together, the kung-fu brethren unite to take on the evil Kai, a supernatural warrior who becomes stronger with each battle."
190,8,Great film,"I think this film is as good as the first but not quite as good as the second. Nonetheless, it's still a great addition to the franchise and tied up the loose ends left by the previous movies. It feels like a good end to the Kung Fu Panda movies. A fourth movie would be nice, as long as the script is good, but if the writers can't come up with anything, they should still be proud to have ended the franchise on a high note."
191,1,Too bad for putting politics in movies,"The Abominable movie brought me here, and I gave it a rating. The producer put the nine-dash line political issue in the film. Too bad. I boycotted this company."
192,7,Surprisingly Entertaining,"Having never seen the original two ""Kung Fu Panda"" films, I really wasn't sure what to expect. Jack Black is hit or miss for me as far as comedy goes. He constantly seems to border the line between funny and annoying. I was pleasantly surprised after watching ""Kung Fu Panada 3"" to find that not only was Black's performance not over the top, but that this movie was overall enjoyable. I didn't really need to see the first two films to figure out that Po was a clumsy, over weight, under dog with a mysterious destiny. The jokes in this movie were delivered quite well, and neither felt forced or drawn out as is the case in far too many children's movies. Each character was likable in their own way and felt three dimensional, having individual personalities and flaws. Brian Cranston did a phenomenal job as Po's father. His interactions with Black's character felt natural, showing that the two veteran actors perform quite well together. The plot was a typical good versus evil story, with the twist being that Po was put in the position of teacher, as opposed to student. I wasn't expecting a deep story from a movie about talking animals doing martial arts, so I was not disappointed by the typical plot. This movie actually makes me want to watch the original films."
193,6,"Enjoyable For The Kids, Maybe Not So Much For The Adults","I was a little bit on the fence when thinking about whether I was excited to see Kung Fu Panda 3 or not. On the one hand, I adore all things furry and all things animated so I should be the ideal die-hard fan of this franchise. However on the other hand, I can't say I really enjoyed the first two. Not to say that they were bad movies, they just never stood out in my mind so whilst I didn't hate them I clearly didn't love them either."
194,8,JUSTGOOD AND FUN,JUST WATCH THIS AMZING MOVIE . GOOD FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO WATCH ANIMATION AND STROY STROY IS GOOD BUT ITS JUST FEEL LIKE CHLIDSHI but the animation is grate and fun the design every chacter in beauty . When i was watching his movie i fell i am on onther world just a beuty full art work is done.. this movie has some flaws also only aboy stroy but fight scence is very good i didnt except about fight scence they improve everthing in this movie this movie is full of entetment and awsome movie with comedy and suspense if your panning to watch this movie than watch this fast for me this is not mastrerpiec but amzing.
195,9,Not bad at all,"I've seen the first two movie, that we're very good, maybe better then this. But i enjoy this too. The same comedic Jack Black, with the help of the other character converge to a good final. I liked the fact that there are many famous actors who played the roles very well and bring a welcome doze of comedy. Recommend it!"
196,7,Go Kungfu fighting..,"Everyone's favourite Po, the Panda is back and full credit to the animation team of Dreamworks to make him look so 'awesome'. Jack Black's voice-over is as energetic and passionate, if not more than in it's first instalment. From the trailers, it was clear than many new characters were to be introduced. None more bigger (and plumpier) than Po's dad Li (he's more Chinese looking) and his entire village of adorable furry fat , dumpling loving pandas. And not to forget 'Kai', the fearsome but funny new adversary from the spirit world voiced masterly by J.K.Simmons."
197,7,Another Kung Fu Panda Movie. Should Make For Some Fun Times!,"This review will have some spoilers so go read a book if you don't want spoilers. Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third installment of the surprisingly successful Kung Fu Panda series. And to be honest with you guys, I like them all basically the same amount! They're all great and funny. So when I walked out of this movie I was wondering what movie I liked the best. The first, second, or third. "
198,8,funny,"Po must protect the villagers and practice new kung fu while becoming a real kung fu panda. How difficult this process is, I really like this movie"
199,9,Po is back with his gang and he is awesome and funny as always!,"Po, our beloved Panda is back with his antics and underdog heroism in his latest adventure in Kung Fu Panda 3. I have to admit, I have been an avid fan of the Kung Fu Panda franchise movies and dedicatedly watched and re-watched each movie, enjoying it every time and am so happy to say that the third installment is again an entertainer."
200,10,Awesome Movie,"Awesome movie of a panda. Panda's comedy was a killer and hilarious. It was a superb content. Including his family in the movie was prettier. Fighting scenes were thrilling, comedy & awesome. Nice graphics were used. Story was cool. Best part of movie I had watched was of moment of baby pandas. Villain(The Bull) was also awesome. Only something which was missing was... there was nothing for missing in these movie. Scene of killing the bull by panda was pretty good.The scene where all the family members of panda were fighting with zombie kung fu masters were the amazing part of the movie. Atlast want to say is it was the best movie of kung fu panda series."
201,10,Kung Fu Panda 3 was epic!!!,"Kung Fu Panda 3 was epic! I really enjoyed watching Kung Fu Panda 3. (This may or may not be a spoiler. I'll just say it anyway, but beware...)I really loved the focus on the idea of chi throughout the movie. It worked great. The characters were as alive and hilarious as they always were. I love the feeling this franchise gives you - the Kung Fu Panda movies are feel-good movies that never fail to bring your mood up and make you laugh. This is a film - and franchise as a whole - that people of all ages will enjoy watching. The humour is just perfection. The combination of drama and comedy in the action scenes was amazing. The people who created this franchise are geniuses. It's in my all-time faves. I absolutely loved it!!"
202,8,I love kung fu!!!!!,"At first, i was wondering where they were going because i am used to seeing po with the five from watching legends of awesomeness. I was waiting for the sarcastic remarks from mantis, the tricks from monkey and the scowl of tigress. I love them thrown in for comic relief, but since po went his own way, i wondered if they would have a storyline. It was not what i had hoped, but it was good. Po and the five go together. I did like it when he found the other pandas and they taught him to be him. It was hard since he was training at the palace. It was funny watching him, but the best was the ending when po learns to do what he needs and Shifu says, ""of course you did""."
203,10,Marvellous,Marvellous movie with great jokes its way better than boss babh secret life of pets
204,9,It's a laughing riot with lots of messages for Parents,It's not only for the kids it is specially for the parents who wants their kids to be as successful as their neighbors' kids. Kung Fu Panda 3 is laughing riot with a potential learning experience for any parent.
205,,soul-mate-compatibility-by-name,"There's some good news about Kung Fu Panda 3, and there's some bad news. The good news is that it's genuinely funny at times and the animation is stunning(perhaps as good as we've seen from Dreamworks) and the movie works well enough to be enjoyable. The bad news is, it could have been much more. When Po meets his biological dad for the first time, it should have been an emotional, touching moment; instead it was played for laughs. And instead of making the villain Kai a threat to respect, they just made him goofy. Plus, the ""Furious Five"" get barely any screen time and the new characters are hardly worth mentioning. Also, the main idea of this movie being about ""who am I"", is practically a rehash of the first two movies. Yet with all its faults, the movie is still enjoyable if you take it for what it is, a funny, but cheesy third movie in the Kung Fu Panda trilogy."
206,6,Villain,Wait a minute... I knew this main villain looked familliar - it's Lobo from DC comics!
207,6,"Personally, I love this.","I love the movie and it's to my liking in many ways..<br /><br />Objectively; cash grab, they didn't give the animators a lot of time and attempted to squeeze too many chapters and story in such a short time."
208,8,Kung Fu Panda 3 is a really good movie and a good ending of the franchise,"I'm a lover of the Kung Fu Panda movies since i was 8 years old. The first one is a really great movie. In that moment, i couldn't see the movie in theaters because my parents were busy in that moment, so i saw on DVD. The second one I achieved see in the theater in 3D with my family and it was amazing. The best of the franchise. And when i heard about the third one and saw the trailers, i was really excited because they past 5 years after the last one. I also saw with my family in 3D, and i really enjoy it. First let's talk about the animation, that is probably the best one in the franchise. All the colors, the characters designs, the scenarios,the action scenes, everything is fantastic in the animation. The humor is effective and it got some hilarious moments. The voice cast is really well done with talent voices of Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, James Hong, J.K Simmons, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and others makes the movie a really watchable time. The story is interesting and great to see a continuation of the second one in stated to reap it the same movie. The score of Hans Zimmer is beautiful as always and makes the action scenes and the emotional moments effective and fun. And the last good thing about the movie are the characters, they are really likable and they still being the same characters as we know it. My favorite character of the franchise is probably is Mr. Ping. Unfortunately, the movie has some defects. The biggest problem of the movie is that even is that funny, there are jokes that don't make me laugh like the testicle joke or when the same jokes of the movie are repeated, and sometimes make me think why they try to be the most funny movie of all like Shrek the Third did. Not even that the tone of the movie although it is not bad,it sometimes want to be Kung Fu Panda 1 for some of the jokes you have. And the last problem with the movie is its villain. Kai is not a very powerful or frighting villain like Lord Shen or Tai Long. It has some funny moments, the concept of the villain is really great, the design is fantastic and J.K. Simmons dose a great job, but his is the most weakest villain of the franchise. So yeah, this movie has been throwing by people calling the best of Kung Fu Panda series, the worst of the series or the weakest of the series. And yeah, I would lie if I said that this is the weakest one. But for the other hand, is better than Shrek the Third respect in the writing and humor. It's a shame that this couldn't have the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature because it could be great if Kung Fu Panda were the first trilogy in be nominated in that category. But, i think that the Kung Fu Panda franchise is the best franchise that Dreamworks give us. Kung Fu Panda 3 even is not the best one in the franchise is a really good sequel which knows that who to end and not be another shity franchise like Ice Age or The Land before Time. "
209,8,Good Fun Movie to Watch,"It is really hard to make good sequels after a famous first movie. Because there is less room for character development, villain seems predictable, and fun factor is usually less. I did not enjoy Kung Fu Panda 2 a lot and I feared that the movie will face a similar fate. But I have to inform that the movie is a good one, if not the best."
210,10,Its Stunning Masterpiece!,"Really Enjoyed the Movie, Feel Good Anime Really Close To Heart (mine)<br /><br />The Charecters are Po, Kai, Tigress, Shifu I Loved it<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's ""kai"" Arraival bgm gotha Vera level<br /><br />Climax Goosebumps lit."
211,8,"A nice, if somewhat tame, ending to the franchise.","For me, the first two Kung Fu Panda movies are on a league of its own. Sure, at first look, they may seem like standard kiddie fare, but they're leaps and bounds ahead from it. Whether it's the impeccable production design, the amazingly choreographed fighting sequences or the deep, somewhat dark themes that lie under the comedic story lines, there's always been a handful of reasons why this franchise has the potential to appeal to both children and adults like myself. Which brings us to this last installment, which is not a bad film by any means, but certainly sets itself more on the kid's side of the spectrum."
212,7,Kai is kratos with pokeballs,Kai is basically kratos with a bunch of pokeballs.
213,5,Fun film,Please note spoilers
214,8,It's good but not as previous 2,"I thought this movie is okay-ish in story but humour was good so i gave it a 8. There are many good quotes like<br /><br />""Before the battle of fist, battle of mind comes""<br /><br />""If you only do what you can do, you will never become more than you""<br /><br />Not recommended but can watch for timepass🙂"
215,6,Ebbas review: Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016),Parents perspective review.
216,10,Awesome!Very funny!Very emotional!Great ending to this trilogy,"Kung Fu Panda 3 was an amazing end to this amazing trilogy..I have absolutely enjoyed it..First of all,its very funny..Like the previous 2 movies,this was very very humorous and I laughed a lot..It was very emotional too especially in the end..This movie answers every questions we had in our mind which are: 1-What is the true meaning of the DRAGON WARRIOR? 2-Who is Po? 3-Why did Oogway choose Po as the dragon warrior in the first movie? In the first movie,Po saved his village,in the second movie Po saved kung fu and China..Now,in this 3rd movie,Po have to save the whole universe.. As Oogway said ""The Universe needs the DRAGON WARRIOR"" You must watch this movie!"
217,9,"Some details are a little illogical, but great movie to watch overall","Went to see the Pandas with my partner after these two wonderful prequels, with warning from my friends that this film is not as good as the others, we still have lots of fun and laughters and, of course, lessons."
218,9,Another Kung-Fu Panda Classic,"A fast paced movie with the classic characters and the inimitable Panda jokes. The graphics are excellent with no faults in any-way. The story is fast paced enough to keep the mind from wandering. The actions scenes are fast paced and entertaining, as are the dialogues, as always. The jokes though routine slapstick Panda jokes but make for good laughter at times. Although the benchmark for all the Kung Panda series is the first movie, and though no one has done better than the original but the subsequent series have not been boring or mundane which is usually the problem with most serial movies. Highly recommended for audiences of all ages."
219,6,Realism,"This movie has so much realism it's actually hard to not find what emotion anyone is giving, to the minute detail to this movie actually making me learn more Chinese culture and myth it's more than good to color having more affect near the end to actual good transition to the point where I would love to watch the Fourth if there is one. To not just Myth to actual Chinese in this movie it is great (Oogway) is Turtle in Chinese, it is more a great movie. The cast is actually still well known to the point where almost everyone I have at least heard or known them to be in a different movie/series/ or video."
220,9,Monkey Voice Actor,"Jackie Chan was the voice actor for this movie but for some reason, his voice sound different from other kung fu panda movie. The voice actor from this movie sound almost like from the TV series by James Sie. The fight scene voice sound like jackie chan but other parts doesn't sound like it. Other parts sound like James Sie or other Asian voice actor."
221,6,Another fun movie with Po,The Good Stuff (from best to least best)
222,8,About the cartoon,"A wonderful kind cartoon. We love to watch it with the whole family. On the one hand, it may seem that it is very primitive and childish, but then when you start listening to the words of the heroes and analyzing their actions with your own, you realize that the cartoon is not as simple as it seems at first glance. Light and funny humor is combined with the problem of fathers and children. You can learn a lot from the main character of the Software. Especially in this part. Although I found my own kind, I realized that you need to be a person and not dissolve in the team, then you will acquire your jin."
223,7,Enjoyed watching but could lacked the punch of previous 2 movies,I watch Kung Fu Panda series for 2 reasons
224,8,"Kung Fu Panda is a wonderful fun movie, and it looks great!","I just saw Kung FU Panda 3, and it was really good. It is probably my second favorite of all three, the first one being the best. But the story in this one is good, but not as good as the second nor first. What makes it awesome is the characters, the mind blowing visuals and art, and just the drama. I said that the story is not as good, but the characters and the drama is so well made here that it makes it better then the second one FOR ME. I saw Zootopia and i would say this is right next to it for me in 2016. I recommend it to go see it with a friend, or a sibling. Its very fun, dramatic, nice fight scenes, mind blowing visuals that made my mouth open and its just, a great fun time! One problem tho is that the villain is not so fleshed out, the first and second one are much better."
225,8,A one time watch ! worth the money!!!,The movie was all about emotions and knowing about your true self and that was heartwarming!
226,8,Kung Fu Panda 3: Expected family fun,A lot of critics were worried that the latest addition to the Kung Fu Panda series would suffer the same fate as many trilogies. In a phrase: that is would crash and burn. Epically. The main concern was more for story line: cartoons typically only have a very simple plot and extending it further negates any special quality the first (or second) movie would have.
227,7,An intersting film for entertainment,"There are plenty good reviews about this film, so I am going to be fast."
228,9,"Po faces his worst, the most brutal, and the strongest enemy of all.","Kung Fu Panda 3 is the most excellent movie of the serial. Po has reached to Nirvana level in this movie. in my opinion from now on, no other enemies can be convincing. So this adventure should come to an end."
229,8,movie is good ..............but it misses something,"i have loved first two parts of the movie very much ..... but , coming to this one i felt that starting and ending of the movie is awesome but it misses something gripping at middle of the story"
230,8,Great visuals !,"As a visual artist , I was fascinated by the visuals and the scenes of this movie , from the color scheme , contrast , lighting , texture, every single detail about this movie is a masterpiece by its own , yes , many of these texturized style were so trendy in 2016 , but they're still stunning."
231,9,"Although lighter in substance than it's predecessor, KFP3 is a heartwarming family film that undoubtedly holds up.","Kung Fu Panda 3 was a surprising movie in all the right ways. It was definitely tough to follow up an already amazing sequel in Kung Fu Panda 2, but this film delivered, albeit in a different way than its predecessor. "
232,3,a tired sequel,"Horrible writing combines with a plot that a 5 year old could have written. No one in the cinema laughed once (except for a little kid whose baby brothers ice cream fell off the stick) and I'm pretty sure everyone over that age of 5 gave up on Dreamworks when he turned into a dragon without any explanation whatsoever. the whole idea of chi is extremely quickly brushed over and the best way they could have described it is ""whatever the plot needs it to be."". The only thing that stops this from being a 1 star review is Jack Black's enthusiasm and some kinda alright fight scenes. There are so many great kids movies you could watch don't waste your time with this tired sequel. now excuse me while i go hibernate until Shrek 5 comes out."
233,9,Great to have my name in the credits,"If you only do what you can, you will never be more than you are now. Its an honor to work for a movie as great as KFP3. DreamWorks did an awesome job. Must watch movie. Best animation till date. Kung Fu Panda has always been my favorite franchise of all time. Looking forward for a 4th edition of this epic Title, As master Shifu says, Time is just an illusion, there is only the now. Talking about the villain, Kai has return! I guess Kai was the best ever character villain. Way to go Dreamworks!!! Love the Po character given to me as a souvenir for working on this. As Po says, Listen closely because I'm only going to repeat this ten times."
234,6,Kung Fu Panda 3 Best Animation Movie,"""Kung Fu Panda"" franchise is one of the most successful movies of all- time, and I'd like to believe that that reason is because the writers, directors, producers and the creative animation talents behind it know how to solidly move the story forward, even with the same characters, they know how to make them evolve without losing the charm and the heart that made more than first and the second film effective. "
235,9,Great film with great story,"I watch Kung Fu Banda from the first edition I really like it. the second edition wasn't that much good but still I love it. Now with the third edition it's really fantastic. I am extremely in love with this type of story, a personal hero which give me a very large push in my personal goal and dreams even if it's not real still I believe that the human can do lots and lots of thing so the film was brilliant I really love all the details and the massages in the story how it teach the people to believe in them self and just to focus in that because being your self open unexpected doors in the life and I like to watch more part for this awesome film."
236,8,A lot of fun,"This is a great movie. Kids love it. It starts good, with a lot of fun,Poe finding out that he has a dead and a whole colonies of pandas. Poe struggling to learn the Che, Whole palad's get's destroyed, and at the end get's very emotional with Poe wining over a General Kay. It is Entertainment to the end. We watched it over 10 times at least :-)."
