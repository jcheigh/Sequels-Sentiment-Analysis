0,9,"Epic, Emotional, and Powerful. George Lucas' Farewell to the Star Wars Saga is an Operatic Masterpiece of Blockbuster Cinema","The final entry in George Lucas' Star Wars saga, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is one, giant climax to arguably the most popular movie franchise in history. It's also the most riveting of the series; A movie of such visual and storytelling intensity that it makes our typical standards for summer entertainment seem trivial. Sith has wall-to-wall action and jaw-dropping special effects, yes. By all measures, Episode III is a grand success when it comes to giving the legions of Star Wars fans any and everything they could have hoped for after Darth Vader uttered the words ""We meet again"" in 1977. The beauty of Revenge of the Sith is that it earns much more than diverting summer thrills. Strip away all the baggage that comes with the name 'Star Wars' and what you are left with is one of the most enthralling films of 2005."
1,10,The Final Part of the Saga,"In Coruscant, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Separatist General Grievous' spaceship and Anakin kills Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) with his light-saber after a fight; however Grievous escape from the Jedi. When they land on Coruscant, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) comes to tell Anakin that she is pregnant. Soon he has premonitions of his wife dying during the delivery. Palpatine requests that Anakin joins the Jedi Council against the will of the members but his is not promoted to Master and stays Padawan; further they ask him to spy Palpaline. Anakin is manipulated by Palpatine about the true intentions of the Jedi and is tempted to know the dark side of the Force that could be capable to save Padmé. Further Palpatine discloses that he is Sith Lord Darth Sidious. What will Anakin do?"
2,10,"""Revenge is a dish best served cold.""","And so, the Star Wars saga comes full circle, with the final pieces of the intergalactic puzzle falling into place. Of course we knew the major elements about to be revealed, but to see it done so effectively is a tribute to the epic story telling genius of creator George Lucas."
3,10,Revenge of the Sith,One of the best star wars movies and best scene is obi one kenobi and anakin fight
4,9,This one is actually great!,"The first two movies in the prequel trilogy weren't horrible, but had so many flaws. This one isn't as good as any movie in the original trilogy, but if you ask me it's pretty close. This one is actually very well done and special effects don't look so fake now and give us some really epic scenes, especially in a movie's climax that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Here, George Lucas proved that he can still do it and I was really satisfied with this movie. The acting was the best the prequel trilogy gave and Hayden Christensen isn't so wooden and annoying anymore. Here he's actually pretty cool and shows that he has potential, but Ewan McGregor remains the best part of the cast. You really believe him to be young Obi-Wan and that's very well done and he also has some very heartbreaking moments with Anakin at the end. One of the biggest flaws in the prequels was all those political conversations. Just lots and lots and lots of talking that makes you want to fall asleep, but thankfully, Lucas listened to his fans and it's reduced here. It's still present, of course, but not as much. Romance between Padme and Anakin is a little bit more believable here, but still not enough and that's one of the biggest flaws here, but the blame is more on Attack of the Clones in this case. Everything is executed very well and leading up to the original trilogy is very good, even tho it does create some plot holes, but in Star Wars you can explain almost everything with the Force. And one more good thing for Jar Jar haters, he appears for only like, a second. Hooray! But there is one more thing they messed up in the ending and I'm not gonna spoil anything but that one awful line (NOOOO!). While the first two movies in the prequel trilogy were disappointing, this one makes it all better. Not everyone will like it, but as a big Star Wars fan, I must say it's a nice and intense ending for the prequels."
5,10,Hot,I like the bit where what's his name falls into the molten pit of fire
6,10,This is where the fun beings,Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is my all time favorite Star Wars movie and hands down the best in the prequel trilogy the story was well done the lightsaber dule between Anakin And Obe wan was amazing.
7,10,Dew it,"After watching the rise of skywalker and the sequels as a whole, I thought It would be fitting to come back here and show the love it truly deserves!"
8,9,Under-rated because of first two movies. This one is truly amazing.,"I think it is under-rated because the first two movies was not this good. This last one is pretty good, how rated so low? First two were not bad but they had so much more potential, those two movies could be so better. I think this is nearly the best way to connecting to the Original Trilogy after two decent movies. This is all we wanted from Star Wars. And this last movie gave that to us."
9,8,Watched this film at a theater in Iraq,"I was on a Combat tour in Iraq ( OIF 2004-2005 ) I watched this film at the theatre of Camp Anaconda, I thought it was the best film of the three prequels"
10,10,The best Star Wars movie in my opinion,SCORE: 10/10
11,7,Best of the Star Wars trilogy of prequels...,".. and that's not saying that much. I think everyone judges every Star Wars movie by what is considered the best of the batch, the original Star Wars of 1977 and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of 1980. Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"", and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the ""Star Wars"" series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas."
12,9,They Really Did Save The Best 'Til Last,"I was never one of the millions of Star Wars groupies. I enjoyed the films, except for Attack Of The Clones, but wasn't a huge fan. Having seen the first five, I eventually got around to checking out this last one, if for no other reason than curiosity. Wow, it changed my whole outlook."
13,10,A Nutshell Review: Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith,"To all the fans out there, it is time to rejoice. George Lucas has delivered in Revenge of the Sith. In my list of favourite Star Wars movie, it ranks up there with Empire Strikes Back in its emotional level, and action sequences."
14,10,The saga is complete.,"Finally we have the episode3 of Star wars. So many things happens in this episode, that I need to make a summary of the things that happens. First of all, some years have passed since the Clone War. Anakin and Obi Wan are fighting as hard as they can, specially now that Palpatine was kidnapped by general Grievous, the leader of the droids army. Anakin finally menage to kill Count Dookan,( with Palpatine motivating him)and Obi Wan killed Gen. Grievous."
15,7,The Best Prequel,"""Revenge of the Sith"" is pretty good fun. After the shaky start of ""The Phantom Menace"" and the abysmal mess that was ""Attack of the Clones"", the third installment of the prequel trilogy finally comes along and gives us the story we had been hoping for all along: the origin of Darth Vader and the Empire."
16,,"maybe, the best","it is my favorite part from the series. because it presents the metamorphose of the lead character. because it is more than scene for impressive technology. because it is a story who reminds to me the impression Star Wars as religious film. because it is not exactly dark and honest and powerful but , after so many fight scenes and characters and stories around a lot of characters , Revenge of the Sith is precise. and human. that courage to be not exactly story of fireworks but the story of fears, emotions,crisis and dramatic decision , for the unique scenes from Mustafar , the film is the most complex and seductive from the entire series. because it is the bridge between new and old films from series , a bridge who seems be more important than the united parts.for the verdict than Hayden Christensen was an inspired option, for the science to give a profound sense to a story who seems be , in many occasions, too preoccupied to have large child public. a film for fans. maybe, the best from the entire series."
17,9,Lucas Redeemed!,"When I asked the reviewer sitting next to me to sum up Revenge of the Sith, he simply said ""great!"" That seemed to basically be the consensus of virtually everyone in attendance at an advance press screening of the final chapter in the Star Wars saga."
18,8,The prequel trilogy finally comes to life,The dark side of the force rises to power inflicting many casualties in the process.
19,9,Flawed but still great,"ROTS is my favourite of the live action Star Wars movies. Does that make it perfect? No. There's some bad dialogue (""It's only because I'm so in love"", ""No, it's because I'm so in love with you""), Sidious killed three Jedi Council Members far too easily and Dooku only had a cameo. However, unlike TFA, which was such a pitiful excuse for a Star Wars film that I think it wounded the franchise, ROTS can stand on its own and deserves its place in Star Wars canon."
20,9,It's OK to be a STAR WARS fan again.,"For several years now, it's been a rather uneasy proposition to be known as a STAR WARS fan. First, we had to put up with the great embarrassment of the clownish Jar Jar and the gut wrenching ""acting"" from the muppet known as Jake Lloyd in PHANTOM MENACE. Then came the laughably stilted dialog and the clumsily told love story from ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Fans far and wide were wondering what George Lucas had done to their beloved STAR WARS franchise! Something that once was so rollicking and without peer was being transformed into kiddie-pandering, muppet populated, CGI over-loaded dreck!"
21,8,Best prequel,Phantom menace was bad and attack of the clones was god awful but revenge of the sixth is a pretty good and solid movie this is what we wanted the whole prequels to be and Hayden Christiansen does a pretty good job of acting it really only has some small problems like the Vader NOOOO other then that nice fun Star Wars movie
22,10,A movie to bring balance to the two Trilogies...,"I personally am more of a fan of the original trilogy than what I have been of the prequels. Although I did enjoy TPM, and AOTC, they definitely were not as well done as A New Hope or Empire. I think the general criticisms of the first two prequels was lack of good story, and poor acting. First I would like to say that the acting is much better in Revenge of the Sith than the first two prequels, but what truly stood out in this movie was the story. It was delivered perfectly, for the first time since Empire, Lucas connected emotionally with his audience. The last hour of the movie was especially powerful. Although probably not planned, I think this movie will be the bridge that brings the old star wars sheep back into the fold. Just as Anakin eventually brings balance to the force, Revenge of the Sith will bring balance back to the Star Wars Universe. And judging by the reaction of the test audience I was part of, everyone I was with feels the same way, no one left their seat for at least a couple minutes after the movie ended."
23,,A Damn Good Movie!,"Upon seeing Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith early this morning, I let it sink in all day to form my opinion. After all that thought, I concluded that this was a damn good movie... and probably my favorite of all 6 episodes (definitely of the episodes 1-3)! "
24,9,"Every line is sewed, every thought is ended!","I know a lot hates the Prequels, for a lot of reason. Some is as how they show the things we heard about in the Originals. They are entirely different, than what we imagined. This is what I like. That the episodes show how things escalated, and that how things turned so black & white."
25,10,"The saga ends, or does it?","The last of the star wars films to be made and done in spectacular style. The only thing with this film is that it relies too much on digital technology, which causes it to lose some of the charm of the original trilogy."
26,10,Probably the best of all 11 Star Wars movies,"After five largely odious episodes, ""Revenge of the Sith"" was rewarding enough to redeem the franchise for me. There was no theatricals, no overacting, no brinkmanship, no obnoxious teasing and taunting between the male and female protagonists and, above all, no more garish protracted scenes of ugly sentient alien beings that had driven me berserk in the previous episodes. (CGI really did the trick, I guess.) The lightsaber duel scenes were also much livelier and more fun to watch."
27,10,"The Best Star Wars Film Of All Time, Othello For The Millennial Generation","In 2002, George Lucas took a multitude of creative risks in both writing and directing, raising his ""Star Wars"" saga (And the Fantasy genre in general) to a level of maturity, intelligence and emotional depth not seen since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" with his second film of the prequel trilogy, ""Attack of the Clones."" (Fanboys hated it.) The final film in his prequel trilogy, ""Revenge of the Sith"", surpasses even franchise juggernaut ""Empire"" in terms of story, acting, themes, drama and characters. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a very far cry from the relatively lighthearted and optimistic original trilogy. ""Star Wars Episode III""'s bite matches its bark, its epic battles used to elevate already heavy substance to the tale of a good person losing everything to a tragic flaw, much like in Shakespearean tragedy."
28,10,The Saga is indeed complete,"When George Lucas announced over 10 years ago that he was going to make prequels to his original trilogy, this was the movie everyone was expecting. Everything that happens in this one chapter, ties together all the other 5 movies, completely. Starting with Episode I when Anakin Skywalker was a young child on Tatooine, a lot of what happens in that movie explains why he turns to the dark side. Anakins inability to let go of his past, and constantly worry about his mother, is a major factor that Sidious uses to turn him to the Dark Side of the Force."
29,3,Failed I have. Move to Canada I must.,"Despite almost 30 years of warm up, Lucas still didn't come up with a <br /><br /> strong enough character motivation to explain Anakin becoming Darth <br /><br /> Vader.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Now when I watch the original do I have to imagine a sniveling, pouty <br /><br /> little punk in the suit? Lucas gave James Earl Jones some of his <br /><br /> trademark magic dialogue for his return: ""Nooooooo!"". Thanks, George.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> I love how they have C3PO's memory wiped at the end, as if that closes <br /><br /> the plot hole. R2 would have been able to remind him. They should have <br /><br /> mentioned disabling R2's ability to fly and somersault out of planes <br /><br /> too.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Yes, this is the best of the new 3. It couldn't be worse than the <br /><br /> first, which only avoids the title of ""Worst Film of All Time"" because <br /><br /> it wasn't shot on film.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The political parallels are the best thing the film has going for it. <br /><br /> However, I would like to remind everyone that ""If you're not with me <br /><br /> you're my enemy,"" has been said for a MILLION years! If you want a real <br /><br /> laugh try attributing anything to W and convincing them it is a quote <br /><br /> he came up with other than his malapropisms.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The flipping Yoda is stupid. I know some geek somewhere thought it <br /><br /> would be really coolbut it isn't.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Ian McDiarmid gives a pretty good performance, but the silly faces he <br /><br /> makes while shocking people remind one why he is otherwise noticeably <br /><br /> absent from the annals of film history.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Keisha Castle-Hughes with the tiny part is pretty funny. The best <br /><br /> actress nominee walking behind the casket of the best supporting <br /><br /> actress nominee.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Ummmwhy did Padme die? She was ""giving up""? When she had two new kids <br /><br /> to look out for? Maybe if they had her give birth, have the kids hide, <br /><br /> go to try to win Anakin back and he kills her the movie might have <br /><br /> actually worked.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Sorry, Fanboys, I know you are all ready to dive back into the pool, <br /><br /> but this was still stale, unengaging and trite. I wish Lucas had never <br /><br /> made these three. There isn't a single moment in the entire new trilogy <br /><br /> that conveys the thrills of the trash compactor scene in the first <br /><br /> trilogy, or the fight on Hoth orwell, anything, even anything from <br /><br /> THX-1138. It's junk. If you'd held out after Episode 1 and demanded <br /><br /> better you might have got better, maybe he would have given up <br /><br /> directing like he did after Episode 4, but you didn't and they're crap. <br /><br /> If this is your idea of good then you deserve Jar Jar and what the <br /><br /> movie studios give you.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Sorry if this isn't a funny arch review but I found how terrible these <br /><br /> movies are, along with Lucas's systematic violation of our memories <br /><br /> with the pathetic changes he made to the original to be seriously <br /><br /> depressing. The man has no judgment. Why would Anakin at the end of <br /><br /> ""Jedi"" reappear as Haydn Christensen? He would appear as the redeemed <br /><br /> old shell he was when he died, like he did originally. Any fool could <br /><br /> see that except the fool with the control. Lucas makes studio control <br /><br /> look good.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> A friend said this and I agree: what do I feel about this film? Relief <br /><br /> that it is all over."
30,9,This is hated?,"Don't know about you guys but this movie is what i'd call a near-to-perfect masterpiece. At the end of 2020, i'd say that this is the most meme generated movie ever, imo. For instance, the ""It's over Anakin, i have the high ground, don't try it."" People harshly criticized the screenplay even when they know it's suppose to be like that. George Lucas told from the beginning itself that Star Wars is a Space opera. It's a space opera sub genre. So it's supposed to be a melodramatic movie. But instead, knowing this, people criticized the actors, Hayden particularly. Well there's nothing we can do when it is actually ""Star Wars fans who hate Star Wars"". I have to admit that TPM & AOTC both were pretty messed up in some ways but not this one."
31,7,The end of the beginning,"Of the three prequels this is probably the best although it does suffer from George's addiction to CGI special effects, it seems that because it is possible to have hundreds of ships in a battle he has to have hundreds even though it just looks cluttered. It also suffers some what because we know what has to happen as this is a link between the prequels and Star Wars; Obi-Wan and Yoda have to survive and Anakin has to become Darth Vader, this of course is unavoidable."
32,10,Blown Away!,"I love Star Wars but to be honest I wasn't expecting to be as totally enthralled by Revenge of the Sith like I am. Knowing the final outcome I thought how good can this one be? Well, it met my expectations, and went above and beyond them. I am so overwhelmed by all the visuals, the action, the emotion ... George Lucas is a genius. Hayden Christensen pulled off the transformation (emotionally and physically) superbly. The action was non-stop as was the emotional turmoil. Many true to life themes. Wow! I just can't say enough. Everyone must see this movie. If you're not already a Star Wars fan you will be after Episode III. I feel like I finally ""get"" the entire series. I have closure now. This is just THE movie to see this year. Like I said not just because it's a great Star Wars movie but because it is just a great movie period. Go see it - you won't be disappointed. You might think you know what's going to happen but they give us so much more than just straight cut answers. This is so much more than the missing piece of the storyline - this is IT! This is why we were blessed with Episodes 5-6 to begin with."
33,9,Star wars prequels #3: revenge of the sith,"Not only is this the best star wars prequel, but the best star wars film in the entire saga and here is why, I appreciate how it has a dark theme, all of the actors do an amazing job, and Anakin's turn to the dark side is brilliant, and it's a perfect setup for the original trilogy, and speaking of the original trilogy, it also answers a lot of questions from the original trilogy for those who didn't read the book series, such as how is darth Vader Luke's father, how did Darth Vader come to be, why was obi wan hiding away, and many more, I'd give it a 10/10, but the other 2 prequels we're disappointing, and the music, oh my god, the music is perfectly timed and not a bad soundtrack in the bunch."
34,10,An all time favorite,"Simply put; it's not a perfect film, yet it is. It's from a simpler time. You can buy a 200 dollar meal from a swanky restaurant but your moms home cooking will always be better. That is ROTS."
35,9,"Some flawed minor things, but everything you can expect of a SW title.",There was one major thing that I disliked about this movie when I watched it in the Cinema. The transition of Anakin to the Dark Side is unconvincing.
36,10,My Favorite Star Wars Film,Introduction:
37,10,not the best Star Wars movie but my favorite,"Maybe its norstalgia but this is one of my favorite movies ever. Ive seen it up to 20 times from my childhood until now beeing 20 years old and I have to say that the movie gives me a feeling no other movie was able to give. Its just this Star Wars feeling that makes these films so special. A combination of the characters, music, feelings, you know what I mean. One of my favorites."
38,10,I absolutely love that film so much! Wow!,Best film ever of the prequel trilogy! My favourite film! I love all those battles!
39,,This is where the fun begins.,Not a single Star Wars movie has surpassed this in the last 15 years...
40,9,That's more like it,"So much better than the first two movies. Quite dark, action sequences great. McGregor really starting to feel like OB1 now. The Saber battles seem more realistic. They fight how you would expect, no spins and showing off but gritty and with power. Good use of C3PO and R2, General Grevious good and great scenes from Palpatine and Yoda. Interesting story now as we see how Anakin was turned."
41,3,A disgrace,Let me start by saying quickly that I am a huge Star Wars fan like many others however I have no problem admitting Ep. 1 & 2 were mediocre films. I thought to myself that if RotS lived up to the story and to the hype that it would be all better. It turns out the effect was the exact opposite. After this installment I will probably never watch the prequels again with their lack of plot progression and clunky conclusion. 
42,9,My favorite of the prequel trilogy,"I thoroughly enough this end to the trilogy. It's both a great film and a great Star Wars film. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's in my top three. That honor belongs to the origins trilogy; this movie probably falls fourth above the Phantom Menace (another underrated film). Enough about that now on to the movie. This movie is everything that you want in a Star Wars film. It is a well-written film with some scenes of great drama and action. Also contrary to most opinions this movie has some fine acting. Now yes Hayden Christensen is not a great actor; he is much better in this movie than he was in the last one. He also doesn't need to be great in this movie. There is such a strong supporting cast of actors that his sub-par performance doesn't even hinder this film. Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are both easily the best parts of this movie. Their just so enjoyable to watch that it's really hard to dislike them in this movie. Having franchise legends Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker, Frank Oz, and Ian McDiarmid make this movie just so much cooler as well, and there are not even the only big-name actors in this. Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson are the two huge name guys in this movie and while there not in much there always enjoyable to see so that's another positive to this movie., Jimmy Smits and Bruce Spence are not huge named actors but they're big enough to say that they provide a good positive feel to this movie. The best part of this movie has nothing to with most of those actors though. It has to do with only two of them Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen. Their fight scene at the end is one of the best of this franchise may be behind only the 1st Luke-Vader matchup and the Qui Gonn-Darth Maul fight. The scene has not one but two iconic lines ""I have the high ground"" and ""You were the chosen one"". I want to give this movie a 10 but it's not as good as the originals. So all of these things being said this movie is a solid 9/10."
43,10,"The only prequel that is not just good, but great!","Heroes fall, villains rise and the legend begins! This film is what Star Wars is all about, it has epic space battles, lightsabre duels, and a variety of cool locations, but most importantly it has so much quotable dialogue, epic moments and iconic scenes that it more than makes up for Episodes 1&2! The score is absolutely perfect, the action scenes are truly awesome and there rarely is a dull moment! All the villains are great, but Sidious stands above all, Ian McDiarmid - You'll love to hate this guy! "
44,9,FITTING END TO THE PREQUEL.,Fitting end to the prequels! The culmination of a two other movies that ends with so much emotion weight and a great pay off that transition to the original trilogy.
45,9,Story + Special Effects = Success!,"(No Spoilers!) Excitedly submitting my comments two weeks prior to the opening of the film (after a preview screening at the Ziegfeld Theater), I am thrilled to add to what appears to be a growing wave of positive reaction to Lucas's effort in Episode III. As a life-long fan deeply caught in a love hate relationship with Episodes I and II, I cautiously awaited this final installment. I felt in my heart that this would be a great film, but feared that somehow I would again be disappointed. Maybe I was starting to succumb to the notion that I no longer had the spirit of that six year old boy who was mesmerized by the original Star Wars, long ago in 1977 at that far away NJ theater. Maybe."
46,10,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"All criticisms of this film are tired and boring, and all completely untrue. Simply think of a criticism you've heard about this film or any of the prequels and you'll realise, if you think about it, that it's completely null and void. Hayden's acting is absolutely brilliant, Jar Jar is there for comic relief, and therefore is a good character who fulfils his job perfectly. The CGI is of a incredibly high quality given when the films came out, I can't think of one thing I saw in any of these films that I thought ""that's poorly done"". George Lucas is a genius, there is no doubt about it. People complain about the politics of the first film, I don't see this as even a tiny problem for without them Palpatine's plan would not have been as seemingly brilliantly executed as it was. The way he claims power with the support of the senate, getting rid of almost all the Jedi is a work of cinematic genius and George Lucas deserves far more credit. The end battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is absolutely astonishing and one of the best lightsaber duels in the whole of Star Wars canon. This film is possibly my second favourite after a New Hope. What a film it was, absolutely brilliant. I am certain that I will see it reach an 8.0 within my lifetime!"
47,8,surprised.,i loved star wars as a kid. i grew disenchanted with the new trilogy. i was prepared for another letdown.
48,10,Fantastic,"It's a fantastic movie. Many would say The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars series, but I personally think Revenge of the Sith is the best. Every time I watch a Star Wars movie, there are parts that get a little boring, but this movie is not at all. I know what will happen in the end, but it's so exciting to see the process. And the lightsaber battle was so good I couldn't take my eyes off it. The prequel trilogy is worth seeing on its own. I love this movie."
49,10,Now I get it!,"Just got back from seeing Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. I'm not a big Star Wars fan but I have watched it with friends who are fans or seen it on TV re-runs growing up. I didn't dress up or even go on opening night. I wasn't even planning on seeing it but I was invited by some friends. It was not a disappointment at all. It had action from beginning to end. Drama, comedy and mystery too. Not much surprises but quite a few sad parts that were tear jerker to a few people in the theater. This Star Wars movie basically shows how a good kid turns bad as a result of bad influences."
50,10,Perfectly done,"I'm now rewatching all the movies, and this one is probably the best.<br /><br />It not only connects all the dots, it also keep you focus on the screen until the last moment.<br /><br />Really enjoyed it!"
51,10,OMG!! What was THAT!!!,What was that... Holy macaroni... this movie set new standards for Sci-fi movies!! Where should I start...
52,7,Final trilogy is perfect and masterfully completed without gaps,"The picture deals with Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) who joins Obi Wan Kenobi to rescue Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) , facing off Count Dooku-Darth Tyranus (Christopher Lee). After that , he returns to his lover , Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) , and will be born their two children (Luke and Leia) . Annakin is tempted to the dark side by Palpatine and he'll confront the Jedi council (Samuel L.Jackson : Maze Windu and Joda : Frank Oz) and Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits)."
53,1,"Better than I & II, but still mediocre at best","*Before you begin, this whole thing is one big spoiler. So don't read unless you've seen the show.*"
54,,Predictable,"By know you know the most important things: the acting and dialog are unbearable (except in the case of McDiarmid), and the effects are busy but competent. The story spins and spins until it ends where we know it must with each step being supremely predicable."
55,8,The darker Star Wars movie,"This is a great Star Wars movie because of its dark point of turn and its awesome lightsaber fights. The story becomes darker and darker, and it is getting our attention all the way. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor play well in their roles. All the action scenes are incredible, and they give you the special, peculiar and positive Star Wars vibes that only this movie can do. The CGI is good, but the music is stunning. Recommending for everyone!"
56,10,Good,One of my favorite Star Wars movies. A lot of pieces fall into place in this one. Does a good job of showing the tragedy of Anakins fall.
57,8,The best film of the prequel trilogy,"After the crushing disappointment of ""The Phantom Menace"" the Star Wars series got back on track with ""Attack of the Clones"", which set the stage for the concluding chapter of the saga, ""Revenge of the Sith"". Luckily for moviegoers, it seems that George Lucas saved the best for last."
58,10,Perfection,In my opinion this is the best star wars movie ever. This has everything you could ask for in a star wars movie.
59,9,One Word........ Fantastic,SPOILERS AHEAD!
60,10,The greatest movie of all time!,"I'm going to sum up Star Wars Episode 3 in one word: AMAZING! In my opinion, this was the greatest movie out of the Star Wars saga. Better then the original, just AMAZING."
61,10,Completely Satisfying Completion to the Original Six Chapter Saga,"Although most Fans Attended Movie Screens for the Conclusion to the Original ""Star Wars"" Saga (6 Films in the making), Anticipation was not what it was for the Previous 2 Prequels."
62,7,The Dark Side Rises,"""Revenge of the Sith"" uses more computer generated images than the two movies before it, only it is brighter and richer in detail than ""Attack of the Clones"". But it visually loses to ""The Phantom Menace"" because real sets, real locations and practical effects, when used well, work best. The plot is easily superior to both ""Episode I"" and ""Episode II"". It does introduce some elements that have never been there before and some of the important events did happen off screen, but in general, it works with the material that has been built across the three movies. And regardless of the great amount of action that it has all over the place, ""Episode III"" does not even come close to suffocating under its own spectacularly huge weight. It may have primitive dialogue here and there, it may have primitive acting here and there, it may have too much ridiculous lightsaber swinging, it may still want you to believe that human soldiers are somehow better than battle droids, and it may not have much Christopher Lee, but it is beautiful, meaningful and bold, especially, for a mainstream piece of entertainment."
63,8,"The fastest paced, most exciting, best character developing, and yes, best Star Wars movie, period","I was ready for Revenge of the Sith to be a moderate step up from the last two prequels, but it was in a different league and should be compared with the epic fantasy movies of our time: the original trilogy, LOTR, the best of Harry Potter and the MCU. It doesn't try to do too much and succeeds on two major fronts: Anakin's character development and the exciting action sequences. Anakin's complete lack of character development was one of the driving factors of why Attack of the Clones was so bad, but we see a complete 180 here. He's given a much more well-rounded script and shows the struggle of wanting to become a great Jedi and seeing murkiness in whether there's a true binary good and bad as well as balancing selfishness and selflessness. His transformation is completely plausible, as you see his doubts in the Jedi and the allure of saving his wife and greater power. The political plot was extremely well done - I said I wanted lots more Palpatine, and I was not let down here. Some really interesting parallels you can draw to modern society too, with democratic people and societies acting as the Jedi and dictatorships as the Sith, and democracy falls due to their own elitism and not realizing the consolidation of power until it was too late, with too few checks and balances. The Jedi assumed themselves invincible and even when they thought there was a Sith, still didn't take it as seriously as it deserved. Anakin's descent is really well done, but other characters like Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Palpatine are also very well done, and even Padme is palatable in this one."
64,10,A great ending for a great saga,"The day has finally arrived. After almost 30 years of the creation of a mythical saga, George Lucas has finally has closed the circle. It is now complete, with the realization of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. And the good news is that the closing of the circle, which is this movie, is more than satisfying: it is excellent.  More or less three years have passed since the events of Attack of the Clones. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is now a Jedi Knight, and his mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is now a Jedi Master and part of the Jedi Council. Padmé Amidala, the senator of Naboo (Natalie Portman) is married to Anakin Skywalker (although it is prohibited for the Jedi to marry) and is about to give birth to two twins. The Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiamird) has been made prisoner by the separatist forces and is being held in General Grievous' (a separatists Cyborg leader) cruiser, the Invisible Hand. Obi-Wan and Anakin have been sent onto a mission to rescue the Chancellor from the clutches of Grievous, and even though Anakin gets to finally defeat Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and rescue the Chancellor, everything seems darker now, as Anakin and the Council start to discover the Chancellor's real identity. The film starts with a thrilling, adventurous and somehow comic action sequence: the space battle, and then the events to rescue Chancellor Palpatine. The space battle is pretty intense, and has some interesting additions such as the Buzz droids that attack Obi-Wan's fighter. Now, when both Jedi reach the Invisible Hand, and with the incursion of R2 to help them, some of the movie's best (and only) comic events happen. They all involve R2, Obi-Wan, and some Trade Federation droids, but the good thing about them is that they are not childish jokes such as the ones that appeared in Episode I. But after the rescue of the Chancellor is when things start to turn bad. In the second third of the movie is in which most of the most important plot revealing sequences happen, and in which the plot of the movie starts to reveal itself. In this third is when most of the action sequences stop to appear (momentarily). Although there is Obi-Wan's assignment to go to Utapau and kill General Grievous, we feel that this third of the movie mainly involves the developing of Anakin and Padmé's secret love and trust, and the decisions that Anakin must make towards Palpatine and the Jedi Council. But, talking about lack of action, there is some action in this movie, and it's pretty good. There is the above mentioned space battle, a chase between General Grievous (riding an unicycle) and Obi-Wan (riding an Utapaun, lizard-like creature), a lightsabre fight between Palpatine and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), one between Palpatine and Yoda, and the famous and awaited final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin. These are all great and are magnificently choreographed and shot and edited. Nothing has been ever seen before. In the end, I think it can be said that this is definitely the best of the prequel movies, and, for me, in my top six of all the Star Wars movies, it would be in a first place tie along with The Empire Strikes Back. It is a great conclusion to a 20+ journey created by a visionary, full of drama, action, and... sadness. I bet most of the people will want to watch A New Hope after watching Revenge of the Sith, because of the feeling that is left after the end credits. It happened to me. But... it's definitely a great conclusion to a great saga."
65,9,Great watch,At this present time in our life 2021
66,10,The Saga is Complete,"Revenge of the Sith is my favorite movie (not only considering the six movies of the saga, but it's one of my favorite films ever). I love the prequels and I like the original trilogy. Star Wars prequel trilogy has a terrific scenery, lots of spectacular scenes and fabulous elaborate costumes."
67,5,Good thing this is the last one!,This shows how Anakin Skywalker (Haydn Christensen) became Dath Vader with all political intrigues and such. The film will be incomprehensible if you haven't seen Episodes 1 and 2.
68,1,The hype is strong with this one...,(r#94)
69,7,Get your kicks with Order 66.,"I had hoped, when I decided to watch this prequels again with my son, that ""Revenge of the Sith"" might be good enough that it makes up for suffering through the first two again. Whilst I would never argue that it's a perfect film, I would say that not only is it much better than Episodes 1 and 2, but that it's a good film in its own right."
70,9,Underappreciated epic film,"This film was what the prequel trilogy should have been. The phantom menace and attack of the clones were sub par but I believe this film nailed it for the most part. Aside from some corny dialogue and questionable choreography, this movie had some of the best moments in the saga. Anakin's turn was very well done, especially during the Mustafar scenes. It is a heartbreaking tragedy and I wish the previous 2 films would have set up this one much better. Nonetheless, this movie picks up the slack and delivers a great back story for the original films that we all love. Plenty of epic scenes to fulfill its hype. Obviously from a film making standpoint, this film is not on the empire strikes backs level, but from a entertainment value perspective I believe Revenge of the sith holds a light to empire."
71,8,"Enjoyed as a child, loved as an adult.","This film encapsulated everything that had been loved about the previous two films and doubled down. This meant less jar jar, more lightsabers and a wonderful turn from Ian McDiarmid. This film looks gorgeous and the world building is amazing. Yes the dialogue is ridiculous, yes some of the acting is wooden, but my god does this film make me happy. After all, isn't that what cinema is about?"
72,9,Could have been the greatest.,Im gonna get straight to the point and say that Revenge Of The Sith could have been the movie to beat if they had focused more on the dialogue and lines. There's just some scenes with very bland dialogue which sadly brings the rating down a little.
73,3,disappointing and banal,"To be frank, this film really really disintegrated badly from what I thought could have been a very good and fitting end to a series that was declining and needed some much needed originality injected into it. Alas, Lucas put too many childish jokes, too many predictable clichés, too many dull and incomplete analogies, too many banal and poor acted sequences and FAR too much incredibly poor dialogue - spiced up with the odd flashy sequence for the masses to be entertained and Lucas hoped he could get away with shortchanging everyone again with his drivel."
74,6,The Best One of the New Trilogy,This 2005 film is the best of the newer trilogy. However it still has major flaws and a paper thin story. The actors can not compensate for a story that really is razor thin.
75,10,"Revenge of the Sith, a spectacular Star Wars film - My Ultimate Review","Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith is personally one of my favorite Star Wars movies, coming second after Empire Strikes Back. It has everything a Star Wars movie should have, but I'm not blind it has its flaws and so has the whole Prequel Trilogy. But what the trilogy has is a superb story, one that you will remember your whole life. Episode III takes all the story and character development from past two films and from books and a specific animated show, The Clone Wars.<br /><br />Revenge of the Sith and the two first trilogies is 6 films I have seen more times than I can remember and I love them, the prequel trilogy its flaws and Revenge of the Sith For too but it's mostly the dialogue but the overall story is incredible. The story is set three years after Attack of the Clones and it has Anakin Skywalker turning to the dark side and thus becoming Darth Vader, it's a transformation I'll never get tired of seeing. Having now seen Clone Wars I can say that it helps a lot in terms of character development and the important moments between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, his turn to the dark side become much clearer. But for the viewers who haven't seen that TV series, it's alright. Watching the prequel trilogy, all three films is enough to get the full picture of Anakin's turn to the dark side. George Lucas' use of symbolism and other visual storytelling is there and he successfully told the story."
76,9,Lucas does good !,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan since I was eight years old back in 1977, I was disappointed by the previous two efforts (Phantom & Attack) But I was thinking maybe I'm a bit too old now for this and its aimed at todays younger generation or maybe I just miss all the original actors playing all our favourite characters. Anyway I had the pleasure of sitting in on Revenge of the Sith's classification screening yesterday and to my surprise I was really impressed by it."
77,9,What Star Wars Should Be,"Star Wars Revenge of the Sith is my personal favorite Star Wars Movie. It brings the Prequel Trilogy to an exciting, dramatic, and emotional end helping shape timeline wise the next movies to come (the Original Trilogy) The story is an exciting one and contains some of the best duels in all of Star Wars which is strengthen by John Williams incredible soundtrack. The emotion and chemistry showcased between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGreggor) is what makes the film hit even harder. Years later this movies popularity and view in the fanbase continues to grow as more and more people see the film for what it is, an incredible Star Wars movie."
78,1,Kurosawa spins in his grave,"Myths put to rest by this ""film"":"
79,8,Better...,This is the one where all the bits in episodes 1 and 2 were attached to the plot threads which were in place as episode 4 opened so dynamically.
80,10,Top 2 not 2,"In my opinion, this is the greatest Star Wars film ever made. And a whole lotta people in 2021 agree with me. I have grown up watching this movie. Although the old generation does not like it because it is tonally different than the originals, they have to understand what makes it great; the world building and lore. Revenge of the Sith and the prequels in general bring a whole new world to Star Wars. Previously it was a bunch of white dudes w weird names, mass amts of people in white armor, a bad guy dressed in a peculiar black suit w a red laser sword, and a black dude who flys ships. The prequels, especially ROTS, exponentially builds the Star Wars universe in a glamorous way, giving us a whole new perspective on a galaxy far far away. Back to the movie though. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman stepped up BIG TIME on their roles and their love story was finally convincing. Ewan Mcregor was fantastic as always, but Ian McDermott stole the show. His performance as empire palpatine in ROTS is objectively a top 5 performance in Star Wars, arguably top 3. The overall tone and feel of the movie is a spiritual journey as you watch these characters go through unbelievable events. Lucas also gives us the most beloved characters in the prequels, such as Padmé, Obi Wan, Yoda, Mace, Anakin, and more. To have those emotional attachments to the characters you love so much makes this movie so good. Not to mention it has the best lightsaber fight in the franchise, the movie delivered on all fronts. The story, worldbuilding, performances, tonal feel, and more make this a 10/10. The only reason this is at a 7.5 is because of old head haters who didn't understand it. The new generation loves it and rightfully so; as George Lucas, Natalie Portman, and Hayden Christiansen are finally getting the respect they deserve. IMBD please refresh your ratings soon as the reviews for this movie will progressively go up as time passes."
81,8,This where the fun begin,"Where to begin with this film. It's really great better than the first two prequels. The final battles/ending was so emotional like seeing baby luke. However there are some flaws which are also from the other movie. First, they should've explored more with the back story to some of the characters like general grevious (who has his own flaw but I will get back to that). Like it felt just like the others missed opportunities and doesn't help the world building that much. Another thing is the dialogue is still meh/bland/forced but it's not awful like with the other two. Now to general grievous, this character is very one dimensional expect for the Darth sidious talk scene but other than that it feels very one dimensional. It felt like there was more to him but eh there was nothing there. Honestly he's an alright character because of the clone wars made him a little bit more enjoyable not all one dimensional. Not hating on general grievous but just there are some flaws. And overall this film is great the best of the prequels but still has flaws."
82,10,The best Star Wars Movie for me,"Its just amazing,fantastic and good in everyway. I enjoyed every second as a star wars fan. Good pace,amazing acting from Anakin,and Obi wan Kenobi is my favorite character. Very enjoyable."
83,10,Fantastic film,"Easily one of the better of the star wars films, really enjoyed this. Lots of wisdom and philosophical themes going on also. Really good job by George Lucas."
84,5,And Lucas' failure is complete.,***Spoilers!****
85,6,Not bad for a Star Wars movie - though that's not really saying much,"I had had a difficult day and needed some mindless entertainment. I wasn't disappointed. Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith has had some of the worst elements of the series pruned - gone are most of the irritating cuddly little creatures aimed at the spin-off toys market (there's no shortage of other spin-offs), and the disingenuous racist stereotypes suggested in other episodes seem to have been cleaned up. It even has a degree of political correctness with a throwaway jibe that recalls George (bad Jedi: ""If you're not with me, you are my enemy"") Bush and the parallels with modern day dictators (whether they trumpet a corrupt democracy or a brutal regime behind their warmongering) are apparent. One of the flaws of other Star Wars episodes has been the simplistic 'ultimate good versus ultimate evil' debate - in this one, the two warring sides are seen as separated more by pain, fear, misunderstanding and miscommunication than anything else. There are slightly less overtly religious references, although 'The Force' still has an elitist hierarchy based on some poorly defined universal power. Probably the only character you'd trust to run anything might be the genuinely peace-loving and diplomatic Padme, a female icon played by Natalie Portman and love for whom sparks off more 'evil'."
86,9,surprisingly good,"Damn lucas, couldn't you just make something like this earlier, it almost looked like someone else has made it."
87,1,well...what did you expect?,"Well, after having my hopes dashed for another groundbreaking trilogy by episodes I and II, I really wasn't expecting all that much from III and for once, I wasn't disappointed. I can accept that Lucas made these for ""a new generation"", but I can't help but feel .... an addition of open contempt for the ""old generation"" while watching them. Quite frankly, George Lucas is a lousy director and storyteller."
88,,A troubled film.,"I'm sorry, but I just don't know what else to say about this film. This is truly a piece of cinema that is struggling to entertain. With some of the most impressive visuals seen in the last 100 years of filmmaking, one wonders what went amiss here."
89,9,Best of the prequels,"This movie still has a lot of the same problems the other 2 prequel movies have like the very weird dialogue, bad cgi in some scenes, bad acting at moments, etc. But this one compensates those problemas with the great story that it tells, how Anakin became Darth Vader, one of the most iconic and badass villains in history. The plot is really interesting and catches your attention inmmediatly, and after being quiet for a little during the middle, the movie blasts off at the middle. The stakes are at their highest, everything is going wrong, our heroes have lost their path, everyone is dying, the republic is collapsing, the empire is rising, everything is great. The final parts feel a little too long but they arent boring by any means, theyre still entertaining and this movie made the prequels leave on a high note."
90,9,Brilliant conclusion to the prequel triology,"Underrated but very good conclusion to the prequels. A major jump up in quality.<br /><br />Links up episode 3 to the original films perfectly.<br /><br />The battle scenes, the lightsaver duals - Anakin versus Kenobi, Windu versus Sidious and Yoda versus Sidious are all awesome.<br /><br />A must watch."
91,6,Better than expected. Best of 1-3,"After Episode 1, I had nearly written off the Star Wars series. When I saw Episode 2, I found myself interested again. However, after 2, I have to admit that I dreaded the release of Episode 3. I knew that what I felt was the weakest and most irritating aspect of Episode 2 - the love story between Anakin and Padmé - would become a major theme in episode 3. While I understood then, as I do now, that this was an important element of the overall plot of the series, I never felt compelled to care about it. Portman and Christenson just did not seem to have any chemistry and I felt that the scripts became clichéd, one dimensional and pretentious in every one of their scenes together. "
92,9,Rise of vader,This was a great finnish to what was a mixed bag of a trillogy and had some real amazing battles that left you amazed and on edge of your seat.
93,10,Awesome,"People say that all of the prequels are bad but this movie proves those people wrong. it succeeded on telling people how Anakin turned into darth vader and it personally is my favorite star wars movie. Sure, its PG-13 but isn't all of the new ones?"
94,6,While not as spectacularly dreadful as Episodes I and II this is certainly no 'The Empire Strikes Back',"The culmination of decades of work for writer-director George Lucas, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith completes the epic space-opera sextet which burst onto our screens in 1977, and brings the tragic story of Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker and his transformation into the iconic villain Darth Vader to a close."
95,4,Revenge of the Myth ...,"In the mid-1950s, the Ford Motor Co. introduced the Thunderbird, a snazzy, little sports car that made history. The '55, '56 and '57 models are revered as classics. Subsequent models made into the 1960's were bigger and gaudier, but they remained uniquely styled and rather special. By the 1970's, Ford tried to make the Thunderbird evolve into a luxury car, which meant it kept getting bigger and heavier and uglier and busier and less and less special. By the time the Thunderbird was discontinued in 1998 it bore little resemblance to the original T-Bird. The STAR WARS series is the Thunderbird of motion pictures. "
96,1,Why???,"Firstly minor spoilers so beware! I just watched this film and am a bit annoyed at the waste of money and the loss of a few hours of my life. This film is nothing special at all in the effects department ( the jumping in the fight scenes is terrible half the time) and i will never forgive the Wookie doing a Tarzan impression???? Come on he has had a VERY long time to think up the story and this is all he can come out with? If this was a stand alone film it would have been panned by everyone but there seems to be a ""aura"" around star wars that means that no wrong can be done and that George is some kind of film making hero.I saw all the originals when they came out and they were good but the last 3 (ep 1,2 and 3) are rubbish,its all ""hey we can do cool effects! who needs a decent plot or dialogue?"" He has said that he will never do the last 3 and i am sorry to say that makes me happy,maybe 1 day someone who believes in the epic story star wars was meant to be will come along and finish it the way it was meant to be."
97,8,Another Star Wars hit.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones, which I both liked very much, it's now the turn for episode III Revenge Of The Sith. Again I thought the story was more than okay, very enjoyable, so again no complaint from me here. By watching the saga in chronological order you get some surprises earlier than in order by release date but that doesn't bug me at all. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. Some CGI's are better than others, but it's not really an issue as the futuristic landscapes and sceneries make up for it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the third movie of eleven in barely 24 hours for me, tonight I'll watch Solo in the hope the quality stays the same."
98,1,"This Movie Sucked, and it's George Lucas' Fault","The first two movies were poorly written, poorly acted, and it was entirely obvious that all of the two years it took to make them both went into it's irritating and unnecessary special effects. I was told that this one was different. I was told that this was the film that redeemed all of that nonsense. By the end of watching that crime of a film, I felt as though George Lucas had reached into my pocket and stolen my eight dollars, not to mentioned reached into my soul and taken a big piece."
99,1,Just another victim of the dream-killing plague,"Having seen the first movie when it reached France as I was about 10, it left a vivid mark on my imagination, and I kind of treasured the little bit of fantasy it brought to me among probably millions of other people."
100,6,"Yo mama is so ugly, she put the ""ug"" in ""Ugnaught""","Of all the Star Wars prequels, Revenge of the Sith wastes the biggest potential."
101,7,Pretty good,"A lot of people were let down by episodes I and II, but this film seemed to take into account all the feedback. It is tighter, the stakes are more dramatic and it is relatively less cheesy. It starts with some riveting outer space action and never lets down its frenetic pace as it closes the Star Wars prequel series with a bang and leads to the main trilogy."
102,7,The Dark side or the bright side?,"This Star Wars Movie was so interesting . We know more about luke's father , Anakin and why he choosed the dark side .All the Story behind it , and why . This was pretty tense and some betrayal and also some revelation . This Star Wars movie could be my favorite one . I enjoyed it and the final battle was so terrific. I recommend it."
103,8,Definitely the best of the prequels,"As far as the prequels are concerned, Revenge of the Sith is by far the best. This is a great climax to an ok trilogy. Palpatine's turn into the Emperor and Anakin's character evolution by far make this movie what it is. The battle between Anakin and Obi Wan, while a little long, holds up relatively well too. The dialogue in some spots are still a little cheeky, but it can be overlooked in this movie more so than in Attack of the Clones."
104,7,The birth of Darth Vader,"With the promise of being the darkest of the Star Wars film, Revenge of the Sith was the prequel we all wanted to see: how Anakin Skywalker became force of evil Darth Vader and fell into the dark side. Luckily Revenge of the Sith was the best of the prequels, but not as good as the original trilogy."
105,10,Mustafar!,"I felt the full spectrum of emotions while watching this film. While the first two prequels suffer from poor writing, acting and pacing, this movie overcomes them masterfully. The dialogue is much easier to digest, the acting is improved (especially by Hayden Christensen) and the film carries a weight and tension from start to finish. The storytelling is at a different level, with the juxtaposition in the final scenes illustrating so much more than birth and death."
106,4,Revenge of the Sith Stinks,"Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of boring. I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So said we all."
107,10,The Darkest and we LOVE it!!! If you don't like it Your LYING!!!!!,"As Kevin Smith said this one was the one those idiotic, whiny, bitchy, haters have been bitching for since the phantom menace. If they do not love what they see, their either stupid or lying."
108,,"Typical summer blockbuster, it is. Lacking detail, subtlety, performances and strong writing, it is. Impressed, I wasn't.","Star Wars was the film that pretty much created the blockbuster, tie-ins, merchandising, so it is no surprise to find that this one has all the strengths and weaknesses that we have come to associate with blockbusters. Specifically the issue that it is all noise and CGI without as much heart and good writing as would normally be required. Visually, this film will be a treat to those looking at the film on that level because it is like CGI overload  Lucas appears afraid to just have simple scenes so even personal moments in Padme's room have wide windows with constant movement behind them. On a technical it is impressive but it detracts from the story, which was what I went for, and it just ended up distracting and rather unnecessary. In the UK, one part of our terrorism laws prevents suspects using computers; at times I felt that perhaps the same measure should be taken against Lucas, to force him to focus on things other than effects."
109,1,Star Boring and painful,"I do not have words to describe how painful was to watch this movie. I admire Lucas for his innovation and I pity a man with such tremendously imaginative technical talents who cannot but two good words of dialog or story together. It's ashame that everyone with rush to see this movie (kind of reminds me of the the second two Matrix movies, lots of money spent before we all realized how truly bad they were compared to the original). I think the real problem with these prequels is that Lucas didn't allow the story to take him somewhere he had it two laid out beforehand. Any good writer will tell you that most of the time it's not good to have too much of your story already laid out that leaves your characters nothing to do and no surprises for the reader. The characters tell the good stories and guide the writer to good plot and dialog. We still do not have any good characters in any of theses three movies including ObiWan and Yoda. Even the even Emperor is reduced to a single note. And poor Christopher Lee if he thought he got the shaft in ROTK boy was he in for a big letdown in this movie. At least Peter Jackson let him die with dignity in the ROTKEE, with Lucas he had no chance. "
110,3,A beautiful shell with no heart,"This review is for people like me, namely- those who genuinely grew up with the originals (TRANSLATION: you saw them when they came out in the theater the first time, not on tape 10 years later out of curiosity for the movies all your toys were in) and have tried to focus on the good aspects of TPM and AOTC, almost out of a familial loyalty to George for how important the originals were to your youth. Those of you who agree the beginning of the end started with the EWOKS keep reading, everyone else turn away. "
111,7,"it starts out on an awful, pretentious note, but thankfully cleans up its act with a sweep of majestic power well before it ends","Now that George Lucas has cleaned up his act for the first two movies in his Star Wars prequel trilogy, we can all pat him on the back and say, ""That's more like it, George."" His third film in the trilogy, I say, still does not quite capture the magic and feeling of the original classic narrative from 1977-1983, but it's close enough, it's a lot better than ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" and, despite a poor, rushed beginning, it's a pretty good movie, though not remarkable like the originals."
112,,I still recognize Leia's Theme,"The challenge of making Revenge of the Sith (as in any other prequel) is that we all know the ending but here, for some of us, it's 28 years ago. From this angle, George Lucas did a wonderful job in bringing things full circle, moving almost seamlessly back to the beginning 28 years ago, into the ORIGINAL Star Wars (1977), which is now given a somewhat contrived title ""A New Hope""."
113,1,What did we do to deserve this?,"When you see somebody - an adult, not a child, mind you - eulogising about this movie, raving that it's the ""greatest"" or ""best"" film they've ever seen, you know the sun is genuinely setting on the human race. We're not evolving, we're regressing. If you truly believe that ROTS is the finest story ever committed to celluloid then you have my sincere pity; I cannot imagine how bad must be all the other movies you may have sat through."
114,1,"Lucas Succumbs, As He Rushes to The Dark Side!","This film is that poor I failed in being able to summarise my argument into the alloted one thousand word limit. Still, I suppose that gives me another thousand words to chide this film."
115,3,at least Jar Jar Binks didn't speak,"Well, it's finally over - the 3rd, and hopefully last, episode of Star Wars is out. This very dark installment lacks the very essence of what made Star Wars great - great characters, humor in the right places and a brilliant plot line. Episode 3 is much better than episodes 1 or 2 (which isn't saying much). It's main value is to answer all the how questions - how did Darth Vader get horribly burned? How did Luke and Leah get to where they are in episode 4? How did the transformation take place? Etc."
116,10,BEST,This is the best film ever created and it will be forever
117,9,almost as it ought to have been...,"First, i disagree with the many people who try to finger point ""their way"" of ""what it should have been"". There are cheesy scenes & there are rushed up scenes. But it's not the first time. Some complain about the final ""noo!"" scene and/or how ""easy"" Anakin is tricked into joining the ""dark side"". You have two equally insipid examples in the old movies: when Luke tells Leia he's her brother, she look numb & with an headache commercial look uuuh...i've always know it was like that...you must go... or along these lines; when (after trying to kill him) Vader announces to Luke he's his father, we get another ""noo!"" scene. In this movie a few persuasive lines of Palpatine are enough to trick Anakin; in the old series it was his son plea for mercy to bring him back...you can laugh at both...in this movie he's convinced he has just one way to save his wife and he has never found the ""regular"" teaching of the Jedis was enough, so... Some of the ""badass"" Han Solo acting and Leia's grow old FAST Now some will probably say the old ones are 10x better: i just say cheesy or rushed up is cheesy or rushed up, anytime."

119,7,Episode III Lucas Strikes Back,"At last the real George Lucas returns to the screen! Neither The Phantom Menace or Attack Of The Clones are the turkeys many people make them out to be, and Revenge Of The Sith is a return to form for the Bearded One. Sure, it has it's flaws, but it also has gravitas and a genuine sense of doom-laden, smoky bravura. To me it felt like the old Star Wars had returned, but a grown-up version."
120,8,The conclusion to how it all started,"We learn such things as the slightly ""cowardly"" General Grievous being the head of the droid army, discovering the chancellor as the Sith lord, the human clones during the clone war a set-up, and of course Anakin Skywalker becoming the one and only, Vader. I would have to consider this film the best out of the other two prequels. The movie ran along quite nicely, had lots of neat action, scenery and special effects as usual, and it greatly demonstrates how it all happened from the middle of the movie (the Sith lord looking more like himself) to the very end of it (Luke and Leia born and split apart)."
121,9,The Prequel that Rocked...,"In 2005, it was time to end the Star Wars Prequel trilogy! The previous two films in the Prequel trilogy have over the years been considered cinematic disappointments in the Star Wars saga, so it's a surprise that the final film in the trilogy would be considered one of the best in the series. "
122,8,A Thrilling Capstone Overcomes CGI and Dialog for True Tragedy,"""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is a thrilling capstone and revelation that more than a dozen hours over 28 years has built up a universe, a mythology and a galactic force whose fulcrum shockingly turns on a tear coursing down Anakin Skywalker's face. "
123,9,The saga is over,"With the release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas has brought his epic space saga to a close, and to what I would imagine is the relief of fans everywhere, he takes it out on a high note. Revenge of the Sith, is, by far, the strongest of the three prequel films Lucas began releasing in 1999."
124,9,The Best of the Prequels,"I'm making my way through all six Star Wars movies in preparation for ""The Force Awakens"", and I just watched ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith""."
125,4,Generally grievous,"The best of the final trilogy? Maybe, but that's like saying that Police Academy 6 is better than Police Academy 4. I understand why people are protective of the Star Wars saga  it's undeniably part of our cultural heritage - but let's face it, Episodes I-III will be remembered only for their sheer awfulness."
126,10,The best in the franchise so far,"This movie blew my mind as a child, I waited for years and years to see the conclusion to the greatest movie franchise of all time, to put all the puzzles together."
127,10,It's not good how much i enjoy this movie,"I might be blinded by childhood nostalgia, but this movie is amazing. The clone wars tv show definitely strengthens this movie and the prequels in general."
128,9,Wished this was darker,"This is the third and perhaps best of the prequel trilogy. The Emperor has decided to rear his head and execute all the Jedi in the universe. We see the fall of Anakin and the rise of Vader. We see the decimation of the jedi order and the birth of those that will resist the Empire. What this movie lacks in acting skills, sorry Hayden, some of this was out of your reach, it makes up for in amazing action and beautiful lightsaber duels. I just wish this had been as dark as Lucas had promised. Overall a very enjoyable film."
129,10,Best Star Wars ever,I miss the prequels so much. Disney completely ruined star wars.
130,4,Not the worst....but not far off,"I am really not sure about Episode 3! If you don't know the story by now, you must have just crawled out from under a rock! This is the film where all hell breaks loose. The Jedi are wiped out by the Emperor and Anakin (now titled Darth Vader). Luke and Leia will be born. Anakin and Obi Wan will face off above the lava we have heard so much about. Boy, does it look spectacular! Unfortunately beauty is only skin deep, and beneath the CGI skin of this film is a very hollow, empty heart! First, the positives! If you are after spectacular action, then look no further. The opening shots of the battle in space are simply jaw-dropping. The lightsaber combat is the best of the series, from the first battle against droids, to General Grievous' 4-way sabre wielding, to the spectacular fight above the lava. Even the Yoda fight (a scene which just looked plain daft in Episode 2  prompting laughs from an audience for all the wrong reasons) is impressive this time, taking place in the Senate chambers, as the green guy faces up to Palpatine. The Kashyyk battle is wonderful, with ILM giving some of their best CGI to date throughout. Jar Jar is only visible for a few seconds, and doesn't talk (thank you!) However, that is all this film is. Gloss and CGI action. The story is minor, and as weakly written as you would expect from Lucas' pen. The direction of the 'between fights' sections is dull, and Lucas has once again managed to make a bunch of great actors look like they are on stage in a Panto! The romance between Padme and Anakin is as force fed as it was in Episode 2, with no chemistry existing between the pair at all. Is this really Hayden ""Shattered Glass"" Christensen and Natalie ""Garden State"" Portman, or are they really clones? Once of what should be the most haunting and powerful scenes  where Anakin walks into the Jedi temple and is confronted with the scared children  is severely weakened by a child actor who has only just learned to read his lines, let alone saying them. Perhaps I missed something there, and maybe the scene was showing the Jedi council as an equal opportunities employer, having recruited a mental retard to the ranks! But I think not."
131,3,Noooooo!,"How good is Revenge of the Sith? Or, more pertinently, how bad is it? Because let's face it, George Lucas has earned such a reputation for mangling the fond memories of his once loyal fans that one can only be pleasantly surprised by his prequels if one has the lowest expectations."
132,9,Nothing wrong here,This was a really good end to a really good trilogy. This really sets you into a new hope if you watch it one way and if you watch it the way they came out this really ties up everything you need to know.
133,4,End of the prequel disaster...,*Spoilers ahead* For me this film was confirmation that the prequels should never have been made (well...not by George Lucas) I entered the cinema with low expectations after Lucas' first two disastrous efforts and really just watched it for completion's sake.
134,8,Have you ever heard the tragedy of episode 3 the underrated,"Any movie you can quote word for word either deserves a 10/10 or a 1/10, this is one of those cases where it is a 10/10"
135,6,The most underrated Star Wars movie,"There's an amazing tragic story here, hidden behind clunky dialogue and not that great of an execution. But it makes up for it by some of the acting and a smart, yet messy writing."
136,1,Absolute rubbish,"Although I found this movie marginally better than the previous two, I find that the utter disappointment I feel in seeing Lucas throw away a great opportunity to tell the story of Anakin's descent warrants the death sentence for this film. So - onto the rant:"
137,1,The year of LET-DOWNS !!!!!!!,"This is the year of let downs. Star Wars Episode III turned out to be an over-hyped, video-game-esquire, poorly acted, under-directed, repetitive-fx-laden, sad excuse for a movie. I dare say that the characters are more card-board than ever, and the dialog was soooo cheesy, it gives cheesy dialog a bad rep. The effects are just as good as in previous episodes, just more of it. There were so many battle sequences that it completely lost touch with those little luxuries like um....character development (or at least character interest), realism, and oh yeah did I mention dialog?!?!. Hayden Christiansen is so incredibly poor as an actor, that his presence on the screen just makes me cringe (he is sub-keanu...yes, it's true)...and his portrayal as whiney/stoic Anakin is horrible...he is supposed to become DARTH VADER, DARK LORD OF THE SITH!!!...argh!!!Wow, what a mess. I mean I am a MAJOR Star Wars fan, and I came in with fairly good expectations, not high, but not low....but man oh man...This came right on the heels of that horrible version of Hitchhiker's Guide....there is nothing here for me now.....I am now just a sad little man."
138,3,Nothing like taking a shower at the movies: 'Dynasty' in deep space throttle!,"With a film that supplies as much soap and sudziness as this, just bring an ""Evian"" water and add a bit to the mix and you will be clean within the first ten minutes. With the inevitability coming along from the first two installments, the audience already knows what is going to happen, so why throw in any surprises? It won't do any good, and so they didn't. Almost predictable in every way, this film follows the after adventures of Padme and Anakin Skywalker, after ""Episode II"" and their secret love affair(played out a la Pamela Barnes Ewing and Bobby Ewing, with awful results) and it's affects on Skywalker, apparently this is one of the key factors in why he became Darth Vader. No, there is no way this could have been enjoyable. The characters are all running around doing nothing and Yoda's little ""Dialogue-This is"" speeches are played out way too much and far too blandly. But that isn't all when it comes to the dialogue. All the words and actions are so cardboard, the film as a result, comes out uninvolved and totally lacking in everything that made the first three(or the last two for that matter) worth one single viewing!"
139,9,Probably the grimmest blockbuster ever made,"No more should the Empire Strikes Back be the go-to for 'dark' blockbusters, because this movie is such a violent, hopeless affair it's impossible not to appreciate the sheer guts George had in making it."
140,9,The best of the prequelsi,"After the rather disappointing (though still enjoyable) Attack Of The Clones, the final film of the prequel trilogy makes up for it."
141,3,Revenge of the Sith -- or Revenge by boredom for anyone who watches Revenge of the Sith,"""Revenge of the Sith"" has been hailed as another great Star Wars film by many, but I believe that it ranks as one of the weakest. The computerized special effects have been applauded in other reviews, but I personally found them dull. The reality is that so many movies are using computer special effects these days that film-makers really have to come up with truly original computer images in order to compete in this market. James Cameron managed to stay ahead of the curve with Avatar's breathtaking images, but the movie scenes in ""Revenge of the Sith"" look like they came straight out of a computer video came from the 1990s. As a result, I could not really believe in any of the situations which the characters found themselves in. Instead, it looked like I was watching Annakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and the other characters surrounded by computer special effects. "
142,9,Tragic and sad. And I love it,"""Revenge of the Sith"" has some problems but it is one of those cases where I don't care. Indeed the movie has some of the best Star Wars moments to date and as a fan I can't do anything but love them. In particular the last 30 minutes or so are deep, moving, tragic and they clearly hit you: Anakin turning to the dark side (yes is a bit rushed but is very emotional), Palpatine's rise to the power, the birth of the Empire, Obi-Wan vs Grievous, Yoda against Palpatine. But nothing can't top Order 66 and Anakin fighting Obi-Wan on Mustafar and I think that those two moments are the best that Star Wars can offer. Both of those scenes are also combined with a memorable score like all the movie in general, in a few words another day at the office for John Williams. Personally even if I consider ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the better movie, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is my personal favourite for the reasons I explained. That ""You were my brother Anakin, I loved you"" gives me chills every time, it's so great. As I said at the beginning the movie has problems, mostly of those are common to the entire Prequel Trilogy (bad dialogues at time, heavy CGI, some acting...) but I don't care, I only enjoy its greatness!"
143,7,A fitting end but you can't beat the real thing,"SPOILER ALERT My thoughts on Revenge of The Sith. Although miles better than the previous two, when held up against the original trilogy it still left me feeling under whelmed. Whether that it symptomatic of today's era when big budget spectacles are two-a-penny I'm not sure."
144,3,"If your're a kid it's brilliant, if you're past puberty........","I didn't expect much, given the target audience, but they really should have told George Lucas ""give us a synopsis, we'll get script writer to do the job"" To say the dialogue is wooden is an insult to trees! The problem is the special effects. Yes they are good but you still require a story for heaven's sake! That's why the originals are better - the limited effects available means they have to have a good story and half decent dialogue. All we've had with Episodes I,II and III is an exercise in how many CGI effects can we get in around a clichéd script! There's also a major continuity/script glitch - when Yoda and Obi-Wan are looking at the security footage of Annakin they refer to the Emperor having commanded him - but they go to the Jedi temple when the senate is meeting - they (Yoda and Obi-Wan) can't know Palpatine has made himself emperor! This is underlined when Obi-Wan then goes to see Padmee and refers to Palpatine as the Chancellor! Even my 8 year old spotted that! But I didn't fall asleep and my kids - aged 7,8 and 12 were glued to the screen so as a film for that age group 10/10 otherwise 3/10"
145,9,Love is the death of duty,"Love is the death of duty. Revenge of the Sith offers a splendid tale of betrayal, lust, duty, and brotherhood, culminating in the Jedi's greatest weapon turned against them. Politically, it shows the fall of democracy and the rise of despotism as a result of fear, ignorance, and hubris."
146,6,This is George. Say hello George.,"This film answers the question ""how rich do you have to be before no one dares tells you that you require help?"""
147,1,"If you ever liked Star Wars, avoid at all costs...","I wanted to cry after watching this BAD, BAD, BAD movie. I have waited for the for prequels so long and I was shocked after I saw EP1. Jar Jar Moron and the crappy story of an unimportant planet being blocked from trade? Where nothing resembled the Star Wars universe? Along came EP2, which I found a tad bid better - there was some kind of a story at least and Ewan McGregor was convincing as Obi-Wan Kenobi. But even EP2 was sub-par, in my opinion. However, I still waited, believing that it really gets better. It didn't."
148,3,Pope Yoda and the Revenge of Sooky La-La,I was all prepared to like this movie. I found the other prequels dull but had read all the good reviews of RotS by others in the same boat. So how disappointed was I.
149,8,Best Of The Prequel Trilogy,"Episode III is not only a spectacular and exciting conclusion to this trilogy, but it also proves to be a deeply moving one as well. The Clone Wars are nearing an end, and a battle weary Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor, superb) and Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen, good performance often overlooked.) pursue a defeated Count Dooku(Christopher Lee, not in this long!) and finally dispatch him, but in a way that reveals the growing darkness in Anakin that threatens his appointment as full member of the Jedi Council. It is this fear that drives Anakin to ally himself with the evil Chancellor Palpatine(Ian McDiarmid, extremely effective.) and betray the Republic, Obi-Wan, and put him on the dark path to becoming...Darth Vader."
150,3,Lucas couldn't afford a competent screenwriter?,"Such a disappointment! After reading initial reviews of Ep III I was looking forward to a film that would really bring the circle to a close. Instead, what we got was dialog so bad it wouldn't have been accepted on a day-time soap, a lead ""actor"" who was wooden, and endless light-saber duels that just filled out screen time. Worst of all, what should have been the pivotal moment when Anakin Skywalker abandons the Jedi and aligns with the Dark Side is so anticlimactic it almost gets completely lost. In fact, it's done so badly Lucas has to have the Chancellor actually *announce* that the transformation has been made. The result is that the back story for one of the cinema's great villains turns out to be that he was a sniveling, indecisive adolescent who just sort of blunders down the wrong path. Bleahh! The best course for the future is, I guess, to just watch Eps IV through VI and forget all about this wimpy prequel trilogy."
151,3,Not a good movie and a horrible end to a series,The best part was the revelation by Yoda that he would be teaching Ben Kenobi how to communicate with his old deceased teacher. This actually explains his later sacrifice in the first movie (part 4). We now know that it was all necessary to prepare Luke to defeat the Sith. OR something like that?
152,2,Really bad!,I really hate Star Wars. This movie made me hate it even more.
153,8,Not totally flawless but certainly the best of the prequels and also the most entertaining,"Almost thirty years in the making, George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" space opera has finally reached its conclusion (or has it?) and we are now able to judge the series as a whole."
154,9,A strong ending for the prequels,"The first two movies, while enjoyable, were not great. This movie, though, absolutely blew me away. The story and the characters were brilliant and show, that George Lucas is an absolute genius. The evolution of Anakin feels natural and simple and smart. It didn't happen from one day to the other, it had time. The action is as strong as ever, the acting works for me and I really loved the fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. It was truly heartbreaking and emotional, while also being a brilliantly choreographed fight. Overall, I believe, that this is one of the better Star Wars movies."
155,10,The best star wars move,This is the best star wars movie always will be and nothing and no one can change my mind its has been my favourite ever since i was introduced to star wars as a kid also the first Star Wars i watched in the cinema as i was 5 at the time but anyway this is my favourite and also the clone wars series makes this movie even more better
156,10,The very best of the Prequels,"this movie makes up for the short falls of it's two prequels. The two previous films didn't really fell like I was watching a star wars movie, instead they felt more like star wars spin offs that should have been called ""This Young Obi-Won & Anakin Adventures""."
157,6,The merge is complete,"Aaaand Cut! That's a wrap. The greatest trilogy in history has finally been connected to the prequels. All loose ends have been tied and plot holes filled. Of the three prequel episodes, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is my second favorite after ""Phantom Menace."" Sadly, that is not saying much, because I was largely disappointed by the prequels. But, then again, how do you follow up three absolute cutting edge, revolutionary, and ground breaking movies without disappointing? Yeah, Lucas had a huge task in front of him."
158,8,"My favorite of the franchise, sue me","Although most Star Wars fans might hate me for not choosing a movie from the original trilogy, personally I felt this was the best movie out of all 9 episodes that are currently out."
159,7,"The best of the prequels, but it does disappoint","Revenge of the Sith was a decent entry of the Star Wars saga. It is for me the best of the prequels, by far outshining the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Having said that though, I still was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it looks absolutely amazing. If there is one thing all the Star Wars movies have in common, it is that they are all a marvel to look at. With the marvellous cinematography, splendid special effects and colourful sets, it was a feast for the eyes. John Williams has a record for writing truly magnificent scores for ET, Home Alone and Superman, and is up there with Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman and Jerry Goldsmith as one of the best film composers ever. The score he did for this film is no exception; it was absolutely outstanding. The performances in general were a lot more solid than they were in the other prequels. Ewen MacGregor impresses as Obi Wan, Frank Oz is brilliant as Yoda, Christopher Lee was superb as Count Dooku and Ian McDiarmund steals his scenes as the benevolent Palpatine. Natalie Portman shows beauty and a vast emotional range as Padma. However there were problems I had with the movie. While not as bad as he was in Attack of the Clones, Hayden Christensen did for me give a wooden and unconvincing lead performance. Plus whereas the stories in New Hope, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back are clear, sophisticated and fast paced, there were pacing problems here and the plot was murky and convoluted. And sadly, I also thought the dialogue was as wooden as Christensen's performance. Overall, a good movie, if you want the real thing, watch New Hope, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back instead, but on its own merits it's watchable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
160,9,This is a very well-done conclusion to this trilogy that is a bit underrated,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows Anakin who has been promoted to Jedi Counsel and asked to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as war seems to be brewing. Meanwhile Padmé is pregnant and this news needs to remain a secret until Anakin and Padmé can choose a direction in life. Anakin will be torn between sides, the Jedi and the Chancellor, as his family's direction will be greatly impacted by a potential war."
161,9,Best of the Prequels.,"Star Wars: Episode 3-Revenge of the Sith (2005): Dir: George Lucas / Cast: Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiamid, Samuel L. Jackson: The very best of the first three episodes. It is a very dark film about the induction of hate where Anakin Skywalker makes the final process over to the dark side. He is having nightmares that reveal images of Queen Amidala's death, and learns of her pregnancy but he is corrupted by Chancellor Palpatine. Setup is one battle after another with the slaying of Count Dooku but robots are responding in an irritating human manner. The climax delivers the emotional drive needed as Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Director George Lucus sets up the story to lead to the original classic trilogy. Hayden Christensen fairs his best as Anakin who becomes his own downfall. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is faced with an unruly task. Natalie Portman as Amidala is greatly distressed as she senses the worst. She will bare twins who will become Luke and Leia. Ian McDiarmid is superb as the evil Chancellor whom corrupts Anakin and introduces the world to one of the most recognizable villains in movie history. Samuel L. Jackson plays fellow Jedi Mace Windu who ends up in a battle to the death against the Chancellor. Final instalment showcases spectacular effects and a message of corruption. Score: 9 / 10"
162,8,George Lucas Magnum Opus: Theological analysis,"As a kid I was never interested in star wars, for one reason or another i just never watched any of the movies. It wasnt until 10 years later when i was 17 years old, that i was visiting my grandparents for the day and i decided to watch some cable, I came across a star wars marathon, it happened to be the final battle of the phantom menace, i was literally spellbound. My life was forever changed that day. Recently I decided to have a star wars marathon, and give a up to date review of the 6 movies."
163,10,The best in the series,"After having seen episode 9 on the big screen I just had to come back to this, the best of the Star Wars movies, to give it a massive thumbs up. Although we knew that Anakin has to turn into Darth Vader here, the drama surrounding it is breathtaking. The intensity of a scene with nothing else than a guy waiting in a room. The twisted righteousness of the Jedi, the political trickery of Palpatine and a character lost and torn apart by love, fear and conventions of society. It really is great drama and on top of it is great action. It shows how Lukas has matured and if you are honest, none of the original trilogy did even come close to this."
164,7,Another almost great movie from George Lucas,"The problem with ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the same as the problem with ""Attack of the Clones"". Writer/director George Lucas spends to much time trying to connect all of the Star Wars dots. He shouldn't have bothered. He should have made the prequels to please movie audiences and not worry abourt all of the Stars Wars fans that read the books. They are two different audiences. ""Revenge of the Sith"" has quite a few moments of movie greatness. The battle scenes, the look, the imagination involved are all terrific. The scenes with General Grievous are my favorites. He's a great villain. The major problem with this movie is same as ""Episode II"". The story of Padme and Anakin is dull and uninteresting. Hayden Christensen is a pretty face that's not up for the task and Natalie Portman mails it in. With each passing viewing I find Portman more and more annoying. I saw ""Revenge of the Sith"" for the first time in the theater. I've seen it quite a few times since. It's a wildly uneven experience but it's a movie I watch every year."
165,3,Shamefully bad,"This kind of storytelling is unacceptable The only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got George Lucas behind it, and it has the words ""Star"" and ""Wars"" in its title. That is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting, but did not get the credit. This is a travesty."
166,7,"Exciting, but flawed finale.",REVENGE OF THE SITH (Warning! Spoilers included) I saw Revenge of the Sith yesterday and actually enjoyed it. I even enjoyed it quite a lot. I doubt that I'll ever be as taken with a movie as I was by a New Hope and pity all those who didn't get the effect of the Imperial Star Destroyer as an introduction to what cinema is capable of.
167,10,Addressing Criticism and Glorifying Sith,"By giving this film a perfect score, I am in no way suggesting that it is free of flaws, but ambition makes up for imperfection, and, with this movie, George Lucas has set out to film a Greek tragedy on the largest scale ever attempted. "
168,1,The Star Wars Myth busted...,by George Lucas himself.
169,10,Epic,"The perfect movie to precede the original Star Wars trilogy and to give Darth Vader an epic background story. The battle in Mustafar alone was A+, with a combination of emotions, darkness, an epic fight and a closing chapter for Obi-Wan and Anakin's relationship as master and student. I still get chills when I watch it. Love Darth Sidious reveal, and the fight between him and Yoda is so cool. Would really recommend to watch."
170,1,"Utter, pointless waste of time, money, the universe","Bottom line: George Lucas can't direct, he can't write, and apparently he can't hire a decent casting director or a high-def-video-cinematographer who can keep Natalie Portman from looking like a middle-aged Hispanic man, either. "
171,2,"Thank you Mr. Lucas for utterly destroying ""Star Wars""","It is always sad to watch potential die. This film, this story had it  all. It could have been the greatest of them all. The heartbreaking  tragedy of the man who gave up his name Anakin Skywalker to become  Darth Vader. Instead we were given, crap. This is why: (contains  spoilers)  The first problem is that since the first two movies were boring and  nothing really happened, everything has to happen now. So we've got  approx. 4 hours of plot to be shown in 2 hours.   The space battle: Mr. Lucas does only care about one thing, his  need to show the world how great the guys in ILM are to create  special effects. So what we see is 5 or 10 minutes commercial. And let  us add some cheesy dialog for Ewan and Hayden so everybody will know  it's actually a movie. Because it's not exciting, it's not amazing,  it's impossible to get an overview what's going on, it's just light  flashing and speakers trying to make the loudest BOOM-sound.  ""Oops here comes Dooku that I for some reason didn't kill off in the  last flick. Well let him fight for three minutes, say some cheesy lines  and then die."" And Lucas or Hayden, you made me believe Anakin killing  Dooku would be the first step on his path towards the dark side. That  he would be torn apart by agony of his action and the inevitable  satisfaction of letting go of his hate. None of this happens. Anakin  says something like ""Oh perhaps I shouldn't have killed him lalalala,  well, well, nobody's perfect"". So Dooku is dead. But hold on we've got  another villain, General Grievous. Darth Maul was underused. It's even  worse with Grievous only he's not cool. The idea of the mix between  droid and alien is great, however nothing of this is revealed. Grievous  is just another stupid villain. And the actor that provided his voice  for him should seriously think about changing professional.  ""Sh*t, I've already spent like 20 minutes of the film; I really need to  make Anakin evil now."" So we see some more wannabe-sound-of-music love  scenes where poor, poor Natalie Portman yet again has to fight against  lines and dialog that is absolutely horrible. I pity her, she must  curse the day she signed on Star Wars. Not your fault Natalie, we know  the truth. Yes, Anakin has more nightmares and yes, it is shown in the  same bad way as the last time. And yes, the Jedi council that never  seem to do anything useful, just sit and watch and do nothing (no  wonder you all will die) appears in a few scenes.  ""Oh my, I need to make Palpatine subtly persuade Anakin of the pleasure  of the dark side. Should we say like 2 scenes are enough?"" Basically  it's just ""Anakin join the Dark Side!"" ""No."" ""Yes do it."" ""No."" ""Yes  come on now."" ""Okay."" No wonder you could not persuade Luke.  ""Aah I still have to kill Grievous. Well, well more time for my lovely  fellows of the ILM to show their skills."" Let me say that Grievous dies  easier than Maul did and have even less screen time. Rubbish  NOW COMES WHAT BUGGERS ME THE MOST Finally after about 2 minutes of  persuading Anakin, Palpatine reveals himself to be the Sith Lord.  Anakin's life is shattered, everything he believed was in fact a lie.  This is dramatic, this is the purest betrayal. How does he respond?  Something like ""Oh really, hmm, I suppose I'd better alert the council""  Either Hayden is the worst actor or Lucas the worst director. Poor  Sidious, I reckon he wanted a better reaction than that. And when  Anakin tells Windu about it, Windu who has dedicated his life to the  Republic and to destroy the Sith? ""Palpatine's a Sith Lord, damn, well,  well, I think we need to catch him, you reckon it can be done before  lunch break?"" Yoda was humiliated to a mere action figure in AOTC. Here  Palpatine gets the same punishment. The death of Windu is kind of cool  though (thanks Jackson for at least making Lucas fulfill our wishes  concerning that scenes)  Anakin helps Palpatine kill Windu. How does he react? ""What have I  done? I'll do anything you want (to Palpatine)"" Yes that really does  make sense. Anakin you may have a high level of midi-chlorians (yes  they are mentioned) but your IQ-level is about zero. ""I fight for peace  and justice and in order to achieve those I have to kill a bunch of  innocent children."" Are you playing stupid games with me or something  Lucas? Which person would think that way? It is not logical, it's  pathetic. Every single scene with Anakin is in some way illogical.  In the end we have the Fight. With mystical dialog and with a tense of  broken friendship and love? No we get ""fast-forward"" 10 minutes of a  blue blurring light. And yes cuts from when the emperor throws chairs  at Yoda. You read it right.  Poor Natalie is made to say her final cheesy lines and is then allowed  to die.   Darth Vader is awoken; he really doesn't seem to care about anything  save that he screams ""no"" that is a parody of the  screams-of-no's-movie-history.  The End  The dream is dead.  Lucas failed us fans, for him showing a 2½ hour commercial of how great  he can make special effects were more important than conveying a  powerful story.  On the night bus home a man clad in Jedi robes wept. We all felt like  it.  This movie could have been everything we could have asked for. In hands  of a better director, with corrections by a real writer, this could  have been a new TESB. Now we were watching a fallen hero. Not Anakin.  Lucas."
172,,The best of the six films.,"I have just come from a screening of Episode III and I am very, very happy to report that it is perhaps the crown jewel of the Star Wars saga. The story is seamless, elegant and beautiful. Unquestionably the darkest film in the series- by a tremendous margin. The violence assumes a humanity which makes the film far more tangible and visceral than others in the series (eg.. when a ship is destroyed in space, you see the flailing pilot drifting in space...). The romance between Annakin and Padme is simply perfect. There are moments of dialog that would certainly tarnish a lesser film, but the delivery, the look, all makes it not only compelling but, as I sat in a room with other nerdy counterparts, i teared up. A few times. Wow. The action is nonstop. The pacing is perfect- it breathes when it needs to. The look is the finest projected image I have ever seen. I saw it at the Mann Village in Westwood, CA through their DLP digital system. The clarity, colors, vibrancy- the image quality has a presence that I've only seen from old school projectors which burned carbon 'silver' sticks. Lucas supports his narrative wonderfully with his use of light (the ship you recognize from Episode IV) and dark. The production design makes this amazing turn towards the end of the film where the shapes and colors are right in line with Episode IV- the last two films were so different from the first three... but somehow through light an geometry, the familiar hexagons and squares from the first Star Wars are all there. All the creatures and fun oddities are there for purpose- there are no 'Jar-Jar Binksy' character which take up screen time so the merchandising have new items in the pipeline. Which is not to say that there aren't amazing ships and creatures- as this is a perfect ending to the technology demonstrated in the bar scene on Tattoine in Episode IV- a complete technological revolution in storytelling, but all the soul is there. There are all kinds of deep images- glimpses of the Millennium Falcon, the evolution of Boba Fett, which are there but not addressed directly. Further examination is going to have to happen as the mythology of Star Wars is so succinctly completed in this film. Hayden Christensen delivers and then some. His acting is indescribably better in this installment. His conflict inspires sympathy and makes Darth Vader an even greater villain, thereby making everyone else that much better (Han, Luke, Amidala, etc.). The only thing I didn't like about the film is that now I have to buy the newly released DVD's of the other films so I can study the mythology which is now complete."
173,4,"One of the better Playstation 3 games, but laughable as a movie","I was so excited to see this that when we got a free Cinemax preview, this was the first movie I watched. (sarcasm off) It follows the exploits of Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi as they make their way through some sort of war between the Republic and the Separatists, while at the same time Anakin has a lot of conversations with his girlfriend and also goes over to the dark side of the force. A few major problems here: "
174,10,Revenge of the Sith: Perhaps one of the best Star Wars movies.,"I have loved this movie since I was a little kid, and I believe it is the saddest one in the saga. Anakin is truly my favourite character in the saga, and always will be. This movie breaks my heart every time I watch it, but it is phenomenal. One of my favourite movies in general. I believe the actors Lucas had chosen for the movies played their parts wonderfully. I've grown up watching the Star Wars movie, I saw this specific one opening day! I'm glad we get to find out how Anakin turned into who he did. Even though I wish he wouldn't do it. I wonder what it would be like with an alternate ending? What if he wouldn't have been seduced by the dark-side and had no lust for power?"
175,10,Now the Post War between Jedi and Sith,"This where it the war between Jedi and Sith, after the Events of Star Wars Episode II The Attack of the Clones. Now this where Skywalker go to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader."
176,10,"Dumb dialogues,stupid acting but 10 stars for the story.","Despite all the shortcomings ,all the stupidity as a whole it has a very powerful story. As bad as Anakin's acting is ,his character arc is a masterpiece despite how badly directed his scenes were. A cautionary tale Anakin's storyline is , both fascinating and tragic . If direction, dialogues and acting were better then this could have been the greatest epic ever told on movie screen ,up there at the top with LOTR."
177,9,Lucas finally gets the finger out,"When the release date loomed, fans all over the world were looking forward with a perverse delight to seeing how Lucas could screw up the final prequel. The stilted, eat-a-dirty-boot dialogue of the previous episodes, combined with plots that tied themselves up in knots, gave Revenge Of The Sith so much to make up for. What it manages to do, aside from exactly that, is prove that Lucas had been capable of much better in 1999 and 2002. ROTS essentially stops and balances the fantasy special effects with the aim of the story, giving it a much more resonant edge. Most of the characters seem far more three-dimensional, and the demises that the Jedi meet have impact, something that nobody who had seen only the previous two Star Wars films would have ever expected. When I went to see the first session on the East Coast this evening, it was the first time in the entire prequel trilogy that I heard applause as the credits rolled."
178,8,The best movie of the prequels trilogy,"Revnge of the Sith, the last movie of the prequels trilogy, showed to be the best of all three. It was darker, funnier and had more character development than the others. It also had cringe moments, something recurrent in the prequels trilogy, but in this one had only a few. The acting of Ian McDiarmid is really good, and seeing the ''birth'' of the Emperor was a cool moment. Lots of great moments, the space battle set in the beginning of the movie, the duel of Kenobi and General Grievous, Order 66, Yoda vs Palpatine, the duel in Mustafar and the birth of Darth Vader. The movie also nailed when we talk about the techinal stuff, the soundtrack is amazing, as is expected of John Williams, the visual effects are better, the production design nailed it with Mustafar and Utapau, both designs are incredible and feel like Star Wars. The acting of McGregor and Christensen improved a lot, the pace of the movie is perfect, it's a crescendo, things scale progressively as best as could be, and in the end you're satisfied. George Lucas, at least, made things right in the prequels trilogy, and thanks that was in the last and most important chapter of this trilogy."
179,1,Flashy? Yes. Less annoying than Episodes I and II? Yes. Star Wars prequel trilogy and George Lucas redeemed? Not quite,"Well, here we are, the big one, the one that was supposed to blow them all away, the one that was supposed to be the meat and potatoes of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, the big downfall that turned Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) into Darth Vader. The final result is a bit... underwhelming."
180,7,"Another Objective 5/10, 7 For Nostalgia","A few months ago, I wrote a review of Dinosaur (2000) saying it has lots of problems and is an objective 5/10, but I still kept my rating a 7 because of my enjoyment. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of The Sith holds a similar place in my heart."
181,1,What a piece of junk!,Little could Mark Hamil have known when he uttered these words in A New Hope that he was making a profound prediction of the future of the Star Wars movies. Did he also foresee the rise of an actor who would make him look like Laurence Olivier?
182,10,Stunning...,"This film is a standalone, but of course it does not need to be. I am so difficult to please when it comes to film, as we all are here, but this has it all. A blockbuster film that you walk out thinking about and analysing. "
183,9,Dignified end,'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith'. Anakin's inner conflict comes to a head and becomes more and more extreme. The path to the dark side of the force seems to be paved.
184,9,Legends happening in front of us,"After a slow first hour, the movie really ramps up. There's so much critical moments happening after this point. The story we just heard about as a child growing with the original trilogy are now happening in front of our eyes. When it ends, you just want to see the original movies again..."
185,10,Epic Star Wars Movie,"First I want to thank George Lucas for creating such a fantastic world that has been in all of our lives for 28 years. Wow! Revenge of the Sith is a great movie and certainly the best of the prequels. It actually has some emotional depth...which the last two lacked for me. There is so much to love about this movie...the story, characters, special effects. Sure the dialogue is occasionally corny, but that's what make ""Star Wars"" movies so much fun. The acting is much better in this one and the action is fast-paced and well timed."
186,1,Better than the last two but not as good as it should have been,"George Lucas has finished this latest Star Wars trilogy with what should have been the best of any of them but poor acting, laughable plot twists due in what is actually an okay movie."
187,8,"quite entertaining, although lacks the personality of the originals","After the previous two turkeys I wasn't expecting much out of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a genuinely exciting action movie with some very cool sequences. It looks very good and has a great sense of massiveness in the sets."
188,7,The best of the prequel trilogy,"Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith is what I consider the best of the prequel trilogy and despite some flaws, is a decent addition to the franchise. "
189,1,I am depressed and saddened.,"I saw Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith once, and I will never see it again. This movie is utterly devoid of anything positive or enjoyable. The first half of the film is basically about Anakin being an idiot and messing everything up, and the second half consists of him on a killing rampage. Sure, I know that the story of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader absolutely HAD to be told, but therein lies the problem. This movie (and the other two, for that matter) was created solely to explain what is present in Episodes IV, V, and VI. There is no point to the film other than explanation."
190,7,Good but one wooden actor kills it,"Hayden Christiansen as Anikan Skywalker is so stiff he kills the Movie, great effects, great action, but as a central character he simply labours through every scene, how he was cast is a mystery, Kermit the Frog could have carried it off better, not surprising he's never led in a movie again outside these Star Wars movies, they got stuck with him."
191,8,The rise of darth vader,"Three years after the start of the clone wars, obi wan and anakin are sent out on a mission to retrieve chancellor palapatine from general grievous. Little do the duo know that it was all part of a master plan of palpatine to start his rise to power. The Jedi start to become suspicious when they realize palpatine be the Sith Lord tknown as earth sidious that they have been looking for. Meanwhile anakin has a nightmare of his wife padme dying in childbirth similar to the one he had of his mother in attack of the clones. Little does he know that he ends up becoming his own worst enemy and becomes darth Vader. The film pays off as the long waited duel between obi wan and anakin and bringing the gap between this film and a new hope."
192,10,Iconic,"This is one of my favourite Star Wars movies. I really liked it, it is without a doubt the best of the prequels."
193,8,Leaps and bounds above the first two films - a return to form,"Now this movie is epic. ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" feels like a proper Star Wars film, and a return to grace as to what Star Wars should be. With almost no fluff, a breakneck pace, and an action-packed plot, Episode 3 is a completely different movie when compared to the first two entries in this trilogy, improving in virtually every way for the better."
194,9,How can one not adore this movie?,"I love this movie with all my heart! Yes the cgi isn't the best, the dialogue is still very cheesy and Anakins motivations for turning, well.. aren't good. But i do not care! This movie is so much fun. I could watch it 20 times and not get bored of it! It's constant action! No excessive politics or people talking about their feelings all the time. Just action! Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor are amazing and steal every scene they're in, Hayden is also great as Anakin and Christopher Lee is charming as always even in the few scenes he's in. The movie also has amazing emotional depth if you see the Clone Wars before hand and Anakins fall is so much more depressing. Lastly, what is there to say about the final battle? It's simply breathtaking and the choreography is phenomenal, blows every other duel with the exception of duel of the fates out of the water. The only thing thats keeps me from giving this a 10 is that, well if we review this as a standalone movie it's not worthy of a 10/10 and i hate how they treated Padme (especially the fact that the couldn't find a way to kill her properly, so they just decided to have her die.. of sadness). Solid 9/10, my favourite Star Wars movie ever (not best ofcource but still my personal favourite)"
195,9,Revenge of George Lucas,I was one of the lucky ones to see on opening night in Leceister Square and I was willing to spend 250 quid or so for the ticket (my girlfriend also paid for hers).
196,10,The best Star Wars movie,"This movie is just perfect, I can not describe how good this movie is, you just need to see it for your self, the conclusion of the Clone Wars, the end of the republic and the rise of the empire"
197,1,George Lucas needs your money ...,"Hayden Christensen (who can't act) and Ewan MacGregor (who can act, but chooses not to) set off to rescue Ian MacDiarmid from the clutches of Dracula and a coughing cartoon character. Christensen kills Dracula, rescues MacDiarmid, kills loads of robots etc etc.."
198,1,Truly awful,"How can this movie be getting such good ratings? Why did they spend SO MUCH TIME on the lava planet when we KNEW we were there just so Vader could get scarred and get his suit? Just jump in the cock-a-doodle lava already and tell me something about the story I don't already know! Why was everyone able to move about said planet and not even break a sweat--even down near the actual flow? What? No fumes? Did nine months really pass??? I certainly could not tell. I can tell you that I am a mom of full-term boy/girl twins, and when I was Padme's size, I still had 12 weeks to go. No way that tiny tummy produced those gargantuan babies."
199,10,What an Emotional Ending,"The writer and director has done splendid job with these movies. I love Star Wars and no matter how many times you watch it is just FUN, FUN and FUN!"
200,7,"""Revenge"" is sweet",Written and directed by George Lucas
201,,"Best of the Prequels, but still sadly lacking","Revenge of the Sith, the last entry in the long running series (we hope!) starts off well, with an epic space battle and a couple of nice comic moments with R2-D2. However it is not too long before everything turns sour and for mainly the same reasons as before. Please note that there are some major spoilers henceforth:- Firstly, unsurprisingly the script is woeful (yet again), making the dialogue in most soap operas look like Shakespeare. This in turn affects the acting as the players struggle to get any conviction across about what they are saying. This is particularly true of the romantic scenes between Anakin and Padme where the chemistry is so minimal that these moments are simply dull as in ""Attack of the Clones."" It is a pity that Christopher Lee, one of the better actors in the prequels and indeed the whole saga is on screen for such a short period of time, sidelined and killed off early on to make way for a weak robot/alien hybrid enemy  General Greivous, another CGI character. Only Lee, Ewan MacGregor, Ian McDiarmid and Samuel L. Jackson really manage to rise above the material in any way."
202,10,Best Star Wars Movie Ever Created,"Hands down the greatest movie created, in general. <br /><br />So much detail, overwhelming aesthetics, large scale battles, iconic characters, beautiful weapon/vehicle/planet designs. I love the cgi, it gives the prequels a futuristic vibe. Otherworldly. nice contrast to the grittiness of the OT"
203,4,"Disinsterested directing, poor acting, great effects","Now all the prequels have been made and seen. So how do they stack up? A New Hope was certainly a winner. The moderate pace, solid acting and intriguing action that you could follow clearly all combined seamlessly. Interestingly, that was topped by Empire Strikes Back which provided not only an intriguing story, more solid acting and terrific contrasts of atmosphere; it also was a magnificent dramatic ""second act"" which captivated audiences. Return of the Jedi slid back down a little, but was still a strong film and was a fairly good wind up."
204,8,Very Satisfying,"A very satisfying conclusion and easily the best of the pre-quels. George Lucas' previous two pre-quels both had their qualities and I actually enjoyed ""Attack of the Clones"" where ""Phantom Menace"" was a snore. ROTS more than makes up for the last two."
205,1,Final Episode doesn't improve much over the previous two (SPOILERS),"The main problem that this movie has is that it just goes too fast. This is because Lucas left a LOT of loose ends for this third movie, which results in an incredible effort to explain all of them in only one movie. The best example of this is that in this movie characters die all too often, such as Count Dooku (like in the first ten minutes), General Grievous (who was publicized too much but ended up being just a secondary character), and Mace Windu. Another example would be the Jedi; we get to see just a few deaths, and have to interpret those few killings as the extermination of most of the Jedi all over the galaxy. And even as they tried to pack this one full, some topics were not completely resolved, like why some Jedi disappear when they die and others don't. Also, the Wookiee battle is too short. Compare it with the Ewok battle in Episode VI, which lasted like one third of the movie. It just seemed like an excuse to cash in on the reappearance of Chewbacca. The romantic dialogues between Anakin and Padmé, just as in Episode II, are boring as hell. Aside from that, I was left wondering how come in ""Return of the Jedi"" Leia says she remembers her real mother, when Padmé died just minutes (or less) after she was born. Another important goof in this movie, thanks to the horrible DVD release of the original Trilogy, is that Anakin never wore the Jedi robes he appears wearing as a ghost in the new end of Episode VI, unlike Obi-Wan and Yoda, who appear wearing the robes they had on when they died. I am also curious about why they didn't bring back David Prowse to play Darth Vader. In this Episode he looks smaller and thinner than he was in the original Trilogy. All in all, I am glad that the prequels are finally over, because I was getting tired of watching ""Star Wars"" go down the toilet."
206,8,"Not Great, but Good",I give Episode 3 a B-. It doesn't come anywhere near episodes 4-6 but it is better than prequel episodes 1-2. There are five things that work really well in this movie:
207,3,May the force (whats left of it) be with us.,"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away (we wish). At the beginning we are told that chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by the separatists, and held captive on General Grivous's (commander of the droid army) Ship, after a fairly ordinary space battle, Anakin and Obi wan land on Grivous's ship in order to rescue the chancellor, they confront Count Dooku and after a short light saber fight Obi Wan goes unconscious and Anakin chops off Dooku's arms. Palpatine convinces Anakin to kill the armless (literally) Dooku and after 2 seconds of Anakin going ""no, I shouldn't, he's weaponless etc.."" he's convinced and Dooku's head ends up next to his incompetent hands."
208,3,"Excellent effects, lousy film","There's no question Lucasfilms has the technical smarts to create any special effect imaginable. Too bad all they could do was cobble together the most idiotic vehicles and improbable landscapes ever assembled. The plot was predictable and unsophisticated, which made the storm of visual effects even more annoying."
209,10,Great movie,"This movie is fun to watch, great visuals, and great action. The CGI is amazing for its time and personally I enjoyed the politics of the prequel movies."
210,10,The Pick of the Bunch,"Chapter 3 in the Star Wars saga is many people's favourite. The 'Revenge of the Sith' was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. and second-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2005. The film begins similarly to Episode 2, with a supreme leader in need of support and therefore seeking help from the Jedi. Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker lead the mission to rescue the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine from the Cyborg Separatist General Grevious. Grevious' ship is infiltrated by the Jedi and are met by the evil Count Dooku, yet another lightsaber battle ensues, featuring the three, Anakin overpowers the former Jedi master, possessing both Dooku's and his own blue lightsaber in the process, Dooku knelt down to Anakin, the young Jedi decapitates Dooku on Palpatine's command. Palpatine is excited by the skills on show from Anakin, understanding his strength and power at his young age and smirks at the site of him dominating a former Jedi master, believing that Anakin can be the most dangerous Jedi in history. Intrigued by his qualities, the Chancellor is never fully explicit on where his loyalties lie, his commitment to the Republic is never clear, we doubt him because of this, and are worried by his potential to subvert. Grievious, fully aware of the act that the a Jedi carried out, escapes the flagship, which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant. Anakin's heroic actions boost his reputation and the Jedi reunites with his wife in the capital, Padmé reveals to Anakin that she is pregnant. To begin with, Anakin is pleased about the news, but his mental struggles are apparent when he begins to have nightmares of her dying in childbirth; recalling his past declaration that he will 'never let anything bad happen to the ones he loves'. Palpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi council as his personal representative. The council, already suspicious of Palpatine, accept Anakin as a member, but decline to grant him a Jedi Master and instead instruct him to spy on Palpatine. Palpatine tempts Anakin with his knowledge of the Force, including the power to prevent death. This extremely appealing to Anakin, who is experiencing thoughts of his Wife dying and his potential child too. We begin to see a discrete partnership for, in between the two, Palpatine encouraging Anakin to darkness and the other side of the force, where he believes Anakin has the ability to dominate and exert his power to wipe out the existence of the Republic. Obi Wan travels to Utapau, where he subtly appears, destroys dozens of droids and eventually kills General Grievous. Grievous' characteristics should make him very much invincible, the villain possesses 4 arms, all of which have a designated lightsaber. What is strange is that Grievous has 2 green and 2 blue sabers, the usual colours for a Jedi. His robotic frame is controlled by his thin middle, allowing him to be very flexible. Yoda travels to the Wookie home world of Kazhyyyk to defend it from a Separatist invasion. Palpatine admits to Skywalker that he knows the ways of the Dark side, stating that he has the power to save Padmé's life. The reaction from Anakin is not what Palpatine expected, and the Jedi reports immediately to Mace Windu, informing the Knight that the chancellor is in fact a Sith Lord. Mace Windu confronts and subdues Palpatine, and on the verge of killing him, Anakin disarms Windu, with the thought of saving Padmé in the back of his mind, allowing Palpatine to send Samuel Jackson's character falling to his death. Anakin pledges himself to the Sith, and Palpatine dubs him Darth Vader. Palpatine issues Order 66, commanding the clone troopers to kill their commanding Jedi officers, sending the Jedi order into near extinction. Vader and a battalion of clone troopers kill all signs of Jedi in the Jedi temple, including the class of young trainees. The newly named Darth Vader exits to the planet Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders. Anakin in this chapter and point of the saga is emotionally unstable, and supposedly can't control himself, easily persuaded by the evil chancellor he believes he is protecting his child and wife by joining the Dark side, but the only person he is concerned and thinking about is himself, he has subverted into a self-centred, arrogant character, not considering how his actions will effect those who helped him and cared for him not so long ago. In a difficult sequence we visualise the dominance of the Dark side, and all good in the galaxy vanishing. Conflict spreads like fire throughout and the Republic is no more. Palpatine who declared himself Emperor before the Galactic Senate, transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire, denouncing the Jedi as traitors. Surviving in the chaos, both Yoda and Obi Wan return to Coruscant and learn about Anakin's turn to the dark side. Yoda orders Obi Wan to confront Vader while he faces Palpatine. Obi Wan boards Padmé's ship heading to Mustafar after the Queen finds out about Anakin's treachery. Padmé tries to convince Vader to reject the Dark side, but the former Jedi disregards her request. He senses Obi Wan's presence, thinking they (Padmé and Kenobi) we're conspiring to kill him, he angrily chokes Padmé. Obi Wan battles Vader on land surrounded by lava, the lightsaber duel is lengthy and ends with Obi Wan bettering his apprentice by severing his left arm and two legs; in an intense watch, Obi Wan leaves Anakin by the bank of a lava flow, as Vader expresses his hater towards Kenobi, the Jedi Knight reminds him that he was the ""Chosen One"" and was meant to defeat the Sith and not join them. Obi Wan picks up Vader's lightsaber, watched him as flames consume the fallen Jedi, and leaves him for dead. On Coruscant, Yoda endures combat with Emperor Palpatine until the battle reaches a stalemate. Yoda then flees with Senator Bail Organa and regroups with Obi Wan on the planetoid Polis Massa, exchanging their feedback following each Jedi battle. Padmé gives birth to twins - a boy and a girl - who she names Luke and Leia - and dies, still convinced there is good in Vader. On Mustafar, Palpatine retrieves a barely alive Darth Vader and takes him to Coruscant, where he is fitted with a permanent oxygen mask and a black armoured suit. Vader asks Palpatine about Padmé's safety, who responds by telling Vader that he killed her out of anger, devastating Vader. Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda plan to conceal the twins from the Sith and separate them until the time is right to challenge the Empire. Padmé's funeral takes place on her homeworld of Naboo whilst Darth Vader and Palpatine overlook the construction of the powerful Death Star. Bail Organa takes Leia to his homeworld of Alderaan, where he and his wife adopt her. Obi Wan delivers Luke to his step-uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, on Tatooine before going into exile to watch over the boy. An extraordinary episode, involving the dark transition from the Republic to the Galactic Empire. And the introduction of the new villain Darth Vader, lowering the chances that the Jedi left, can bring peace and prosperity to the Galaxy. The dominance of the Empire only strikes fear and makes us worried for the Galaxy and it's leadership. Palpatine's betrayal is no surprise and his attempt to create his own Empire has begun. The fact that Vader is told that he killed Padmé, fuels the anger inside him."

212,2,Absolute rubbish,"Let's start with George Lucas's work as a director: Is it possible that he was on the set when Samuel Jackson filmed his scenes? Other than in camp films, I have never seen a more wooden, preposterous performance. In fact, Ian McDiarmid does the only decent acting in the entire movie. As for the action scenes, they are utterly unexciting, filled with the kind of disorienting jump cutting where you never know what you're watching or even where you are. Flabby, lazy, unoriginal. And besides, does anyone ever suspend disbelief any more when these CGI things come on the screen? Fake, fake, fake. Characters you can care about? Sorry, nothing there either. The unintentionally hilarious dialogue doesn't help: Padme: ""Ani, you've been feeling a lot of stress lately."" What is this, the Dr. Phil show? And Yoda still annoying is. The movies have passed Lucas by; he still thinks he can recycle the same old formula, phone it in, and cash in. Well, yes, he can cash in; but I have seen more sophisticated entertainment (and I am not kidding) in a Bugs Bunny cartoon."

214,10,Fans will love it...most 'casual' viewers won't.,"Let me start of by saying that I can understand why one would hate this movie. If you're not really familiar with the five other Star Wars movies and franchise, there won't be an awful lot for you to enjoy in this movie. And don't even think about seeing this movie if you haven't seen Episode I and II yet! This movie literally is the centerpiece of the saga and ties up brilliantly the loose ends between the original and prequel trilogy and answered more questions than I expect. This is also why fans of Star Wars will absolutely love this movie, only they will be fully able to appreciate all of the moments in the movie, such as the transition from Palpatine to Sidious, the extermination of the Jedi, the death of Padmé, the birth of the twins etc. Is there than absolutely nothing to enjoy for the just more casual viewer? Of course there is! Visually the movie looks splendid and the special effects are by far the best ever featured in a Star Wars movie. Everyone should be able to appreciate the immensely large battles and countless lightsaber duels. So seriously, there still is plenty to enjoy for those who don't regard themselves as being big Star Wars fans."
215,10,Bittersweet,"I had the fortune of watching this on opening day, before anyone got to ruin the fun."
216,7,THE prequel,"The first thing that jumps to my attention in this movie is that the CGI, although still very noticeable, is finally at an acceptable level, helping a lot to give more fluidity and immersion. The movie begins right into the action with an early space battle followed by a lightsaber fight with Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) against Dooku (Christopher Lee) to free Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Dooku in this fight is better than in ep. 2, but as I had already mentioned in the review to the previous film, I feel that Christopher Lee is dislocated in the Star Wars universe, so it is good that he leaves the scene early on. However, the villain who appears as his replacement, General Grievous, is an even worse choice: it is true that he gives a good show in the duel against Obi-Wan, but his whole character does not convey emotion, which leads me to affirm, once again!, that Darth Maul was really badly underused."
217,10,"""Luke, I am your father"".","It took 28 years for George Lucas to finalize his popular space saga with verve, power, spirit and amazement that actually equals the original STAR WARS(1977). All the elements one expects are there. Most of all a lot of pertinent questions are finally answered. If he hasn't already done so, Lucas can now open The First National Bank of Lucas. "
218,10,"The best of the prequels. Darker. Scarier. Better.,","Now, I conclude my review of the STAR WARS prequel trilogy with EPISODE III: THE REVENGE OF THE SITH."
219,9,Best of the Prequels,"This is what I like about the movie: Beautiful costumes, sets and scenery Obi-Wan Kenobi is becoming one of my favourite SW characters The lightsaber battle at the end Yoda fighting Palpatine The Musical score"
220,8,The Saga Concludes To a Fitting End,"I just rented a Screener DVD of the movie, cos I missed it when it was in the theaters... I was under the impression of a great movie, with superb visual effects and excellent acting... I was not slightly disappointed..."
221,1,"""Luke, I am your father...""","""...but this is not your father's Star Wars."" "
222,8,Far better than I ever remembered!,"To be fair, I don't remember much but still. Now, comparing this to the newer movies there is a clear difference. I don't hate the new movies, I think they are mediocre but what sets them apart from the prequels is that the prequels actually care about the Jedi. The sheer scale of the action is far greater and the lightsaber fights are genuinely amazing to watch...Disney simply don't have the same understanding of how to create a Star Wars movie properly. I also don't believe that episodes 1 and 2 are anything incredible but I can at least respect them. Now onto the actual movie, which is very very good! I'm happy to say that the acting actually improved for this film and man does it pay of...the final scenes, Oof that are terrific! The action is also very good, maybe not quite as good due to how dated the movie is but definitely still watchable. The cgi does have a few stumbles here and there but nothing that draws you out of the movie. The plot, I'm actually surprised to say was amazing, it works so well at piecing everything together that was built from the past two movies. While doing that it also links straight with episode 4. The characters are also far better in this movie, they have real development and good chemistry that really gives their relationships meaning. Really my only main problem is the pacing, it goes from being really fast to incredibly slow but even then if you just forget about it, it goes away. Trés gud."
223,8,A Shame it had to end!,Lucas does a phenomenal job of tying up all the loose ends and showing how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Natalie Portman is as gorgeous as ever (she didn't look too good in Garden State) and the light saber fights are awesome. There is one scene in particular where Obi Wan fights a robot that has several light sabers in his multiple arms.
224,5,Godfather Four: Revenge of the Golden Voyage of Sinbad,"Paging a script doctor to the O.R., this series needs resuscitation, stat!"
225,1,Down the toilet we go one last time...,"I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck. It finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas' career. He wants us to swallow the Annakin is Vader nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film vindicates those feelings. The story hasn't worked since Phantom Moron, and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade. I have to go. I know where some new rocks to throw are. You want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is NOT their Father. Duke Countoo should have switched sides while he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been any good to anybody. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin didn't build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his Mom about putting him together from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of Annie, but she had told do what George Lucas wrote for her. What a dope!"
226,1,It's Just Bad,"Unlike the millions who have seen and apparently loved this newest , and supposedly final, installment of the Star Wars saga, I disliked this movie vigorously. Predictably for Star Wars, virtually every aspect of this movie was bad: the acting, the dialogue and that neglected part of summer movies -- what's that now? --, Oh yes, the plot."
227,8,An amazing way to end George Lucas era.,I can admit I wasn't exactly fond of the first 2 prequels but this was very very enjoyable. All of this puts the stars wars history in place.
228,1,Lukas Has Completed His Journey To The Darkside,This was the worst film comparable to even the lowest of B grade films.
229,2,"Criticism, might have to criticise.","When I watched the Phantom menace, I was driven into a crazed state. I went mad. I started behaving like an animal. I was pacing the room, angry, irked to the point of psychosis. I started winding people up like a twelve year old kid, poking and punching them. I had a well of annoyance inside me. I had become emotionally ruined by the experience. Maybe it was the plot, maybe it was annikin, maybe it was Jar Jar Binks's voice and stuck-on wibble wobble gait. Maybe it was the thought that this film cost more to make than your average third world country's GDP. But I saw red. I've rarely been more fired up by a movie than by the Phantom menace. I had a similar experience with Revenge of the Sith."
230,10,'SITH' Happens! - Lucas' Epic Comes To Satisfying Conclusion in the Darkest Chapter -* Spoilers - duh!,"STAR WARS : EPISODE III  REVENGE OF THE SITH (2005) **** Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McDiarmid, Jimmy Smits, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, (voices: Frank Oz and James Earl Jones) (Dir: George Lucas)"
231,1,Where's the beef...,"Part of my beef, is now 3 movies deep into the prequels... Palpatine and Anakin are still essentially normal ""good"" citizens. Their transformation is rushed, unbelievable, and mindless. The Sith needed to be more developed overall... and unfortunately there's no evil here to speak of, just some dopey fretting and rather conspicuous manipulation. Why should we care if the powerful Jedi's can only beat up some non-firing security-guard robots, and then some crusty Senator out of the blue can kick 3 Jedis and Samuel Jackson's ***... That's just resolving an outcome that's already been decided, with zero narrative to lead us there. It's like if Trent Lott suddenly had Jet Li's fighting skills and Nicolai Tesla's ability to fire electricity... with no explanation. "
232,9,Star Wars Month #6: The Saga Goes Out in Excellent Fashion,"This was the big one. We were finally going to see how it went down. The pressure Lucas was under when creating Revenge of the Sith was unimaginable, especially considering the fans had savaged his last two films. But come Memorial Day weekend in 2005, the expectations were SURPASSED. Revenge of the Sith was considered to be the best of the Prequel Trilogy, but for me it is the best film in the series since Empire Strikes Back."
233,10,Rewatched it exactly 1 year later,"I started a tradition where I'm watching Revenge of the Sith every 19 December. My first watch was last year, 2nd watch is this year. And damn what a movie"
234,1,'Death And Other Minor Ailments',"It started out with a realisation of the expectations I expected. Space battle! Noisy, flashy, happy cuttings editor on drugs. A grandiose hook for the biting off. Fishy audience, indeed."
235,3,"Bye now, don't hurry back","Way back when the first Star Wars film was released, I recall a friend telling of reading that George Lucas's vision was for a 9 part opus. The three ""middle"" episodes first, with Luke and Leia and Han, etc.; followed by the prequel to the original three, also in three installments; and, then, the three concluding episodes that pick up the story from the end of ""Return of the Jedi."" Let us hope that anyone who was ever entertaining that idea has long since had a change of heart."
236,3,"Messing up a good thing, George is.","When ""New Hope"" came out, I must have seen it 30+ times in the theater. I was 10 years old and the story was every boy's dream. How I yearned to harness the ""FORCE"" and use it to beat up some bullies at my school. Of course, a light saber would have been pretty cool for show and tell too! ...now, I wish I could use the FORCE to go back in time and have a chat with Lucas and fix this awful mess."
237,1,"A Galaxy Far, Far Away...","I'm not quite sure how this film is being rated well. What is wrong with this film? Well, setting the Star Wars fan in me aside, this movie is just awful. The acting is completely horrible, and nobody in the cast is spared from that comment. The script is along the lines of Episodes 1 & 2, which is a long way of saying tremendously bad. Oh, I wish Lucas had brought in a screenwriter, someone like Kasdan (for those of you who are fans of the new trilogy, Lawrence Kasdan wrote Empire Strikes Back and ROTJ) who actually can write a screenplay."
238,3,Spectacularly horrible.,"So the final (hopefully), middle (middling more like) film is complete. Now, at last, Lucas can (should) disappear into the undergrowth, never to be seen again (by anyone, himself included, preferably). Revenge of the Sith is utterly, utterly bad. But why? Well....where to start? I've seen bad movies. I've seen really, really bad movies. Sith is bad in a whole new way. It's as if Lucas realised that it's a horrible movie, and knew he had to camouflage it with computer generated whiz-bang effects. Industrial Light and Magic are great, as always, but they just douse the movie with so many ships and explosions that everything else takes a back seat. The acting is so wooden it makes my house look Oscar winning. I pity the actors, though Lucas is completely to blame since he provided the lines."
239,1,"Visually Nice, but the dialogue, cover your ears","I'm sorry, but I expect more from a movie than imagery. I expect a story, characters who develop, who have depth. If there are plot holes, okay, but they must be somewhat reasonable, not idiotic. The story is dreadful, the dialogue juvenile (no not even juvenile, rather childish). There are so many holes in the plot, you could market it in the cheese section, under Swiss, but then again it could be just American cheese for the script itself. The main problem, I think, has to be there is no suspense, we all know who lives and dies. Why bother having a 10 minute light saber duel, when you know the outcome. Somebody once said Lucas looks to Kurasawa for inspiration, but watching some of those classic samurai movies, the duels are over in 5 sec., much like real world fencing. That would in this case be much more dramatic... But back again to the acting and script... the Jedi are incredibly dense not to sense the bad guys and anakin is so dim, you can see why he ended up being the second banana in the original movies. He obviously has trouble thinking for himself, seems to never gotten emotionally past 12. How he ever got Padme pregnant, we can't imagine. How she could love such a child? The whole thing actually left me angry at the end."
240,8,Rises the franchise to epic point,"Knowing George Lucas as we all know him, is very odd (and with I mean, great) to see such a dark movie about the Star Wars saga. This final chapter is when the light goes, the brightness and positiveness flies away from that far away galaxy, and the fairy tale turns into a devil nightmare."
241,10,All I can say is that Lucas has finally redeemed himself!,MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!
242,10,That's my favorite star wars movie !!,That's what we were waiting for to see how anakin transforms into darth vader. I am looking forward for the show.
243,1,Ignore the comments above,"This film was awful - as bad as The Phantom Menace, but without anything as good as the Darth Maul light sabre fight. I was checking my watch throughout the film, waiting for it to be over."
244,,It is a space opera isn't it?,It really makes me sick. So many of the writers here are treating this movie as if it were a candidate for best dramatic movie of the millennium and then flunking it when it fails. I really get sick reading people (on this movie or many others) who apply their very narrow artsy standards to a film that was not created for their narrow world of drama.
245,4,out with a whimper instead of a bang,"it is a terrible shame that Lucas could not have brought on board people who could write and a director who could direct actors. the script is worse than usual with every line a cliché, the performances vary from good Ian mcdiarmid (emperor/palpadine), Natalie portman (padme) to average McGregor (obi wan) to the bad Christensen (annakin). And there is the main problem as we are dealing with the demise of annakin and the birth of Vader, the actor needed to have gravitas and authority, poor Haydn has neither and struggles manfully to fill the body and shoes of Vader but does not succeed. i am baffled by the response by both critics and fans alike that this is the best of the new trilogy, for me it is the most emotionless. there was no sense of story or character, far too many battle scenes, the one on the wookie planet had absolutely no purpose other than to get Yoda out of the way. or maybe as someone said after the screening to capitalise on the merchandising. anyway i shall see it again to see if it gets better or not"
246,10,George Lucas is redeemed!!!!,"Revenge of the Sith is one of the most indulgent, operatic and grandiose films I have ever seen, and the most courageous entry into the Star Wars saga. The film reeks of a beautiful desperation from a director moving mountains to improve on his widely despised prequels. It's a crushing film for hardcore fans of the franchise, literally killing off an entire era of mythology and history in the name of transitioning to the original trilogy. Every part of the film feels absolutely necessary to Lucas' tale of hope and despair, dispensing with the frivolities he enjoyed in the first two films. It treats its characters with sincerity, reveling in broken relationships and budding ones alike."
247,7,Best of the Pre-3,"This is the best of the prequels. That's all. I enjoyed it and still believe this is the only rewatchable movie of the prequels. I'm an avid Star Wars fan, or at least sufficient."
248,10,The Best Star Wars!,"The Revenge of the Sith is no doubt the best Star Wars movie ever. Even though the first two in the prequel series were good, this movie blows them away. Everything is so much better here in this movie such as the acting, more action, and better special effects."
249,2,Makes the first two look like Citzen Kane.,Don't be mislead by my title. This film is well worth the viewing. I haven't laughed this hard since...well... episode two.
250,9,"A positive and intelligent film, despite several flaws.","This film shows how Anakin Skywalker will turn into Darth Vader, and betray the trust and friendship of all who knew him. Directed and written by George Lucas, it has the participation of Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and Ian McDiarmid, among other actors."
251,9,Came to rate this after The Last Jedi and TROS travesty,Lucas had a story and he didn't backtrack despite the backlash against first two movies. He had a character and he knew what he was doing with it. He had originality and creativity behind it.
252,3,Reviewers are taking payoffs,"""You are so ... (long pause) ... beautiful"" - only George Lucas could write such lame dialog, delivered by such lame actors, and still make millions at the box office. Was this movie worth interrupting an afternoon nap? No. The only good thing to say about it is that it sucks less than episodes I and II. Save your money, even if you love special effects on the big screen. The action comes so fast and furious at times you can't catch what's going on anyway. Sets? Imagine a princess's palatial penthouse suite with no art, no books, no plants, no pets, nothing organic. Everything is sterile - like most of the visuals. From a plot perspective, we all know where this movie is going, so couldn't Lucas come up with even a few plot twists to get us there? Guess not. Thank the FORCE this series is over."
253,10,The best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back!,"This has got to be one of the most underrated sequels ever. I think it has to do with it being a part of one of the most controversial trilogies ever. Had it been a part of any other trilogy, I bet it would appear in many lists of top sequels. Unfortuanately, too often people seem to treat it no different than the last two prequels."
254,9,the final installment,"There's something about the Star Wars movies that have reached a grand culmination with Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the prequel trilogy, and of Star Wars completely as a saga- the storytelling has reached a peak (much like with the other two masterpieces A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back). The visual effects, the sound, the music, all of the background elements are perfectly suited to tell the story. Of course this is how it also went with Episodes 1, 2 and 6, but this time George Lucas has reached a peak with the visual effects that has been increasing since Episode 1. Some of the visuals may be more formidable and concrete than others, however as a viewer I was completely wrapped in the story most of all, emotionally and even intellectually. And, of course, the challenge is to still make an entertaining, compelling film with what everyone who's seen a Star Wars movie knows is the climax- Anakin Skywalker turns into Darth Vader, and Skywalker offspring become separated at birth amid the end of the Jedi and the democracy of the republic. The journey is what counts, and it's a spectacular journey. I would even go as far to say that for one not expecting much from the ashes of the first two entries, this is not only one of the top pictures in the saga, it's also one of the best films of the year."
255,,The Space Opera Strikes Back,"The interesting part of Episode III is how blandly the visual effects are presented, and how the action sequences in the first half of the film have so little intensity. Fighter ships sweep in and out between larger battle cruisers and deal with annoying little droids, and I don't care that it's CG  I accept it as valid star ships fighting over Courescant. It's a virtuoso display of Computer Generated Imagery . . . and yet I don't find myself in awe or wowed by the display, but then again it really wasn't the point of Episode III either."
256,1,This film has NO MATURITY in it!,"Why is this stinker rated so high? It stunk on just about every level. Even the special effects! I admit, there was the sense that it took a lot of time and money to do the special effects, but there was nothing groundbreaking about them, and it got to the point of special effects overload. I love science fiction movies, but there must have been a record breaking amount of scenes of alien cities and spaceships landing and taking off. I agree with most of the other bad reviews in that the dialogue was atrocious. The same was true for the last 2 movies before this. The acting and story were bad, as well. A six year old could write a more intelligent story! The proverbial nail in the coffin for me was the wookie doing the ""Tarzan"" yell while swinging into battle. Not funny or amusing in the least. Also, I don't see the appeal of stupid computer generated yoda."
257,6,The Best Of The Worst !,"It's the best because, compared to the previous 2 prequels, there were things that made the movie suitable for a second viewing, like: a good opening sequence consisted of half hour of powerful action, good climactic sequence which was another half hour of powerful action, the music of (John Williams) especially ""The Battle of The Heroes"", the final 2 parallel sword duels; that was great, (Yoda) as a perfect CGI this time; thanks to the talents behind it, how all the CGI wasn't that trite, some real creative backgrounds, and the clever dramatic meaning about the end of democracy and how the dictator could rule; which made me ask: did (George Lucas) refer to American contemporary issues at the time through (Star Wars)?!, and the smartness of pulling down the parliament by one savage power that wants to destroy freedom along with everyone and everything, but itself."
258,1,A fitting end to an awful trilogy...,"And so we arrive at the end of Star Wars episodes one to three, a scornful and exploitative six to nine hour merchandising marathon the likes of which we will be lucky to never see again."
259,5,"Laughably bad writing, direction and acting","I was hoping for a grand end of the prequel trilogy of my favorite movies when I was growing up. I still remember being a 10 year old kid sitting in the Colosseum movie theater in Oslo being totally at awe in watching Return of the Jedi back in 1983. It has always been the greatest movie experience of my life and it always will be. I now think that Empire is even better (I was too young to see it in 1980) and have bought the original trilogy on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD (and I will buy them when they come to Blu-ray). This prequel trilogy was just such a waste. All the talent in front of and behind the camera, except Lucas, was wasted on these movies. I have written a review on the first prequel movie and I must say now that I feel even worse about it, episode 2 and this movie. I have seen all three of the prequel movies several times now and I must say that they contain so much clichés that it is almost frightening. I cannot say how many times I cringe when I see these horrors that are disguised as Star Wars movies. When I see the pod race in the first movie I keep thinking that I am seeing a sort of desert live-action Wipe-Out race."
260,6,Not compelling,"Watching the final part of the prequel trilogy gives one a real sense of closure, which is very good indeed, but also a real sense of emptiness, which isn't so good. I don't mean just an empty feeling because there are no more Star Wars films on the horizon, I mean empty as in sadly unfulfilling. If Star Wars Episode III were a candy bar, it wouldn't be Snickers."
261,4,30 seconds of meaningful cinema,"The Star Wars trilogy (IV to VI) was path breaking - the special effects were like never before seen, the story had meaning, the cast was interesting. There was substance, there was excitement. Now Mr. Lucas has lost all his magic and turned this into a meaningless franchise of useless drivel. Episode I was horrific - the menace of Jar Jar Binks has me cowering. I skipped EP II. But I was a captive audience (as in on a long bus ride) to Episode III. The special effects made me feel like I was watching a video game in progress. The robots all died after three shots, screams and their eyes exploding! Anakin was played by arguably the worst actor ever - who told Lucas that Hayden Christensen could act? And Natalie Portman was no better. Yoda and Obi Wan were the only engaging characters. Even Samuel L. Jackson flailing about with his light saber couldn't save this travesty. The last 30 seconds when the metallic mask was finally put on Darth Vader, dotted some is and crossed some longstanding ts. But was the 2 hour long torture necessary? This is one to be avoided at all costs. A word of advice to Mr. Lucas regarding numbers 7, 8 and 9 - please do not go there!"
262,8,Technology is foe!,"I wasn't all that impressed with this final definitive installment linking the prequels to the original Star Wars Trilogy, but I still had fun and that's what really counts. Episode I, II, and III by no means comes even close to the magic of IV, V, and VI. I believe technology is to blame, and way too much of it. Lucas abandoned actual live sets for CGI and left his actors with nothing more than a green screen. No matter how technologically advanced our computers become they can never, that's right I said ""NEVER"", take the place of what is real. It may come close, but life is to precise in its detail to ever be captured completely. The original Star Wars was magic because of the ambition of it's creator and the lack of computer assistance, the greatest things in life will always be found in simplicity. Lucas spent so much time focusing on the computer graphics that he lost the realism needed to touch his audience. I felt incomplete when I left the theater as though the story still wasn't finished, however I still gave this film an 8, heavily influenced by my love for the first three films. If this film stood alone I would give it a 4, and suggest 20th Century Fox to declare a loss. Peter Jackson delivered 100 times better with Return of the King than Lucas and his Sith. I really wanted to love this movie! ):"
263,9,Thank you for Star Wars!,Thank you George Lucas and to everyone involved in bringing us this wonderful movie series! I love Star Wars Episodes 1-6 and it is my favorite movie series.
264,10,"If Star Wars must end, this is the way to end it!","(NOTE: THERE WILL BE MAJOR SPOILERS WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!!) As the Clone Wars rage on, spreading Jedi across the galaxy, the Seperatists dare to strike at the heart of the republic. Led by General Grievous, the evil cyborg, the Seperatists kidnap the Supreme Chancellor of the republic, Palpatine. Two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, are sent out to rescue the Supreme Chancellor, and what unfolds is an epic space battle and a lightsaber duel with the Sith Lord and Seperatist leader Count Dooku. After a successful rescue, the two Jedi end up being separated. Obi-Wan is sent to find General Grievous, who escaped the epic space-battle. Anakin is left on Coruscant, capital of the republic, to spy on Chancellor Palpatine, whose actions in the Senate seem suspicious. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith, is looking for a new apprentice, since Anakin killed Dooku."
265,7,A Pretty Darn Good Star Wars Movie,"*Contains some very teeny tiny ""spoilers""*"
266,1,what an awful lot of crap,"After reading and hearing so much good about this star wars picture I can't prevent myself noting down some negative aspects. To be honest: it is in fact awful. It is strange and impossible to believe that someone who apparently is so inventive and creative in producing special effects on the film screen, is so utterly lacking in any sort of talent for making a real film. Most of the film consists of scenes in which Yedi-knights are wielding their laser swords; in fact no 5 minutes pass by without these things flying around. However, the acting is so really unbelievably bad, that after a few minutes of a crap of a dialog one prays for a fighting scene: all is better than this. Awful music. Absolute no humor. Babies delivered to ""loving"" carers with sunsets (2 suns!!) in the background and swelling choruses. Unbelievable drama: why is Mr Anikin turning to the Dark Side? Because of a nightmare??? Next time less gin in your cocktail, Mr Anikin! A possible Yedi knight, trained in wisdom, walking over to the dark side because of a sleepless night??? You need a good psychiatrist and your wife a good obstetrician, I would say. And than the fighting between two individuals: these always end with the good guy seeming to fall into a precipice, but no, he holds on with his fingernails, magnetically attracts some sort of gun laying in the neighborhood and kills the bad guy off. So, during a fight you see a precipice looming up, you know the end of the fight is near. And so on, and so on. Keep away from star wars!!!!"
267,3,"""I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.""","I have always been a huge Star Wars fan. I've seen ""the Holy Trilogy"" scores, if not hundreds of times, I've read the books, I've bought the toys, I even played the card game. All of these things make me not only a geek, but a person whose soul was crushed when he saw Episode III. I can't possibly convey to you using words my disappointment and horror as a reaction to this film. Harrison Ford's old quote to George Lucas, ""You can write this s***, but we can't say it!"" doesn't come close to embodying the sheer awfulness of the script. There is melodrama that is laughable, and comedy that just fails on every level. Lucas has squandered a great cast and elicited some of the worst performances in cinematic history (no hyperbole), and even Samuel L. Jackson was bad. The action and CGI are amazing, but they are the only redeeming features of the movie, and there is not enough of them to make it worth sitting through two and a half hours of Lucas' offensively horrendous dialogue."
268,9,"Lucas, you finally made a better movie than ""Empire""","This is it, the movie that fans have been waiting to see for God knows how long. An average viewer would think that the expectations are too high, that no matter what the movie delivers, they will be sadly disappointed because they wanted more. "
269,5,Very silly,"Silly. Very silly. Very, very silly in fact. The script still has the vocabulary and creativity of an impaired third-grader, the acting is either so far over the top (in the case of the emperor) or devoid of talent (in the case of Anakin) that you want to barf at times, but the movie is saved by the fact that it is so (unintentionally) funny in so many places that you stay awake in anticipation of the next howler. I suppose if you're one of these sad people who drool over cornflakes packages containing light sabre mazes and sacrifice a goat to the shrine of George Lucas that you've built in your attic you would find the film stunningly brilliant, but for the rest of us who see Star Wars for what it is (a rather plain kids' space opera), it's just harmless mental froth. Yeah, worth a viewing I guess, but put the brain on 'low' before entering the cinema."
270,9,Cult Classic,"I'm so glad in recent years we're seeing a rise in well deserved love for the prequels. They expanded on not just the immense world building of Star Wars, but also the tragedy of the characters, especially Anakin. Hayden embodied him in a beautiful manner that portrayed the conflict and confusion in a perfect way."
271,3,It wasn't with me.,"The force, I mean. Now it is commonly known that the force has left George Lucas a long time ago, but he still keeps shooting movies. The latest addition to the Star Wars saga is, in my eyes, the worst so far. It is a nearly random collection of battle scenes, sometimes even jumping back and forth from one to the other, which I found really annoying. But cut out an hour of battle out of this overly long film, and all you have left are pathetic dialogs, which wouldn't really make it that much better, either. Lousy acting, particularly from Hayden Christensen, adds to the pain. Watch it for completeness, but don't expect quality."
272,4,This is what passes for a good movie?,"I am no stranger to the ""Star Wars"" films. I have seen all six of them and even the infamous ""Clone Wars"" movie from 2008. This terrifies me. I can understand people claiming this is the best of the prequels, but then there is all that talk about how it is as good or even better than ""Empire Strikes Back"". How is this film that popular? I do not understand."
273,,If you like video games . . .,"A two hour and twenty minute explanation of how a fine young Jedi warrior could wind up as Darth Vader. The fable is told with an orgy of top grade special effects. It is a must-see for teen geeks, but for mature audiences it is like watching a teenager play a video game with the volume too high. If you saw the original Star Wars when it came out in 1977, you are too old to still be watching Star Wars movies."
274,10,A near perfect masterpiece,"George Lucas' amazing storytelling ability at its finest! Every detail is used by Lucas to perfection from the political intrigue, the influencing of Anakin by Palpatine, to the war effort by Kenobi to hunt Grievous. Each scene is intentional in crafting the ultimate story. Each character is used to their fullest emotionally and has probably their best moments in the entire prequels. The final fights are something to behold that all fans of movies Star Wars or no should see. The only problem with this movie is literally one poorly written dialogue scene. Lucas is a master of a lot of things, but dialogue is not one of them. The dialogue is truly cringe worthy in this scene, but honestly I don't care. The movie is that good! If it were not for the poor dialogue scene, this would rank among the top films of all time. The story crafting is THAT good."
275,10,Best of the Latest Trilogy,"Wow! Lots of expectations, lots to live up to and nowhere to go but down. However Lucas does a masterful job of putting together his finest work of the new trilogy."
276,9,Breaking My Heart...,"When a pregnant Pademe (Natalie Portman) confronts her husband, Anikan (Hayden Christensen), after he has chosen his path down the Dark Side of The Force in ""Star Wars: Episode III-- Revenge of the Sith"", she cries, ""...You're breaking my heart!"" And for the first time in the movie's trilogy, this one does have a heart. For the most part it was worth the wait. Writer and Director George Lucas in the end has redeemed his saga of classic tragedy set ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" Lucas's Episode III even with it's weaknesses (patches of dialog and over exposition), has genuine pathos and drama. Episode III is perhaps the most visually stunning movie ever made. Though what had plagued this series was the storytelling."
277,7,"Far, far away from it's potential...","After 22 years of waiting, since 1983′s ""Return Of The Jedi"", we were sat in the auditorium ready to witness the epic moment when Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker would finally turn on one and other and Darth Vader's conception would be complete."
278,,Fantastic stuff!,"Today, at last, I saw Episode III for the first time. To be honest, I had great expectations (also because of the fantastic trailers)  they were fulfilled and even topped! The plot can be told very quickly, I think: The movie takes place one or two years after Episode II, chancellor Palpatine shows his true face, Anakin becomes more and more influenced by the dark side  we all know the result of this (two words: heavy breathing) and his marriage with Padmé develops into a dramatic direction. Besides you have the usual: Spaceships in blasting battles, troups, aliens, monsters, beasts and light sabers."
279,7,"best prequel by miles, but still not as good as the originals","SPOILERS So this is it. Almost thirty years after George Lucas released ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" we go full circle to the creation of Darth Vader. Written and directed by Lucas, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a strange film because it is the darkest and most well thought out film since ""Empire Strikes Back"", but it also contains some of the worst dialogue and woeful scenes of the entire series. It is an enigma, but it is an entertaining one."
280,1,Revenge of the (re-arrange the letters in S-I-T-H),"Too many incongruities ( Yoda - flexible at times, then needs a cane? Annikin turns evil in a heartbeat, etc)."
281,8,"Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Darkness,","Anakin Skywalker drifts towards the dark side and the cutesy nature of this new trilogy is minimized, easily making this the best of the second trilogy. Most of the scenes even have less light in them to add to the effect that was started in the second half of Attack of the Clones. The biggest thrill in this movie is watching Ian MacDiarmid slash his way through the scenery. He was given next to nothing to work with in the first two films, but he makes up for it here. then, there is the fight that everyone has been waiting for, as Obi-Wan and Anankin duel near a planet's surface as lave rushes by. Although, I'm still not sure why Obi-Wan couldn't finish off his friend. If he cared about him so much, why would he leave him to suffer? There is still a sense of the childish in this movie and Natalie Portman, while beautiful, is mind numbingly dull for the third time, but this movie nearly reaches the same heights as the weakest of the original trilogy."
282,10,"blew my mind , totally awesome","To me this is the best star wars movie of all , the visuals effects are stunning by far the best seen on any movie ever . This movie is the revenge of Lucas he took to heart the bad stuff all you critics & OT fans said about the first two prequals and he totally got this one right no jar jar , no bad acting & no lame dialog for a love story , every thing came together in a fantastic way , this movie pieces together all the story lines & made me want to watch episode 4 right away . The fall of the Jedi was an incredible sequence both dark & brutal , I just loved the dark stuff in this movie god I just can't believe how Anakin became so dark , he was awesome as Palpatines apprentice , In Anakins eyes he was doing it to save Padme from certain death at child birth so in away he was tricked by Palpatine telling him that he could teach Anakin to save lives through the dark side . So all in all if you like movies you must see this one & if you are one of those who didn't like episode 1 & 2 don't worry you won't be disappointed with episode 3 I'm sure you'll love it just as much as me."
283,10,A masterpice star wars movie,One of the best star wars movie in my opinion.
284,2,"It all hinges on this one, and Lucas blew it","When people talk about prequel disappointment, they're usually talking about ""The Phantom Menace"". And it was a shaky start, to be sure. Still, there was always promise that the next movie would be better and finally hit the groove again (even after ""Attack of the Clones""). But ""Revenge of the Sith"" crushes that promise and buries it six feet under. This movie was beyond disappointing; it was a total waste."
285,8,The start of darkness and the birth of light and a new hope!,"Of the three prequels Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith is one that ends and sets up the way for Star Wars a New Hope just perfect due to the fact that it shapes the story with the birth of central characters and the start of an evil being of darkness. Picking up years after the clone wars the Jedi Knights Obi-Wan and Anakin still have to finish a battle with the evil dark federation all in the meantime a major shakeup will happen with young Skywalker. As now the fate has finally came true Anakin takes a turn to evil, yet even more important is the fact that Anakin has gotten his love Padme pregnant and she has twins before she leaves the galaxy and these two little people are gonna be pretty important people later on in the force! Overall pretty good film that reveals some major developments."
286,,Its initials are ROTS. This is an omen.,"Except that the film cannot be spoilt, being already so very, very poor."
287,5,Wow...its Incredibly Mediocre!,"While I realize there is little I can say that has not already been said and that no matter how strong an opinion I do voice it will not change the minds of the legions of ""Star Wars"" fans, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do."
288,7,"Much better than the previous two, the next ones are still better!","""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (USA, 2005, 140 Min., Theatrical Version) "
289,1,A film too far,"To make a film straddling the prequels and the ""real"" Star Wars trilogy would tax even a great film-maker....Mr Lucas is not that film-maker."
290,3,"clunky, insipid, and illogical space soap opera","Though science fiction requires a willing suspension of disbelief, this film requires a suspension of logic and common sense. "
291,8,The ending in the middle,"This ending in the middle, following the curious episodes order of the Star Wars Saga fits very well in the circle, and this seems to have been the main goal of Director George Lucas. By the end of the film not only we know how Anakin Skywalker turned into Darth Vader, but we also fit many other pieces of the puzzle at the right place. That's good."
292,7,Best of the Rest,"Revenge of the Sith is by far the best movie of episode 1-3. If Lucas just would have made the other two movies of the same quality... A great improvement is also the performance of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker: whereas in the other two movies his performance has without doubt some issues, in Revenge of the Sith he rocks the house. To sum it up: Star Wars: Episode III can't reach the power and beauty of the three movies of the original trilogy, but is without doubt the strongest one of the first and final trilogy. Epic, but with some (mostly) minor issues."
293,1,A Waste of Celluloid,It's not as bad as the first two but it is still a pathetic waste of time. I watched episode 4 last night and it is still the best of all of them. Hayden Christenson should join George Lucas and just go away and never bother us again. Ewan MacGregor could join them with no loss to the movie-going public also. I will not go see this dog a second time nor buy the DVD when it comes out. I'll stick to the original three episodes.
294,7,Best of three...,"It is unquestionable that this is the best entry in this trilogy. An accomplishment which most likely was not hard to achieve considering the first two were really, not great!"
295,9,"""Hello There!""",Star Wars III: Revenge Of The Sith (2005) -
296,7,"At least, the end !!!!! (Screen)","My first star wars movie (and cinema experience) was ""The Empire strikes back"". I was then 6 years old, and Dark Vador (in France) has terrified me and gave me fever. Nonetheless, it was magic and I was very fond of collecting the toys, and inventing tons of stories with them."
297,1,A piece of Sith,Strategically mix up the letters in the word Sith and you'll have an apt one-word description of this movie and the other prequels.
298,8,An excellent recovery in the series and the only prequel to Star Wars IV: A New Hope,"""Twenty eight years, I worked it out"" said the guy next to me as we sat and waiting for the movie to start. For those of us who saw, and loved, the original Star Wars trilogy this has been a long wait, and the journey over the past few years an extremely disappointing one. So when the music began and those famous words appeared, my excitement and expectations could not have been any higher."
299,8,The tough exercise that was the 'Star Wars' prequels pays off,"As the conclusion to the prequel trilogy, ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" is easily the best of the three. How could it not be? The whole trilogy is about Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader and how the stage came to be set for the original movies. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is finally the movie that does that – it gets to deliver. Payoff, payoff, payoff."
300,9,The movie that saved the prequels,"When I went to the cinema to see Revenge of the Sith in 2005, my expectations were pretty low after the mediocre Episodes I and II. But this movie proved everyone wrong who had already written off the prequels."
301,7,Pretty darn excellent!,"Quite a few things can be said about the Star Wars prequels and it is not all positive. It is pretty safe to assume that you either love or hate them but in my opinion Episode III is pretty close to the high standards of the original three films. Many people felt that Episode I was to much directed towards children, a lot of people felt that the main character (Anakin) was too weak in Episode II but Episode III remedies both these things."
302,3,How Disappointing,The last two Star Wars movies sucked dead fish with a straw. (That's a film criticism term.) I had high hopes for this one.
303,1,Why the Hate?,"I'll tell you why. Mr. George Lucas has taken the Star Wars myth, one of modern cultures most well known stories, populated with some of the worlds most beloved characters, and completely and irrevocably flushed it all down the toilet. For many others and me Lucas is a legend killer. I won't go into the gruesome details of this failure that so many others have already cataloged but will say that the blunders are legion. What is most frustrating is the total wasted opportunity. Lucas had the money, the resources, and the creative control to produce an epic, a timeless tale about the Rise of an Empire and the Fall of a Man, that surpassed the Original Trilogy and entered the pantheon of cinemas greatest accomplishments. Oh, what could've been? Instead we get ridiculous situations, phony characters, non-existent motivations, and fart jokes. Ugh! It should be noted that on the best of the OT, ESB, Lucas had the least collaboration. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Also, I do understand why these ""movies"" receive so much praise and adulation. It's the same reason why some people believe that professional wrestling is real and others believe that there is a dime's worth of difference between the Republican and Democrat parties."
304,3,The Lucas Lite machine has cloned its final self.,"In the wake of this film, the risk of George Lucas's bubble finally bursting will rise as he now gets around to doing all those 'other' film projects he's had on the back burner for nearly 30 years. It fathoms the imagination as to how a man could attain such mythical status and a billionaire's portfolio over a directing and writing mini-career that's degenerated since ever since his THX student days (yes, even American Graffiti was overrated). I won't re-walk previously tread ground. The critics of this film have adequately, even eloquently, derided the gross defects of Revenge of the Siths. Many have said it doesn't hold a candle to the original trilogy. I'll be happy to go out on a limb to say, on the contrary, it is perfectly faithful to the mediocrity of the five previous installments. As for the reasons why this film seems to enjoy 8.0+ respectability on this site I would first ask the IMDb to remind us what steps it takes to avoid 'ballot stuffing' and then go on to say that the people who appreciated this film must either a) be under the age of 13, b) were under the age of 13 when New Hope (the first prequel sequel) was released, or c) have become so intoxicated by the direction that cinema has gone since the original Star Wars that they have forgotten that special effects, regardless of how well-executed should never be considered more than frosting on a well-layered cake. They do not replace the classic essentials of story and character."
305,1,What could have been,"This has to be the most money and effort ever put into such a horrible script. The dialogue is ridiculously inane, the character motivations are manufactured, and the acting is less than second rate. I wish I understood how people can enjoy paying over $10 to see a movie where the second most charismatic character is a robot, R2-D2, that can't speak. If George Lucas does the final three installments - he should make them comedies. For a while I thought I walked into the sequel for Spaceballs. Of course, the acting was not even that good."
306,8,By George....,"This is just my personal opinion, but none of the three prequels have made an impact on me the way the first three Star Wars saga had on me. They were all average in the sense that visuals were only par with what you can see on TV in the '90s on ward, and story line lacked the suspense first three Star Wars movie had. It was basically a story to explain other stories rather than a stand alone piece. Still I think George could have done a little better job with plot and sub-plot development (the only good dialog in this movie was ""So this is how democracy dies. With thunderous applause.""). Plot lacked a binding central theme other than to explain how Luke and Leia comes into existence and how Anakin turns into Darth Vader (In which his transformation to the dark side seemed sudden and unnatural to me). I think George Lucas surrounded himself with too many yes men and non-thinkers. For instance, in all the CGI back ground and visuals, things are repeated too many times (like cars, robots, buildings etc.) which takes away from the visual by being too busy. There's generally too much of everything. This I guess is the art department just going along with the computer guys concept (because they can duplicate stuffs easily), and all earthly scenes all looks like they're shot in Europe: The buildings, large marble interior etc. etc. and costumes that also looks like they're feudal age Europeans, which just makes me feel not out there in a galaxy far far away. In contrast to this, ANH had many never seen characters, and back drops such as the storm troopers, battleships, tie fighters, X-wing fighters and yes, I did feel like I was in a galaxy far far away. ESB was even better in this regard. So by George, how did such an original concept filled franchise turn into so mundane a series ?"
307,2,"Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing","The line from King Lear probably best describes what should have been a clever script, but instead was ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"". The writers of the screenplay must have felt very hogtied in what they could do to keep this movie legitimate in accord with the two previous episodes and three ensuing episodes that the writers were bound to live by. However, the lack of imagination in tying the stories together was so appalling, that one wonders why the movie was made to begin with. The movie starts out with what looks like some ignorant video game, the director reveling in his chaotic world, but he doesn't bring the audience with him. Most of what follows is uninspired dialogue, only written to cement the movies together, a vain attempt to establish character, and more special effects that no one cares about. However, the biggest flaw is the future Darth Vader, who we know will turn evil, but his trust in an evil creature to keep his word is more than bewildering. It just doesn't get established as believable on a character standpoint. The characters of Obi and Yoda are much better drawn, but the viewer feels he must credit that to the writers of the other movies, since the other characters are so blandly written, and the dialogue is beyond cheesy. The movie actually looks more like an insane video game. So much so, its hard to care about anything that occurs. The viewer must struggle throughout what seems like an endless movie. Obviously made just to cement the portions of the story together, with absolutely no creative talent thrown in. A good example of what kind of tripe is formed when a movie is made up by storyboard artists instead of creative individuals."
308,8,Nice puzzle with stunning special effects,** HERE BE SPOILERS ** 
309,2,Nnoooooo! - Is Lucas on drugs?,"What can i say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Absolutely everything is wrong about it.Anyone would think Lucas was on a mission to kill off our happy memories of the original trilogy. Perhaps the disaster which is this film is best summed up by the central character Vader.He let flies with the most cringe worthy,embarrassing, pathetic line in the history of film making. ""NNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"". A moment of absolute ridiculousness , which killed any remaining respect I had for George Lucas."
310,10,An Epic Prequel Conclusion,"Surprisingly believe it or not, i never give any of the three first original Star Wars a score 10, so do The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones and those with a various different problem, the one that near was The Empire Strikes Back, and finally Revenge Of The Sith is the first to receive it, it is an epic prequel conclusion, with a story and ending that we all actually already know but the movie still manage to have that excitement and epicness of a story, action, visual and special effects, characters, performances, and feeling too, it is safe to say that my personal overall thoughts on Star Wars prequel trilogy was great, i enjoy it, and i like it, Revenge Of The Sith is the best to ever do it so far for me."
311,8,This movie salvages the Prequel Trilogy,"Those who suffered through the previous two Prequel movies to arrive at this point finally have their payoff. This movie isn't great, but it is good, good enough to make it worthwhile to suffer through the previous two films in order to fully appreciate the backstory and plot of this one."
312,1,It was a real disappointment,"I am disappointed that people ranked this movie at around 7, because the acting is horrendous. It seems that George Lucas wasn't really concerned with acting, because there were some pretty good actors like Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor, and they failed to make this movie worth watching. The CGI effects were of questionable quality. I believe that the hardcore fans of the Star Wars series ranked this movie so high, because it has the name ""Star Wars"" in the title. They failed to judge the movie for what it really was. The only scene that was worth watching, was the scene were Obi Wan is fighting with Anakin. All in all this movie is poor, considering that it was the most expected movie of the year, it was a real disappointment."
313,4,Quite a disappointment,"As fanboyish as I am for anything concerning Star Wars, Star Trek or James Bond, I was looking forward to this movie. Episode I wasn't all that great, but Episode II was significantly better, so I had high hopes for this movie to be the best of the series. However, despite all my fanboyishness, I was in for a disappointment."
314,4,the effects were good,"When I worked at a video store,this was the line I would give when people asked about The Day After Tomorrow which was the new DVD release at the time.The rule of thumb was that we had to say something positive about a release no matter how bad it might be and that's the line I'm going to use here..The effects are good and some of the action sequence are also good but go by too fast and overload the senses in that you can't enjoy them...Same with the lightsaber battles...Some people say this is on par with Empire...Nowhere near it...The duel in Empire was like two predators stalking one another..The ones here feel like a speed race...As for story..What story??This movie feels incomplete in it's story and looks like the editing wasn't complete...Some scenes in fact feel incomplete unless you've read the novelization...And despite what all the Lucas yes-men say..it does not answer every question and I got no sense of wonder or excitement from the last few scenes at the end and the Vader appearance was over hyped...As for the acting....Ian McDirmid does the best job followed by Ewan McGregor...Dopn't get me started on the other two...They didn't have any chemistry in Ep. 2 and they don't here...One would think that by working with Ian McDirmid,Hayden Christiansen would be inspired to step it up a notch but doesn't...As for all this talk about the comparisons with Gearge Bush,as a conservative republican I don't see it mainly because that would require some level of intelligent writing and that isn't present...But the effects were good"
315,9,The Best Movie from the Saga - A deep insight of the force and human behavior,"In Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, we have a somewhat different approach into what is the regular line of the movies. It's an approach that gives us a deeper understanding of all the Star Wars Saga and particularly about the Jedi Order and the Force."
316,10,I love this film,This film gives you everything from a good story line and a good line up for a new hope.
317,5,Force-ing A Point: How George Lucas Fooled All Of The People All Of The Time.,"Revenge Of The Sith is darker than other Star Wars episodes in the sense that ""Scooby Doo Meets Dracula"" is darker than ""Scooby Doo Meets the Harlem Globetrotters""."
318,,THE TRUE OPINION,The movie sucks... I love it
319,2,Revenge of the CGI software!,"Take a beautiful idea, add tons of CGI with a little dry acting and forced melodrama and sell it like a cheap bicycle at a flea market. Thats Revenge of the Sith."
320,2,"Rest in Peace, CGI Wars (er, I mean Star Wars)","Why do so many IMDb members rate this movie highly? ""The actors really pulled it off,"" they say. Are you kidding, a third-grader couldn't be fooled by that acting. In fact, it wasn't even acting. It was the sound of thespians being tortured. ""The plot-line was gripping,"" they say. Gripping?! This must be the MTV generation talking: ""Give me flashes of light, give me staccato scene changes, give me words dropped like concrete balloons from another dimension, and I'm totally gripped."""
321,5,"Please people, open your eyes!","Growing up, I loved the original Star Wars Trilogy. The plots were sound, the characters were well-developed, and even though the basic ideas behind the movies were fantasy, the basic theme remained BELIEVABLE! Nevermind the fact that the first two movies were basically wasted with regards to the supposed main theme of these three movies: Anakin's descent to the dark side of the force. Can you imagine how awesome this would have been if this truly had been the focus of the first two movies? A slow, gradual pitfall resulting in one of the best villains ever seen in a movie? Instead, Anakin chooses the dark side in literally about 10 minutes in the final movie. It was almost as if Lucas thought to himself while writing ""Whoops! Gotta throw this in here somewhere... ah, here we go..."" The plot of this movie is awful. A legion of Jedi, including Yoda, who demonstrates in the original movies an ability to determine a person's intentions through the force, are wiped out by a massive conspiracy that NO ONE SEEMED TO REALIZE WAS COMING. Awful. Nevermind the fact that they were all wiped out in a matter of minutes in the movie... after all, from everything else we've learned about the Jedi in the past, they are obviously easily defeated, especially when ALL OF THEM are being targeted. Stupid."
322,4,Continues the nonsense of Episodes I and II,"Ludicrous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old Annakin, who somehow seems appealing to Amidala, 5 years his senior. Now 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. Ludicrosity squared."
323,3,A long time ago in a galaxy made of CGI...,"Warning, this unquestionably contains spoilers. (How can it contain spoilers when we know the ending? By quoting wholesale from the script. I have done this because it is the best way I can think of to demonstrate how bad this film is, letting it speak for itself.) "
324,7,Best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back,"Revenge of the Sith is not only the best of the prequel trilogy, but arguably the best film in the Star Wars saga. It is a roller-coaster of fun that is also packed full of poignant scenes and moments, and is dense with powerful themes and symbolism."
325,3,Disappointing enough for me to join IMDb and post a review,"STAR WARS: EPISODE III - Revenge of the Sith RATING: = 3/10. A major letdown with laugh out-loud bad dialogue and computer generated overload. It was great to see the Darth Vader suit fitting, but the rest was pretty much disposable. Kids who haven't seen many films or fans of computer generated overload movies such as ""Van Helsing"" will like it."
326,7,An exciting movie with great pacing but flawed,"The third episode of Star Wars (Revenge of the Sith) was a great movie, this piece of the trilogy contained VERY GOOD PACING, VERY GOOD VISUAL EFFECTS, GOOD DIALOGUE, DECENT ACTING. As the best movie of the prequel trilogy i found it very enjoyable, it was entertaining with its recurring important events to the franchise and iconic lines of dialogue. It may not seem as a great movie technicality-wise because it is not but it is far more important than that the fact that the viewers can enjoy it no matter their age. The effects and scenery on this movie where fantastic as shown in the epic battles you can presence throughout the film, the passion along the continuing and long lasting duels between good and evil. The acting was not terrible but it is certainly not award-deserving, a good job from Ewan McGregor and a clear improvement from Hayden Christensen since the Episode II. It is simply fantastic and emotional to watch whether it is the first time or the 10th time you watch it."
327,4,revenge of the sh#t,"Is it a coincidence that Sith is an anagram of sh#t? The final instalment of the new trilogy of star wars films arrives on a wave of hype and expectation and leaves on a star destroyer heading for planet boring in the fall flat nebular. Badly directed, scripted and acted this film relies on CGI like crutches to hold itself up. I had to keep reminding myself to be objective not to let this movie off the hook just because its star wars and I love star wars. That's what I did with the first two, but now with hindsight I can safely say that they too were not really that good. But this film takes the biscuit. We all know the story, Darth did it, but that doesn't mean Lucas should go ahead and make it so bland, like paint by numbers in space. Don't get me wrong there was the odd little set piece that was good but overall after a 27-year wait it was well not really worth it. We were promised so much and given so little, Wookies fighting? Only a bit and when they did why did they all do Tarzan impressions? R2-d2 was I'm sure there for comedy effect, it became like carry on star wars as every time something was about too happen he let out a high pitched robotic ooohh. Anakin's transition into Darth Vader just kind of happened, the build up sort of fell down. There was more emotion at the hint of his turning in clones when he slaughtered the sand people and admitted it to padmé. Here the emperor just promises him the ability to save her life (even though she may or may not be dying) and apparently that does it, off he spiral on his evil path of destruction. Mace Windu who we were promised and I quote would 'not go out like a bitch' did just that. Windu out the window. Lucas seems to have an uncanny knack of producing interesting villains who are all killed really easily (Darth maul in menace etc) and here is no exception. Dooku goes first followed quickly by grievous I know Jedi's are hard but these enemies are just too easy. Based on them they should have won. I can't help but feel disappointment on seeing the best screen villain in film history reduced to a caricature as Darth breaks his shackles at the end and stumbles forward like a new born deer using his legs for the first time, wobbling he cries nooooooooo! Which is exactly how we felt after the film (just without the camp moves)."
328,7,Revenge of the Sith a return to form for Lucas,"I was quite young when Episode IV came out, and I loved it for its excitement. Having within the last year or two rewatched the original series, these are my observations:"
329,10,Only a Sith deals in absolutes.,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is significant, due to the build up in story and the introduction of Darth Vader. Though the poor writing and illogical thinking of the characters is pretty hard to overlook."
330,6,Star Wars III - Revenge of the Sith review,"'Revenge of the Sith' is a film some consider to be the best Star Wars prequel. That's not difficult. After 'Attack of the Clones,' anything would be an improvement. I saw 'ROTS' at the cinema a whopping three times! Yes, I was one of those people who loved it on first viewing (but less and less each subsequent time). Maybe it was the knowledge that this was (at the time) the last Star Wars film to be released (now that Disney have the licence, we will probably see a new Star Wars film out every week...). Maybe my expectations were so low, and my eagerness to appreciate the film so high, that I convinced myself I was watching a good film. After several rewatches later, however, I have come to my senses. Yes, it may be the best film of the prequel trilogy. There are some promising scenes. Lucas seems to try really hard to end his saga on a high note. However, it retains most of the flaws of the first two prequels, and creates a few of its own..."
331,8,"End of an era, a new beginning","As the final installment of the prequel, it's perfect. It answers all the questions, ties up all the loose ends neatly, all while remaining jaw droppingly amazing. Some parts leave you with utter despair and sadness, the bitter pit at the bottom of your stomach. You feel every betrayal, every disappointment. At times, even shock."
332,8,"Should you watch this? I say ""DEW IT!""","""Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith"" is a return to form for George Lucas after the shlocky screenplay and direction of the previous two entries. After an over-reliance on politics in the Republic that bogged down Episodes I and II, ""Episode III"" is a return to the classic space opera laced with fun action scenes we became accustomed to with the original trilogy. While this movie is a refreshing treat after the first two prequel films and a significant improvement on both, it is not without its flaws. ""Revenge of the Sith"" does an excellent job of trying to mask those flaws with a ton of action and effects that captivate the eyes, however."
333,8,"""The Epic Conclusion to the Star Wars Saga!","""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith"" is an epic conclusion to the Star Wars prequel trilogy that will leave you speechless! With stunning visual effects, thrilling action scenes, and unforgettable performances, this film is a must-watch for any Star Wars fan or movie lover."
334,10,My favorite Star Wars,"Not only is this the movie that we were all waiting for but it's also an absolute masterpiece. The story is tight and flows quickly with precision. And I think the biggest wow factor of this movie was what we had all been waiting for: how Anakin became Darth Vader. It was not a reason that any of us predicted or even could. But it felt right and natural. He became Vader because he thought he was doing good and not evil? What? And that's real stuff. Bad people don't think their bad, they think they're doing good."
335,9,"Best prequel, and that's saying a lot","I really liked the other star wars prequels, although probably not as good as the others, they were still entertaining. But this one has the heart of the first three, action scenes that compliment the story, special effects that are jaw dropping, character development, amazing acting, and a simpler, but still complex story line. Even with all that, it's still, just as entertaining as the the other two, it completes the story of not only the prequels, but brings the saga full circle, that way we now know why episode 4 is called A New hope. If you haven't seen it because you didn't like the other two prequels, I say it's worth a watch, though some dialog is bad, it has it where it counts, the story, effects, and character."
336,9,The one we've all been waiting for!!!,"I was seven years old in 1977 when Star Wars first came out, it was the movie that is responsible for my love of cinema. I don't consider myself a Star Wars geek, but I really have always loved the Star Wars universe. For the last 6 years it has been uncool to love Star Wars. The hammering of Episodes I and II was I thought, unfair. I have to agree that they aren't as memorable as the first trilogy but the public in general put expectations on this new trilogy that were so high that they were impossible to meet. Now comes Episode III, the one that logically would have to be the best one of the new series. And without a doubt it is!!! Every Star Wars fan had in our heads what this one should have been, and I have to say that except for a couple of quibbles, this film blew me away. It is easily the best film since Empire, George Lucas saved the best for last. He brought a closure to the story that is satisfying and sad. Sad because according to Lucas he won't do another film. He has announced that there might be a TV series, but I for one can't imagine liking a TV version of this story , it belongs on the big screen."
337,1,For (dumb) Kids Only,"I saw the Empire Strikes Back when I was a kid. I liked it. I saw it again when I was a teenager. I still liked it. Just to make sure that I was correct I watched it again before going to see the pre-quels. I was still amazed by the story, the characters, everything. Now, let's talk about TroS. It was empty, devoid of any emotion, full of ridiculous pieces of dialogue, unbelievable situations, unbelievable characters, fights without suspense, meaningless space battles. The movie tried to cling on to 'themes' from Star Wars like R2-D2, 3-CPO, Wookies, etc. But why? The first time the droids were funny, the sixth time they are not even annoying, they are just pointless reminders of the glory days. I couldn't care less what happened to them. The scene where R2 saves the heroes by remotely controlling an elevator: where did I see something like this? The main problem with repeating scenes from previous SW movies is that the audience already knows the scene so it's not original anymore. Worse still the audience already knows the outcome too, there goes suspense. So what's left is a mechanic execution of a trite re-enactment."
338,1,Is 'Sith' an anagram?,"George Lucas should really have stopped after the first three movies, which tell a good story linking fast paced action and adventure in a really snappy, original format. The more recent threesome are as fat, bloated and boring as George himself. The three movies tell a very simple story (the genesis of Darth Vadar) very laboriously, moving slowly from plot point to plot point, with little to lighten the journey along the way. The snappiness of the first three has been replaced with sheer drudge, and the characters, painted so sharply in the early movies, are muddled and unfocused and the whole thing is utterly dull. At least its all over."
339,8,Best of the new installments,"REVENGE OF THE SITH For the first time since ""Return of The Jedi"", I was unable to make the midnight session of a new Star Wars Installment. I saw it 21.5 hrs later though. Here's some thoughts on the movie:"
340,3,Whatever,"Mediocre at best. I can't believe friends of mine liked this and said it was dark. I guess it's certainly better than the last two, but I found it long, boring, and unconvincing. The acting seemed better in this one from the Anakin and Obi Wan characters, but it wasn't enough to carry the bad script. I didn't find Anakin's transition to the dark side powerful enough. Especially the one scene where he pledges his allegiance to Darth Sidius. ""What have I done??"" he says, in reference to killing the Jedi Master...followed immediately by ""I will do anything you ask of me"" to the Sith lord and then he goes out and kills younglings with no remorse. Wanting to save Padme could have been better developed. Even if they had stuck in a few lines between the ""What have I done"" and then ""I'll do whatever you want"" to see Anakin's will crumbling. And if the love between them was more heartfelt. Despite the good attempts of t he actors I just didn't find it convincing. And I dislike that they have Padme out of politics like some dumb housewife just saying things like ""let's go away to the lake and be in love and forget everything."" There were so many unnecessary boring scenes that could have been cut to make room for more character development that could have fixed these problems. And when the newly suited Darth Vader learns that Padme had died...what a pathetic scene. He cries out ""Noooo!"" in a very cow-like sound and that's it??? Darth Sidius says he killed her by striking her, and then it's all OK and they sit and watch the Deathstar being built like best buddies. I didn't feel the tragedy in this at all. This had all the makings of a good tragedy, tragic flaw and all. His love for Padme and refusal to lose her leads to him losing her, but this is so poorly executed in the script that it looses all the emotional pull it could have. A forgettable movie."
341,8,"Ten Simple Reasons Why ""Attack of the Sith"" is the ""Sith""",(and sorry for the lame pun) 
342,10,A perfect ending/beginning,"When I saw the first trailer,I thought ""This is gonna be good"".When I read that Steven Spielberg started crying during an advance screening and that an Italian critic who had seen the movie in Cannes considered it the best episode of all six,I was even more determined to see it as soon as possible.I went to watch it in Como with a couple of friends,and it was TOTALLY worth it!"
343,1,Do Not Hand Over Your Money For This Trash!,"People, pull it together!!!! The new Star Wars film is a piece of trite, poorly written, badly acted, ill-conceived, over-hyped tripe."
344,3,Well It isn't King Lear,"In a nutshell - ROTS is the best of the three prequel trilogy films. But then again Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than any of the prequel films. Two things stood out to me about this movie. The first is that Lucas seemed to be very rushed in his storytelling. The second was that the movie really had no emotional depth. Now many will say that this would be impossible since we all already knew that Anakin Skywalker would become Darth Vader. To those who say that let me point you to Peter Jackson's treatment of The Lord Of The Rings, a story which the majority of viewers already knew what was going to occur, yet Jackson still managed to create an exciting and fresh experience. Here Lucas had the benefit that no one knew what the causes were that lead Anakin to his fall from grace. All we knew is that he fell. He had a lot more room to maneuver story-wise, yet he threw it all away in favor of visually showing us what new technological gizmo's he could come up with."
345,7,Now that's more like it!,"Not just the best prequel but one of the best Star Wars films period. The stakes are higher, the emotions deeper and the performances much more relatable and real. This one far outweighs its two predecessors in quite literally every way. The action elements are turned up to 90 and you can really feel the tension surrounding each of our characters. Not perfect by any means but way above average and a fantastic departure from the boredom and staleness of Episode I and Episode II. This film really makes it mark on the franchise and while watching it, you can't help but feel that this is the story Lucas wanted to tell all along. Extremely entertaining and absolutely devastating."
346,8,Darth Vader scene was so exciting,"It is quite normal not to know about this movie in Azerbaijan, which used to be a part of the Soviet Union. Yes, I admit, I watched the original trilogy during my university years. Many young people now watch and love Star Wars movies, which are very enjoyable to watch. These movies were disliked by most fans, but I found them good, because I watched it too late and it was interesting to me."
347,7,Pretty good-not great but a worthy finale to series.,"I enjoyed this quite a lot. Sure you have the bugaboos from the first two prequel movies--some bad stretches of dull talky scenes, klunky dialog and acting that makes you roll your eyes. But this time-King Jorge Lucas managed to avoid letting that overwhelm the rest of the film and thus we got a good, bona fide decent movie Star Wars movie here."
348,8,This Star Wars prequel was pretty damn good!,"I was so hyped to see this movie six years ago. I just came back from camp in grade five and do you know what happened? I saw Episode III on the big screen. This was a day to be remembered. I was having a fit of excitement even when the 20th Century Fox opening came up, even when the Lucasfilm logo showed off its gorgeous majesty, and I was on the brink of sh***ing myself with excitement. I'm betting millions of other kids were having the same experience."
349,7,"alright, just not as good as the first three, but better than the last 2.","George still has problems working with live actors, and a serious problem with dialog. The movie is really good until the actors open their mouths, then the banal and trite seem to fly. Also, what on EARTH happened to Padme? she went from a kick butt queen to a whiny sob sister. It will be interesting how Lucas explains the discrepancy between what Princess Leia tells Luke about their mother and her dying right after the birth. "
350,4,"And so, it finally ends. Oh, what could have been.","Well, I finally saw it. I didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. While not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying."
351,8,Binks Has Been Booted!!!,The removal of Binks was enough on its own to make this the best movie of this trilogy.
352,5,Gets a pass for not being completely terrible,"For the third time in six years, I left the cinema back in 2005 after a screening of the eagerly anticipated conclusion to George Lucas' Star Wars prequel trilogy with a smile on my face, and satisfied with a decent addition to the franchise canon. Yet again, as time went by, I felt my opinion towards the film rapidly decline after subsequent viewings. I decided to re-visit the Star Wars series again in the hope of finding some unique charm to the prequels, be it nostalgia or just my general love for the universe I frequently visited as a child. Yet there is little fun to be had with Episodes I-III, and the films now seem more rigid, humourless and just plain boring as they ever did. Revenge of the Sith does offer some slight relief however, and ends the trilogy on a minor high thanks mainly to a darkness Lucas had promised previously but failed to deliver."
353,4,Previously rated this higher,"Having recently decided to blow through all the star wars movies, having done the first two episodes (mostly dreadful) and some clone wars stuff (okay), I was looking forward to this, having enjoyed it quite a lot at the time of it's release. I now realise my earlier rating of 8/10 simply placed it in direct comparison with the proceeding two movies, rather more than valuing it on it's own merits, in and of itself. So, here I am some 17 years later, and must admit I found this quite difficult to watch."
354,10,Perfect,"Final episode of the protagonist's fall into the dark side, which concludes a splendid story arc in a masterly way. Everything goes well in the film which is entertaining beyond belief."
355,9,It All Comes Together,"After the almost mythical success of the Original Trilogy, the first two movies of the Prequel Trilogy set the stage for a potentially explosive ""final chapter"". Well, ""Revenge of the Sith"" delivers the goods in nearly every way imaginable."
356,7,Ewan McGregor's Finest Performance As Obi Wan Kenobi,"The positives. After a very talky and slow moving second movie, this is has a lot more action in it. Ewan McGregor gives his best Performance as Obi Wan Kenobi, The final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin is the best light sabre battle in any Star Wars movie and I'm considering it a plus point that it's the last one of the prequels. "
357,8,Relations with the wookies I have,"Like the first two prequels, this movie features an embarrassing screenplay uttered by everything between small furry aliens to large droids. Some nice samples are ""good relations with the wookies I have"", ""no its because I'm soooo in love with you"" and ""NOOOOOOOO!!!"" Now this is where Revenge of the Sith is different and decidedly much better than the first two prequels. Instead of just continuing on the constant path of terrible dialogue and plot, ROTS features probably about 1 1/2 good scenes for every terrible line or moment. That extra half scene is what makes this movie so much better. It seems that for every hollow or badly-directed scene is another 1 1/2 surprisingly effective and emotional scenes."
358,5,Barely Watchable Final Installment of Star Wars Saga is Still Badly Scripted and Overacted,"You could argue that this review is a 2 1/2-times improvement over my rating of ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"". But when you consider that it only makes it to 5, whereas 6 is my bare minimum for real entertainment value, this is still a mediocre film at best, and still a boring overrated unpolished story at worst. The storyline is a little more interesting than the first installment, but again the script needed serious honing and rewriting. Putting on fancy Sci-Fi costumes is not character development, and nor is neat star-ships flying around good storytelling, in my humble opinion. In other words, simply calling it ""Star Wars"" with affects and costumes is not enough."
359,8,Wasted opportunity,Episode 3 is surely the best of the prequels but it really hurts to see how Lucas couldn't get over the wooden & cheesy dialog. He lost too much time in 1 & 2 with uninteresting story lines so he had to put all in 3 to tie up the loose ends.
360,6,"REWATCH: By far, the best prequel.","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog :)"
361,,Failed to live up to the hype.,"Can't say I was surprised that this did not live up to the hype, but I WAS surprised at how bad some of the acting was (special mention must go to Natalie Portman, who I love otherwise but who really was looking quite awful here, mostly in the scenes with Hayden Christiansen, who was not much better). Of course, Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino would have had trouble making such inane dialog sound believable, so what are you gonna do? Lucas is clearly scratching the bottom of the Star Wars barrel. This was not really that great a movie....on it's own. As part of the Saga you have to kick it up a notch or two just for being there, and Darth Vader IS a Mythic Villain for sure, but overall I was really under-whelmed."
362,7,revenge of the sith,It still has some bad parts but it is by far the best prequel
363,10,The BEST Star Wars film by the BEST Director there ever will be,"This movie is perfection. A good example of what passion and love for film making can look like without the interference from Hollywood executives or an activist producer or even worse, the lowly lot that resides on Twitter (you should never take anything a single person says on twitter serious)."
364,1,The Death of Star Wars,"... Kind of like, ""The Heat Death of the Universe"" - Meaning, it's Hopeless."
365,6,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"After reading the great reviews I was really looking forward to seeing this supposed ""Great"" movie that was finally as good as the original trilogy. I am a die-hard Star Wars fan and even thought that the criticism of episodes 1 and 2 were unfairly critical. Sure they were not as good as the originals (by far), but they were still entertaining movies that were better than 90% of the garbage that comes out of Hollywood today. The final showdown in Episode 1 between Qui-Gon, Obi-wan and Darth Maul was one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. Very well done and very intense. I really hoped that Lucas finally got it right and concentrated on the development of characters and story line and not just the eye-candy. I hate to say it, but Lucas you blew it."
366,8,Would class this as a step above the preceding two films,"Still not perfect, but 'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' is such a more enjoyable entry in the prequel trilogy - which ends strongly."
367,10,sith it?,"this film has some wonderful aspects. 1) the technicians involved in the movie, all of them did a great job. the sound, sound editing, score, cinematography, fx, film editing, et al. if there were no dialogue, just watching this film is a great experience. 2) the art direction was spectacular. the worlds they created, make-up and sets, costuming and design, creatures they designed, were truly great. and the choreography of the fights were exceptional. i loved watching Yoda decapitate those guards before they knew what hit them, and the individual battles between Anakin and Obi-won, Yoda and Palpatine, Windu and Palpatine, were athletic and convincing. and general Grievous, an android with a respiratory condition, intriguing! 3)Ian Mcdiarmid did a great job as the evil emperor. although i suspected he was the villain when he first appeared in the earlier films, his performance was great to watch. 4)character and emotion was prime here. jealousy, greed, love, remorse, sacrifice, betrayal, ruthlessness, loyalty, deception, hope, courage, despair and grief, emotions and their nature were easy to relate to."
368,6,"Kind of like Star Wars, but too much","The Clone War approaches its end as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi close in on Count Dooku and his nefarious sith master. Meanwhile, back at Coruscant, the political landscape is about to change as people elect to give more and more power to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. And in the midst of all this the Jedi Order must plot its course."
369,10,best 1,"i found this star wars the best of the lot even though the old ones are the classics, but that doesn't stop making it the best. the special effects and the great story line which combines all the star wars together gives a great edge. it is a non stop action film so i have to give it a 10 as this is the type i like (a non stop action). i think that this shows that Darth Vader is caring for his kids because he doesn't realise hes turned to the dark side and he is only trying to save her. if u haven't seen this I'm sorry for telling you but thats the way it is. this film finalises with the death of a lot of Jedi's which upset me but hey its only a film. i recommend this film to any age."
370,1,Estelle Getty gives a great performance as Yoda and only Ed Wood could have directed it better.,"Now that I have your attention, please allow to me to blaspheme this most recent Star Wars as the single worst motion picture ever made. It's bad enough to be just ""bad"" but this movie and all the hype around it manages to transcend badness -- entering into the realm of pure, subliminal marketing evil."
371,2,What is Everyone Thinking,"Lucas has not redeemed himself, not one bit! You would think that with all the amazing digital effects and character creation that Lucas is capable of conjuring up, he would be able to at least get a semi-believable performance out of A-List actors. The dialog is just plain awful. Even master Yoda's normally poignant dialog is ruined in this one, as George decided to make the audience have to stop and figure out what the hell he is saying. Also, Hayden doesn't quite fill out that Darth Vader costume. He looked about as menacing as the Vader costumes waiting in line at the theater. I am finally convinced that George has never been in love with a woman. The dialog between Padme and Anakin made me cringe every time they exchanged their horrid lines. Anakin: ""You look so beautiful tonight"" Padme: ""That is because I am so much in love"" UGH!!! I am giving ""Sith"" 2 stars, only for Yoda's humorous quick work of the Imperial Guards. Otherwise, it would have been a one."
372,8,An Awesome Star Wars Movie - But not without flaws,"The first two Star Wars prequel movies were certainly nothing close to the perfection of the original trilogy, but Revenge of the Sith was the prequel movie every fan dreamed of. A perfect John Williams score, tons of emotion, and epic action propelled this movie to be great.<br /><br />Some of the things that made it so great was scenes like the order 66 scene and the infamous 'lava battle' between Anakin and Obi Wan.<br /><br />There were a few things I didn't like though. I found Hayden Christiansen's performance to be meh, as I found him to be kind of whiny, and I would've liked more evidence to show Anakin's turn to the Dark Side, as it was very sudden. Also, episode 2 gave us the Padme/Anakin love story which continued to be absolute garbage in the movie, and ultimately held it back.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is a must see, great Star Wars movie, but there are flaws that hold it back from perfection."
373,8,The bulk of the story plays out,"George Lucas has said that when he had asserted that the entire prequel trilogy was planned in the era of the original trilogy, he actually only meant the story captured in Revenge of the Sith. Everything before that was less clear to him, and it feels very obvious in retrospect. The first two prequels were searching for a story with certain thematic elements taking center stage for moments at a time. The third one allows the viewer to look back over the first two films with a new lens to see what Lucas was trying to do far more clearly. The concepts of some of the things he dropped into the first two prequels were intelligently done, but the execution was always faulty. Here, everything comes together (mostly well) to deliver a story built on an idea but also functions as an actual story."
374,10,Just Amazing,"This movie was done perfectly,Anakin skywalker's fall into the dark side was done gradually and in a believable way.I just loved how palpatine corrupted his poor mind.This movie sinks well to the return of the jedi in jow darth vader was redeemed.Just perfect"
375,10,I'm speechless. Overwhelmed.,It was dark.
376,9,How awesome is this movie?!,"Only after garbage that's been created due to a ""woke"" nature and incometent leadership in continuing this saga, one learn to appreciate the ones that were made before."
377,5,Lucas failed,"Call me old-fashioned, but all the deadbeats who vote this movie a 10 without having seen it are really bugging me. That's sabotaging the ratings system. This movie is definitely not worth the current 8.1 rating."
378,9,Incredible conclusion to the prequel trilogy,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is an epic, emotional and thrilling tragedy with a reliably incredible score by John Williams, this is by far the best film in the prequel trilogy. Ewan McGregor is incredible once again and Hayden Christensen gives a much better performance than the previous installment. It's also has one of the best lightsaber fights in all of Star Wars. The CG is also incredible throughout and it's much better paced than the other prequesl. Only downside is the reason given for a character's death, which defies logic."
379,8,"Many of the answers we were looking for and all the shortcomings of previous episodes, especially the original trilogy, are answered satisfactorily","After 28 years, George Lucas concludes one of the series most relevant and commercially successful film history magnificently. Until then, Attack of the Clones was the best film of the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith but fully met the expectations of all."
380,7,"After watching Episode III, you'll have a much more different look on Star Wars! A masterpiece!",**** out of ****
381,10,The Fall of the Republic and the Rise of the Empire,"My favorite of the Prequels. The movies flies along giving us the fall of Anakin to the dark side. The end of the Jedi. The rise of the Empire. Order 66. Luke (he's the oldest!) and Leia. Great battles, including two of the best light saber duels in the entire series. This ends on a low note but is the best of the Prequels."
382,8,Darkly Tragic And Exciting Conclusion To The Second Star Wars Trilogy,"Order in the universe hangs in the balance as galactic war rages and the guardian Jedi Knights are threatened by the evil Sith Lords. Powerful Jedi Anakin Skywalker is manipulated by the evil Chancellor Palpatine into embracing the Dark Side of the Force and the Republic is torn in two as he embarks on the destruction of the old order. Can he be saved from his misguided lust for power ? The tremendous conclusion to Lucas' astounding six-film Star Wars saga has all the hallmarks of the other movies - stunning action sequences, eye-popping visual effects and a great story that sweeps along at breakneck speed. What's unique about it is that it's by far the darkest and most tragic of the tales; a man's misplaced loyalties and limitless ambition, combined with his tremendous powers, lead him to an irredeemable and hideous fate and destroy universal freedom in the process. It's grim stuff, and kudos must go to Lucas for producing a blockbuster epic that's closer to Macbeth than Flash Gordon. The film is also an odd experience in that its task is to set the stage for Star Wars (the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader, the birth of Luke and Leia, the inauguration of the Empire), which it does very well, but at the same time retaining its own dramatic structure. There are some inconsistencies (for example, in Return Of The Jedi, Leia says she can remember her mother, but her mother dies in childbirth), but they don't really matter - the pathos of the story is what counts. There are also some surprises, like the moment when Palpatine reveals his villainous identity and Anakin, rather than join him, immediately reports him to the Jedi Council. Anakin's descent towards Vader is afforded real depth, and any movie which presents the bad guys in a sympathetic light is always worth seeing. Christensen handles the pivotal role with aplomb, with McGregor giving strong support and the excellent McDiarmid gleefully stealing all his scenes in his second outing as the evil Emperor. As ever with the Star Wars universe, the visual imagination is simply outstanding - the rainswept landscapes of Attack Of The Clones are replaced with hellish infernos - and the action sequences are superb, notably the opening battle with General Grievous (cinema's first robot with emphysema) and the brilliant Night of the Long Knives montage as the Jedi are virtually wiped out. The visual effects by Brad Alexander, Roger Guyett and John Knoll, the music by John Williams, and the direction are all first-rate. Lucas may have his detractors, but none can deny that he has created an astonishing, exuberant series of films and in his lifetime has probably had more influence on film-making technique than any other director. This is a tremendous conclusion to his great cinematic vision."
383,,All we could expect,"All cinema fans owe George Lucas thanks for delivering a something unique in the history of the cinema: six linked films created over 28 years which have thrilled millions and created many iconic characters and magic moments. ""Star Wars III"" essentially delivers just what the franchise's supporters wanted: answers to all the questions posed by ""Star Wars IV-VI"", a neat conjunction of the two trilogies, and some fun along the way. As with all five previous ""Star Wars"" films, I saw it with my son and the audience's wild cheering at the opening seconds created almost a family atmosphere."
384,8,The link is done!,"What can I say, it's actually the first Star Wars movie that I actually enjoyed watching."
385,,Worth the two year wait.,"Attack of the Clones wasn't much of a movie, but it was enough to provoke my two year hype for this one. That's the second longest I've waited for a film's release (after Avatar). Well Episode III proved not only to be worth the wait, but in some ways it is the best entry in Star Wars."
386,4,The Titanic of the Series?,***Possible Spoilers***
387,10,Damn underrated,"This movie is pretty damn good, the special effect hold up for the most part, the dialogue is much better than the last 2 films but sadly and the overall script about temptation, willing of power is pretty amazing, sadly its underrated and unappreciated because of the two movies whom procidied this one, really sad!"
388,9,Too much criticism on an awesome movie,"This is my favorite star wars movie of all 7 episodes, just a bit above Episode 2. I can't understand the haters of these movies. Yes they have some ridiculous or childish elements (mostly the 1st, a bit the 2nd and much less the 3rd) but the same is true for the Episodes 4-6. In this movie it was ridiculous how Sidious killed 3 Jedis in some seconds but if we forget this and maybe a few details that i can't recall now itwas a really epic film. Rich plot, joy, sorrow, plot twist, 4 impressive light-saber duels with several characters, much action generally and very few romantic scenes (I liked the episode 3 more than the 2nd because it has much less romantic scenes and more action, but both are brilliant). Even the 1st Episode, with so much Jar-Jar show-time, was really very enjoyable. I guess many people watched the sequel many years earlier than the prequel and were different when watched the newer movies or probably are being nostalgic. I remember when i was a child a liked some movies/series really much, but if i had watched them now for first time, i probably would tell you that they are ridiculous and awful. Maybe, this is what happened to the haters of the new star wars Episodes?"
389,5,Thank goodness its over,"There's probably nothing I could say to dissuade a Star Wars fan from seeing the concluding episode to this space opera, and nothing I could do to persuade a non-fan to see this movie. So, all I will say is that for fans, this is like attending your child's college graduation: you're proud of the kid, and you're relieved to be moving on to the next phase of your life. You'll love the guaranteed-spectacular CG effects, you'll tolerate dialog that your grandmother could have written better, and you'll be satisfied that the story cycle is complete. Those not inclined to see this movie to begin with may get a laugh out of the review posted at http://bleacheatingfreaks.com/."
390,4,Nope,"This is the best of the prequels, which is like calling Moe the smartest of the Three Stooges."
391,10,HOPELESS,"This film, oh god, this film was one of the very few films that had make me feel sad but truly sad to the point of crying and i'm a person that doesn't like to cry for films or books, i think is dumb, but Oh GOD this film broke my heart, it made me feel hopeless, And i don't see it as a bad thing, The Revenge of The Sith makes you really be part of the world, part of the suffering and even if sounds terrible, it's what films are supposed to do, films don't just share a message but share emotions.<br /><br />I know that the script wasn't the best, we can obviously see that George didn't had such talent in that exact skill, but it still worked for me, i just love classic films, i like to find the beauty in all of them.<br /><br />One of my favorite STAR WAR FILMS! And one I HATE, Films should be loved and should be hated, BALANCE!"
392,9,A satisfying and emotionally gripping ending to a prequel trilogy!,"The lightsaber action and choreography is at its best and most well done yet, and while it is truly sad with what ends up happening, you're pretty invested in it and it brings it back together beautifully with the original trilogy. The Star Wars score, characters, fun, and universe overall do not let me down one bit in this film!"
393,9,"A delicate operation, neatly performed","It must be pretty hard to link up 6 or so hours worth of movies with another 8 hours or so filmed 20 or 30 years ago, even if you were planning to do it when you started out. I can't say it floored me but it was a workable effort. This entry focuses on Darth Vader's conversion to the dark side. Look, I know character development isn't Lucas' strong suit, but I still think they could have done better than Christensen (sorry), and he certainly isn't helped by the story line they give him. The transition from good guy to bad guy just didn't convince me. Plus there's a whole lot of jawing at the beginning of this that didn't seem necessary. But they do a nice job of tying things together, at the very end it's like stitch, stitch, stitch. In my mind episode 4 (the first movie) will always be the huge creative breakthrough, with episode 1 a somewhat remote second. This gets a 9 just based on the enormous scope of the effort."
394,10,It was worth waiting for...,"I must say, with all the hype surrounding this film, and considering how long I have been anticipating it's release, it would have been very easy to have been disappointed - but I wasn't disappointed at all. This film delivers the goods. This film moved me in a way the others had not (including the original trilogy). Although I thought it was a little slower in parts, it more than made up for this with some really amazing scenes."
395,4,A partial return to form for Lucas,"It looks great. It sounds great. It's actually got a story this time. It knits together the original and the new trilogy rather well. And yes, it's actually a pretty good movie. Nowhere near A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, but on par with Return of the Jedi."
396,10,one word..... AMAZING,"By far the best one. Fast paced and beautiful the whole way through. I feel so honored that I got to see it as one of the first across the country. There was so much action crossed with love. The action and settings of the movie really traces the slow decent into Darth Vador. If you haven't seen the first 2 or the last 3, you really should before you see this movie. It will all mean so much to you and make so much more sense. Don't worry if you feel lost at the beginning even as a fan, I was, but that's the intention. They really tied all together and ended with a beautiful shot that leads you right back to the originals. 10 outta 10, 5 stars, slam dunk...whatever you call it, it was fantastic. A must see for even those who aren't die hard Star Wars fans."
397,2,The force is not with this one,"Well, the movie is a miserable failure on so many levels it is nearly impossible to decide where to start. First off let me declare that Episode IV is one of my top 3 movies of all time. I am a huge fan and actually thought Episode II had many redeeming qualities. But this pile of crap is a different story. I saw it in a packed theater and in many scenes the audience was bursting out laughing at how poor the acting was and how cheesy the scenes were. Most notable the entire scene where Samuel L Jackson is slayed by the soon to be Darth Vadar. The entire scene is a laugh riot and me and my date burst into tears at how hilarious the scene played out. Can you say bad makeup and horrible acting day? Omg, isn't it funny how R2D2 can 'jump' out of his spaceships in this film but not in Episodes 4->6? It's funny how bad this film really is. I saw it with 2 other huge fans as well and we just left shaking our heads in disbelief. Lucas needs to issue out a serious apology to all the fans he let down. He should recommision Eps 1->3 to a new director to 'remake' them immediately. The only good thing about this film was the last 20 mins which sets up the masterpiece Ep 4. And that was just because it brought back such warm memories of the best one of all. Yoda is cool as well, but the rest of the cast is a joke. The writing pathetic as well. Do not even think about renting this pile either."
398,7,Certainly on par with the first and second episodes.,"Just watched this today and still getting over it. Although I wouldn't call it a tear jerker just yet, the movie does leave one rather numb. I am a bit disappointed with Lucas over the treatment of Keisha Castle Hughes. A lot of hoopla over her appearance of about 5 seconds. I would have hope for some speaking. The main problem with Ep III... it's extremely rushed towards the end. The pace is clearly off. Not something I would have expected from Lucas. Who's attention to detail has irritated some fans (not me) by messing around with eps 4,5, and 6. Why he rushed the hyped parts towards the end... I'll never know. That is, Padme's death, Darth Vader's retrofit, and the exile of Yoda and Obi Wan. The book did a far better job with this. I almost expect some sort of massive redo when it comes to DVD. The rest of the movie did fairly well, although the reliance on cgi fakery shows it's ugly head every time. Including Yoda again. Which would be why 1, 2 and 3 can't match the realism of 4, 5 and 6. I will have to say LOTR did a far better job at subtle CGI than any of the Star Wars. I hope for a good explanation on DVD."
399,10,Best Star Wars movie ever,The goat<br /><br />The 1st<br /><br />3 episodes are my favourite<br /><br />But the 3rd has the most bad ass battles and epic story of how He turned To the dark side
400,10,It was worth the wait!,"I waited for this movie for 3 years and decided to see it on the opening day- something I have never done for any movie. It was spectacular in its special effects and battle scenes, and fast and effective in its story telling. It makes quite an emotional impact toward the end when Anakin finally falls in the river of lava and has to be rebuilt into the masked Darth Vader. The acting was excellent. Hayden Christensen shows the conflicting emotions very effectively. Ewan McGregor made me cry at the end, and so did Natalie Portman. Ian McDiarmid is back as 'the emperor' and the dark Sith Lord Darth Sidious. He is scary and disgusting at the same time. It is easy to see that Anakin accepts him as his master and does not question him out of fear. Anakin/Darth Vader spirals into the dark lord very quickly by killing the innocents. We keep wishing that he would return to Obi-Wan and the Jedi but we already know what happened in the original trilogy."
401,2,"10% film, 90% reference manual","This final installment is less movie for a 2:20 run time than anyone might expect. For what I think is a fairly accurate commentary on the shortcomings of that 10% of the film that was really a bona fide attempt at a motion picture, see the review by neodante23. My problem is that 90% of the film was nothing more than a reference manual for franchise fans. We get to see visual elements of equipment that will eventually ""evolve"" into the X-wings, B-wings, and Tie-fighters, even the Emperial Walkers used on Endor. We learn that a certain famous Wookie was around to helping fight droids long before he became a smuggler's accomplice. But it's all done without much more motivation than the expansion of the franchise. By far too much attention was given to these sorts of details, and very little to the story, dialog and character development. We must draw conclusions for ourselves that Anakin would sacrifice everything to be with Padme, but he returned to action because preservation of the Republic was a close second (to who, him or Padme?) We really don't know what's stopping them from working out their priorities together. Rather than leaving the huge gap between AOTC and ROTS during which Anakin and Padme apparently established the deem NEED for each other that is supposed to motivate Anakin, this film could have very well omitted the explanation of why OB1 and Yoda can communicate as ghosts, or even dropped the flashy animation that is General Grevious when ATOC firmly established Duku's abilities as a dangerous leader of the separatists."
402,10,BEST EPISODE EVER!!,"This is an absolute dream of movie, we have the end and start of a new era, a whole new adventure and last but not least... VADER (my favorite character of all times), 10/10."
403,1,S**t Wars,How can anyone delude themselves into thinking this was a good movie. The much tooted special effects were not so special. The visuals looked so fake that you might have well been watching a cartoon. Did Ben Kenobi riding that lizard look realistic ? Was the the final light-sabre fight in anyway believable ? or was it just me that thought this film was a phony GCI nightmare. During the battle sequences could anyone see what was going on with out being sick or falling into a seizure.
404,7,Falling Fire,"Anakin Skywalker completes his path to the dark side as he finds only The Dark Side can save his wife Padme from certain death. It's not that I hate the prequels, it's that I hate the first two and much to my surprise, really enjoyed this one. Mainly because this is what we wanted to see, I'll grant you the orgins of Anakin could be interesting, but the problem with Lucas is that he tells too much instead of showing, and finally here he does the showing and delivers rousing entertainment, often unintentional,but it's fun nonetheless. Revenge Of The Sith isn't great, but It's very enjoyable, indeed had they had a better actor than Christensen, this could've been something special. As it is, I still enjoy watching this every now and then and still relish watching McDiarmid camp it up. It's all very soap opera esque pulp, but I still years later find this prequel compulsively rewatchable. Guilty pleasure, anyone?"
405,5,Lucas couldn't have been more off the mark.,"To be fair, it's not hard to see why George Lucas decided to make this movie the way he did. With episode 1 and 2 ending up as failures for their crumby story lines why wouldn't he just give up and fill every scene up with endless amounts of action and special effects. I guess he figured doing that might finally get everyone off his back; too bad"
406,5,B-Movie w/ $100m Special FX Budget,It's one thing to watch this for the cartoon it is; to turn it into some sort of major cultural event is just a sad reminder of how low the bar has gotten. I wasn't expecting 'Lawrence of Arabia' or anything but am I the only one who thought this was basically a b-movie with heavily branded characters? The writing and acting are terrible! I grew up on the original films as well but that doesn't mean I'm going to suck down this sort of pap just for the sake of being one with my former eight-year-old self.
407,10,The dark Sideof the fore is a pathway to many abilities some believe to be un natural,"Lucas has redeemed himself since the last 2 prequels. I wasn't disappointed with TPM or AOTC. Sure, TPM's character development was't the greatest, and Clones had some pretty bad dialogue, but they were both thrill rides. But neither can compare to the bold, brilliant, and totally kick ass thrill ride that was Revenge of the Sith."
408,9,"I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend.","They finally did it! The original trilogy finally presented a movie that is absolutely incredible. There is so much to talk about but I will try to keep this short. The special effects and CGI in this movie are perfect, almost as if you are actually there. Also I loved all the little one- liners such as ""You underestimate my power!""-Anakin and ""So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause,"" –Padme. From the beginning of the movie till the end you will see tons of amazing action, lightsaber duels, and space battles. Plus the fateful birth of Darth Vader, which Lucas handles masterfully, leaving me stupefied. I was left heartbroken during the final scene of brother vs. brother and rejoicing when Grevious hit the ground. There just isn't enough time for me to say how happy I am with this movie and to see it give the bridge to the original Trilogy. I especially love the consistency of awe the soundtrack provides, combining new and old. I give it a 9 out of 10. "
409,8,Crown Jewel of the Prequel Trilogy,"The final installment of the prequel trilogy is a perfectly balanced coming-together of modern sci-fi adventure and classic Shakespearean tragedy, able to switch its tone back and forth with little to no warning from some of the lightest to darkest moments in the saga. It's unapologetic is its melodrama, unforgiving in its calamity and woven into the saga so precisely and with such cyclical purpose as to rewrite history and have you believe that Sith was always there; before the original trilogy was even completed."
410,9,Just when we've all dismissed Lucas as a sell-out and a business-man... he reminds us what he stands for in the movie business.,by Dane Youssef
411,8,A good trilogy conclusion,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a pleasing ending to the prequels. The cast largely performs well, aided by thoughtful dialogue and a storyline written with increasingly building tension. Character development therefore delivers, particularly in the latter sequences when the twist is finally accomplished. The emotional depth is excellently portrayed throughout, between mindfully constructing various character relationships and sequences that present genuine conflicts, obviously adding together in reaching a severe boiling point. However, the shocking sequences that are delivered do not feel wholly developed and convincing. There simply is not enough background fleshed out in the right manner to fully suggest certain plot moments would happen the way the story executed them. In fact, what occurs is slightly contradictory to what is previously developed. Still, the plot is truly exciting and heartbreaking all the same. The score works well, particularly in the thrilling action sequences which also sport great visual effects. Throughout, the combat is mostly well done, and certainly gives depth to many jedi and/or sith abilities. There are issues with the final couple sequences logistically, but the conclusion is ultimately stunning on many fronts. Overall, this feature is very good and make the prequels worth watching."
412,10,It was an incredible ending to a incredible saga,"I was again one of the many in the country that got to preview it before it is relased today last night, and I do not think that I even blinked one time during the whole movie. It was just so incredible how they used raw emotion to tell a story of betrayal like that. I describe it as what Empire was like when it was made and released, lots of pathos in that movie also. I was just glad that this movie answered lots of questions that made everything else make sense. Like the ship that R2 and 3PO were on at the end, it is the same ship that they were on at the beginning of the original movie. I think that lots of people will notice that when they see it. I also see why Vader was wearing that outfit, being burned and all. It was just a wonderful way to put all of the pieces together at the end of the movie."
413,8,Star Wars Strikes Back,"George Lucas has finally decided to listen fan's complains and make a great work like this. I gave this movie a 10... maybe I'm still under impression but I can't find any minuses except poor acting in some parts of the movie and some cheesy dialog... But that are't real minuses because Star Wars movies are well known as movies with poor dialogs and acting... This movie won't get any Oscar any time soon but it's masterpiece if you like Star Wars... You have all those transformation from good to dark side, all those visual effects, space battles, ground battles, light saber duels... Palpatine is ingenious. He is the most brilliant carachter in whole movie... This movie is great! Thank you George"
414,,"A special effects demo by ILM, who seeks to be the Pixar of the blended live action/computer animation world.","After the previous two installments of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, discerning viewers know what to expect of Revenge of the Sith. A special effects demo by ILM, who seeks to be the Pixar of the blended live action/computer animation world. We know it's nothing more than a kids film, that the acting is uninspired, and that the absurdities will fly thick and fast."
415,3,Lost Chance,This is a film that grants Spy Kids a run for its money.
416,4,"Save your money, wait for cable.","Where do I begin? A complete let down, just like the other two. Although I do have to admit that of the three, this is the best one. However that really is not saying much. There was no need for the Wookiee's to scream the Tarzan yell. R2D2 getting a fight scene? Had George Lucas really run out of idea's that he had to give R2D2 a fight scene? And no star wars prequel would be complete with out the cheesy dialog. And for the CGI, well we all know how off and poorly done the last two movies were, the same applies here, and it especially shows when they are on the Lava Planet. You get pumped that they are finally bringing in the Wookiee's. Who just like Darth Maul, have a total of 10 minute screen time...if that. And how about in Epidsode 2 where George sets it up that Boba Fett was going to be the one to kill Mace, after he witnessed Mace beheading his father. And absolutely no Boba Fett! Never mind Boba Fett, how about the fact that there were no Mandalorian Soldiers in the movie at all?! I would like to know why there is an animated movie that you need to watch before Episode 3 so that you understand the General Grievous story? There was never an animated movie to connect Empire and Jedi. And Padme goes from telling Anakin that she is pregnant to practically full term in the next scene. Speaking of Padme, another scene that clearly shows that Mr. Lucas ran out of ideas, Padme died because she lost the will to live due to a broken heart. Give me a break! Fans did not wait over 30 years for this stupid lame excuse of a death scene as to why Luke and Leia's mother had died. Another example of the horrible script writing was the lack of thought put into the reason the Emperor now looks the way he does. Although I do have to give credit to the light saber and space battle scenes. At least you didn't blink and they were over, they actually almost held a candle to the originals. The only part of the movie that I enjoyed watching was the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader, which isn't until the last 45 minutes of the movie. I felt that this movie was a total let down, and I hope that George does not get the bright idea to do Epidsoes 7, 8, and 9. I want my money back!"
417,5,Hear that sound of a deflating balloon?,"I'm REALLY disappointed. Taken as a stand-alone film, it's enjoyable nonsense; taken as the crucial link between the prequels and the original three episodes, it's frankly First Grade essay level. The dialogue is poor, Christensen again fails to convince except right at the end, and (very impressive) CGI is used too much to cover up the shortcomings. I wanted so much to have my faith restored after Ep. 1 and 2, but even ROTJ is better than this, and to say that the one with Ewoks is better sums up how disappointing this is. How is it that Anakin can decide to give up his years of Jedi training and switch to the Sith within one scene? There should have been more time spent on showing his emotional problems - Darth Vader is after all THE MOST EVIL villain - and they actually could have left out the Wookies altogether. There is more than enough of Chewbacca in the original films. And how do the Jedi all die so easily if they can use the Force to fly around etc.? Actually why do the troops suddenly turn on the Jedi when these guys have been protecting the Republic for so long? Some positive words, since I gave the film 5 out of 10: Ewan McGregor is good, Natalie Portman does her best with what she's given, and the planets are beautifully rendered. C3P0 is a bit player, which reduces the ham factor a bit, and there's no Jar-Jar. Christopher Lee makes the most of his few minutes on screen, and Ian McDiarmid is excellent as Palpatine. What a shame that the overall result comes up short. Mr. Lucas - there's only one thing you can do to redeem yourself now. Re-shoot the battle scenes in TESB with the latest CGI and take out the (impossible) sound effects in the space scenes. Then re-release it; it's still the best of the 6 by miles (in no small part thanks to Harrison Ford), and an upgrade on the FX would make it simply stunning. DO NOT even think about making any new ones. Enough is enough. Actually it would have been better in retrospect to have just had the first 3, but too late now! Nerd point: I may be wrong but I'm sure I saw the Millennium Falcon landing in the distance in one of the early scenes."
418,6,The darkness of this one makes it the best of the prequel trilogy,"Finally, the film all Star Wars fans have been waiting for, and really the only one of the three prequels that's worth watching: Revenge of the Sith is a dream come true, offering spectacle and excitement that is far more akin to the original trilogy than the flabby, pointless prequels which followed it. This is the only story, with the only characters worth bothering with. The action-packed plot line involves the betrayal and death of the Jedi council in a surprisingly poignant overview, and of course there are tons of space battles and light saber fights to liven things up along the way."
419,9,My Favorite Star Wars film,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I have always been vocal about the prequels (while not being the best in dialogue and acting direction) being much better than some have said. Again, they have their problems, but Revenge of the Sith is by far one of the best Star Wars films in its overall story, action, and heart."
420,7,Unbalanced story with great ending,"This movie definitely has its moments, in fact some scenes in it are the best of what George Lucas has ever directed in his life. And some of the music edited in those scenes is best what John Williams has to offer."
421,8,Better then the others 8/10,"The final chapter in the sequel trilogy is probably the best ever, the feeling and amount of darkness in this film is great and sad, makes you wanna cry. What broke me the most was to see my favorite characters turn on the jedi during order 66. The movie has a lot of moments with exaggerated acting and iconic scenes that became ridiculous over the years. The actors did a wonderful job even with all the difficulties, they still act really well. Even with it's dificulties the movie is fine and has its good moments. And we get a good connection between the two trilogies, from the sequels to the originals."
422,5,"Like the rest of the new trilogy, Lucas needed to give it to someone else","As a Star Wars fan, I really wanted this to be good. It has its moments, but I still left the cinema feeling underwhelmed."
423,8,Best of the prequel trilogy,The prequel trilogy isn't the best loved of the Star Wars universe but it has its moments most of them being in this the third movie of the prequel trilogy.
424,8,Star wars episode 3 revenge of the sith,"Anakin joins forces with Obi-Wan and sets Palpatine free from the evil clutches of Count Doku. However, he falls prey to Palpatine and the Jedis' mind games and gives into temptation."
425,2,"Disappointed, I was!!","I loved the original three. The first two prequels were mediocre at best. This was the opportunity to bring it all together and create a strong and emotional bond with the audience. This movie just doesn't do it for me. Granted, I think part of the problem exists with the other two movies. The character of Anakin as a young man just doesn't flow with the man he becomes. There isn't enough thought put into his motivations as a character and the reasons that we are finally left with for his turn to the dark side aren't compelling enough. "
426,2,"Thin, thin, thin..... its a $3 rental at best. Wait for the DVD","Of Episodes 1,2, and 3, Ep3-RotS is clearly the weakest. The entire point of the film is to connect the dots from where things stood at the end of Episode 2 to where things go to Episode 4. We know there are certain points we have to pass through to get there, and Lucas makes sure the boxes are checked off. In fact, that is one of the weaknesses of latter part of the film as the dialog and story pretty much disappear entirely as the final sequence of events happen in rapid succession as we need to get to where Lucas wants it to be."
427,6,Best of the prequels,"The Clone War is coming to an end, or so the Jedi think. Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi rescue Chancellor Palpatine from the Droid General Greivous, in an outstanding space battle. After the mission, Padme tells Anakin that she is pregnant, which makes things a little complicated as they were supposed to keep their marriage a secret, but their Euphoria is cut short when Anakin has dreams of Padme dying in childbirth. Anakin's faith in the Jedi is wearing thin, from their insistence that Anakin must let go of his fears to their lack of faith in Chancellor Palpatine. Palpatine starts to drive a deep wedge between Anakin and the Jedi by making him his personal representative on the Jedi council and by trying to convince him the Jedi are trying to take control of the Republic. The Jedi are deeply suspicious of the Chancellor and therefore Anakin by default, because of their friendship. Then Palpatine drives the final nail in the coffin by promising Anakin that together they could prevent Padme's death through some mystical force mumbo jumbo."
428,8,"Too Much to Say, Too Little Time","There is no doubt that Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith is the best film of the new trilogy. In fact, it far outweighs both Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones (Clones) in many ways. However, even groundbreaking CGI could not permit the third installment of the Star Wars saga to reach the heights of the original trilogy, due, in part to some fundamental changes in narrative."
429,6,Succinct in Sixteen,Unbearably dry writing with poor acting delivery can't match the magic of the originals. CGI shines.
430,1,"Script worse than Godzilla, more cheese than in cheese factory","Truly, this movie should not have been made. I do not understand how George Lucas saw the final version of this and proceeded to release it. The script had so much cheesiness it was hard not to vomit while seeing it. Honestly, I have seen better scripts in the worst soap operas. I liked some of the original movies- they had this excuse of ""oh it's the 70s they didn't have better movies back then."" They were fresh. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. "
431,9,My Favorite of the Prequels,"At last! A movie that everyone can agree on. After years and years of bickering about Episodes 1 and 2, BOOM! Star Wars: Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. This movie is so kick-ass, it makes you forget about how much the others stunk, not to mention the complaining about the computer graphics."
432,10,Lord Vader RISE (May have spoilers),"Star Wars III is perhaps on of the best films in the Series. Why do I say this? Everyone knows Lucas himself said this film would be the Turning of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. A Jedi Knight into a Sith lord. The movie moves with a quick pace and it answers all the questions. How did the Jedi Die? How did Anakin become Darth Vader? Why does he wear that mask and Helmut and Armour? Lucas gives us all those answers and move crafting a incredible movie with a back story that leaves you saying yeah I know this but wow I didn't Know THIS!! Anakin Skywalker is worried about his wife's life pregnant with their first child Anakin is having troubling dreams foretelling her death. Meanwhile Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi are trying to end the Clone Wars. Skywalker and Kenobi are two of the most famous Jedi alive and their legends inspire people everywhere. They bring down Count Dooku and return Chanceller Palpatine home Anakin in talking to Palpatine unloads all of his feelings and fears and Palpatine sympathizes. Slowly bit by bit the chancellor is drawing Anakin into a web. Palpatine orders The Jedi Council to put Anakin on the Jedi council They relunctly comply but tell Anakin they will not grant him the title of Jedi Master.This drives a wedge between them and as palpatine draws them into a trap he gives them information that will lead the Jedi into traps. Anakin discovers the truth that palpatine is a sith lord and he is trying to tell Anakin he alone possesses great powers that can stop Padme from dying. Anakin goes to Mace Windu and tells him and as MAce Windu goes to arrest Palpatine a great battle ensues in which Palpatine drops all pretense and battles the Jedi master meanwhile he draws Anakin further in. Anakin helps kill Mace Windu and He is overcome with guilt but Palpatine soothes him and promises to make him the greatest Sith lord ever it is time for the Jedi to die. Anakin Skywalker bows down to Palpatine and rises as Lord Darth Vader. Then The order is given and Palpatine goes to the senate and tells them the Jedi tried to take over the senate they injuried him in order to protect the Senate he is creating the first galactic Empire and he will be the Emperor. all of this is fine great even but the moment has come that everyone has wanted to see. Obi Wan Kenobi VS Darth Vader. The climatic battle is everything we wanted it's fast and it gives us thrills as Vader and Obi Wan move closer to their destiny Vader eager for the kill Obi Wan not so much he much rather talk Vader back to the light side. then..Vader Lunges at Obi Wan as Obi Wan Hold the high ground and disarms him leaving him for the lava. It's a emotional moment as Obi Wan Cries out to him. ""You were the chosen one you were meant to bring the force into balance not leave it in darkness,You were supposed to destroy the sith not become one of them.You were my brother Anakin and I Loved you"" To which a Enraged Vader can only scream""I HATE YOU""! the film ends with Vader being placed in his armour and Obi Wan and Yoda helping padme deliver the twins Luke and Leia and they watch her die. The film ends with the twins placed in their new homes And With Obi-Wan helping watch over Luke. This may be the most emotional Star Wars film ever made and it certainly is one of the greatest."
433,8,Darkest of the Star Wars movies.,"This is the darkest of the Star Movies, where we get to see how Darth Vader came to be. Three years after the events of ""Episode II: Send in the Clones,"" Anakin Skywalker crosses over to the dark side after he falls into the deceit of the Sith Lord, making him an enemy of the Jedi."
434,7,"Not perfect, but much closer to the originals","As a long time fan of Star Wars, (but not a rabid fanatic) I have looked forward to this chapter, more than any other. From the moment Darth Vader set foot on the Rebel ship in Star Wars (I refuse to use the episode title) he captured my imagination. Hints given by Lucas in interviews added fuel, as did other media appearances. Now, I get to see how it all transpired. However, given the dramatic content of the previous two installments, I entered the theater with a healthy dose of skepticism. The final verdict: nearly there, but not perfect."
435,4,You can write this s***...,"So here, at last, it is, the missing piece in the 'Star Wars' jigsaw. And for anyone who's seen the preceding two parts, you'll know what to expect: visual overload, a semi-comprehensible plot, Ewan MacGregor delivering a passable impersonation of the late Alec Guinness, and ponderous dialogue that, as Harrison Ford said of the original movie, you can write but you sure as hell can't say. But that movie was actually quite good; instalment six, on the other hand, is (like its two immediate predecessors) a film made by someone who's forgotten how to make films. So much is wrong, not least the attempt to depict the story of the old Republic as a fight for ""democracy"", a term used without any understanding of what it means. While many have deplored the boring intrusion of political themes into the three 'Star Wars' prequels, the real problem with the politics is really that it is so badly done: we get episodic action scenes interspersed with summary information about the underlying power struggle, which seems to leap between states with little rationale and no force of dramatic development. For example, take the start of this movie, which presents us with the scenario of the kidnap of the galactic Chancellor by an alliance of his two leading enemies, but with no attempt to explains the purpose behind this feat, or the means by which it was achieved. The rest of the film continues in a similar vein: the Republic's eventual fall, around which all six movies pivot, unfolds almost risably."
436,1,More of the same...,"If you like the first two then watch it. You get more of the same beautiful effects, plot less story, painful editing and mindless Decalogue. If you are like me, a fan of the originals and not these, don't waste your time. unless you want to say, hey i gave it a chance. I did just that, gave it a chance. I thought well if this one is OK then whatever, at least one is good. NO! Why oh why. I knew it would be more of the same and yet i went ahead and watched. I know why too, i love star wars, i love the universe, i love the space opera theatrics wrapped in a simple fairy tale like story. I gotta wonder what happened to all that? What happened to a little subtlety (sorry if i spelled that wrong) in story telling? What happened to telling a competent story altogether? Oh George...i dunno what to say."
437,8,same old Lucas,"This film is the embodiment of the best and worst of George Lucas. It has an amazing storyline and wonderfully constructed plot, but the screenplay and direction is lacking. Not nearly enough development of Anakin's character is shown for the biggest turn in the entire series, and the scene in which he kills younglings is just completely unnecessary. They could've shown him killing other Jedi in the temple or something, but come on, that's a little dark for a movie you wanna bring your kids to. Plz don't imply the main character kills children in a children's movie. Now, those frustrating moments in the script still can't take away from the quality of the story and the fact this is obviously a good film."
438,10,Star Wars a movie that projection room grants.,Star Wars is with 'Natalie Portman' who is a young Jedi. The sweet nature lacks initial strictness but the epic wondrous movie is the picture that here is at our recommendation. Recommending a film is viewing it accepting the terms placed by us on it like age verification because an adult movie is watched by adults and the younger children do not care. <br /><br />Being at heart young and caring for both of us like at a function for keeping us happy and satisfied by outside influences that cannot be tolerated. Films like Star Wars: Episode three which having viewed but for the self makes us content and 'heads up' is enough.
439,,My favorite out of the prequels,"Full of tragedy, lost hope, and more this movie was spectuclar. This episode actually had writing that was actually very good and above average for once and was pretty consistent. CGI was very impressive considering the time it came out in. The acting I also was impressed with and the sound composition which was well done also. The cheography was good the body movements had some problems though."
440,5,"great effects, awful acting, atrocious script","Eagerly awaited and an infinite improvement on entries 1 and 2 in the series, Revenge of the Sith is fatally flawed by mediocre acting, due I suspect to an over-reliance on special effects, poor casting, and a dreadful screenplay. Ewan McGregor is like a crude caricature of the stiff-upper-lipped Englishman. His efforts to sound like his great predecessors of the English school left me numb with disbelief (competing with boredom). The feeble efforts of Natalie Portman and the overparted Hayden Christensen brought memories of school plays rushing back into my memory: how could such a pricey film end up with such risible, pure-high-school acting? But then Star Wars isn't about dialogue or drama, is it? It's about cowboys and indians in space, and we got plenty of that. But almost three hours of bad acting, set into sharp relief by superb performances from Samuel L Jackson and Ian McDiarmid, cannot be compensated for by the sumptuous images and richly drawn 'aliens'. All in all, I'll settle for acting and drama any time."
441,2,Ummm... did I miss something? (Mild spoilers included),"Blinding action? Relentless pace? Over-the-top crap to me. Whatever happened to the simple moments, the light-hearted breaks, the banter? Putting it into the over-done, over-long opening alone doesn't cut it. And how is it possible that TEAMS of filmmakers working on the layer-on-layer-on-multiple-layer of FX in every frick'n scene could stand to watch those pathetically bad dialogue passages without one of them saying ""um, George -- this stuff is crap"". ""Love me like you did on Naboo...""? Vader going ""NOOOOOOooooo!""? Crap, all of it. Holy cow, I'm at a loss here to see how anyone can call this a good film. What's presented is non-stop battle, which folks can argue was the point of the episode, but where within Ep.III was the exciting chase/race scene, the tension of ""will the hyper-drive work"", the visual break the eye needs where a solo villain character marches slowly, menacingly toward its prey with nothing whizzing around it? Every scene is deliberately set in front of a large window or moving landscape solely for the purpose of allowing more effects to whiz by -- well enough is enough!! Sometimes movies just need to focus on characters for a few minutes, you know -- have them set in front of a static wall or something so you look at them... and in this one all we get of that is a few moments with Anakin/Padme mouthing awful love lines to each other (AWFUL!) and then the Jedi Council deliberating about Anakin -- yet again with all of Coruscant's traffic buzzing outside the window. Dammit George -- all that visual clutter just ruins things... and it makes me sleepy watching it all. Sleepy ain't supposed to happen in an action movie, but by the time the end was finally approaching I was zoned out and wishing it all to be over. Disappointing, disappointing, disappointing... ...and don't even get me started about the weaknesses in how it links to Ep.IV (an 18-20 year build time for the Death Star that began construction with no political rebels established yet not a single eventual rebel EVER knew of it's development in 18-20 years? That was what I call a weak, WEAK (a.k.a. ""crap"") way of linking forward -- 15 seconds of silent shot?! -- where was the creativity??"
442,7,A great movie experience but....,"Star Wars Episode 3 is certainly well worth the money spent on the tickets. The special effects were out of this world! During the opening scene of the fight in space, a fighter was blown to bits and you can actually SEE the pilot being thrown into orbit together with the rest of the debris. If that effect does not meet expectations, I don't quite know how else anyone can make it better. The light saber duels were excellent. However, the Obiwan-Grievious fight scene was a huge disappointment. I mean, how can someone (or something) known as the ruthless killer of other Jedi warriors, and wielding FOUR light sabers, be so incompetent to lose 2 arms in a space of seconds?Unfortunately, I have to admit that what brought this movie down a few points was the hurried pace during that all important scene where Anakin became Darth Vader. The scene was perfect to extract the maximum dramatic emotion from the audience, but it felt as if Lucas was running out of film and needed to finish the shoot in double quick time. All in all, Episode 3 is the best of the prequels but some way short of the spirit of the original."
443,3,"Poor, really poor...","What a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. There are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. I won't complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. Utterly disappointing."
444,5,"Toys, Toys, and the Dark Side","On a Planet far away there appeared a young man who created a fantastic science fiction movie which ignited the imagination of millions and he entitled it STAR WARS. Viewing the original sparked the most fanciful dreams. The original was a classic, however as many expected, the sequels, and there have been a few, have all fallen short of the mark. The latest installment is Star Wars III, the Revenge of the Sith. The movie begins with a cavalcade of space craft engaged in deadly combat. A few scenes even forget that there is no air in outer space. Someone should tell the director. Once into the heart of the movie, the most obvious, in your face, aspect of this film are the guns, gadgets and college of characters. Missing prominently however is cohesion. It seems Mr. Lucus has taken his original idea board and created a puzzle. But viewing this latest segment, one get's the impression the pieces of his puzzle are being created as he goes along. Each piece is crafted, forged and forced to fit into place. What we see, has been promised and this is it, weather you like it or not. Nevermind that it does not resemble the picture on the box. ***"
445,1,"Lucas finishes the series of ""star wars"". And he totally fails.","When i went to the cinema, i expected to watch the greatest part of star wars, because it is about the transformation of Anakin Skywalker, who will be ""Darth Vader"" (everybody knows that...) (I add, that i am only a fan of the old 3 s.w. movies). But what i saw was a very dumb and boring movie. According to me, it is the worst ""chapter"" of StarWars. The only thing, in which George Lucas succeeded, are the special effects, e.g. the ears of ""master Yoda"". But that's not enough!... Even the battles between the ""Sith"" and the good, are very boring and ridiculous. Then, the ""Jedis"" aren't ""Jedis"" anymore. Now (when you compare them with the ""Jedis"" of Episode 4to6), they aren't anymore the cool warriors who always stand alone and who always respect the ""Jedi""-rules, doesn't matter what happens. Now, they fight together with other ""Jedis""(even Alien-""Jedis"" exist) in Arenas (in ep.2, too) and will spit on the ""Jedi""-rules, if it is useful. That's why I think, that in some parts, George Lucas didn't understand his first three movies. ""StarWars"" lost a great part of his style, which is noticeably shown in the first 3 movies. I can't forgive him this stupid change. "
446,10,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the darkest, bleakest, coldest, painful, saddest, wonderful, and greatest film of all time in My opinion!","On June 1st, 2005 I saw the greatest and most darkest film of all time, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith! It was everything I thought it would be and a whole heck of a lot more! It was such a cool experience to finally see this film! I just couldn't believe what I saw! How great, dark, and, exciting this film is! The film is packed with not only superb action but great acting as well! I am a huge Star Wars fan and I love the prequel trilogy and in My opinion Episode III is the best of them all. The directing is just great by George Lucas! The musical score by John Williams just excellent! This is arguably his best score in the Star Wars saga and possibly his career! Below I will give My opinions on the actors and characters, scenes, and more! Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi: He really great here. McGregor shines very bright in this one. He shows a lot emotion. Natalie Portman as Padmé: Portman is just excellent here. She cries and is very upset at things and shows it well.This is arguably her greatest performance. Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker: He was the perfect choice to Anikan Skywalker. I just love the way he looks, the looks he gets on his face, and his eyes!Its unbelievable just how awesome he is when hes mad! He is a very, very convincing Darth Vader.Great chemistry with Portman! Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine: Arguably the best performance in the film,McDiarmid shows his great acting. I absolutely loved it when he was teaching Anakin. the looks he got on his was pure evil. I also loved it when he was face to face with Jedi Mace Windu. He was also great against master Yoda. Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu: Once again Jackson shines as the Jedi master Mace Windu. He shows great talent when he and his fellow Jedi comrades confront the Chancellor and when he has him cornered. Jimmy Smits as Senator Bail Organa: Very good performance by Smits. This time he has much more screen time. Frank Oz as Yoda (voice): Just as great as usual. Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: Just as great as usual. Christopher Lee as Count Dooku: Another excellent performance by Christopher Lee. Wise words comes from him once again as a Sith lord. Even though his character dies in th film at the hands of Skywalker, he shows great trouble when his hurt. Jay Laga'aia as Captain Typho: Another good but brief performance by Jay. Bruce Spence as Tion Medon: I was very surprised by his performance. His voice and accent has totally changed for this brief role. Temuera Morrison as Commander Cody: Morrison just not plays Cody but also a handful of other Clone Troopers and he plays them very good. Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: He was good in a brief performance. Michael Kingma as Wookie Tarfful: He was also good in a brief performance. Jett Lucas as Zett Jukassa: Very good especially for a youngster! Kenny Baker as R2-D2: Just as good as usual. Amy Allen as Aayla Secura: Amy Allen was good as My favorite female Jedi. I got sad when she got killed by the Clones. Matthew Wood as General Grievous: Wood's voice is something else for this new major and powerful character. The CGI of the alien cybernetic cyborg was very neat and cool. James Earl Jones as Darth Vader (Voice): He's just great once again! Ship Battle: An incredible space battle! Just as great as the fight in ROTJ! Anakin and Obi-Wan vs. Count Dooku: This rematch was really something! Dooku was great against them! Anakin vs. Count Dooku: After the Count took care of Obi-Wan he fought Anakin one on one. It was really painful to see Dooku lose against Skywalker. This was a great light saber fight however. Obi-Wan vs. General Greivous: This fight was really something. It was Grievous and his wheel bike and against Kenobi and the Boga. Then it was cyborg to man. The General's arms split to four limbs and Ob-Wan had a hard to beating him. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine vs Saesee Tiin, Agen Kolar, Kit Fisto, and Mace Windu: The fight was so unreal. Palpatine took out Tiin and Kolar like they were day dreaming but they weren't. Fisto didn't have a chance either. Windu proved how great he is with a saber by getting the Chancellor cornered. The huge window broke because they both used the force at the same time and when this happened how the light were and how the wind was blowing it reminded of the Battle of Vader against Luke in ESB! Great scene! Anakin vs. Mace Windu: After Windu defeated Palpatine Skywalker fights mace and gets him off guard. Yoda vs. Emperor Palpatine: This here was one of the long awaited fight. It was a great one and very memorable. Anakin vs. Obi-Wan Kenobi: This is the fight that the galaxy has waited for so long. Its a very long duel and you will see how Anakin becomes Dartn Vader in the black suit! Clone Troopers vs. Jedi Knights: This was really a sad, sad scene. It was very pitiful seeing Ki-Adi-Mundi, Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, and Stass Allie betrayed. Battle on Kashyyk: Great battle! Battle on Utaupau: Great battle! Battle on Mustafar: Excellent battle! Anakin vs. the Younglings, Jedis, and Sepertists: Amazing! Simply amazing! "
447,5,Sadistic Jedi,"OK kids, this movie is ""OK"". Way better than the other 2 previous disgraces, not as good as Empire Strikes Back, and brushing against the simple-fun-minded buy-my-toys plan that Mr. Lucas always seem to have in mind. Dark? Not at all. Lucas seems to be almost ashamed of making an allusion to the evil deeds of Vader against kids. But what bothers me is the sadistic way in which the so-called good guy of the movie leaves the bad guy suffering a horrible death with limbs amputated and more burned than my first attempt at a BBQ! The Vader guy is laying there, screaming in pain (ok, he was screaming that he hated the other guy, but that's hardly a reason to leave the roasted guy in such torment), clinging for dear life over a river of lava, and what does Obi-Wan does? He just turns his back and leaves the party (yeah, he seem sad and angry at losing his buddy privileges, I concede that). Why didn't he finished him off! Was is too much to ask to take his ""ex-apprentice"" out of his misery with his light saber? Couldn't he suspect that maybe the poor guy was suffering needlessly? I already complaint before about the Jedi's being not-so-good sports by attacking 2 against 1 that poor Darth Maul on the first one, but I think that the sadism shown in this movie by one of the only Jedi's left alive is worse. No wonder Darth Vader turned out to be such a grumpy breather! OK... this movie deserves 2 stars because I only fell asleep once. Go Sith, Go!"
448,9,Redemption.,"Hayden Christensen surpasses my early predictions surrounding the caliber of his expected performance. His performance wasn't the ""stuff of legends,"" but, and face it, folks, that's exactly what it will become; however inferior. He DID; however, deliver JUST ENOUGH to pull this off."
449,8,A fitting and redemptive end (for George Lucas) to the prequel trilogy,"After Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, I wasn't sure that there was going to be much redemption for George Lucas. But I was wrong. Revenge of the Sith is the darkest Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. It ties all the loose ends neatly together from the previous two prequels, and it delivers us the final moments of Anakin Skywalker before he became Darth Vader. I could complain about the cheesy dialogue and the overdone special effects, but those are minor compared to what I felt in the theater. George Lucas, I forgive you for the first two prequels. You've really made me love Star Wars again. There's action galore, and I wasn't bored in the slightest. I won't say Revenge of the Sith is perfect, and there were parts that could have been handled better, but other than that, it was a good, if not excellent film that I could probably watch several more times. And the DVD wasn't bad either. It had all the best things about Star Wars. Revenge of the Sith is now my favorite film of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Third time is definitely the charm!"
450,5,"""Dark movie"" is not equal to ""Good movie""","So ends the disappointing ""Prequel Trilogy"" of Star Wars. The first movie was lamely disappointing, the second was just lame, and then we got the third one, the first Star Wars rated PG-13: there goes the excuse of ""these movies are for children"". But this movie was acclaimed by many fans, who said ""the first two were awful, but this one is good!"", ""Lucas had two strikes, now he made a Homerun"", etc. I only have one explanation for comments such as these: ""Low-expectation syndrome"". After being exposed as a mediocre director and writer for his last movies, in the Revenge of the Sith, no one were expecting cinematic gold from Lucas anymore (except die hard fan-boys). So, a mediocre film with writing as sloppy as common with Lucas during the last ten years, but with some ""dark twists"" (spoilers!), such as killing children (oops, younglings, sorry), killing Samuel L. Jackson, and a guy horribly burned and mutilated by his ""best friend"", was a bit refreshing after all the ""kid-friendly"" stuff of the previous movies. I was impressed the first time I saw the movie, but it got old really fast."
451,8,If you're too critical you'll miss the point,"Bad dialogue, yes. Cheesy romance, yes. Improvement over the last two, definitely."
452,,"So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.","As someone who was growing up at the time of the prequel, this film was my childhood favourite and will always be adored and have a special place in my heart. The prequels were the first star wars films I watched and this specific movie began my love for star wars."
453,9,Proof Lucas Still Has It!!!!,"After seeing Episodes I and II, I was beginning to wonder what had happened to Star Wars. Would the prequel ever live up to the quality of the original trilogy? "
454,1,It's awful,I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Mostly because of Hayden Christensen and some of the worst dialogue in movie history.
455,1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"I know that this is the greatest origin story for a movie villain, the man we know as Darth Vader. But George Lucas got a little carried away thinking that this an epic scale film..Yes it is...Buts its still lame...boring and dull...The origin story should have been more exciting much more darker and the occasional comedy makes it worse.."
456,3,Too bad Lucas didn't seem to care about telling the story,"Star Wars has always been good because it is a story of mythological proportions, filled with potential for analogy and interpretation. The last two of Lucas's films have severely disappointed most audiences in this regard, pandering to children with unnecessary silliness while attempting to capture teenage and older audiences with technical mastery -- forgetting that it was the story as much as the special effects that gave the trilogy its magic. The Revenge of the Sith, while having some of the best potential of the three in terms of plot, with loads of political scheming and important characters pitted against each other and undergoing personal transformation, fails to pay attention to the story itself. Lucas neglects storytelling in order to play with on-screen digital wizardry. The effect is often dazzling, but dazzling like a psychedelic light show: fabulous moving shapes and flashes, but with no meaning. The characters are reduced to hollow husks, such that the blurring between human and machine that has always been at the heart of Star Wars symbolism matters little to us, characters are cartoon images of themselves and they dissolve like the 1 and 0s they are made up of when they are killed off. Lucas is so eager to show us the myriad worlds he has conjured up that he doesn't really give us a chance to see them, their names come and go so quickly that they fade from memory and blur into one another. While Tattouine and Endor were sources of inspiration for my childhood imagination, I have trouble believing that any but the Lava planet (whatever it was called) will stick with this generation. And the efficacy of that planet partly stemmed from its reminiscence of Mordor. Ultimately, this is why the Lord of the Rings so easily dominated what should have been an equally legendary set of films, because those films used special effects to aid the telling of a story. Lucas gave his computer toys precedence and produced something that is sadly kind of boring."
457,3,Star Wars 3,The problems of Episode 2 return. The continuing story of the creation and transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader and yet the performances don't deliver on any of the promises of epic stories and grand adventure. Everything feels off and odd and manufactured.
458,8,Anti-climactic,"Visually stunning and yet I found myself yawning here and there after twenty minutes. Basically, this is exposition, showing us the origins of the Empire, the development of the main characters and their relationships with each other. But, finally, at the end of this episode, we know the great struggle between the two sides of the Force has just begun. The first Star Wars movies, made when Lucas and the rest of the world was thirty years younger and that much more innocent, had an exuberance I found lacking in this final installment of the prequel. Episode Three reflects the grimmer world we live in after 9/11 with its increased degree of cares and concerns. It must be said, however, that the completion of these six episodes of the saga is a magnificent achievement and insures that the name of George Lucas will live forever in cinematic lore."
459,8,"Should be 10/10, but so many issues",POSITIVES:
460,2,I cannot believe I paid $8.00 to see this!,"I am at a disadvantage here as I have only seen this film once, and that was enough. I do not think I could sit through another showing of this galactic mello-drams without first being administered a couple of cc's of morphine or some other pain relieving drug!!! Quite frankly, I even nodded off a couple of times during this film from sheer boredom. I have to admit, I am more of a Star Trek fan than that of Srar Wars, although I enjoyed the original Star Wars films much more than the later three."
461,8,The best of the prequel trilogy by far!,"This film is a fitting ending to a disappointing trilogy of films, this film shows the best that the prequels had to offer whether that be in its story, acting or the action in the film. Saying that this films still does have some of the problems that over two films previous have as well. "
462,7,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) ***,(Possible Spoilers)
463,7,Star Wars Episode 3 Much Better With Some Flaws,"Star Wars Episode 3 is the best of the prequel trilogy from writer/director George Lucas who has somewhat redeemed himself from the so-so previous films that came before this one. Lucas brings his two trilogies to a sad yet satisfying conclusion that reveals more unanswered questions and the ending helps bridge the events in this film to the ones that will happen in A New Hope. Ewan McGregor is much better this time around as Obi-Wan Kenobi and luckily has more to do. McGregor had an uncanny resemble to the older character played by Alec Guiness which made him that much more believable. Natalie Portman does what she can as Padme Amadala who is trying to keep her marriage to Anakin a secret. Her character also discovers she's pregnant with Anakin's child(ren)(Hint ""spolder"" Luke and Lea). Portman gets less screen time than she did in the previous and less to do making her character feel like a supporting player who shows up here and there. Portman still does a decent job with her limited screen time. Hayden Christian reprises his part as Anakin Skywalker and he like McGregor seem much more comfortable in their roles this time. He also seemed more of a lead than Portman considering he gets more screen time since the movie does mainly focus on him and McGregor. Christensen's character goes through a major transformation in this one and he is convincing in the role. For those of you who have seen it I don't think I have to tell you who he eventually transforms into but I'll say it anyway. Christensen's Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader and his characters signature costume complete with that strange breathing sound are shown briefly revealing why he has to wear that suit. Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious is an effective villain who gets more to do including two light saber duels one of them is against Master Yoda near the end. Samuel L Jackson is back too as Jedi Knight Mace Windu but unfortunately his character's role is cut rather short. Jackson is good in his small role none the less. The same can go for Christopher Lee who also returns as Count Dooku from Episode 2 but his part like Jackson's is very small and he's written out of the movie quickly. The rest of the supporting cast including Yoda, C3PO, R2-D2, and brief appearance by Chewbacca are adequate in their small parts but don't get much to and none of them really leave an impression. Jar Jar Binks luckily makes a non-speaking brief blink and you missed it appearance before the conclusion. The special effects are amazing and the action/fight sequences are equally impressive. The ones standing out being the space battle that opens the film and the final climactic light saber duel between Ob-Wan and Anakin/Vader a very impressive fight sequence that was a bit long but very well executed none the less. The pacing was slow in between the action again at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally either like the other ones but fortunately the good outweighs the bad. Lucas ends this film in a good way which could've been a little better but it was still a big improvement over the previous ones. Overall this film is much better than some of the other third movies in a trilogy that were disappointments like Spider-man 3, X-Men The Last Stand, and Pirates 3 to name a few. Despite it's few flaws Star Wars Episode 3 is still an entertaining sci-fi adventure with enough intense action, solid performances, and a fitting finale that makes this third film enjoyable to watch."
464,8,the dark ending we were all craving,I first realised that this would be a fitting end to the story when Anakin and Palpatine had their discussion in the Opera house. The way in which Palpatine was able to mold and cajole Anakin to his way of thinking was a masterful and sublime piece of film making. The undulating tone of the score just helped reflect the confusion and chaos in Anakin's mind.
465,7,The best prequel is still light years behind the originals.,"The best of the new Star Wars prequels is still light years away from the quality of the original movies. It's easier to examine the good things so i'll begin by saying Ian McDiarmid is superb as Emperor Palpatine. His character has real purpose and its something the prequels had lacked up until now. The general feeling still exists that is that big set pieces get in the way of telling a very important story. Before this film, audiences have had to endure Podraces, Jar Jar, droid factories, flying R2's and CG overload. What they really needed from this film,and this is something the original trilogy had in spades,was storytelling but instead we get a whole subplot where Obi Wan is chasing after some CGI robot with four lightsabres while riding some annoying sounding CGI animal and you just want to yell STOP!!!!! The developments between Anakin and Palpatine are interesting though, and McDiarmid recalls the same hammy brilliance seen in Return Of The Jedi. Hayden Christensen is still out of his depth as Anakin however and lacks the dramatic skill to really convey true menace. Another deeply disappointing moment comes when a suited and booted Vader is finally allowed to speak for the first time. There is a moment so embarrassing, it almost devalues the character forever. Nooooooooooooooooooo, he wails in the most unintentionally funny moment of the movie. So do we."
466,,Decent wrap up to the saga,"Caught up with SITH at the famous Cinerama Dome in Hollywood (where the fans SHOULD have been lining up instead of the Chinese where it ISN'T playing!). Can't say I can add much to what has been said already. Basically, I would agree that it's a generally satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and a marked step up from the previous two turgid entries. The final reel or so really takes flight and wraps things up nicely."
467,1,The Star Wars Holiday Special Comes to the Big Screen!,"Well, so Luke: This whiny dork is your father? Now I understand why Luke Skywalker screams ""No! No! That's impossible!"" so dramatically in 'The Empire Strikes Back'. I'd jump into a chasm too, if I knew my dad was this adolescent, miscast, Scott Stapp-lookin' wimp. (Casting Hugh Jackman or Alan Rickman would have made a lot more sense!) Whew! Well, George, thanks. It's been fun. Go write for Sesame Street now."
468,5,more of the same,"I don't understand why this film is getting much better reviews than the first two. It's about the same. The acting is dreadful. The writing is worse. Anakin's turn to the dark side is utterly unconvincing. ""He's unarmed"", and ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" tie for most-cringe-inducing lines. The story has all the right plot elements, but Lucas seems unable to tell it. Halve the time spent on CGI and double the time spent on Anakin's internal struggle and you might have the beginnings of a watchable movie."
469,9,Old school Star Wars,"George Lucas went back to the well for this one. And it worked. The opening scene of ROTS is reminiscent of one of the closing scenes from Return of the Jedi. A massive space rumble between the good guys and the bad guys is taking place, and who should be sitting in a chair, watching it out a window, than Chancellor Palpatine. But this time, instead of dropping Palpatine down a shaft, Anakin Skywalker saves Palpatine's life. The action scenes are pretty much non-stop throughout the film. The only slowdown comes when George Lucas tries to write dialogue between Padmé and Anakin. The last time Lucas made a film that wasn't a major action flick was American Graffiti, and that was more than thirty years ago. In the interim, he seems to have forgotten how to write inter-personal dialogue. He should've hired somebody else to write those parts of the script. Aside from that, though... from the opening battle to the fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin that culminates with Anakin's transition to Darth Vader, it far outstrips Episodes I & II for old school Star Wars action. Of course, I would be remiss if I did not mention one final thing. In all of the other movies, Palpatine has always been a very static character. However, in ROTS, Palpatine turns into one of the most dynamic characters in the film, and if I may be so bold, Ian McDiarmid turns in what could be an Oscar-nominated performance in turning Palpatine into one of the greatest bastards of film of all time. If you haven't already seen it, rent or buy it on DVD and see it now. If you've seen it - see it again. You'll enjoy it greatly."
470,9,fantastic epic with the most satisfying end!,"I had the chance to visit a early screening in my hometown Zürich (switzerland) of ROTS and I was very nervous and hopeful because I wasn't very excited about the previous episodes (I &II, specially I). but then, what a joy when I left the theater after the screening. It was Lucas at his best! great actions, well defined characters, very well acted, terrifying moments (watch out the younger of you...), excellent effects, superb landscapes, fine storyline, great villains, and last but not least a very, very satisfying end (you immediately want to go home and watch A NEW HOPE instantly on your DVD). this final episode of this trilogy makes you forgot the misses of the last two ones. and - more important - it bonds very well with the second trilogy, physically AND (and thats the great achievement of LUCAS) emotionally!!! so then, why did I give just a 9 out of 10? because after the movie you realize it's the last one! no more star wars movie ever (for sure not from Lucas so far) - the saga is complete...and that left you with a sad feeling! and for that Mr. Lucas I minus one star! hey, what am I gonna hope for in the future now?!?!"
471,8,"Great film, with disappointments","We start off with your typical STAR WARS, but go down to a non-typical fight. TIE fighters everywhere, beautiful special effects, but from the ongoing camera movements and the bright colors on the screen, it got a little disorienting. The reason for this? Well the clone war is ending and a new villain has entered the series known as General Grevious, half alien half machine with four arms, who from what I've read all over the internet was suppose to be a Jedi killing mother, which brings me to disappointment number one. "
472,9,Episode 3,Star Wars The Revenge of the Sith. Another great film in the Star Wars series and a highlight in the Prequel Trilogy showing the end of the War and the rise of the Empire in this epic prequel trilogy conclusion.
473,9,Prequels finished and set up nicely for the rest,"At any point in your life if you watched and became a Star Wars fan you wanted to know how it all began. where did the Death Star come from, When did Vader become Lord and how did the Emperor come to exist. From the Phantom Menace, thru a grueling teen Anakin in Attack of the Clones we get definitive answers from George Lucas in Revenge of the Sith."
474,7,So it's complete.,"You may have heard how ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" ends, so I'll just talk about a few aspects. The line ""Either you're with me or you're my enemy"" sounds a lot like ""Either you're with us or you're with the terrorists"" (although George Lucas wrote the script before September 11). But I would have said a long time ago that George W. Bush is basically the same as Darth Vader."
475,6,Surely the best of the new trilogy...,"Revenge of the Sith is a very good closing part of the Star Wars saga.After seeing it for the fourth time I can really appreciate the film in every way.It has all the elements of a good sci-fi movie and then some.Starting of with a complex and exciting first shot the story then takes off in a great first half hour,just like the great openings in The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi.After that the movie seems to go all wrong (although we can see a glimpse of the Millennium Falcon at the arrival on Coruscant) with a pretty dull and horrendous acting part that is luckily saved by a brilliant Ian McDiarmid.Hayden Christensen shows once again that he's a bad actor and good actors like Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson get no chance to show their talents.But let us not forget that Star Wars is a serial based on it's effects and wondrous worlds.And with that RotS succeeds.State of the art SFX and great planets and creatures are made standard in this flick."
476,7,Very Entertaining End to the Trilogy,"Revenge of the Sith's flaws stem from the previous 2 movies of its trilogy, combined with the Clone Wars show however, this film has a perfect setup and is much better. With occasional bad dialogue and some action scenes that drag on a bit, this movie is still very sad and has some of the best moments of Star Wars ever put to screen. Revenge of the Sith is always going to be looked at as the gem in the pile of broken glass known as the prequel trilogy."
477,10,I'm still speechless!!!!!! Must see it again!!!,I seen the movie yesterday night thanks to my local theater having a Midnight showing!
478,10,Most underrated Star Wars film to date,"Hands down my favourite Star Wars episode and it does not get the credit it deserves! Unfortunately ROTS is held back by the two other mediocre films it shares a trilogy with. The most lightsaber duels, action from the very first scene, dark ending and masterpiece of a performance from Ian McDiarmid."
479,10,"Inform the troops, Lord Vader has arrived","I saw it yesterday with my Dad. it's like a tradition since 1983 when, as an 8year old, i saw Return of the Jedi with him in the movie theaters."
480,2,Not nearly as good as we hoped,"I feel that the critic's reviews of this movie are in error. Let's face it; this is not a good movie. As much as people want to believe it's good it still falters when it comes to the core criteria of what makes an engaging film. Revenge of the Sith suffers from bad lines of dialog, un-suspenseful action, poorly directed actors, bad sense of timing, and horrible story boarding."
481,9,Story regains the the dynamics of Episode IV!!!,"The first thing I want to say is that the dialogue in this movie is exceptional. The opening scenes especially feel really dynamic and casual, serious without being pretentious. I'm really regretting the fact that this is the climactic appearances for Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen, because I get the impression they've finally found the right fit for their characters."
482,3,Absolutely Horrendous,"What in the world has happened to George Lucas? Once a man with near mythical status, a sci-fi god, if you will, has reduced himself to the hackiest of working filmmakers. The new Star Wars Trilogy fails on so many levels it would be impossible to address them all in so limited a space. The script is horrible. There is virtually no engaging element to this film. While populated with decent to great actors, the film makes little use of them, forcing such fine performers as Ewan McGregor to spit out some of the most ridiculous lines ever uttered on screen. The romantic scenes between Christensen and Portman are vomit-inducing, and this proves once and for all that, as he has said himself, Lucas is a terrible writer. As I mentioned, the characters are totally one-dimensional. What could have been an epic tale of evils temporary triumph over good has been turned into a sci-fi farce, so unbelievable droll it made me want to leave the theater. Though Lucas should be held accountable for the vast majority of this abysmal failure, Hayden Christensen absolutely butchers what was formerly one of the greatest and most intimidating characters in film history. His Anakin Skywalker is pathetic, at best. He is a whiny, pouting scrub, whose acting is so wooden, so fake, I found it difficult to believe that he is, in fact, a professional actor. I have several friends, amateur performers, who have displayed far better acting ability on the high school stage. Fortunately for him, he's not alone. Christopher Lee, typically a fine actor, has been reduced to a caricature. Natalie Portman, a very talented actress, is almost as expressionless as the digital sets through which she walks. Sam Jackson is a shadow of himself, as Mace Windu's expressions actually made me laugh out loud. The set pieces are almost all digital which irreparably damages the film as a whole. They have no texture, no sense of realism, and most of all, no character. Part of what made the original films so great is the undeniable character that the locations and props had. Everything was real, well-used and seemed like it belonged to an actual fantasy world. Here, everything has a polished sheen that makes for a totally unbelievable environment. I could go on for days about what makes this film a failure. I really could. However, I don't want to. Just writing this much has depressed me. This story that Lucas was attempting to tell over the course of this new trilogy could have been amazing. Darth Vader's rise to infamy? The formation of the Empire and the few who stood up to it? This could have been a coming-of-evil tale on the level of the Godfather. Anakin could have been like Michael Corleone, an innocent led down a dark path that ultimately ends up fulfilling his destiny as a figure of unadulterated evil. Yet it is not. I feel bad even mentioning the potential of a Godfather comparison, as this film isn't even close to the same cinematic plane. Overall, one of the worst and most disappointing films ever produced. Though a small step up from the laughable Attack of the Clones, what should have been an epic conclusion turns into a disaster of epic proportions."
483,,One long and endless light saber fight,"First let me state that I am an avid Star Wars fan from the first hour, having seen Episode IV on the big screen when I was some 12 years old."
484,8,Not only the best of the prequels but the best of the sequels extremely emotional,Not only the best of the prequels but the best of the sequels extremely emotional but if you want to get the full weight of this movie watch the clone wars first
485,8,Overall good but beware of the hype (minor spoilers below),"I have been anxiously waiting for this movie. I know a bunch of people have commented on it so I will try to be brief and will assume you have read many other reviews. Loved the Original Trilogy (OT) and thought Episode 1 was fair and Episode 2 was acceptable. I had read all the critics and prior nay-sayers carrying on about how great this movie was and I really wanted it to be incredible. Unfortunately, I believe it is a victim of its own critic praises. The praise built my expectations up so high that it would have been hard to really reach it. So, I saw this opening day in a pretty good theater and was expecting the sun, moon and stars."
486,6,An impressive and glorious end,"George Lucas has finally proved himself worthy of the legacy of ""Star Wars"". With Revenge of the Sith, Mr. Lucas has proved that he can actually direct a great movie. Revenge of the Sith manages to successfully and satisfyingly close the Star Wars circle. The saga is finally complete."
487,6,"I still think George Lucas is becoming senile, but someone did SOMETHING right.","The problem with the prequel ""Star Wars"" trilogy is obvious: it is largely, if not entirely, an orgy of hyperrealistic and inordinately expensive special effects capitalising on a hugely successful and endearing franchise with little attention paid to the basic framework for what makes a good movie, well, good. Of course, it all starts with the scripts, which overall are remarkably poorly written: no special effects could gloss over this tripe; nor could the fabulous talent of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen possibly shine through these mousy lines; nor could any actor convincingly portray a character so incongruously contrived as Anakin Skywalker. Episode III is not an exception and judged objectively as a film it is not a great one."
488,5,Merciless End to the First Trilogy,"I recently watched Sith on Spike TV after having not seen it for a while. Right after that they showed the first Star Wars (or to Star Wars geeks, Episode 4, A New Hope). There was absolutely no comparison between the two movies..the original Star Wars was that much better. There are a number of reasons, but it boils down to this. In Star Wars and Empire, the effects supported the story and the characters. In the three ""prequels,"" and in particular this movie and Clones, the characters and story are more of an afterthought to support the massive amounts of CGI/effects and cartoon characters invented by George Lucas."
489,9,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005),"It's official; I'm no longer a Star Wars virgin. I have finally watched all six films in preparation for The Force Awakens which I eagerly await with my pre-ordered tickets. Revenge of the Sith is undoubtedly my favorite of the prequels and my second favorite overall, behind The Empire Strikes Back; I was surprised by how much they stepped up their game and ended the trilogy in a darker, more emotional way. In Revenge of the Sith, the Jedi Knights are spread out all over the galaxy leading a massive clone army against the Separatists. Obi-Wan Kenobi is sent to kill the leader of the Separatist Army, General Grievous. Meanwhile, Anakin Skywalker becomes closer to Chancellor Palpatine who is secretly a Sith Lord and eventually leads Anakin to yield to the dark side of the Force and become Darth Vader. Although Anakin's transition to the dark side was only foreshadowed in Attack of the Clones, it is a major theme in this movie and gives the film much more dramatic depth to explore. Watching his mind warp into that of an eventual Sith Lord is almost tragic in context with the rest of the trilogy, and it makes Episode III the most emotionally driven prequel. Hayden Christensen's acting is still questionable as ever, which I blame on poor writing. He has great facial expressions and body language, but the material he has to work with is dreadful at times. Even then, Revenge of the Sith is still a wholly satisfying and terrific ending to the prequel trilogy. From its memorable opening action sequence to the final scene showing Darth Vader's construction, Revenge of the Sith is a thrilling and impressive conclusion to the trilogy."
490,9,The negative reviews seem a little harsh..,"OK, much of the dialogue isn't great, and Yoda's backward speaking sentences move to a new degree of tortuousness, nevertheless those people saying this film lacks any urgency, and/or is laughable, are missing some basic emotions, because despite the above, the climax with Anakin/Obi-wan and Palpatine/yoda is stunning, with a level of emotional investment way beyond the first two prequels, and the action itself is outstanding, having watched the battles more than a few times now on DVD. Anyone complaining, about Vader saying ""Noooo.."", how about experiencing the loss of everyone you love and three limbs, hell, maybe you might say ""ooh, I could crush a grape"" a la Duncan Norvelle ( a reference for UK readers)"
491,9,Best of the recent bunch!,"The best of the recent three Star Wars films, STAR WARS: EPISODE THREE: REVENGE OF THE SITH delivers with zest, you can't keep your eyes or emotions off it. It's 140 minute running time flies by even for the non Star Wars fans. "
492,9,When the Sith hits the fans.,"(Note: I reveal major details, but if you know what has to happen, there are no surprises.) ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" faces an interesting narrative predicament, because not only does everyone know where it begins (picking up during the Clone Wars, a few years after ""Episode II"" ended), they also know where it ends (about two decades before the original ""Star Wars"" begins). This both abets and subverts the power of the film, which must be considered the best of the three recent installments. Knowing what must happen eliminates the suspense factor, but adds different emotional layers that more than adequately fill that void."
493,10,Great movie,Has some problems but still great nonetheless. Has really great ideas to expand upon the already existing Star Wars universe and there's some fan service tossed in as well.
494,9,Excellent bridge to part IV,"After Episode I and II which were full of intriguing creatures and planets but plot wise not too good (especially Ep II) IMHO, this episode has a strong plot. It shows Anakin's journey to the dark side. Not that it becomes a psychological drama all of a sudden (we are still talking Starwars), but it shows the struggle within a person but also the effect that the outside world has on personal choices. The start of the film is full of action and this is certainly not the only fast part in the film. The final scene showing Anakin's final choice for the dark side and how he becomes Darth Vader was a highlight to me on a fascinating planet. It also creates links to the original Episode IV, why Obi Wan had to face Darth Vader. To me it was a gripping story full of action with a great climax. The final scene is a very good bridge to the original part IV. For me, the only disappointing element in this film for is the ""bad guy"" who could have been a better choice. On the other hand, he is not the real bad guy: he's more a handle to attach the action scenes to. And of course it becomes very clear that the emperor is the real bad guy in the end (which, if you see the films in the order of the story, you probably already suspected which gets confirmed. If you watched in order of release, you of course already knew)"
495,8,"The Best Star Wars Flic, and Good In Its Own Right","I'm not a ""Star Wars"" fan. I see the movies because I want to keep up with popular culture."
496,10,This is where the fun begins,This is where the fun begins<br /><br />This is where the fun begins<br /><br />This is where the fun begins
497,2,Very Disappointing,"While I am greatly disappointed in this the sixth and final installment of the Star Wars saga, I am still a loyal fan. Episode III is not as good as Episode II, which is not as good as Episode I. As with Episode II, Episode III seems to be too concerned to tie into the story of Episodes IV-VI. This compelling need to be a tie-in, bridge episode is the greatest flaw in Episode III as it was in Episode II. Episode III is the weakest installment by far. It seems as if George Lucas has become tired of the story and wants to be done with it."
498,1,"Master visual, amateur story","It's over, literally! I was at the beginning screen 12:01 midnight. I was expecting this dramatic one as anyone else did to be the soul-searching one revealing why Anikin flipped to the dark side. Boy, was I bored and disappointed. I give the movie 6 * out of 10, 4 for the visual and 2 for the story. Felt terribly sorry for the eager fans, as they went out there and hoped. What did they get? Nadda! The only reasons that Anakin went over were 1) he had some bad dreams abt his wife dying when delivering the babies. Yet these dreams are totally random and unfounded. Throughout the movie, there was NO plot or really danger to his wife whatsoever!!! 2) The council doesn't trust him, as he was close to palpatine . THAT'S ALL???? Come on, any amateur writer can do better than that!!! There were lots of visuals, but they seem random, redundant and meaningless, . The story is linear and scripting seems from some freshman's English paper, read by some amateur actors. The revealing of the Dark lord was carelessly told and rendered."
499,10,An excellent conclusion to the saga,"George Lucas has really outdone himself; when you're about to finish a saga that took nearly 30 years to complete, this is the way to go. This is the one all the fans have been waiting for, and it's unlikely anyone will be disappointed. The drama, the action, the romanticism and the mythic qualities of Star Wars are here in spades, and there are some shocking moments (particularly to anyone who has managed to remain spoiler-free) that are sure to be remembered forever, just as Palpatine's demise in Return of the Jedi (1983) was such a memorable scene."
500,7,Meh ... :shrugs shoulders:,At last it arrives ... the film linking the glory of the original Star Wars saga with the mediocrity of the new series.
501,8,"Worth seeing twice, you can't catch all the subtleties in one viewing.","(Star Wars  Episode III) George Lucas has put his crowning touch on this quintessential ""pas de la resistance"" finale. With cinematic grandeur that only Lucas could achieve, this ending saga quite eloquently weaves continuity into all the loose ends of the five prior epilogues."
502,10,Greatest movie. Greatest saga,"Emotional. Powerful. Poetic. Simply Beautiful. This movie offers everything that a fan could want, and it does on an epic scale. Anakin's turn to the dark side is very emotional, and truly iconic."
503,,Lucas is capable of much worse.,"It's difficult to make this film and not disappoint someone. The expectations are just too high; after three decades, grown men are still wearing silly outfits and making odd sounds while waving their plastic light sabres outside cinemas. I don't fault Lucas for the criticism he's received, nor do I think that he should be chastised for not making the best science fiction film in history. Furthermore, if he wants to make some more money and have his characters sell stuff on TV, more power to him; if you don't like it, buy another brand. I could care less whether Vader ends up advertising for Playtex. My gripes lie elsewhere."
504,10,Great Movie - compared to the whole Saga,This movie is really a great pieceof art.
505,2,Very Disappointed... More of a comedy than anything.,"Sorry fellow fans.. I don't mean to knock it for you so you don't see it. You'll see it anyway as a fan of the franchise, and it being the final part. But if you're interested in an honest if negative opinion of a true fan, a disappointed fan, read on."
506,1,Revenge of the Steaming Pile of Sith,"The franchise has gotten so wrapped up in CGI that they've forgotten what the series is supposed to be about. As space opera, Episode III is the lowest of the three ""new generation"" Star Wars flicks. As high art, it fails."
507,8,Best of the 'Prequels' by far,"This is easily the best of the prequel movies. In fact, it's an excellent movie, it which the strands of the previous movies come together brilliantly to set the scene for events in the original trilogy."
508,9,What if?,"Since many many people have now paid their money and seen this film, I'll not go into plot details or trivia since you have 600 other reviewers for that. Most of the time while watching the film I kept thinking about two things. First I wonder what the filmmakers could have done with all this power and ability given a truly great science fiction novel or story like the Foundation Trilogy or John Carter of Mars or so many other great novels or short stories in the hands of great writers and screenwriters. Second what if Darth had just simply taken his wife hopped on a ship and joined his ""brother"" out on the desert planet and become a simple farmer giving us a kind of space opera Green Acres? It's like I'm the weirdest of the Star Wars movie fans because I wonder about all those people in all those zillions of background buildings that go whizzing by while everyone's watching the leaps and explosions. Is that really what all these movies over nearly 30 years are all about? That millions of beings living in really cool looking buildings seem almost eager to be ruled by a creepy guy and his almost robot like sidekick and their millions of faceless troops? Are all these people too busy voting for the next crappy pop singer to really know what's going on? Did any of them get to see Team America World Police? We may never know."
509,6,lost my interest,"Lucas's grand finale was a grand fizzle. The story to end all the others stories just fell flat. The script was good, and the acting absolutely first-rate. I could tell that they took great pains to make certain that there was continuity between this film and Episode IV. Near the end, when Darth Vader's helmet is placed on his head and he draws that first very audible breath, was a ""goose bump"" scene. There simply weren't very many of them in the film. There is one major continuity issue that I noticed. In Episode IV, Princess Leia talks about her mother as if she knew her as a child, and mentions her being sad. But in this film, Padme (Leia's mother) dies immediately after giving birth, so Leia couldn't have known her mother. That didn't bother me too much, though. What DID fall flat were the special effects. Nothing in this film can compare with the work of Weta Digital in the LOtR trilogy. I'm afraid that ILM just hasn't quite caught up with the Kiwis. Lucasfilms relies on technology that's been superseded. The entire lava planet fight scene, which is the ""kick butt"" sequence, looks so faked that I couldn't get into it. That's where the film lost me...and it never regained my interest. Sorry, George. I gave it only a 6 and I think that's being generous."
510,10,come to the dark side of the force,"This prequel definitely lives up to the trilogy. Anakin betraying the jedis and becoming Darth Vader was really powerful, I cheered on it! Pain and love molding the good character in the most iconic antagonist ever. Also, the ending of the republic was shocking, even if it was the expected... Impossible not to love it."
511,7,Dark is a point of view ...,"Like many friends of mine I left the theater feeling sorry for Darth Vader. I also felt that he was an idiot to not see through the chancellor's plot to control him (I think the chancellor really did plant nightmares in the mind of Anakin Skywalker but this was not explored on screen.) The story line is much better than the first two episodes but one grows tired of seeing a Jedi Knight lose his light saber for the 67th time in a single movie. Can't he use a wrist-strap to keep it handy ??? While this movie does an excellent job of binding the story of episodes 1 and 2 to 4,5,6, it will also change and devalue the way you feel when you watch 4,5,6, forever. The respect for Yoda and Obiwan will be gone, and the fear and hate for Vader will be diminished, replaced by pity and sadness."
512,1,This movie made me so sad,This was a horrible movie on so many levels. I am so sad.
513,8,The verdict is in: Fanboys SUCK!,"I liked both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones in spite of their obvious flaws. But even knowing that chances are I was probably going to like Revenge of the Sith, or at least give it more of a lighter critical touch, I had to shake my head and laugh at all the people who thought Lucas was finally going to put the naysayers to rest with this one."
514,6,It's over. Thank god.,"With ""Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith,"" it's time for those of us raised on the Star Wars franchise, we who have a certain fond attachment to the series, to acknowledge the unavoidable: these are not good films. It's easier to admit this about the first trilogy, protected against criticism as it is by the prism of nostalgia. Even the considerable mess of ""The Phantom Menace"" seemed no worse than a mulligan. After providing the heroes and villains of countless childhoods, George Lucas could be forgiven for being a bit stiff after a 20 year absence. But by the time R2D2 suddenly sprouted booster rockets in ""Attack of the Clones,"" something had clearly gone wrong. The saga limps over the expected finish line with ""Revenge of the Sith,"" and the end is gratifying; we no longer must bear witness to the agony of something so beloved. It's the film equivalent of putting down Old Yeller."
515,1,worst dialogue in a major motion picture.,"well, george, you blew your last shot at credibility. ""Not if anything about it I have to say?"" Are you joking? Did your kids write the script? you had this amazing idea for an epic in space....and you turn it into this. you can't be proud of that movie....you just can't. The action, specifically the lightsaber fighting, was nothing new, nothing epic. there was just lots of filler, and lava. I should've seen this coming when I saw Return of the Jedi. Teddy bears, to movies for toddlers. George saw big $$ this time. Why else would he spend so much money stirring up hype? Because there was nothing in that movie that would make people tell their friends about it, except for the aforementioned laughable dialogue maybe?"
516,10,The force is strong here,I absolutely loved this one the other prequel s are really good but this one took the cake and Hayden did an amazing job as Anakin Skywalker
517,2,"Boring, dull, and too little too late","After what seems like about 5 hours of lifeless CGI effects, we get to see the making of Darth Vader. But by then I don't think many in the screening really cared anymore, having been long since tired of the attempt to cover up a poorly crafted script with uninteresting battles and utterly transparent supporting characters. The light-sabre duels in the original trilogy were cool and used sparingly when the story really required it. But here they seem to be out every 5 minutes and thus are simply made so so dull."
518,9,S10 Reviews: Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005),"The Clone Wars have fully consumed the Galaxy as Count (Christopher Lee) Dooku's droid armies (now lead by the sickly part robot General Grievous) engage the Senate's forces. In a daring move Grievous takes The Chancellor (Ian McDiarmid) hostage and it is the job of the two premier negotiating Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor) to rescue the Chancellor. After a rousing success the Jedi head back for their next assignment but not before Padme reveals in secret to Anakin that she is with child. In the time between films the Chancellor and Anakin have grown closer but all takes a turn for the worse as Palpatine offers Skywalker his knowledge of the Dark Side to prevent Anakin's premonitions of Padme's death in childbirth from coming true. Confused the young Skywalker reveals the Chancellor's identity to the Jedi council and Mace (Samuel l. Jackson) and company head in to shut him down. But Palpatine has manipulated all for one purpose, to create the first Galactic Empire and with Anakin's allegiance proclaimed to Palpatine he seals the fate of the Jedi and destroys all those around him."
519,9,Great !,"This film was like George Lucas saying sorry for the other 2. But it is one of my favourite Star Wars films. The only thing wrong with this film is Hayden christiansen. I love this film as it shows all the characters in the other films who haven't met before meet and fight for the whole film. Script is a bit off but is good to see how everything ends and turns out for everyone. ALSO is great to see what happened to darth Vader, great idea, only good acting from Hayden I've seen"
520,7,Still Flawed But The Best Of The Trilogy,"After two entertaining but extremely flawed prequels, the third had a shocking amount of anticipation. In fact, I remember everyone being more excited for this than Episode One, and for one reason...Darth Vader. Say what you will about George Lucas but he knew how to get fans wanting more."
521,8,The Best Movie in the Prequel Trilogy,"This movie is easily the best film of the prequels, though that isn't saying much. Anyways, this is actually a pretty good film, which I was not expecting on my first watch, considering the terrible first two films of this godforsaken trilogy. The lightsabers duels were somehow better than in the first two movies and John Williams' score adds so much! This was also the best movie for characterization, and definitely the best when we're talking about the story! Overall, this is a good movie, not to the standards of the original trilogy, but to the standards of this one."
522,10,Iconic. A true staple.,This movie defined like 5 years of my youth. I still bawl every time I watch it. Cinematic gold. Pure unadulterated masterpiece.
523,7,Gerat CGI but not much else.,"The opening sequence is an indicator of just how good a movie this is. Although it is a very good CGI of ships in combat there is no real hart to this film. We are bombarded with the CGI capabilities of ILM, but for me there is no solid story telling, no great acting, no comic relief, and absolutely no chemistry between characters in this movie. All the elements that made the first three films more then just good movies, but something really great are missing. "
524,9,Speechless,Just got back from a midnight screening of the film for which i have been waiting for 20 years. And i'm just about to go see it again.
525,5,Best of the Prequels,"This movie was definitely the best of the three prequels for the Star Wars saga. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that it was a great movie. Unlike in the two first installments, the Revenge of the Sith managed to bring forth my emotions at a couple of points, but I still could not but laugh whenever the screen was decorated by a so-called romantic scene. Lucas still doesn't know a better way to describe love and emotions than making the characters say them aloud or staring silently into the distance..."
526,1,A Very Bad Movie,"There's basically two problems with this movie. First, Revenge of the Sith is not very engaging and features characters who are not supposed to be stupid behaving stupidly, the only reason being that they need to do what they do to make the badly-thought-out story move forward. Second, Revenge of the Sith does not accurately or satisfactorily set up what happens in the movies that came out from 1977 to 1983. It's as if the makers of this movie didn't watch the other films and forgot what was said about characters' back-story."
527,10,This is the best star wars movie period.,Just when Lucas finally got the hang of things the franchise under his care ended. Unlucky.
528,10,The Best STAR WARS movie,This movie is actually what star wars means...<br /><br />Everything that makes Star Wars amazing is in this movie.
529,8,What All the Prequels Should've Been,"This movie shares a few of the problems that it's predecessors had. This includes an unlikable Anakin, cringe worthy dialogue, and confusing plot points. I'll get to Anakin later so for now I'll talk about my other 2 problems with the movie. Surprisingly, the cringe worthy dialogue had been severely limited. The only point where I cringed was that one balcony scene with Padme and Anakin. Everything else between the two in this movie was pretty tolerable and at times believable. Okay, that liberty line was dumb to and General Grievous' dialogue is a bit too silly but those are scattered throughout the movie. Most of the time I don't even notice nor care. I also kind of like some of the dialogue others seem to hate. I felt the emotion when Anakin betrays Padme. You can see at this point that Anakin is far gone and even if they didn't truly love each other, seeing a once noble (for the most part) Jedi being seduced by the dark side is pretty tragic. I'll admit that Anakin is a bit better in this movie and like I said, I did feel the emotion as he turned to the dark side and killed all those Jedi. His motivations are strong enough but the one thing I will not let slip by is Anakin murdering those younglings. Why would you do that when your wife is pregnant?! FATHER OF THE YEAR AM I RIGHT?! That's what I was thinking at least. I don't think anyone would murder younglings to save their wife. I'm sorry. I get why it was put in the movie but it really didn't have to be younglings. Anyways, my last problem with this movie is one really confusing plot point. For the most part, this movie is pretty easy to follow which is a good thing. However, I don't get why General Grievous had to die. I may sound like an over-obsessive fangirl for saying this but was there any point to him dying? The Jedi were planning to bring General Grievous to justice to end the war, but did it end the war? NO! The war continued even after his death. Yes, I know General Grievous is just a pawn for Count Dooku and Darth Sidious so they can kill more Jedi. However, he didn't have to die so early on in the movie. I would've liked to see a duel between General Grievous and Anakin. At least it would've been a cooler and more memorable way to die. Anyways. Onto more positive things. As you can tell, I really like General Grievous. He is one of the best characters in these prequels next to Obi Wan. He's also an interesting concept. Another thing like about this movie is how visual it is. They use visuals to tell this story in a unique and dazzling way. They don't flat out say Anakin is being seduced by the dark side. They show him killing all those jedi, nearly killing his wife and engaging his former master in a duel. It's also a much slower process than people give it credit for. As Anakin starts to spend more and more time with the Chancellor, Anakin becomes more and more interested in the dark side. This eventually leads him to making the wrong decision during the showdown with Mace Windu and at first, he is regretful for his actions. I kinda like that actually. The lightsaber duels are also much more intense. Remember in a New Hope when Vader and Obi Wan were just tapping light sticks? Well in this movie the same people are doing flips in mid air, clashing swords, riding small rocks over a river of lava, the list goes on! The opening space battle actually looked like a Star Wars movie. Yeah that always kind of bugged me in the prequels. They spend so much time on the planets in a movie called ""Star Wars."" Here I don't mind it as much since the planets are much cooler looking or pretty. Overall, I really love this movie and I kind of hate to admit that."
530,7,I find your lack of fandom disturbing...,"My score of 7 is a bit misleading. When I first saw the movie the day of its release, I would have rated it a 9, I liked it that much at first glance. Some parts were tedious, but in general I got a kick out of the movie. This is because I made a deliberate effort going in to check my brain at the door."
531,10,Lucas is the man....,"Lucas finally got it right. Although I loved all the prequel's this one was by far the best I even thinks it ranks up there with the original. I saw the midnight showing. We got into the theater around 9:30pm and it was crazy in there. People kept on going to the front of the theater to have light saber fights. The chemistry and relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin was exactly the way it should be. I thought in the last episode they didn't do much on their relationship, but in this one it was like they're brothers. Everyone cheered when Anakin killed Mace. They also cheered when the pronounced Anakin Darth Vader. And when they first put Anakin in the Darth Vader costume everyone went crazy. We all closed the show with giving the film a standing ovation. What's the limit of stars to give a film well I don't know so I'm giving this film 6 stars."
532,10,The end is here. A great way to end Star Wars.,"I must say after seeing this movie, i was quite stunned! I never went to see ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" or ""Star Wars: Attack of the clones"" in theaters. I'm glad to. The 2 prequels were just so dumb and very boring. It goes to show ya that those two movies were nothing but warm-ups just to get ""Star Wars: Revenge of the sith' story running. I think the whole world will agree with me that ""Revenge of the sith"" is better than the other 2 prequels. Heck, even IMDb says so. Jar Jar Binks does not say 1 word in this movie...THANK GOD! Hate the character. He really gets on my nerves.This movie has a plot, a good one at that. Whilist the other 2 prequels didn't even have one. This movie did. It caught up on a lot of things from the originals. And it was good to see some evil for a change. Instead of having ""A new hope"" as for Luke as the last hope for been the last Jedi, we have Anakin been the last hope for been the last Sith. It was very dark. Which is good, actually. That way not many kids can see this movie. So you wont have many kids running around in the movie pretending that they're in a concert playground. But you still get stupid teenagers acting stupid in the theater. But, anyway. This movie is the best movie i've seen in cinemas, same with ""Seed of Chucky."" But ""Revenge of the sith"" is definitely a movie to be seen in the cinemas. The action and CGI in this movie is simply amazing. Best movie so far with it. And the acting improved 100% ever since the other 2 prequels. If you're a fan on action and Science Fiction, than this is YOUR movie. I recommend this to all the Star Wars fans and all the people that love action and Science Fiction."
533,8,Best one in the series.,"Star Wars Episode III is probably the best one in the series just because of the way it brings everything together. It's not classic material like the original, but it's really enjoyable to watch everything get connected. This movie ties up all the knots. Anakin's final journey to the dark side to become Darth Vader, Palpatine becoming the Emperor, Luke and Leia's birth, and everything else, no matter how small the detail."
534,7,Still missing something.,"Lucas pours on the special effects and action for one final blowout, but its still not quite enough. The film is entertaining on a visual level, but like the other prequels, it has no heart. There are so many scenes that should have had more impact, but they are killed by flat, cliché-ridden dialog. Why can't these characters talk to each other like human beings? What's wrong with having a little emotion on their faces? You've got this massive betrayal going on, all these innocents killed, and characters react like they're doing a line reading around a conference table. I know that most of these people are good actors, so I can only assume it's George telling them to be more robotic."
535,6,George Lucas Light Show,"Roll up, roll up to see the George Lucas light show. Look what I can do with my computers boys and girls? Isn't it great? "
536,9,This movie is excellent,"This is an excellent film filled with memorable scenes, lines and an excellent soundtrack from beginning to end. Put all this around a thrilling narrative about the lead being torn and manipulated and it just gets better every time I watch it."
537,4,"Contrived, this film is","At a crucial point in the plot of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) screams out a forced, ""Noooooooo!"" A metaphor is to be found here. As Hayden Christensen passes the torch of Anakin onto Jones, that single word is representative of Christensen's acting career -- if you're willing to call his strained attempts at emotion acting."
538,2,Star What??? Revenge Of Lucas Arts $$$,"Lucas should feel shame for all of his wasted efforts beyond the original trilogy. Since the mid 70's, fans have waited with great anticipation for follow-ups to the first low-budget blockbuster that could have outlived history and possibly still will. Unfortunately none of the newest releases from the 2000's will receive the same regard."
539,10,A New Era Has Begun,"Revenge of The Sith is truly not only the best movie in the Prequel trilogy but on it's on it is one of the greatest Star Wars movies ever made. Everything......and I mean everything from The Phantom Menace, Attack of The Clones and the majority of the Clone Wars TV series has been building towards this epic tragedy."
540,,Shame on George Lucas,"George Lucas is a soft-spoken man who has devoted much of the past 20 years of his life to caring for his adopted children. It is so clear from interviews with him and his children what wonderful Dad he is. It is too bad though that he didn't take the rest of the children in the movie-going public into consideration when he made this last series of prequels to the earlier Star Wars Trilogy. Before you give into being upset about my comments, please read on."
541,1,Falls short,"Well, I went into this movie with expectations low, we've been treated to lousy films one after the other, Return of the Jedi has prepared us for this trash. Like in return of the Jedi they're a lot of useless talk and silly moments in this movie, Ewaks belong in Lord of the rings, not Star Wars, wouldn't it be funny to see a death star in LOTR. The fights which were the big fuss were nothing more then two people staring at each other with lame things happening in the background. AS expected he put everything together, But for some reason you will feel empty at the end of the film, sure the fans are cheering like they've just won the lotto, but all in all there is no jackpot in this film, A New Hope and Empire strikes back are still the best films of the series, and this movie is just the same thing all over again."
542,7,Has the Ingredients,Revenge of the Sith offers an insane amount of action and great music with a little bit of heart. In some ways ep III is everything I want in a Star Wars film but there are some things that bother me which is why it isn't.
543,3,It's finally over,"I saw Revenge of the Sith when it came out, afterwards I was speechless, it was such a let down, I felt despite their faults Episodes 1 and 2 were building to something. Not only was Episode 3 too violent and not just at the end, but it was numbing, how many light sabre fights can you see before it gets tired? Episode 1's climatic fight was really good, and redeemed the film to an extent (and it had a great theme song), Episode 2's climax had good novelty the first time. Where as what we get is an entire film building up to the most overlong, disappointing duel, the only moment in the entire scene with any resonance was Obi-Wan telling Anakin not to fight him when he has the higher ground. Poor Ewan McGregor: not given a character to work with but a list of mannerisms, poor Christopher Lee: wasted, poor Natalie Portman: badly written. Samuel Jackson could've have been a bit better, although he had three films with nothing to do."
544,8,The best of the newer Star War films,"I'm not that big of a Star War fan, but I did enjoy the movies very much. And I'm talking about the older ones. The one's that were more realistic with the special effects. Now, if you notice in my movie comments, I did not comment the Episode 2, because my mother said if you have nothing nice to say then don't anything at all. But this third one was the best out of all three of the newer Star Wars. Everything finally came together. You know it's kind of funny, I was expecting a happy ending. Yet you know if you have seen Episode 4-6, that it's not going to be so good. :D I thought the acting and effects were very awesome and believable. Coming from a computer generation, it's a bit disturbing how many bad effect movies there are, but Episode Three was cool to look at and have fun with."
545,5,Tedious,"Compared to episodes 1 and 2, there is a higher level of action in this film, which could have been a good thing if only because it minimises the amount of dialogue. Alas, that would have been the case only if the action scenes were actually GOOD."
546,5,The Saga is Not Yet Over,"I'm an occasional fan of Star Wars films. So I don't want to sound like a detractor of George Lucas and his ILM Northern California Kingdom. Nevertheless, don't be fooled for a minute that Lucas is finished with his SW storytelling. If 'Episode III' topples ""Titanic"" off the #1 moneymaker spot, rest assured the director will be working double-time on 'Episode VII.' "
547,10,The Fall of man and the birth of a monster,"""Star Wars"" is certainly a cult event that has been stirring people's minds for decades, has a huge army of fans, which is replenished with new ""adherents"". It is difficult to overestimate the impact of this franchise on people's minds and popular culture. It is a splendor of colors, philosophical ideas, epic battles on planets and in space. Here everyone will find something interesting for himself, something that will touch him to the depths of his soul."
548,10,"Good movie, I was sad to see Anakin fall","The movie was good, the visuals are much better than the last 2 movies, in this movie the story is much more interesting than the last 2 movies."
549,,Suitably thrilling and often poignant.,"With Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas brings his second Star Wars trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant -- if still a bit uneven -- conclusion."
550,1,Makes no sense!,"The only reason Anakin agreed to help Palpatine was to save the love of his life Padme. Then it seems he just thought ""ah, balls to it - think I'll just go the whole hog and go fully evil"" and turns on all of his lifelong friends and his principals. Gives Padma a virtual shove to the ground too, just for good measure. It just WAS NOT believable! And er, who comes up with such a word as ""younglings""!! Also, they used the lazy trick of having background music on throughout the entire film - because they knew the drama just wasn't up to scratch. Sigh, the poor kids who had to put up with this level of entertainment when we got the far better parts 4, 5 and 6 when we were growing up. To quote Yoda: ""Regret watching this, you will""."
551,1,sucked losers dry,"This movie in some ways was a crowning achievement in movie history. Never before have I seen so many brilliant actors, effects artists, set designers etc. produce such a steaming bucket of hamster vomit all because of a loopy director. I only hope that he stops killing Star Wars some day but I can only imagine he is doing something stupid like make a baby Jabba TV series. The only thing that mattered in all the prequels was the end scene of ep 3 and honestly by that point I didn't care. Actually at that point I wanted my money back. I think if the movies were dubbed with better dialog they could be saved but as they stand I feel they blow big donkey dongs. I was a huge Star Wars fan when I was young and after seeing the movies I have not spent one cent on any Star Wars related stuff. I know I can't stop George from flushing Star Wars away but I know how much money I spent on his world when I was younger and I know how much I could have spent now that I have a job and I didn't because Star Wars sucks now. The only thing standing in the way of me totally writing off Star Wars are the games. George Lucas on the other hand can shove his head up an elephant's butt."
552,10,The best star wars movie ever!,The prequels are actually way more<br /><br />depressing than what we thought. Throughout his<br /><br />whole life anakin was plagued by a lack<br /><br />of freedom he was born into the slave<br /><br />trade where his abusive owner would take<br /><br />advantage of his technical skills then a<br /><br />group of jedi knights show up to rescue<br /><br />him finally this is his big break and oh<br /><br />wait no they don't give a about him<br /><br />they just want to use his little racer<br /><br />thing to win them some money but hey<br /><br />after he risks his life for them after<br /><br />he single-handedly gets them exactly<br /><br />what they want the jedi return the favor<br /><br />and free him from slavery but it's not<br /><br />from the goodness of their hearts it's<br /><br />because they now think he's their new<br /><br />space jesus they couldn't give less of a<br /><br />about the actual human rights<br /><br />travesty happening on the planet see you<br /><br />later little slave kids enjoy the desert<br /><br />you feel wimps but it's whatever<br /><br />anakin gets to become a jedi and learn<br /><br />the ways of the force in a way it's<br /><br />actually a really abusive system which<br /><br />forces them to repress all of his trauma<br /><br />hormones or attachment to any living<br /><br />thing in the known universe despite<br /><br />fighting their wars for them despite<br /><br />bringing them countless victories for<br /><br />their republic the jedi still take<br /><br />advantage of his natural power and<br /><br />blatantly ignore what he has to say<br /><br />about it and so when palpatine comes<br /><br />along the father figure he never had<br /><br />someone who finally understands him hey<br /><br />i get that the jedi are using you i get<br /><br />that you have these romantic feelings<br /><br />that are forbidden join me and<br /><br />everything will be fine of course he<br /><br />gives in but again palpatine is just<br /><br />using him for personal gain and anakin<br /><br />ends up paying for it he sacrifices his<br /><br />moral code his best friend's trust and<br /><br />the love of his life and after losing<br /><br />everything after being left so hideously<br /><br />scarred and deformed he has nothing left<br /><br />but his loyalty to palpatine he's gone<br /><br />too far to turn back and so he has no<br /><br />choice but to spend the next 20 years as<br /><br />an emotionally tortured puppet all of<br /><br />this is changed by his son luke the only<br /><br />person who hasn't lost faith in him who<br /><br />hasn't been corrupted by him or murdered<br /><br />by him and so when he sees palpatine<br /><br />taking advantage of luke when he sees<br /><br />history repeating itself anakin finally<br /><br />has enough for the first time in his<br /><br />life he exercises freedom and makes the<br /><br />first choice that is truly his having<br /><br />been told to repress his feelings and<br /><br />the love that he has for others it's<br /><br />that same love for his son which<br /><br />prevails and ends up saving the day.
553,1,Stupid stupid film not worth a 1.,"Has Lucas gone completely crazy? Despite loathing the first two prequels, I, nonetheless, was caught up by the Darth Vader hype like a lot of others and entered the cinema with anticipation of the final redemption of Lucas. How wrong I was. Within a couple of minutes I was bored by this pile of juvenile, preposterous garbage. I understand that Lucas ignores basic laws of physics for his productions and I am willing to ignore the continual sound effects that take place within a vacuum, but the space craft relying upon moves that can only be accomplished within gravity and atmospheric pressure in the selfsame vacuum borders on the moronic. This was my first complaint. The storyline was utterly laughable and the repeated destruction of the characters in episodes IV, V and VI are painful. R2-D2 can fly and leaps around the space-craft like a jackrabbit. Ouch. And of course, despite spending 14 or so years training Anakin, who is replete with R2-D2 as his special robot, he does not remember a thing when confronted by Luke years later, you'd think a relationship that lasted for 14 years would stick in his memory. Jesus Christ Lucas, give us a break, at least acknowledge we have seen the other films. When Darth finally appears he wobbles uncertainly on his legs and attempts to convey emotional distress through his voice synthesizer. It's pathetic and in no way the awesome inspiring figure from the earlier films. The oh-so-annoying Padme just 'decides' she wants to die after giving birth to two healthy babies in an amazingly short time and promptly does so. Why???!!! It's too irritating for words. Anakin's very turn to evil is just silly, he wants to learn the necromantic arts of the Dark Side, for no reason whatsoever. Because he wants to bring his long-dead mother back? come on, really, that's just nuts. Oh, I nearly forgot the physical change that takes over Palpatine after he reveals himself as the nascent Emperor. Think of the sudden change in Bilbo when he is confronted with the Ring and that's about it. All of a sudden he is this old, ugly guy. It's a joke played on us by Lucas. 'What will they put up with next?' he wonders to himself, in his multi-million dollar ranch (paid for by us), rubbing his hands and chortling in glee as he watches the merchandising fly from shelves and the gullible public (of which I was a sad member) descend in droves to multiplexes and cinemas across the world. "
554,6,Not to worry...we are still flying half a ship!,"In all honesty this is probabaly the best of all three prequals & that really is saying something seeing as the previous two were not that good. However, I am watching this in context to the utter mess Disney has made of SW in recent years & in comparison TRofS is actually quite good in my opinion. This is a dissapointment, because this SHOULD have been the ultimate SW movie, that winds up the whole saga, but it leaves more questions than answers. There is also a very disturbing element to this film as well, namely the murder of children & innocents so this should be viewed with caution for those who are sensitive to needless violence in films (I am one!) I understand this is supposed to be part of Anakins journey to the Dark Side, but this is mostly explained by the fact that Anakin ""deams"" about Padmes suffering & death. Surely there should have been more substance to Anakins Dark journey than having it based on a thin premise of a ""dream"" ? Sorry but this (& the senseless violence) really lets the movie down. It is also let down by weak scripting & odd pacing, as well as going from deafening battle scenes to bearly whispered dialouge. Is this meant to keep the viewer awake? Also in tone this film is a lot darker than the previous too, which in places is well done when carried by Ian McDiarmid's awesome acting talent which I really enjoyed. The CGI is quite good as are the lightsaber duels (except the final one which looks like its on fast forward!) but the ultimate scene of Anakin/Vader transfomation is far too quick & a complete let down. There is no explanation of the tech of his new Vader suit & he just stumbles about yelling ""NO!!"" Sorry, but a little too implauseable, but hey! this is fantasy!"
555,10,The magic of the originals has indeed returned...,I was very excited to see this movie... it was easily the most advertised thing on television and those who had done reviews on it in the newspapers were strongly convinced. Not one single negative.
556,3,Thoroughly painful.,"I admit to almost falling asleep during this horrid movie. The only reason I didn't fall asleep was due to the constant noise of laser guns. Mnyeeeeehmnyeeeeehbooombabababooomboooooooom. -If you find that last sentence immature then don't watch this film, as that is all you should expect from it. Sure, this film has a decent plot and the acting is okay, that's why it gets 3 stars from me. But the film fails on all levels to convince me that this is true. I know it is a work of fiction, but when I am in a cinema I can truly believe a movie is real for the time I am in there if it captures me. Star Wars simply didn't. Lucas seems to be hoping that most viewers are die-hard fans who simply want to see some fighting. This film was all one messed up jumble of random robots and random characters with random head shapes. Appalling and highly disappointing."
557,7,"Bland Conclusion to ""Star Wars"" cycle","Writer & director George Lucas takes about two hours and twenty minutes to wrap up his popular, long-running ""Star Wars"" sci-fi franchise with ""Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith,"" the sixth, latest and certainly not last installment in his multi-generational galactic extravagance. ""Star Wars"" fans who consider themselves completists undoubtedly will savor Lucas' fill-in-the-blank storytelling skills. Those moviegoers less enamored of this cinematic phenomenon, however, may find themselves excited by the spectacular CGI special effects but jaded by the garrulous exchanges of dialogue. All things considered, ""Revenge"" amounts to standard-issue entry in a largely light-hearted franchise. Compared with ""Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" and ""Episode 2: Attack of the Clones,"" the anticlimactic ""Episode 3"" proves more implausible but entertaining, perhaps because Lucas shoehorns in so much information into an otherwise shallow plot, so that he can come full circle with his groundbreaking 1977 classic ""Star Wars"" that gave science fiction films a new lease on life. Like ""Attack of the Clones,"" ""Revenge"" suffers from the ghastly casting of stiff, inexpressive Hayden Christensen as heroic Anakin Skywalker. Christensen fills the role the same way cement fills a hole. Moreover, Lucas bungles Christensen's dramatic make-over from a humble Jedi Knight to one of the cinema's most despicable villains: Darth Vader. Christensen's leaden performance combined with the less than convincing logic that prompts Anakin to cross over to the dark side undercuts the dramatic clout. Poor Natalie Portman could have phoned in the second-rate, soap opera-like dialogue that she delivers with more conviction that it deserves. She appears barefoot, pregnant, and wears the oddest-looking night gown strung with beads strung across her shoulders. Not only does Lucas provide few surprises to liven up this fairly formulaic potboiler, but also the way that he ties the movies together lacks imagination."
558,1,"Well, at least its over with.","As a fan of the original Trilogy, I suffered through Episode 1 and Episode 2. Episode 1 remains the favorite of the three, only because its the only one of the three that doesn't seem like an over long special effect. At least it seemed to be a Star Wars film, even if it was a bad one."
559,10,One word WOW!,I must admit first I wasn't disappointed with the first two prequels. In fact I still don't know what the fuss against them is all about.
560,10,OMG! So good!,"Wow! A 10/10 for sure. Close to perfection. This one is just visually stunning. A great action packed movie. There could of been no better way to connect the events of EP2 and EP4. Compared to the previous 2 star wars movies this one is better paced, has better dialogue and better acting overall. With a great emotional charge this movie can make a grown man cry. The script is perfect. The CGI is amazing. The music fits really well to the story theme. Hayden's performance as Anakin was amazing. He was the perfect man for the job and really turned his role into one of the most loved characters in the whole franchise. Overall the movie is almost perfect from any point of view so i'll end my review saying that this is one of my fav of all time."
561,9,"Not a Perfect Way to End the Franchise, but a Good One","If they had ended the movies here, I would've been satisfied. While the Phantom Menace may have suffered from confusing villains and a story that was more aimed at setting up future installments than being good and Attack of the Clones was a steaming pile blaster-riddled bantha fodder, Revenge of the Sith finally got its act together and gave us a proper Star Wars story."
562,2,Thank goodness we only paid $2,"I will say this for Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith...it wasn't as bad as Attack of the Clones. Having said that, nothing can get much worse than AOTC. Revenge of the Sith improves on storytelling a little bit, but the extremely poor acting and overwhelmingly ridiculous ""special effects"" made this seem less like a film and more like a boring video game. Watching someone else play Sonic the Hedgehog is more entertaining."
563,,The worst Star Wars film (spoilers throughout),"Who ever thought that Darth Vader, the baddest guy in the galaxy, would turn out to be such a wet blanket? Not me. Well, not until the new Star Wars trilogy began. But even then, and after having to endure sickeningly cute Vader (""Wizard!"") and petulant adolescent Vader (""They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM"") I still had hope for the final part of the trilogy. Surely that would be good, I thought. Only a moron could screw that up. And after all the good reviews, I thought that finally, at long last, Lucas had delivered another fine Star Wars film. Cue disgust then when Lucas not only produced a terrible Star Wars film but the worst one of all."
564,10,One of the Greatest pieces of Star Wars,"While the first two had their problems, this prequel is perfect. We see how Anakin fell into darkness and saw the subtle ways the republic became the empire. Every actor in here is perfect in their role. But by far the biggest plus of this movie is seeing a bad guy truly win. This ascends the movie from good to great. Order 66 was a heartbreaking scene but the best part of the movie is the mustafar duel."
565,6,Actually... it wasn't a bad movie. I can't believe it.,"After watching the first two fiascoes (the prequels), I certainly didn't have any hopes for this one. I was expecting a whiny Darth Vader (Palpie! My light saber is, like, SOOO UNCOOOL! I hate it, hate it, hate it! - and so on), a terrible storyline, predictable plot, and slow... s-l-o-w storytelling."
566,8,A good movie. Period.,"The opening scene is amazing and after the Sidious vs Windu fight, the movie gets a darker tone with the fall of the Jedi Order and the theme of defeat. Maybe it's the most dramatic movie in the saga. With great choreography in the lightsaber fights, important moments to the whole story of the saga and the soundtrack is a masterpiece. McGregor is iconic as Obi Wan by now, McDiarmid is so hammy portraying Palpatine that is amazing, Portman did well, even though her role was small. Now Hayden acting was not that convincing. It's a fact that this movie is far from perfect, there still some cringe dialogues and bad executed scenes, but the last 50 seconds is just amazing. The heroes lost, Palpatine win, Anakin falls, But there still hope to the future and the way this movie conect with Star Wars (1977) was satisfying."
567,9,Powerful storytelling and the best of the prequels,"So far, George Lucas's prequels to the Star Wars franchise have been duds. This on the other hand is an exquisite film with better characters than the previous installments. Lucas has a lot of climatic battle scenes and features a towering score by John Williams with heart-wrenching moments that finally completes his large, sprawling series of films. This tops the first two prequels and does what prequels should do; it sets up the first film. Though not even close to the masterpieces that are the first three Star Wars films but it still partially redeems the mixed bag that is the prequel trilogy and certainly brings in plenty of cash for Lucas."
568,2,Auts,"In spite of the rather good idea for a plot, the dialog was awful and ate credibility. McGregor and Portman did they work as professionals do, but it was shame how little of their acting capacity was used. A little more effort to persons and more length to certain scenes would have done the trick. The scenario was jumping one place to an another having no rational thought. Special effects were great of course, but one can not compensate acting with them. The most beautiful role was done by ""Emperor"" Ian McDiarmid, and he truly belongs to royals ones. Anakin's role was so seriously performed that it was almost comical. Watching this was like watching the bad ones in Idols. The sense of empathized embarrassment made stomach hurt."
569,6,Oh Anakin! I have lost my will to live and take care of my children!,"I saw the original Star Wars when it was released and loved it. I mercifully slept through all the other ones when I took my kids. Today, my youngest finally persuaded me to see ROTS promising me I could once again sleep through it, but I really did want to see the story behind Darth Vader. I had the supreme fortune never having seen all the other ones, just the original and way back when. So, I thought it would be really interesting to see how I would react."
570,4,A truly epic disappointment,"Six years ago, I walked out of a movie theater, unable to admit to myself that perhaps George Lucas had made a mistake. My love for all things Star Wars clouded my sight and I was merely happy to have more jedi, droids, and George."
571,5,Another disappointment...,Anakin's motivations for turning to the dark side and his subsequent actions make no sense. I think Lucas developed the character of Anakin in the prior two movies and ended up writing himself into a corner. The following situation would be a similar situation in today's world.
572,1,Why is this a Good Movie?,"I don't want to rock the boat.... but WTF. The movie is a piece of ****. Please explain what you like about it. Here are my issues: - half the movie is CG footage of cities and planets - the lightsabre fights are so fast you cant even tell what is happening - the script is wooden, and so are the actors - ill give you that the fights with yoda are OK - and please explain all the BS camp in the first half of the film with the robots talking... we get the joke and it isn't funny I guess my biggest issue is that not only does this film suck but it also casts a shadow over Ep 4, 5, 6 because of the poor presentation of Darth Vader."
573,1,Lucas is a horrible writer,"Watching movies is a part of my daily activities, and I am aware that my standards of evaluation are rather harsh. But even lowering them for this movie did not help it. Hence the disappointment."
574,4,Not again...,"It's difficult to comment with originality about a film which has been so spectacularly derided in so many different ways; all focusing on one aspect of the entire series. Well, since George Lucas isn't big on originality, nor shall I be, so here goes - the dialogue is so bad, I thought I was watching a futuristic episode of the long dead 'Eldorado'. How is it possible to be SO bad at understanding what makes for interesting and convincing dialogue? How is it possible to come up with such a pathetic reason for Anakin joining the dark-side (oooo I had a bad dream so I'm going to be in a REAL mood now..)? How is it possible for an actor to be so wooden as to make Pinnochio actually look like a real boy with a few splinters? (and don't argue with the it's_difficult_to _act_properly_with_only_blue screens nonsense - I saw a one man rendition of Animal Farm with nothing but a torchlight at the Edinburgh festival - I think it was John Hurt and the whole theatre was transformed). How is it possible for a shabby screenplay to get past everybody involved with words like 'Younglings' (""Not even the Younglings survived"" says a clearly embarrassed Ewan McGregor - WHAT!? YOUNGLINGS? Was that a flock of small brown birds I missed getting massacred?). Hang on, I know the reason why - it's because George Lucas has lost so much focus on the real world and has been so immersed in the pseudo-Greek_myth_meets_toddler_vocabulary world that he doesn't know a good line if he sniffed it. Still it's better than the previous two."
575,7,GREAT-depressing-Stunning visually,"I'm updating my first post because I saw the movie AGAIN, and now have different view of it. The first time I saw it was 12 midnight and I was very tired with a headache too. So I saw it again the next day, fully rested, feeling good, and now can give a fair assessment of it. "
576,9,A Great End,Star Wars is one of those things that is larger than life. It goes beyond the movies. It's something that transcends such trivial ideas like entertainment.
577,4,Great effects (as you would expect!) but still more Revenge of the sh!t than Revenge of the Sith,STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs 
578,8,spectacular finish to the saga,"With ""Star Wars: Episode III - The Revenge of the Sith,"" we finally end up back where we started 28 long years ago with the original groundbreaking film. In this final piece of the puzzle, we learn what it is that causes Anakin Skywalker to finally give up his Jedi knighthood, cross over to the Dark Side, and become the dreaded Darth Vader."
579,7,it's an ending,"I saw this in the theatre when it came out and wasn't very impressed. It was at least the best of the 3 prequels, but that's not really saying much. But when I saw the high ratings it got here in this website, I thought I might've judged it too harshly and decided to give it a second chance. So I watched it again yesterday. Still boring. Everything I saw in the first two prequels I saw here: weak story and acting, little or no character development and no build up in tension and suspense. There were characters dying left and right. Characters I hardly new or cared about. True, on the plus side, Jar-Jar was left out and Samuel L. Jackson was finally knocked off, but these things happened too little, too late to save this film. Though at times, the special effects were nice to look at, most of the time it seemed like I was watching a cartoon. With the heavy use of CGI and colorful sets and the lack of character development and chemistry, this film probably should've been considered a cartoon."
580,4,The acting continues to kill!,"I am a huge fan of the original 3 Star Wars movies (Episodes 4-6). I've seen them countless times. I have tried to like these last 3 movies and have watched them several times to make myself like them, but I cannot do it. Although Mark Hamill was not a great actor, he made you love Luke Skywalker. Plus Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher had a great connection on screen. In these films it is hard to like anyone. Hayden Christensen is just awful in Episodes 2 & 3. His acting is neither believable nor likable. It is bad when you want the lead actor (who you are suppose to feel sorry for) to die. The love story between Anakin and Padmé is also wasted. There is obviously no connection between these two actors. She is supposed to die from heartbreak when Anakin turns to the dark? Whatever! No Romeo and Juliet here! It just doesn't pull you in, ever. Hayden has been good in movies like ""Shattered Glass"" but not this. G. Lucas did a horrible job selecting a cast for these films. I can only imagine how different these movies might have been with Leonardo DiCaprio (who was originally considered but turned it down)."
581,9,My favorite of the last three made,"Saw it opening night as to be expected. It had good action, good plot, and a pulse. The beginning was slow and a little stale but it picks up pretty quick. The two best parts of this film were watching the Emperor fight the Jedi with his light saber and watching Anakin fight Kenobi. That was pretty horrid and memorable I'm not sure little kids won't be emotionally scarred from watching that or seeing some other choice parts. The Emperor is the best character gosh darn he's the best thing since central air. If I could choose to be a character in these last three installments he would be the one screw everybody else. That alone was worth the price of two movie tickets. I applaud Lucas for cramming that much storyline into that time frame I still don't know how he managed that. Pretty impressive that was a lot of ground to cover in two and a half hours. I sure hope he decides to do three more and if the money's right (and it will be) he just might decide to do precisely that. But if not I want to tell you Mr. Lucas it has been one hell of a exciting ride. Thank you for the opportunity to ride along."
582,10,Star Wars is officially done,Star Wars: Episode 3- Revenge of the Sith is the strongest of the last three films. In this installment we see a more matured and angry Anakin Skywalker going to the Dark Side and becoming the figure we all know as Darth Vader. What people don't know about me is that I am a Star Wars geek. So I really enjoyed this one and I loved how dark it was. There were things in this one that I thought I would never see in a Star Wars movie. This was the Star Wars to cap all of them and if there were another one to be made it'll probably ruin the franchise. Lucas did well with this one.
583,3,George Lucas has officially moved to the dark side,"*Might contain some very mild spoilers* Attention all viewers: George Lucas has officially moved to the dark side. With a budget (and income at the box office) that could feed a whole African country for three years, Episode III of one of the most popular sagas ever created is nothing more than a Playstation/XboX game with some nice special effects, but with no story at all. Remember what was so great about the original trilogy? The adventure, the humor, the suspense? I didn't spot one joke in the whole film, except when, after more than 20 years of serving the good side, Anakin Skywalker decides to move to the dark side after having one single nightmare. Have you ever wondered why Darth Vader is called that way, or how Luke and Leia got their names? Again, don't expect any thoughtful insights, and beware one of the most ridiculous and shallow dialouges ever written. There is no team work as well. R2D2 and 3PO aren't doing much, Samuel L. Jackson and Liam Neeson are serving as statistics, Padmé (the beautiful Natalie Portman) has four lines in the whole film, and most of the time is waiting in front of the window for Anakin to come back home. And we miss so much the charisma and energy of Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. I must say that even if the three new prequels were well written and creatively done I would have preferred to hold on with the mystery, but sadly, it is not the case here, and this film, as its precedes, is long, tedious, and bad."
584,6,The Force was not really in it..,"This film is a must see, simply because it is the link in the saga, but that is about where it ends."
585,9,Best of the 3 prequels,Following review does contain spoiler
586,4,Trying too hard - 2 hours wasted,"Hadn't got around to watching this after the disappointments of the first two, but last night I had some free time so decided to give it a try."
587,8,nice,"The end of an era, watching a person's irreversible end to a long-known ending, there is a sense of fatal sadness."
588,2,Magic is lost forever.,"Well, I considered my self a big fan of Star Wars movies. Not any more. The reason? George Lucas never realized that the project was beyond his capability of writing and directing. He turn off a magic dream into a nightmare. I agree with many reviewers about: 1) The love story was awful. I think Lucas has never loved a girl. I believe that he adopted his children and that his marriage is faked. 2) The dialog is extremely poor. Even me as a no native English spoken, I have more options to express my ideas. 3) All the plot was rushed on the final 15 minutes."
589,3,"I know everything about Star Wars, and I was totally confused.","OK, first off, Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor were fantastic. They did a splendid job of having vulnerability and strength and created an interesting subtext to the full. Just about everything else totally sucked BIG."
590,10,Makes it worthwhile to watch Episodes 1 and 2!!!!,"This movie was well worth the wait! I just returned home from the midnight showing at one of the theaters here in Chattanooga. I must say that I was anxious to see how Anakin became Darth Vader. No spoilers here, but I feel that every question I ever had about the origins of Darth, the emperor, the mother of Luke & Laura, etc, have been answered. The special effects are outright phenomenal, if not dizzying in some scenes. The sound is superb, and the story has more depth than episodes 1 and 2. Lucas really should have gotten a woman or gay man to write the tender moments between Padme and Anakin, but still, if you like the love-story aspect, there's stuff in there for you, also. The first Star Wars movie I saw was ""Return of the Jedi,"" since I was only 3 when Episode IV came out, and 7 when Episode V came out. So, I was too young, and wasn't familiar with it. So, I essentially missed out on the original trilogy and making it part of my childhood. However, watching this trilogy has closed any gaps, and now, these six movies are really something to cherish. I loved ""Titanic,"" but I think this movie is good enough to get enough repeat business, it could become the #1 box-office champ for the U.S. May the force be with Episode III!"
591,3,lame..lamer...lamest!,"OK I went to see EP1-LAME. I controlled my skepticism and went out to see EP2- LAMER! And I just today saw EP3. LAMEST of the whole SW world! Geez, You'd think that after 5 films and almost 30 years, Lucas would have had a good story to tell, but alas, that wasn't the case. Ep1 and Ep2 had plenty of room to start drawing threads together enough to have made Ep3 a truly awesome film, but instead, Lucas chose to end the entire SW universe not with a spectacular wave of great acting, deep heartfelt emotion, and great story telling, but instead with an embarrassing and really smelly fart. A one-hundred and forty minute fart at that."
592,1,Worst film of the year!!!,"If I ever see George Lucas on the street, I 'll ask him to stop writing and directing his own movies and may I please have my $10.50 back...""Hold me like you did...blah, blah, blah. How could he do this crap!!!! Stealth was far and away more superior than this head shaking embarrassment! He should be restricted on his budget, after seeing this bloated, overblown drek! The original Star Wars was amazing and to have this thing use Star Wars in it's title is an insult to anyone with an imagination. I knew I was in trouble as soon as the film opened with brain draining CGI then proceeded to embarrass several fine actors with dialog and direction from what appeared to be a 10 year-old's first big movie. ""Here kid, here's 200 million dollars, go make something loud and obnoxious"""
593,6,The best of the new bunch,"As with the previous two Star Wars, Episode III isn't as different as Lucas says it is. Sure, it's dark, but you know, it still has the same problem that Episode II does, and that's Hayden Christensen. If you didn't think that much of his mediocre acting in II, you won't mind that much here. But for those of us who see Star Wars in a different (non hardcore) way, and also enjoy movies that don't have Tie Fighters, the dry mouthed twenty something's whine will make you sad, and yet when he's got a shut mouth and staring into the camera with dark eyes, I was happy, especially by the time the suit was involved. Less lines for him would have been great, but understandably impossible. It kind of all depended on what his lines were and who he was on the screen with. Sometimes he was alright, when being talked to like a young child that he was acting like, not the next chosen one guy. For him, less would have been more, but that's just me. Thank god for Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan, which for the longest time has been shutting him up with the right words to make me feel just a bit better."
594,8,Great. Really,"The Chancellor (McDiarmid) fights the Jedi over control of the Republic and enlists the aid of Anakin (Christensen) Skywalker, the future Darth Vader. "
595,8,"Star Wars has come full circle, and its done it with style!","So, at 3 in the morning on the 19th of May 2005 I emerge from the cinema in Portsmouth and have finally, after waiting 6 years, seen Star Wars: Episode III."
596,7,What a disappointment.,"From the very beginning with its inexplicable space battle through numerous plot twists that didn't seem to mean anything to the seemingly rushed conclusion, this long awaited final episode in the legendary Star Wars saga was just a tad disappointing."
597,10,Enjoy!,"Man, I don't believe how many people bashes movies of this kind. You don't like it, worse for you. The rest of the world had a great time watching this movie. Never thought that maybe you are missing something? That the whole rest of the world loved it? Maybe we are all crazy or we are all stupid or dummies. But I don't think so. This movie is Entertainment in all its glory. Who gives a damn about the cheesy script? Hell, if I want to watch a ""serious"" movie, I won't go for George Lucas! On the other hand, the ""purists"" that say that the first trilogy was better and this one sucks: get a life. Don't take it too serious. Maybe you loved the first one more because you were younger! I was 9 when the original Star Wars hit the cinemas. Now I'm 34 and I still enjoy this movies like if I was 9. The trick is to KNOW what to expect from them."
598,2,What were other people watching?!,"Dreadful acting, dreadful dialogue, dreadful set design/special effects. That's all just in and around the dreadful scene in the elevator. Was this film made to look cheap on purpose? I feel like people are watching Star Wars movies through blindfolds ....that's the only explanation for their high ratings"
599,3,Even Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett couldn't save this one,"For those Star Wars fans who don't know who Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett are, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Lawrence Kasdan was the screenplay writer who helped edit out most of Lucas's God awful dialog and Leigh Brackett, was the one who wrote the original screenplay Empire Strikes Back. Maybe they deserve more credit for making Star Wars the success that it is because, without them the franchise just sucks."
600,9,I love this film.,The best saber fights. The best space battles.
601,9,Dark Heaven!,"""Star Wars Episode 3- Revenge of the Rich"" is based on how movie stars are striking back against the paparazzi. The film stars Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee, and Cameron Diaz. However, that is not the ""Star Wars"" episode I am going to review. Of course, the episode I am going to review is the final chapter of what is the most successful franchise in movie history- ""Star Wars: Episode 3- Revenge of the Sith"". Director George Lucas has saved the best for last! We finally learn the power of the Dark Side, which in now way is reminiscent of Halle Berry's steamy sex scene in ""Monster's Ball"". Speaking of monsters, viewers finally get the answer of the most asked question in film history- ""What makes Anakin Skywalker transmute to the Dark Side and become Darth Vader?"" I was a bit displeased with Episodes 1 & 2: ""The Phantom Menace"" & ""Attack of the Clones"", but my George I think you got it right with ""Revenge of the Sith"". It's a blockbuster movie extravaganza embodied with exceptional special effects, striking action scenes, and memorable characters. I have a ""Sith Sense"" that you will see some dead people in this episode, but I will not reveal whom. Ewan Mcgregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, and Samuel L. Jackson are more stirring here than in their trifling performances in the first 2 episodes; at least this time they do not appear to be so spaced out. However, the palpable supreme performance of Sith is Ian Mcdiarmid's brutal work as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The delightful androids of ""Star Wars"" (C3PO, R2D2,Yoda, and even Chewbacca) are also a continued bliss. It was even cool to see a Jar Jar Binks (who's real name is Mesa) appear. Do not panic! He only appears for a few seconds! I realize that too much ""Mesa"" can be annoying. Let me also point out that the biggest badass ""Greengo"" of ""Star Wars"" continues to be the little green Yoda. He rocked! However, ""Star Wars"" is still primarily Anakin Skywalker's tale. One of the greatest movie moments in history is when the Darth Vader armor is inserted on Anakin!!!!!! ""Star Wars- Episode 3: Revenge of Sith"" is interstellar cinematic heaven! ***** Excellent"
602,3,You were the chosen one!,"Dear Mr. Lucas,"
603,7,The easiest to tolerate?,"""I can't watch anymore"". I understand you, but that really refers more to the entire Prequel Trilogy. When you put a line like that in... I mean, just look at the title of Intolerable Cruelty, and the tag of The Matrix Revolutions. But yes, my summary refers to the most recent three. And it does, indeed, not take into account how frenetic this can be. There's a healthy dose of action, and some of it does work... but much is overdone. The light-saber stuff varies, but some bits, with how casual its participants are, while the intent surely was to make it look cool, it just takes away the sense of danger, and the thrill and excitement go with it. At times, the fights are done in medium shots, which doesn't help any. The battle scenes, for really the only time in any of these movies, lack any kind of sense of progression, you can never tell who's winning, and it renders them little more than visual spectacles. The effects are amazing, I do give them that. Do the cameos add, or merely detract? The dialog(though it does have moments) and acting(come on, Hayden, you're better elsewhere... so's essentially everyone else) still need work. More holes in the overall canon exist from what is seen and heard in this. This does try to, and to some extent, succeeds in, bridging the gap. The efforts do range between abruptly sudden and too slow, but the middle is reached at least for portions. It's dark in tone, and this is fairly well-achieved. My conclusion after having viewed the entire PT in succession is that Lucas started where it would have been fine to end... Phantom Menace feels classic, and to me, it scores the highest marks as far as being entertaining goes. After that, it just went further and further, and the emotion and how memorable they were declined at the same rate. I imagine few will argue that George has too many yes-men around him, or for that matter that he clearly did not have the entire series in his mind whilst working on any one of the individual films. I would like to point out that I am neither a disgruntled fan nor someone who grew up with the OT and/or experienced a lot of hype for these. The DVD has over a dozen featurettes(of varying length), trailers, TV-spots, cut out material and a commentary track. I recommend this to those who wish to take in all of the canon cinema releases. 7/10"
604,7,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Short Movie Review),Positives:<br /><br />
605,10,Underrated but awesome,So great the ending (despite the Vader part) still gets me emotional to this day and Dean mgregor is so great actually 9/10 but screw the critics
606,8,Is it better to be a Sith?,"YES! Thank you Lucas for redeeming yourself and the Star Wars franchise with this spectacular spectacle of science fiction entertainment. Oh I tried so hard to like the Phantom Menace, but it lacked the true Star Wars character I was looking for. Then came Attack of the Clones which was definitely an improvement on it's jar jar infested predecessor, but now we have Revenge of the Sith. This move towers over not only the other Star Wars films, but most films in general. It kept me enthralled and glued to the beautiful glow of the screen the entire picture. Every aspect of Star Wars has been thought out and played to the way we all envisioned Darth Vader to become. The acting in this movie is splendid, and is in my opinion Oscar worthy. Of course the action is over the top and great in all forms and the special effects again push the line forward on what we can do. I can't speak enough good things about this picture, so I will just shut up and give it an 8/10!"
607,9,Emotionally Compelling,Hello there. This movie has strong storytelling and universe building. It captures the essence of Star Wars and has some gut wrenching turns. Much better than the sequels.
608,7,"Like I and II: Good entertainment, plenty of frustration","OK, let me quickly give my credentials: Indie filmmaker, saw Star Wars at 9 and know every line and  every note of soundtrack music to all five movies. And I attended the  $250-per-ticket charity premiere of Revenge of the Sith to see it a  week early. Now that that's out of the way, let me give the biggest  complaint: Anakin's reason for turning to the dark side is wrong. All  wrong. I won't explain as those who haven't seen it will want to see it  for themselves and those who have already know why he did. The reason I  always imagined he turned is because of the ""power of the dark side,""  which he reminds us in V and VI. In Revenge, Anakin does not turn to  the dark side for power in and of itself but for an alleged power that  he needs to save Padme, and it's a power only obtainable through the  dark side. Somehow, his quest for this makes him a complete idiot: He  is easily persuaded by the Dark Lord of the Sith (who was part of  Qui-Gon's death, remember) that the Jedi, who raised Anakin like a  family, are suddenly evil and trying to take over the Republic. And a  second later, Anakin is suddenly slaughtering children, even as his own  wife is pregnant. Come on, George! ""Vader was seduced by the dark side  of the force."" Not anymore. The line should now read, ""Anakin was  easily duped by the most evil person who ever lived that someone like a  brother to him was his enemy out of the blue."" It just doesn't ring  true. After the fact, I liked Anakin's handling of Obi-Wan and Padme,  and I certainly understood his desperation to get the power he needed  to save his wife. But not at the expense of all sanity. Palpatine  subtly admits that he engineered the creation of Anakin. But why on  Tatooine? Why didn't he go and get the boy as soon as he was born? The  bottom line is he becomes Darth Vader too easily. Close but ultimately,  wrong. I completely expected during their duel, that Anakin would say  to Obi-Wan, ""You don't know the power of the dark side, Master!"" Not  only does he not say this but we NEVER see Anakin, in any of the  movies, use any of this so-called extra midi-chlorian power to do  anything but win pod races and make fruit float around. He NEVER uses  any dark side powers at all (whatever they may be). I expected  Palpatine to be giving him little tastes of power. For me, this almost  ruins the movie. We never learn who Jedi Master Sifo-Dious is, who  ordered the clone army at the time of Phantom Menace. After telling us  in 1999 that the whole Jedi disappearing when they die thing will be  completely explained, it is NEVER explained! It is alluded to in the  worst throw-away line I've ever seen in a movie: ""Oh, by the way,  Qui-Gon though dead, has figured out how not to be dead and will be  getting in touch with you while you're hiding on Tatooine."" This wasn't  the exact line but it could have been. What an outrage! And no  connection whatsoever to Anakin's ""One day I will keep people from  dying"" line. Unless that line was just a line of frustration that we  can turn to to justify his ""turn to the dark side."" He also spoke of  being frustrated that he wasn't ""all powerful."" By giving him tastes of  the dark side, including use of Force lightning, he could have shot the  lightning at Obi-Wan in their duel. Obi-Wan could have riffed Luke in  RotJ by saying, ""Anakin, there is good in you,"" since Vader said,  ""Obi-Wan once thought as you do,"" to Luke in RotJ. Does this mean they  meet again between III and IV, where Obi-Wan tries to convert him back?  Dooku is completely wasted. Padme literally does nothing but sit around  her apartment waiting for Anakin to show up so they can have expository  scenes without passion. It's embarrassing as a writer that Lucas  thought it was fine to have her sit around and do nothing until the end  of the movie. As always, Portman is amazing and, along with  Christenson, who is a good actor, rises above the material. I really  believed her heart was broken, although the script didn't give us  reason to. OK, those are the negatives and they are not dismissible by  any stretch. But like with even the worst Star Wars movie, it's still a  great piece of entertainment. Most important was what I've waited 22  years to see: The Emperor in all his naked evil once more and this does  NOT disappoint! Ian McDarmid is the best thing about the sequels, is  the true villain of the saga and a great actor. The character to me is  far more interesting than any other, and I was glad to see his sadistic  laughter as he battled the Jedi and delivered the best line of the  film: ""Unlimited power!"" I like all the actors and there was plenty of  disturbing imagery, especially of Anakin burning and defeated. Vader  screaming was memorable, as well. Of course, the action was all  awesome.  So, all in all, this movie has most of the same frustrations of the  first two prequels but because it is the story we've all waited 28  years to see, it is more interesting and unfortunately, more  disappointing. Anakin should have been 16 or so in Episode I and we  could have had the whole forbidden Slaveboy/Queen love story, THEN when  they met again in II, it would have meant more. Why did there need to  be 10 years between I and II? Just so Ani could get 10 years older?  Dammit, George, you blew it!"
609,2,What a piece of junk!,"That's right Luke, you're origins were poorly thought-out."
610,,the best of series,"a real show. heart of series. and exercise of masterpiece. impressive, powerful, magnificent. a film like a large arena in which detail is real precious. because it marks levels of a decision. and the option for an ideal. story of sacrifice, explanation for first series, with memorable scenes and new definition of Evil, it represent for me the reason to define SW as religious saga. because it reveals the old pieces who defines our civilization. because the image of basic feelings is more than bait for audience. because it is proof of genius and huge hard work. and celebration of imagination or new skin for profound and irresistible fairy tale."
611,8,Completes The Saga Well But,"Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe."
612,8,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith - A Gripping Conclusion to the Prequel Trilogy,"The Star Wars franchise has been a staple of pop culture for over four decades, and the third installment of the prequel trilogy, ""Revenge of the Sith,"" is a fitting conclusion to the story that takes place before the original Star Wars trilogy. Directed by George Lucas, the film is a high-stakes adventure that features iconic characters like Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and is full of intense action, drama, and suspense."
613,1,Senseless? Are you?,The capital letters aren't big enough to emphasise the shock and disbelief of the following sentence: HOW CAN ANYONE LIKE THIS FILM!!?
614,8,chapter 3,"of the 3 prequels,this one is the best.Anakin is now a young man,very close to the dark side.helping him to get there is supreme chancellor Palpatine(Ian Mcdiarmid)a dark lord of the sith.Mcdiarmid clearly relishes his role as he brings an intensity and believability that must be seen to be believed.this is an Oscar worthy performance.the movie does a fairly good job of tying things up,as the saga concludes.there are,a few problems with the time line,of course,but despite that,the movie works.what everybody was waiting for was the reveal of Anakin into Darth Varder,and those chilling words:""Rise Lord Vader""(Palpatine)""Yes My Master""(voice of Darth Vader)so was the last scene worth the wait?for the most part yes.it treads close to being funny,but stops just short.as for the movie itself,the best of the prequels,and closer in quality to the original trilogy. 8/10"
615,8,A flawed masterpiece,"Many have been rather unkind to George Lucas's prequel trilogy to Star Wars over the years. This film is proof even as late as 2005, that he could still muster up something great. Anakin portrayed by Hayden Christensen, while somewhat wooden, can still deliver a performance of a fallen Jedi. The story is far more fleshed out than either episodes I and II. It seems as though there was much more of a story to tell this time. Unfortunately, Episodes I and II have overshadowed Episode III, leaving many to regard this film to be just as disappointing as those were. Recommended for those who truly love Star Wars."
616,10,Merges the prequels together with the originals,Honestly revenge of the sith is Lucas finest hour. It's ashamed the audience couldn't have been more supportive and patient because God only knows what else George could have done for us if we hadn't exhausted him with endless unrealistic expectations.
617,3,Excellent FX - Awful unbelievable storytelling,"after the first episode turned out to be a kids-movie and the seconds one a love story with a not noticeable plot, the third could have been the turning point of the whole beginning of the saga. the story, based on the many secrets the episodes 4-6 created, could have been epic and dramatic. and we all have expected this, regardless the disappointments of the first two episodes."
618,2,Disappointing,I cannot believe how disappointing this movie was. For example: -Plot is completely unbelievable. There is no way someone that is Soto 'special' would slaughter a bunch of innocent kids to save his wife.
619,8,Rounding out the incredible epic,"So many obstacles and such enormous, HUGE fans to live up to. Lucas had an overpowering amount of obstacles to overcome. But in his favor he took the criticism and just continued on with his dream for the greatest science fiction epic and overall...all six films...he accomplished that and so much more. Episode III finishes off his epic and connects the old with the new. After the disastrous (my opinion) Episode II I didn't think the third installment would rectify the situation any. I had chocked the deplorable performance of Hayden Christenson in Episode II to his bad acting and criticized Lucas for casting such an important role to such a poor actor. I formally retract that statement. Apparently I should blame Lucas for Episode II because Christenson redeems himself for Revenge of The Sith."
620,10,Epic,"Masterpiece. This is what good star wars feels like. Especially the last hour is pure gold. You can't get bored, not even for a second. Anakin is at his best. The last scene with the binary sunset warms my heart every time. In the end, star wars is all about hope. And of course John Williams' music enriches the film."
621,4,"It' Crap Guys, I know ya wanna love it - but it's Crap !!!","First the qualifications - I am a 40 year old male, saw Star Wars on the big screen first time out, paid twice (when it was big bucks) to see Empire and queued around the block for several hours to see the opening of Jedi in Newcastle. Since that time I have bought the films that comprise the original trilogy in three formats and watch a combined more than 250 times. . Yes, like you I wanted to love Revenge of the Sith, but like the little guy pointing up at the emperor, I have to tell you HE HAS NO CLOTHES ON!!! This is crap !!! First the plot, and there is simply loads of it. It spills out from every orifice, but so loosely strung together to be delivered like a producer pitching a storyboard to suited execs. He doesn't care if they believe it, he just wants the money - and so did George. Next - Hayden Christensen can't act - I know. We know. But George clearly doesn't, so it's time for y'all to form on of those intraweb campaign things and tell him. That way, the greatest atrocity since the election of one George W. is never foisted on the world again. Speaking of acting or lack of - Da Princess? Err..she's got no balls - and (I know girls ain't supposed to), but there is no conceivable way this Prada-shop-alike, could give birth to the sassy, bad attitude, nut cruncher that her alleged daughter Leia became and was loved for. I quote ""lets go to Nabboo to decorate the baby's room...."" What! And then change the course of intergalactic history for a follow up? Stay at home with the wet nurse Natalie, your light-sabre days were over before they began. Palpatine - sorry old, ""very old"" man, but we guessed the big reveal in Episode one, and being made to wait until E-III didn't make it any more exciting. Darth Grievious - So what? clumsy? Sorry, guys with asthma, don't threaten Jedi, they just cough a lot! One more in an alarmingly long line of vacuous, excessive characters who appear only to be slaughtered without reasonable explanation or development. No sooner had GL learned to kill off Ja-Ja that we get this Disney throwback. The biggest mistake you ever made George was the killing of the only credible villain you created in the prequel series - Darth Maul  dark, edgy and entirely believable. Even if he woke up in the shower and realised being hot-sliced was all a dream, I could have stomached the return of the Horny one far more easily than the bumbling fools, served up to take over the universe? Speaking of Disney, what about the Looney Tunes robot voices? Dangerous - you bet, laughing hurts if you do it too much? Threatening, err...not! Robots, so effete, no one would be cruel enough to send one into a war zone in case they got hurt. This movie has massive issues, the plot has to be storytold by the cast constantly. Drama lifted directly from the daytime soaps carried by foreign language cable channels mixed with the political intrigue of Watergate. George completely misunderstands the very children's demographic he was aiming for. If you want to make a kids movie, you first make a nasty adult one, and pull the camera before the censors do. Kids love the stuff we tell them they shouldn't, which is why Lord of Rings was such a success. Rich and faithful to the reality of the unreal. ""Order 66"" - big build up, big let down, because it all comes to quickly -Mrs. Lucas, is this one of George's common faults? Too many characters and far too many sets and locations. Take Wookieworld, how many minutes did we have left to wander around, yet Chewie's are central to the story. Leading actors have been stored up for walk-on, walk-off babble that just cannot live up to the billing - Samuel L. Jackson and Jimmy Smits are wasted, to say nothing of the palpably bored McGregor. Judged by the production, George's writing is all over the place. The film jolts along at an inconsistent pace, suddenly retreating to collect threads of forgotten story lines that fell off when it hit the bumps. This is was two hour industry commercial for the creative potential of Lucasfilm and ILM. I quote Obi Wan directly ""I can't watch any more!"" It desperately lacks a script of any merit, and all along just begs the question - how much would it have cost for Lawrence Kasdan to have saved this? Sith has been handicapped by the very production process should have been it's trademark. So much is done in the green room stages that the acting is pared down because the reference points have to be separately generated in CGI. The timing is awful, the dialogue blunt and clumsy. And, speaking of CGI, Sith is still trumped by being released between a string of Peter Stevens marvels LOTR and Kong. Sorry George, but you just didn't cut it with this one. Spectacular bad timing."
622,9,well done and somewhat depressing,"Tis a sad tale of betrayal, the fall of a hero and perhaps the strongest entry into the Star Wars mythos, to date. Well acted with state of the art visuals, this is one handsomely mounted production. I felt bad for the little kids, who came in expecting happy endings. They were instead treated to Tragedy 101. "
623,8,The origins of Darth Vader revealed!,"Now that the final(?) Star Wars film has been released, the gap between the two hit trilogies has been filled. Of the 3 prequels, this is the most important, and the best as well. I really don't doubt that Fox will release a 6 DVD collection, and that fans will be happy to finally get a chance to view all the films of the saga in order. But now that any person has the chance to do this, I wouldn't recommend, not for a single second, that someone should be introduced to the Star Wars films by viewing episodes in order of I-VI. If the new, not-nearly-as-good trilogy has taught me anything, it's that it's essential to be viewed after seeing the originals. Of course, no one has this problem yet, as most people have already seen the 1977-1983 trilogy first, anyway. But surely any fan who someday has kids and wants to show them these movies will have a hard time getting them to warm to the droning dialogue of the 1999-2005 series."
624,1,What did this film have to offer??,I've watched Phantom Menace and thought it was a boring movie but it had things I haven't seen before in the Star Wars universe. As for how the Jedi were while in power. How the government ran. And an unbelievable light saber battle at the end. This film was slow but watchable IMO.
625,4,Clones was way better than Ep 3,"while better than episode 1, this movie still sucked, way to much cgi in the opening battle and more new stupid robots and droids, sure it had a darker tone than the others but the writing was pretty bad."
626,8,Undoubtedly the best of the new trilogy,"OK, first, I have to say I'm not a Star Wars fan. I got a kick out of the original trilogy as a kid, but since then I watched a couple of the original films maybe once more. Episode one I hated. It was boring and pompous, and wholly unexciting. Episode 2 was slightly better, but still, I found it pointless, as nothing really interesting happened. I was just about to write off Lucas as a hack. Enter Episode 3. Here we get all the goodies that Lucas denied us in the previous two films. If in Episodes 1 & 2 the feeling was he had been holding back, this time Lucas unleashes his imagination and lets it roam wildly. Needless to say, the visuals are stunning. CGI has never looked this good. The action and fight sequences almost consistently take your breath away. Apart for a few scenes in the beginning involving Anakin & Amidala (which unfortunately have some of the corniest dialogue I heard), the rest of the scenes are well-written and engaging. I was happy to see the acting has improved greatly since the last time around. This time we don't get the feeling the actors are reciting the lines. We actually get to see some emotion! And as the film progresses, the emotions get more intense, and the tension rises. Hayden Christensen does a wonderful job, and his performance becomes more powerful the darker he becomes. The only weak link, acting-wise, is Ian McDiarmid, whose performance as Palpatine is sometimes ridiculously over the top. Another of the film's strongest points is the intelligence of the script, which presents us with a dilemma about the nature of evil. We are exposed to several definitions of the differences between the Force and the Sith, and what makes a Jedi dark, and to be honest I found myself more than once empathizing with the dark side. The Force is presented as something cold and detached, while the Dark Side is dark because it's driven by the passions and weaknesses that makes us human. Going to the film, I had a lot of doubts, but soon after I was swept up in the excitement. I think I'm starting to get what all the fans are fussing about."
627,7,an entertaining and fulfilling roller-coaster ride down nostalgia lane,"I've just seen the film at a digital night screening, and I must say: even though the film is still flawed, it's not the ""revenge of the S-H-I-T"" I thought it was going to be. It's by far Lucas's best attempt to recapture the magic that made so many people across the world love the original Star Wars saga."
628,8,It's a good movie,"The first prequel, The Phantom Menace, was a dull and boring movie with a few good parts. The second one, Attack of the Clones, was an improvement, but not as good as the original trilogy movies. The third prequel, the movie I'm reviewing, Revenge of the Sith, is the best of the three sequels and is a very good movie. It's got action, drama, and it's just a good, fun movie."
629,9,Episode III: The Best One,"For me and many other kids born past 2000, the prequels were my first exposure to the Star Wars franchise. For this reason, I have a lot of nostalgia for all of the prequels, but it's not like I didn't see the original trilogy. Believe me, I'm well aware that A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back are far better than Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Nostalgia isn't the issue here."
630,5,Feature length toy advert,"Whilst this is reasonably absorbing while it runs, in point of fact it consists of conversations full of phrases along the lines of ""the force is strong in him"", ""you must never underestimate the power of the dark side"", ""they will join with the force"", etc etc etc etc, with long fight scenes at intervals. These often though not always involve robots or partial robots (that is with some organic components, such as General Grivas), and also often involve the light sabres. Sadly this looks less like an honest intellectual endeavour, and more like an effort to make the most of the toy franchise."
631,1,Marcia Lucas You are our only hope!,It has been said that George Lucas can't do dialogue or write a logical rational script. This movie proves it.
632,2,Waste of money...,"and I borrowed it off someone. Trite dialogue, appalling special effects and terrible action scenes, this film was only held together by some decent acting from Ewan McGregor et Al, but to hear them spout the utter rubbish that George Lucas writes as a script is embarrassing."
633,6,Computer Graphics Kill This Film,"As the Clone Wars near an end, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious steps out of the shadows, at which time Anakin succumbs to his emotions, becoming Darth Vader and putting his relationships with Obi-Wan and Padme at risk."
634,10,Much better than I thought - some bits niggled....,"I rated this 10 - assume I thought it is excellent, and take these niggles with a pinch of salt. I don't approve of mad fan-boy comments."
635,9,The best in the prequel trilogy.....the second best of all six films....,"After almost 30 years, the Star Wars saga is finally done. I for one, am sad to see this film series go. For me, these were more than films, these were a cultural impact while I was growing up, and bring back many memories of my childhood. With that said, ""Revenge of the Sith"" goes out with a huge bang, and brilliantly sets the stage for the original trilogy filmed a long time ago."
636,10,Best Movie Of All Time and Best Of Prequels,"Watched my favorite sci-fi Movie of All time so I decided to watch Star Wars:Revenge Of The Sith which in My opinion is not only the greatest Sci Fi Movie of All Time and All Time. The Greatest Movie of All time. The Cast Was Stellar With Ewan McGregor(The Island) as Obi Wan Kenobi, Hayden Christensen(Jumper) as Anakin Skywalker,Natalie Portman(V For Vendetta) as The Lovely Padme Amidala, Matthew Wood(Instant Zoom) as General Grevious,Samuel L. Jackson(Die Hard With a Vengeance) as Mace Windu ,Sir Christopher Lee(Lord Of The Rings) as Count Dooku, Temuera Morrison(One We Were Warriors) as Commander Cody, Jimmy Smits(Sons Of Anarchy) as Bail Organa,Frank Oz(The Muppet Movie) as Master Yoda and Ian McDarimid(Sleepy Hallow) as Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious. The Film is Great has one of the best intros with The Battle Of Coruscant."
637,2,I wish I was shot in a war,"Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith. It seemed like the greatest movie through the incredible trailer. I attend a 9 o'clock show and fell asleep right in the theater, even after drinking about 10 Cokes at my friend's house, along with a box of Sno-Caps. It was like watching C-Span for two and a half hours. It kept switching back and forth from a good 5-minute battle to a 30-minute discussion with Samuel L. Jackson on Palpatine's plan to overthrow the Counsel. I wanted to go into the movie screen, grab Anakin's light saber, and kill myself. THe only good thing in the movie was Yoda's battle, it was like watching Kermit the Frog beat the s*** out of the puppeteers controlling him. Star Wars is a stinker, go see The Longest Yard or Kicking and Screaming, if you prefer ESPN to CNN."
638,3,The Most Boring of the Star Wars movies,"I just went to see this piece of crap of a movie. Basically, its a story of how Anakin Skywalker went to the ""Dark Side"" of the force. Something that could have been summed up in one paragraph of dialog in any of the other Star Wars episodes. The Battles throughout the movie were very ""70'ish"" and lacked any of the eye popping, jaw dropping capabilities of CGI available to filmmakers today. I wont point out any one in particular but just say ""The Actors"" appeared bored with the script. They put nothing into it. The words just came out like they were reading the script as they went along. Maybe this movie should have been called ""Attack of the Acting Drones"". This is a ""War"" movie, plain and simple. There was no need to throw in all the mush romantic dialog. We see that Anakin got his woman pregnant and gave up being a good Jedi Knight for her. Bull. The fact is that most of the script revolves around Anakins ""Wanting More"", something not good for a Jedi Knight and a ""Sure Path to the Dark Side of the Force"". He wants to control death, have the ability to bring the dead back to life or some such, he wants to be a Jedi Master. He wants too much. (Of course I suppose thats also why he wants to control the Empire as well, cause he's a ""Jedi in Need"".) Personally I fell asleep 3 times as the movie is extremely slow throughout. There are moments of excitement, but thats about it, a few moments. Boring movie, lousy uninspired writing, goofy romantic story, and 5 seconds of Jar Jar Binks, thats the only redeeming quality of this 3 star trash pic."
639,2,Boring Excessive Special Effects + Weak Story = BIG LETDOWN,"As real STAR WARS fans, we never see STAR WARS movies anywhere except at Washington, DC's wonderful UPTOWN THEATRE --- our city's last big stand-alone theater with its huge curved screen and $20,000 stereo. That's where we saw the first STAR WARS 9 times, and every subsequent STAR WARS film since. The first 3 films all would rate 10 out 0f 10 for me, and after 20 years when Phantom Menace came out I'd rate that one at 8 or 9. Then the series bottomed out with the utterly useless Episode II wherein we were supposed to believe that Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman were ""in love"" --- perhaps the hottest couple since ICE AGE they were so flat as lovers they exceeded even Natalie Wood and Richard Beemer in West Side Story in the indifference department. The one redeeming quality of SITH was it wasn't as pointless and stupid as Episode II. George Lucas can be declared useless as a film director now that he's stated he needs to juice-up his special effects. Good grief, George, what this movie needed was a storyline and character development, and the kind of camaraderie that made the first three films great. Special effects, like alcohol, can be overdone. Boo, hiss!"
640,10,Awesome film,"I am not going to spoil the fun for anyone who has not seen this film yet, but let me just say I have loved Star Wars since 1977 (when I was five years old) and I was a little disappointed with the first two prequels (although I think Attack of the Clones was not as bad as most people think). Anyways, all I am saying is that I saw 'Revenge of the Sith' twice in the theater and I loved it. Even my wife (who is NOT at all a Star Wars fan) loved this one! Lucas has finally delivered the goods this time and has connected this with episode 4 very well! "
641,1,Possibly one of the worst trilogy's awful and horrible of film,"Where should i begin? I am a fan of Star Wars since my childhood. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope(1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) were one of the best movies ever made of the trilogy and created. I watched every singly movie they were the best. Mark Hamill,Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher were terrific whole three movies are awesome, the best. But now The Prequel trilogy awful horrible. I am giving this episode 1.star and that is all. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) was start one of the worst and boring movies i have ever seen. I seen bad movies but this one was the worst. First from the beginning was the movie completely boring and dull seriously. Jar Jar Binks whoever played that character look like a cartoon moron seen on screen,he looked really ridiculous. No wonder that actor who played him did had a small part and possibly two or three lines in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and in this movie he barely appeared without any word, no one explained what happened to him because he was so unpopular. In Star Wars I the only thing i thought was really great to watch was Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala / Padmé she was really beautiful and great chick she gave it a wonderful performance and i had a crush on her than is Darth Maul played by Ray Park and of course Peter Serafinowicz wonderful outstanding performance .Than the fight with Liam Neeson,Ewan McGregor and Ray Park as Darth Maul was wonderful.The only thing in the movie that was dull was the story and it was lacking,too boring and too long movie it could have been better. I gave the first movie 3.stars for horrible performance and lacking of the story. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were possibly as best as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi."
642,3,"Extremely disappointing, but what should be expected from Lord Lucas","I could start out by comparing this, and the other 2 previous films, for that matter, to Episodes 4 and 5 (I don't count Episode 6, because Lucas lost me there when he had little teddy bears beating stormtroopers!!), but what is the point. Lucas got lucky with 4 and other people directed and wrote the script for 5 (Hmmmmm... why is that one considered the best?!!!) As for ""Revenge of the Sith"", Lucas has, for me, destroyed one of the greatest and most intriguing characters I have ever seen in cinema. I am referring to, of course, Darth Vader. Or, as he should be known, ""Bi**h Vader"". In case you are wondering, yes, that is the slang word for a female dog!! As I recall, Obi Won said in Episode 4, Vader ""was seduced by the Dark Side"". But when you see this film... But more than this, it is the over the top, bombastic, overly contrived story and directing that Lucas displayed in 1 and 2 that continues here. Yes, the effects are dazzling, but at times it's too much. It almost seems that throughout this trilogy Lucas is more interested with showing off than telling a good story. Effects help a good story and script. Effects do not make a movie! And as for the script, again, Lucas caught lightning in a bottle with 4, because at times I had to keep from laughing out loud! I mean too loud! Once again, with the exception of Ian McDiarmid, Lucas manages to direct the actors to boredom!! Hayden Christensen is an absolute joke, whining and pouting, his head turned down trying to evoke some kind of transformation, or something. And, yes, I could do better!! But, I am not really angry about what George has done, but rather resigned to the fact that this movie represents what Hollywood has become. All show and NO substance. I keep hearing people say, if you don't compare it to 4, 5 or 6, it's a good movie. Have our standards dropped so low? This movie being the best of the first 3 is not saying much! But, it is Sir Lucas' toy. It just makes me sad. I remember the joy and astonishment when I first saw the universe he created in 1977. Once again, the pure products of America go crazy!! By the way, if you want to see an example of REAL cinema, check out the Japanese science-fiction epic ""Casshern"". Story (thought provoking), script, acting, music, directing (extremely imaginative), action, and more effects than anyone can ask for, are all there. No wonder Hollywood is remaking so many Asian films. Sad..........."
643,4,Lucas has done it again folks!!!!!!!!,"To preface this little review, I used to be up until a day or so ago a firm believer in George Lucas, not only his movie making ability, but also his ability to redeem what has been an abysmal trilogy. I used to be one of those fan boys who just couldn't admit that anything was wrong with the prequels, I remember walking out of episode one thinking that it was a great flick, but have over time become aware that the prequels have been nothing but a total letdown... But to be honest I was really looking forward to seeing Episode Three, not only because I had read that a lot of you out there actually thought this movie was good, not only that but it made up for the first two prequels, and even eclipsed a few of the originals. A day after seeing Episode Three the only thing i can say is that George Lucas fumbled the ball, and let not only the star wars crowd down, but the movie watching public in general. It was sloppy, forced, and the acting apart from McDiarmid, and McGreggor was just lousy. What I thought was going to be an explanation of how Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side, became an almost agonizing countdown to the credits. Now before I bash the whole movie to pieces, I will say that there were some parts of the movie I thought were great. The special affects, as always were great, the as said before there were a couple of good performances, and thats about it. Now for the bad, my first real gripe with this movie is how awful, and stilted the acting was. Portman, Christiansin, Christopher Lee, those annoying Neimoidians and even the baddest man on the planet Sam Jackson sounded like amateurs. this is surprising to me, because even the worst one of them all Hayden Christiansin isn't that bad of an actor. I blame this mostly on Lucas' inability to write believable, and even tolerable dialog at all. Even the original Star Wars movies had the same problem, but the actors pulled it off. This wouldn't be a problem if it was only a small fraction of the movie, but for every cool, or good line, the audience had to sit through a bunch of crap that just pulled the viewer out. My main gripe in this is the Anakin/Padme love story, and the hideous ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"" that Vader utters near the end of the picture. Whether or not that was a homage to Frankenstein or not, that is something that should have never made it into the flick. And what the heck was with Vaders voice when he got into the suit. Props to Lucas for bringing back James Earl Jones, but why all the enunciation, did Vader develop an accent a few years after he got the suit?? Another problem I had is that throughout both of the trilogies, viewers are told what great warriors Jedi are, how all powerful they are, and how their use of the force helps them to sense things before they happen. If this is the case then why is it that after Palpatine passes his law, something 66, are the Jedi so easily dispatched. I can understand the little Padawan's being slaughtered, but Ki Adi Mundi getting shot by clones without even a fight at all....thats just weak. The Jedi Purge is something that I thought would make this movie great, instead its just a five minute montage of the so-called greatest warriors in the universe getting pounded like Peter McNeely. My last huge problem is...Grievous. Why they even created him in the first place I cant figure out. He didn't do anything except cough, and spout out cheesy one liners for his short stint in the movie, and then even though he's slaughtered countless Jedi, and has been semi-trained in Jedi Fighting styles by Count Dooku, is man handled by obi wan, like any of the other machines. Even his body guards gave obi wan a better fight then grievous did. This was very disappointing to me, only because I was a big fan of the clone wars cartoon, and that made grievous look like a total bad a$$. Another problem i had with grievous is the abysmal voice acting of whatever hobo they pulled off of the street to to the voice work. At one point Lucas had Gary Oldman on to do his voice...what was Lucas thinking. One other small knit pick, Why was Chewbacca even in the movie, matter of fact why was that whole Wookie battle in it, it served no purpose other that to make fan-boys soil themselves. I know this is going to just pi$$ off every star wars fan that frequents this site. But to all of you fan-boys I pose one question. If its possible for you, go see the movie and just treat it like any other movie. If it didn't have the words Star Wars in the title would any of you even like it?? To me this is just another missed opportunity for Mr. Lucas, and quite frankly proof that good old George is becoming nothing less than a self absorbed HACK. I love the original Star Wars just as much as any fan boy out there...i used to be one of you guys!!! But after last night, and after Lord of the Rings Star Wars, just doesn't stack up. And if George is reading this.... Mr. Lucas read a book, or better yet watch a Quentin Tarantino movie, maybe that will help you to write dialog...and for anyone who still hasn't seen this piece of garbage, wait for the DVD, or better yet that special, special edition of the prequels that Lucas will no doubt give us to squeeze the piggy bank. So...to close out props to Ewan McGreggor, Ian McDiarmid, and the people at ILM, besides that for shame George."
644,7,Lucas Finally Gets it Right,"After stumbling with two bad prequel films, Lucas returned to form with ""Revenge of the Sith"" - an operatic tale of an innocent man's corruption that lives up to the spirit of the original trilogy while telling a gripping story in its own right. This isn't just the best prequel film, it's also one of the best ""Star Wars"" films. It's by no means as good as the 1977 original or ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" two of the greatest movies of all time. But ROTS is better than ""The Force Awakens,"" ""The Last Jedi,"" and even ""Return of the Jedi."""
645,5,Hayden still can't act,"I don't know if it was all the hype that had built up over the last two years or if it was simply my own anticipation for this final movie, but Revenge of the Sith did not deliver. I am saddened to report that all prequels for the Star Wars movies have fallen short of my expectations. Poor acting by Hayden Christianson and Natalie Portman, weak dialog, and spectacular special effects did not add up to make a great movie. There are a few strong points to the movie, mostly having to do with the comedy from R2D2, however in general this movie falls short of the limelight it has created..."
646,8,This latest Star Wars film is Better than Some of the Sequels and Prequels.,"The Galaxy, it is at War! When General Grievous (Voiced by Matthew Wood) is planning to destroy the capital planet of Coruscant and Kill the Supereme Chancelor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Obi Wan Kenboi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywlaker (Hayden Christensen) are sent to stop General Grievous and find the mysterious Darth Sith, the dark side of the force. When Anakin finds out that his secret wife Padmé (Natalie Portman) is pregnant. When the Chancelor Palpatine offers Anakin to be a Jedi Master and also to be in the Jedi Concuil. When the Other Jedis are curious about the Chancelor Palpatine new plans, they send Anakin as a Spy to look what is Chancelor Palpatine up to. But Anakin discovers a dark secret about Chancelor Palpatine, who he really is."
647,4,Noooooooooooooooo!!!!,"Disappointment, that's the word that fits best to what I felt when watching Episode III. Reasons? there are lots, beginning with dozens of movie ""references"" (from Titanic to Frankenstein passing through Bram Stoker's Dracula or Aliens...to name just a few), cheesy acting, poor script and last but not least PAINFUL Spanish dubbing..."
648,2,Thank the maker! This painful cinematic experiment is over.,"I like Star Wars--the original movies are watchable but certainly not high art. They took A movie technology to illustrate a B movie-kind of story. Mainly for kids but with some ideas and moments that adults can enjoy. Lucas had a vivid imagination--and with help/guidance from gifted artists like Ralph MacQuarrie and a competent producer like Gary Kurtz, was able to get two decent escapist movies..when Kurtz left, we got Return of the Jedi."
649,9,The best Star Wars movie,"This movie is highly underrated, it is amazing for Star Wars fans, the fights, character development and cinematography all hit the spot. Now I can understand if you don't know Star Wars well you may not like this movie but if you do, your in for a treat. This movie is a 9.5/10 and is a must watch for Star Wars fans."
650,2,mediocre,"I watched the original movie in 1977 when it came out. My kids wore the paint off the original Star Wars figures. This movie was a real letdown. The acting by Portman ( her high-water mark was ""The Professional"" ) and Christensen was wooden at best, and emotionless at worst. Lucas should have given the director job for the last two movies to someone else, as he did for 2 of the original two movies. The Jedi Knights were conveniently killed in droves when it suited that point in the movie. Only Yoda seemed to know that there was a ""tremor in the force"", and he was light-years away, while the others were shot at point blank range, some in the back...so much for Jedi powers... This just plain sucked. The first 70 minutes could have been cut. Darth Vader's near death on some sort of volcanic planet was problematic..as he burst into flames but managed to survive. If you like card-board acting and an orgy of ILM special effects this movie is for you. By the way, the birth of Luke and Leia was a virgin birth..Anakin is not the father. Didn't hear that mentioned in the movie...."
651,1,Maybe the worst movie of the year.,"Put 100 monkeys in a room with 100 typewriters and they would likely come up with a better written script than George Lucas was able to cobble together for this last (thank God!) entry in the Star Wars franchise. To make matters even worse, his directorial skills are perhaps more pathetic than his writing! My personal opinion is that no capable director that took one look at the script would ever be willing to try and direct this bomb."
652,2,George Lucas couldn't direct his way out of traffic...,"Let's face it, the reason Empire Strikes back was the best of the Star Wars was because Lucas wasn't in the director's chair. Star Wars was a trilogy, and no amount of persuasion could ever convince me that George Lucas had these last three films in mind the way they came out. They are horribly written and even more poorly directed. Hayden Christensen's acting is about as dry and bland as it can get. Granted, this was the best of the three new ones (and that's not saying much), I was seriously upset after I walked out of the theatre."
653,3,Cinematic Garbage,"Before I begin this review I will point out I am a fan of science fiction and have been since I was a kid; I'm not a huge Star Wars devotee but I do really enjoy Episodes IV-VI. Despite some flaws with dialogue, they are hugely entertaining, genre-defining classics."
654,10,"I could point out a few plot foibles, but, basically a BIG thumbs up!","I could point out a few plot foibles, but, basically a BIG thumbs up! Great special effects, but FAR MORE important, a cogent STORY line!!!!!! (Ridley Scott! Read 'em and WEEP!!!! Write a story, dude, if you want skittles with your beer.) I am very glad to see the STAR WARS Series go out with a BIG BANG!!!!! The plot is essentially Christian in Inspiration, but a FEW apostate malingering creep in, such as, ""only a Sith believes in absolutes""."
655,9,ONE of the best of the entire series,"First, I will tell you the one thing that is bad about this movie: The acting is rather bad. The actors are very wooden and just don't seem to mesh well. Though, I must say two things about this. First, NONE of the Star Wars movies has had great acting. And, the acting in this movie is MUCH better than ep 1 and 2. I especially enjoyed Hayen's acting AFTER he swore loyalty to Palpatine."
656,9,A Magnificent wrap-up for the Star Wars series!,"It was predictable of what would happen, but it was so well done! Lucas'last two films did not do to well for me and many other fans, but this was MAGNIGIFICENT!!! It was slow and dark...yes but that did not hold back its' triumph! The film starts off with a battle over the planet Coruscant (a planet that is one city). The clones, under Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker send a rescue mission against the droid army, to retrieve the chancellor from being captured by the ruthless Count Dooku. The two Jedi reach the ship of General Greivous, who is the leader of the Trade Federation army, and rescue the Chancellor, leaving Grevious to escape. "
657,4,Once there was a hype...,I enjoyed the old trilogy and liked the prehistory wondering how it would be realized. Disliking Part one the second aroused some expectations...
658,5,"The best of the trilogy, but still not great","This was a good end to the trilogy. I feel like Lucas kind of redeemed himself, but only because the other two aren't good. Fun action and a good ending. Other than that, It felt pretty lackluster"
659,7,It's been a long journey for Lucas and the audience,It's 1977 and I'm 15 years old when on a hot summer afternoon I ride my bike to a local theater to see the big summer smash called Star Wars and naturally there was a long line to get in. Hard to believe that 28 years later I'm still going to a movie theater to view the latest entry in this remarkable series of films and that it's taken this long to almost come full circle to where we originally started. In this film we see how young Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) save Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and bring him back to the Jedi council.
660,7,I voluntarily saw this twice,"**May contain spoilers** (forgot to add this to my last two reviews, oops) "
661,9,This is why I love Star Wars,"Reviewing Star Wars films is a rather complex issue altogether. Not only is the fanbase deeply divided, there is always someone who knows more about the lore than I do. There is a vast collection of films, video games, and television series. That being said, I believe I should briefly mention my history with the franchise."
662,8,A great movie!,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the 3rd film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and the final installment of the amazing Star Wars Saga! To start off this one was a major improvement over its predecessor, Attack of the Clones, but still there were a few problems in many of the same places that its predecessor had. First the acting, although very notably better than Episode II, still falls short of the pedigree in the others; and much of the dialogue is still pretty bad. Still minus the bad things it is a well made film and is very good. The story is a bit slow getting started, but once it gets moving it doesn't stop until the credits roll, non-stop action. One thing that should be noted is that this is probably the most action packed Star Wars film, and I must say that nearly all of the action is very engaging and exciting to watch(especially the films many lightsaber duels). The special effects as usual are top notch, and so is the production design(from the new planets, to costumes, and much more). Overall it's a great film, and the ending is a definite highlight for any Star Wars fan, it brings everything full circle."
663,9,"Please, stop bashing Lucas and enjoy the movie(s)!","I saw the movie this afternoon and, wondering what people were thinking of it, I just give a quick look at the various comments already entered on the IMDb site. I liked the movie and I am therefore glad that most comments are positive. But quite an important number of viewers apparently felt VERY dissatisfied with the movie. My own comment is as much a reaction to these negative opinions as to the movie itself."
664,3,The worst of the lot,"This has to be the worst Star Wars movie I've seen in years. I can not believe that George Lucas would actually put this on film. The characters were so predictable and the acting was poor at best. I was fortunate enough to get free tickets. I would NEVER pay for this raspberry award winner! Clone Wars was great, the next one after that was okay.... This was just a total waste of time and film. I would have had a better time seeing Rocky XII. About the only good that came out of the midnight showing was that I won a raffle prize which contained star wars cards and a figurine. Well, my recommendation if you plan on seeing this film just to watch it like some grotesque accident, don't stare, you will fall asleep. For the people that are having problems sleeping, I feel the GL has found the perfect cure. I sure could hear a lot of snoozing. Next time bring the action and scrub the crappy storyline."
665,10,my favourite of all,"14 years later and I still love this movie. Is it perfect - no, but it has something that is somewhat difficult to describe. The musical score alone is just astounding - Anakin's Betrayal, Anakin's Dark Deeds, Battle of the Heroes (see Vader study on the profound impact it can have). Then we get to some pivotal scenes - Yoda v Palpatine, Anakin v Obi-Wan (I love Ewan's portrays of Obi-W), Yoda's shock at feeling the Jedi fall (at Kashyyyk at the time). I could go on and on - 10/10 - will forever be my favourite. May the force be with you."
666,10,Star Wars comes Full Circle. Lucas is Vindicated. May the Force be with you.,"What can I say? I had not been to the cinema to see a film more than once in about a decade. I experienced this film first on my own and then the following week I took my wife and my 1 year old daughter. This film was a powerful emotional experience for me. The scenes with Anakin and Padme before he turns to the Dark side are beautiful and I was almost moved to tears on more than one occasion. Who says that Lucas is incapable of providing us with deep emotional connections? That is total rubbish. Never once during the entire LORD OF THE RING TRILOGY did I feel such deep emotions linger within me. By the third Lord of the Ring film I was bored to tears. Not so here, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the latest Star Wars series. That's not to say the previous ones were incompetent. Episode I was another great experience when I saw that in the theater about 6 years ago. It is a highly underrated film and I don't think it is a 'kids film'. The fight between Obi-Won/Qui-Jon & Darth Maul ranks among the greatest duels in cinema history in my opinion. Come on, you know I'm right!! And now, in terms of lightsaber action, Revenge of the Sith has topped all the previous films. In this great film we even feel more sympathy than we ever have for the character known as Darth Vader and it is a touch of genius the manner in which Lucas accomplishes it."
667,8,180 degrees Turnabout...or as much as one can make considering,"Hmm well, what can i say that has already not been said ? With the vast amount of hi-tech gear out there today, there is always the ever present danger of making movies, especially those of the science fiction/fantasy genre, where the characters/scenery, basically the whole film do not mesh well together. Directors become lazy, there is no real emotion between those participating in the movie and the audience is left with a hollow empty feeling *rather those with sense enough to garner what is happening* of incompletion. I'm not particularly enamored of the fact that George Lucas created far superior looking equipment/environments/visuals for this second trilogy when the first trilogy is eons behind in the fancy technical gear. I do understand that IV, V and VI were made a while back but he should not have made such obvious enhancements, which niggle me to no end considering i know how Luke Skywalker's visuals appear to the eye. Would have been better to keep things somewhat simple, but instead the film seemed cluttered, with far too many CGI happening all over the place."
668,5,Most Watchable Movie of Prequel Trigoly,".....and this is the highest praise I can think of about Episode 3. In fact it inherits most of the faults of previous two movies. ( but not all. For example no Jar Jar Binks except a few forgettable scenes and thank god no more his silly accent ) Weak scripts , terrible lines and bad acting from some of main casting goes on though. Besides there is too much CGI , enough to give you headache and although Computer Generated Image Tech advanced so far we can see its limits here. During certain times in movie you feel like you are watching an anime or something and this is disturbing. You can see forgery in these scenes obviously. More than that making some key characters as CGI just didn't work. They don't give you the edge of real actors or hand made creature designs. Give me puppets of Jim Henson Creature Shop over CGI anytime. If they did this all just we can see Yoda fight umm no I could do without that."
669,10,It's up there with the best of them!,Revenge of the Sith is now a classic piece of the saga and it 100% deserves to be recognised as one of the finest.
670,9,Breathtaking action..,"The third episode which closes the first star wars period is how it should be..marvelous..Everything here is so well built that there are moments in the movie,that make you change colours and mood so quickly,all too unexpected and swift..No doubt best visual fxs ever,best picture,and story plot.All things are unfolding in an enormous speed,young anakin chooses so fast to join the dark side,and everything turns the upside down.Disaster for everyone..Performances are quite pleasing with McGregor giving a moving and more mature acting as obi-wan,and Christensen giving a convincing performance of someone who really is confused and chooses power from love..Heyden i think will make his mark in Hollywood..MacGregor already marks with his performances.The movie is a science-fiction highlight,and proudly closes the first cycle of star wars.Loucas did it again.He knows better..This movie can only be enjoyed,And i enjoyed it..May the force be with us..just once.."
671,3,Prequels will never live up to the originals,"As far as how many reviews there are on this site for this movie I am pretty sure mine will go unnoticed, but I must say what I feel about this horrible attempt at unifying the 6 movies. Episode three had one good part and that was Yoda until the end when he just gave up. This movies blatant use of horrible cinematography, and over use of CG rockets it into the caliber of not worth seeing. Not only did this movie ruin my day(not because of sad story either). This movie has turned the Star Wars universe into something that can be underdone unlike the first movies."
672,8,Strong finish to a epic,"Completing the cycle of Star WArs films is this offering,which offers the last pieces of the puzzle that is the Skywalker family dynasty. Anakin Skywalker's tilt to the dark side,merely hinted in the first two films,becomes plainly evident as this film digs in."
673,3,insult on my intelligence,"I expected nothing (wasn't so fond of the previous two) so I came with brain on zero just hoping to enjoy the special effects or something, but this one really insults my intelligence. Even trying not to pay attention, the inconsistencies in the plot are overwhelming. "
674,5,Some good things - Some bad things to say,"My main criticism is the lack of emotional identification with the characters. One must care about the characters to care what happens to them. When Padme dies in childbirth from the lack of a will to live (because of Anakin's turn to the dark side), when Anakin gets chopped-up - these are moments that should carry some emotional impact...they do not. It is sad when the person you identify with and cheer the most is a CGI character (former puppet), Yoda. I cannot help but remember Alec Guinness doing Obi-Wan and how he held us spellbound - we really cared when he transitioned and became a part of the force. There was enough time to develop these connections, but evidently not enough directorial talent. Despite ""Revenge"" lacking any emotional connection I would still recommend that it be seen. It contains more computer animation and movement then any other movie I have ever seen. The light saber battles are at least somewhat interesting, although the Jedi seem to jump around a lot like grasshoppers. Many of the scenes are funny where humor was never intended. This last installment seemed to offer more (in the way of information) and, at the same time, less (emotional connection)than the other movies. That said, only two of the eight people I polled disliked it or had criticisms. Whadda I know."
675,,George Lucas does not know how to make movies anymore. perhaps he should buy a pig farm...,"Revenge of the Sith should have been The Godfather of the science fiction genre, a powerful human tragedy about a good man corrupted by evil. However, because of George Lucas' inability to tell a compelling story about people, Anakin Skywalker will never be the powerful tragic figure Michael Corleone still is today. It's a shame George Lucas told the stories of the prequel trilogies from a technical/historical perspective and not a human one. What made the Original Star Wars Trilogy so great was the focus on the lives of ordinary people brought together by this intergalactic war. What makes the ""Prequel"" trilogy so horrible is the focus on major historical events of the war and not the people who defined them. Throughout Sith Lucas sees the intergalactic war of the Trade Federation and the Galactic Republic as something that happened in the past and treats Anakin's story as just one of the events in history. Due to this past viewpoint and historical perspective of the story, Lucas fails to develop Anakin into a three-dimensional character I could relate to. Because the story and the characters are so one dimensional, I have no reason to care about Anakin's story or his relationships with the other characters like Papaltine, Padame, The Jedi Council or Obi Wan. When Anakin turns to the Dark Side it has no impact on me. It's just another insignificant event in the larger history of the Star Wars universe. This type of indifferent perspective is good for a history book, bad for a movie where we need to care about the characters in order to be involved with the story. There are all these great tragic stories about people affected by this intergalactic war in Sith. However, without the three-dimensional human characters to give them depth and dimension, they have no heart and no soul. Sith quickly deteriorates from a tragic movie into a poorly made series of intergalactic history channel documentary reenactments with the artificial feel of a LucasArts PC game. In just two and a half hours, the Galactic Republic falls, most of the Jedis are all killed, Anakin becomes Darth Vader, the twins are born, Padame dies of a broken heart (ridiculous) and Obi-wan and Yoda go into seclusion. Because of Lucas' obsession with only technical aspects of the film, the acting from the humans is horrible in this movie. I won't be too hard on the actors; they aren't the reason Revenge of the Sith is a disaster. That blame falls squarely on George Lucas' shoulders. He micromanaged the actors so much that they couldn't perform well. He nitpicked the way every line was said, they way every facial expression was made; the way every lightsaber stroke was slashed. Having been micromanaged myself in jobs, I can tell you no employee performs well in this type of environment. Someone needs to tell Mr. Lucas that movie projects are a collaborative effort and you have to trust your actors' ability to perform if you want them to act naturally. Due to the micromanaging, Hayden Christensen is wretched in the role of Anakin Skywalker. He says his no lines with any emotion, he has no chemistry with Ian McDarmind Ewan McGregor or Natalie Portman. His ""expressions"" of anger are sadly a laugh riot. Natalie Portman is just a nightmare as Padame Amidala. She says her lines as if she were reading them off the page. Samuel L. Jackson gives his second worst performance in a movie (see The Man for the first) as Mace Windu. He looks so stressed out in some scenes it's just troubling. Ian McDarmind hams it up as Papaltine taking the character way over the top. Ewan McGregor tries to add dimension to Obi-Wan Kenobi, but the script he's given is too puerile to work with. Jimmy Smits is the only actor to perform well in this movie. In his limited time on screen, he gives Senator Bail Organa the dimension needed to make me care about him. With the exception of Smits, everyone should just take this trilogy off the resume on the back of their headshots. It's just not their best work. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of these three disastrous prequel films is what transpired behind the camera over the past sixteen years. In his isolation, George Lucas, a once hardworking good man has become so corrupted by wealth, greed, and power (The Dark Side of Hollywood) that he no longer understands what human elements make a movie great. ROTS and the entire prequel trilogy will sadly go down in history as just another by-product of today's corrupted movie-making craft that thinks fake looking computer generated special effects are superior to compelling human storytelling and character development. Hollywood filmmakers like Lucas have become so obsessed with what computers can do that the art of movies is losing its humanity. And without a human touch, fantasy movies like ROTS just aren't realistic enough to be compelling to the audience. Some advice to the former gurus of the Science Fiction and fantasy genre such as George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, The Wachowski Brothers, and the people at Paramount who let the Star Trek collapse into a black hole: Science Fiction and fantasy are stories about PEOPLE. The primary focus of the story is the human characters relate to each other and how they live life in these strange and exotic worlds. The main point is to make a commentary our modern society and the culture of today. All those aliens on the screen and those high tech widgets are secondary to the stories about the relationships of the characters."
676,9,Lucas has his revenge,"Revenge of the Sith was worth the wait on the big screen. Although there are a few flaws with regards to dialog and pace, we finally witnessed and understood Anakin's downfall, it's just sad that my fellow Star Wars fans are still having some issues with his descent to the Dark Side."
677,9,Proves that a new Star Wars can be as good as the old.,This is the best of the new Star Wars Trilogy. It has more action packed than the previous 2. It even wraps up some stuff we'd expect in the movie.
678,9,Wow,"The Star Wars franchise has always proved to be visually stunning and Revenge of the Sith definitely keeps up this trend. However, this film has something the the previous two films did not have, an element of inner conflict, of pain, the Revenge of the Sith is a tragedy that at least starts to get back to the ways of the original trilogy."
679,2,Nobody could possibly expect it to be that bad,"All right, just returned from the cinema. Frankly, I didn't expect much of it. I went to watch it for the main reason that I've seen all SW movies around the time they came out so I wanted to watch the last one as well. But - what I didn't expect was that mind-numbing assault of unbelievably bad crap. The acting was in a galaxy far, far below any known standard, the dialogue made me grind my teeth (it was a true rival for the abysmal Blade III) and George Lucas' idea of tying up loose ends to connect EP III with IV is something very much like what a six-year old boy would think up. Every time Hayden Christensen attempted to put on an evil or angry facial expression I was forced to summon all strength not to explode with laughter. I could go on now for about an hour but I'll spare the eventual readers of this comment and myself the time. In summary, the movie was a waste of money."
680,2,Disgraceful,Lucas clearly thought he could get away with making an exceptionally awful movie by hiding the extreme lack of content behind mediocre (I'm sure he thought they were spectacular) special effects. It's so bad. So extraordinarily bad.
681,10,The Best Star Wars Episode of All,"This movie shows the reason which led Anakin to turn to the Dark Side (become Darth Vader) The movie is just perfect. It shows a lot of emotional conflict, pain, fear and manipulation. Also the battles are epic."
682,7,May the farce be with you!,"It's a good piece of entertainment (hence 7/10), and I would heartily recommend it to anyone with a couple of empty hours on a Saturday evening, but I couldn't stop thinking, 'why on Tatooine did anyone bother making these movies?'."
683,1,Didn't even have to wait in line... and -yes- it sucked real baaaad !,I really don't want to spend any time on this: this film sucked so bad that I came out thinking that I didn't get anything positive out of it.
684,10,Truly Perfect,"The character development and the connection to the original trilogy is truly wonderful, the action scenes are amazing and truly worth watching, just go and watch it."
685,1,Complete waste of money and technology,"I started out by watching the series in chronological order (of filming) and I have to say that as the movies got newer, I grew more disappointed. The original trilogy makes a real classic, and this one fails remarkably. The plot is so thin that you don't even have to watch the movie from one end to another. The excessive CGI used for the combat scenes and the chases could only draw a few yawns from me. They were mostly confusing and pointless displays of computer-generated effects. What a waste of budget. Then there is the character development. I mean, the utter lack of it. Anakin just makes rebel teenager character, his face is completely expressionless for all the feelings he should express. It doesn't even change from when he learns he'll be a father to when he plots and schemes. As for the plots and schemes, they are poorly written, and the characters are completely transparent. I couldn't believe the scene of Anakin's temptation? After it's all so clearly put out to him, he still says ""what did you say?"". What??? Are you deaf or something? He may be full of the Force, but it all seems to replace his IQ... And going over to the dark side just because a very small number of personal problems...come on, that's so overdone... There is practically no chemistry between him and Padme, it's just a bunch of completely flatly delivered lines... I suppose the point of the prequel was to explain what happens later, to fill some gaps, but this one fails in all aspects. There is no real crisis in any character's life, so where's the explanation for turning evil? Except the fact that Anakins wears a frowned expression throughout the movie you couldn't tell that he'd turn to evil... And then there's the stereotype talk about ""democracy"" and ""war"" and ""diplomacy"" and ""treason""...remind me please, but this is supposed to be a prequel to the 1977 movie, or is it just another propagandistic picture? I almost expect the words ""anti-patriotic"" and ""un-american"" being uttered! You can easily watch the original trilogy and understand all of it without these 3 movies. There's barely any story to them. They're not even eye candy. I expected much more of this movie. It has disappointed me on every level and has discredited Lucas forever. Oh yeah, one final question: Why does Annakin cross to the Dark Side?"
686,7,Still nowhere near as good as the originals,"I'm one of the original fans of this movie series. I went to Star Wars with my mother as a kid, and adored the first three with a passion that was exceeded by nothing else at the time. But then Lucas decided to make these prequels."
687,5,The Most Visually Stunning and Dramatically Powerful of all Star Wars Films!,"There's a shot halfway through Revenge of the Sith that has a disgruntled Yoda rub his forehead and sigh. While it's not a glorious battle scene (of which this film has many) its a strong image for Star Wars. One it signals a breakthrough in modern CGI film-making. Two it shows a subtextual sigh of relief from all the artists at Lucasfilm. All showing their collective talents and saying a weary goodbye to the greatest cinematic franchise of all time. The visual style of this film is flawless, gone are the rather static scenes of Phantom Menace and the overly gaudy CGI splashes of Attack of the Clones. And present is beautifully designed planets and environments and some of the most epic and awe inspiring sequences in film history. As Anakin and Obi-Wan battle it out to a truly rousing operatic track on the hellish planet Mustafar it switches(in vintage Lucas style) to Emperor Palpatine and Yoda tearing the Senate building apart in a relentlessly exciting duel. As far as action and spectacle go, you can't beat this. But the narrative and acting has been improved too. For once in the prequels we have a fully realised and dramatically engaging story. Anakin's perilous plunge to the Dark Side dealt with in an adult fashion, so no midi-chlorians and young cringeworthy cries of ""yippee!"" Just powerfully moving scenes of Jedi genocide and good become soured to bad. Some scenes show real dramatic charge and others political poignancy (""This war represents a failure to listen!"") Evreyone does there best with Lucas's notoriously strange dialogue and all do fine. But particular praise MUST be given to Ian McDiarmid's excellent performance in this film. Boasting incredible acting gravitas and finally given something to do in he prequels, he delivers his lines with relish and energy. If there's any justice he'll be clutching a golden statue next year! Only occasionally does Lucas falter with poor dialogue and slow pacing but no film is perfect. And above all Lucas triumphs so well, with this visually thrilling soap opera, that any self respecting cinema fan can't help but tingle with excitement as they see the last piece of history from that Galaxy far, far away. BY RM."
688,10,Anakin Skywalker,"I've never found episode one to be all that great, and episode two was pretty good but still doesn't live up to the original trilogy. But this one is in my opinion the second best Star Wars movie behind The Empire Strikes Back. I know there are a couple goofs, like how the Jedis Mace Windu brings with him to fight the emperor cant hold their own against him at all and die immediately; or when Darth Vader yells no in his weird voice and it ruins the sorrow of the scene. But at least there is no Jar Jar Binks like in the first two, or the Ewoks in the sixth. This is by far the most emotional and heartbreaking of them all with both Hayden Christensen & Ewen McGregor's portrayal of the characters drifting apart from each other. Anakin's path to the dark side is done well and played amazingly despite what some say about Hayden's acting. Hayden actually did an incredible job and when Anakin acts whiny, you can blame George Lucas for writing the character that way. But even then, people must realize that all the hardship Anakin went through would make life really difficult for anyone, so it's not all that surprising that he acts that way. It also makes him easy to manipulate i.e. Emperor Palpatine who used visions of Padmé dying to deceive him into obeying him and rebelling against the Jedi Order. This is of course no excuse for slaughtering the younglings or letting Mace Windu die. And by then there was nothing anybody could do, not even the two people closest to him: Padmé & Kenobi. This is a truly sad story about betrayal and corruption via manipulation making this a ten out of ten for me."
689,9,Fire Bad! Plus Padme lighting horror!,"First I must say that ""Sith"" is the best installment since ""Empire"", and that's strong praise from someone who saw ""A New Hope"" at the age of 7 at the drive-in in 1977 and who went on to essentially worship the Star Wars universe through his pre-teen years. Well done, cast and crew of ""Sith"" for making a memorable ""finale"" to Star Wars (though I'm confident this franchise will be resurrected in the next 5-10 years in some form or other). Casting was great, effects as usual were great, story was tight, and I actually cared about the characters this time around compared to the frankly tepid previous two efforts. I was so happy to see that the amazing Ewan MacGregor finally got a meaty part in these films and that he demonstrated how awesome Obi-Wan was. No one else could have prequeled Guinness, period."
690,1,Neutering Darth Vader,"I am 25 and have loved the first Star Wars trilogy since preschool. They have actually grown on me over time. I gave the prequels a chance after seeing Episode I (seven times at the theater), which I liked for the most part. I thought it (the prequels) could still be pulled off appropriately and all was not lost. After I saw Episode 2, I was a little worried, but still had hope. For some reason I imagined that Revenge of the Sith would be awesome and I was in the theater at 12:01 a.m. opening ""day"" to see the movie. "
691,,Revenge of the Sith is a surprise of a movie,"After a good thirty years, and two prequels later. George Lucas is bringing the final piece of the Star Wars saga to the fans. And after two opulent misfires, he has a lot to live up to."
692,9,And so started everything,"The Revenge of the Sith is the movie which completes the trilogy of prequels of Star Wars, storying the rise of the Empire, the transformation of Anakin to Vader and the begin of the conflict shown in the original Star Wars film and trilogy."
693,6,"Good Technology, but Character Development Doesn't Hold Up","I would give examples, but I don't believe in putting spoilers in reviews, so don't look for them here. This review gives only my personal impressions of what I saw on the screen."
694,3,Heartbreaking,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith Despite the last dying hopes of my inner ten-year-old, the final chapter in the Star Wars saga proved to be an even larger disappointment than my adult mind had realistically expected. Bad acting, a plot that seemed rushed in its effort to sew up loose ends of the overall story and even some surprisingly sub-par special effects culminate in a hastily-constructed, cut-me-a-check-so-I-can-move-on-now 'swan song' for director George Lucas."
695,8,The best of the prequels,"After a really bad Phantom Menace and a slightly above average Attack of the Clones, George Lucas finally got it right with Episode III as far as the prequels go. The first time movies were basically setup and here was the payoff. You finally got to see the epic matchup between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. You finally got to see Chancellor Palpatine become the Emperor. They were able to tie up the loose ends of how Padme died and how Luke and Leia were split up."
696,2,"She's gone from suck, to blow!","This movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long. Herein lies 1 hour and 30 minutes of some of the worst dialog I have ever had the misfortune to witness (even worse then Stargate!), 35 minutes of classic Hollywood clichés (""She's dead, Annie""... ""Nooooooooooo...!!!!"") and about 15 minutes of some reasonably sufficient fight scenes. And sadly, that is the movie summarized in one run-on sentence! So, common... I must have at least one good thing to say about the movie, right? Yep, and here it is - At least Lucas didn't use racism for character development this time (nice use of the Cali-Surfer dude in place of your traditional Japanese accent for the ""evil, money grubbing"" Ferengi-esquire leaders of the robot army, George)! It seems that George had his (ex)wife for a muse when he wrote/directed the first trilogy. I guess she was the only one gutsy enough to say ""Agh, George, that sucks."" His story arch's are some of the best in the business (hell, that's really why everyone loves Star Wars, right?). And even in this tripe, those wonderful story arch's are there, yet they are hidden behind his pubescent attempt of ""dialog"" and ""character development"". Some of the story devices he uses are quite well done (such as how Palpatine manipulates control away from the Senate ""with thunderous applause"") while other devices are worse then pitiful (such as how Palpatine manipulates ""Annie"" into being a bad guy  ""What have I done!? {agh, all well, I guess I'm evil now} I'll do anything you want me to do Sith Lord"")."
697,9,Almost perfect,"It's an amazing movie and truly sours the tragedy of Darth Vader The Manipulated, the only issue I have is that Yoda is still demolished as a character in the prequels compared to the sequels. Maybe if the time gap was bigger from the prequels to sequels and he had even some development it'd make more sense, but that's not the case. Amazing movie, not to mention Kenobi."
698,10,One of the Best of the Series,"This really is the film that ""Star Wars"" fans have been waiting for, and really writer/director George Lucas set himself an impossible task. For one thing, everyone knows how it's going to end, and there have been years of fan speculation and hype to live up to. Happily, Lucas has succeeded. This film is great and genuinely powerful as it charts the descent of Annakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) to the Dark Side of the Force and becoming Darth Vader. The film opens with a truly spectacular space battle between the Republic and a rebel droid army, which is full of the excitement and spectacle of the old ""Star Wars"" films, before the story takes a darker turn as the powerful and sinister Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) starts to gain an unhealthy influence on young Jedi Annakin. The film shows the downfall of an essentially good person. Annakin wants to do good, in particular protect his pregnant lover Padme (Natalie Portman)."
699,3,WELL....,"It's a meh, for me. AT LEAST IT'S BETTER THAN THE FIRST 2 PREQUELS"
700,9,The Best of the Prequels,"It's not perfect, but it's a really good film. By the time this movie was released, Star Wars fans were so divided that it was hard to get a level headed review out of anyone. When I initially reviewed this, I gave it a perfect 10. This film does not deserve a perfect 10, but you have to understand, I had just come off from seeing it and was so excited that I had overlooked the flaws and only reported the things I loved about this movie."
701,10,Best Star Wars film to date,"I believe this is what star wars truly is. You have great performances by Ewan Mcgregor, Hayden Christensen, etc. I do believe that the previous prequel films were not that good but I hate seeing this amazing movie being belittled by just the fact of being a prequel. Lucas could of easily just redid the elements that made the previous movies work, but no he didn't unlike what Disney did. He wanted to tell what us the story of Star wars in his vision. It wasn't about making money for him (Some of it was, but we are all motivated by greed in some way), it was about telling a convincing story of the rise of the empire and fall of the good. The Clone Wars series really made this film go from a 7 to a 10 because you create an emotional attachment to these characters and feel sad when things go dark. I love the inclusion of politics grounding it to reality. This is how empires rise, and I love it. WATCH THIS FILM, it is a must see if you are a true starwars fan."
702,1,What A Wasted Opportunity!,"Despite all the ridiculous complaining by many Star Wars fans about the previous two Star Wars films being inadequate, this is, by far, the weakest of the current trilogy series. Sure it has magnificent special effects and plenty of shocking scenes. But its all about the story, stupid! Unlike the previous two Star Wars films, which were masterpieces, this finale left me feeling empty, disappointed and a bit annoyed. Maybe the actors were exhausted by an oppressive director. Or, perhaps George Lucas is getting burned out, like his scenes in the volcano. Whatever the reason, Revenge of the Sith certainly didn't capture my imagination like previous Star Wars films did!"
703,7,Finally a good prequel,"I'll come clean - I hated Episodes I & II. So when I walked into the screening of Episode III, I wasn't expecting much except disappointment and maybe anger at Lucas."
704,5,Search your feelings. This is NOT the redemption people say it is,"If Ep1 and 2 disappointed you, then this will disappoint you only slightly less. If you think I'm being generous by using the word ""disappointing"" with regard to the Ep1 and 2, then save your money and wait for the TV premiere. The acting and dialog are still terrible. And the only way Lucas makes up for it is with more fighting. However, if you get off on space battles, saber duels and wide establishing shots of futuristic cities, then by all means, take your Vaseline and join the dark side."
705,7,"Nice wrap-up, decent story, bad acting & dialogue  but overall satisfying climax","The Clone Wars is nearing an end; the Separatists have been driven away and talk of peace is finally spreading in the Galactic Republic. But bubbling to come up underneath a bottled lid is Anakin Skywalker's own morbid ambitions, pride and disloyalty to the Jedi Council. Zooming in more than ever on his psyche, this last Star Wars installment is a much darker and more character-driven piece that explores the gloomy nature of Anakin  how far will he go to get what he wants?"
706,5,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"The final episode of both the prequels and the entire saga (28 years since the release) is the darkest of them all, from writer/director/creator George Lucas. It was also the most anticipated with the revelation of how Anakin Skywalker (Razzie winning Hayden Christensen) joined the Dark Side, and became Darth Vader. It is war, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) was kidnapped by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), and Anakin listened to the Chancellor's order to kill him, which is not the Jedi way. Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is on the search for General Grievous, the other person suspected as being the Emperor's servant. Anakin meanwhile is having complications with his wife, Padmé (Natalie Portman) who is pregnant, and eventually, as he turns, starts dying, because of his anger. He is also assigned to keep an eye and spy on Chancellor, but when he finds out he is the Emperor he does not do what Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) said and kill him, and he ends up striking him, and letting the now disfigured Emperor killing him with his lightning power. Anakin was seduced by it, and now he gives in to the Dark Side and is now named Darth Vader, and he follows all the Emperor's orders to kill all Jedi threat, even the children! Towards the end, Obi-Won discovers his turn to the Dark Side, and their light sabre fight on the volcanic planet is extraordinary, and when it is concluded Anakin is burned, and Obi-Won just leaves him. This is the pinnacle moment when (after found by the Emperor), Padmé gives birth to the twin babies, Luke and Leia, before dying from Anakin's anger, and Anakin has become Darth Vader with the mask and helmet, because he couldn't breathe properly. Also starring Jimmy Smits as Senator Bail Organa, The Muppets' Frank Oz (aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) as Yoda (now computer generated), Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. This film basically explains everything about the future and ends all questions for the original trilogy. This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story, dialogue (which is ridiculous) or 'magic' as the originals, but the special effects are never disappointing. Samuel L. Jackson was number 11, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and McGregor was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Worth watching!"
707,9,The circle is complete,"I admit, I am the heretic who likes the Prequel Trilogy, even as much as the original."
708,3,Oh the shame,"I attended the final instalment to bury this long-dead series, but I found this episode fascinating  for about 10 seconds. That would be the iconic moment when the black mask is lowered on to Anakin Skywalker's mangled face and he truly becomes Darth Vader. Unfortunately, this a movie does not make. Mostly, the entire experience left me embarrassed: embarrassed for being there in the dark, hoping against hope that I might get the rush I did when I was a kid from these movies, then realizing just how pathetic George Lucas's imagination really is; embarrassed for all the people in the theatre, who were probably in the same situation, who when it was all over were left justifying the time they wasted with comments such as: ""It was better than the first two,"" or ""A lot more lightsaber fights, eh?""; embarrassed how such an olio of awful, non-sensical science-fiction could become such a cultural touchstone; embarrassed for a fine actress such as Natalie Portman reduced to such childish, lousy material. No matter how many Closers or Garden States she does, the poor Portamn will be known the world over as the weakest female character I've seen in the movies since, well, ever. Crying, spouting Harlequin Romanceesque dialogue and dying in childbirth  not exactly the heroic type. (There really aren't any female characters in Lucas's films because the arrested development necessary for creating such dreck means few if any of the animators or computer-effects geeks have ever taken the time to talk to a live female. I just don't think that much time in the dark is good for the psyche.)"
709,10,Part three of a great fantasy series,This is the third part of my essay on the themes and motifs of Star Wars.
710,9,The most stunning Star Wars movie.,"""Revenge of the Sith"" packs a powerful impact both visually and emotionally, and is undoubtedly the most stunning of the 6 Star Wars films."
711,10,A powerful and extremely satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy,"The final film in the prequel trilogy is the best of the three, and my favourite in the saga. The special effects are superb, rendered with such a fine clarity that they do not look computer generated. I always say that the special effects and cinematography of the prequel trilogy is underrated. The story is perfect and is delivered with such a powerful emotional intensity. This was the last and final piece in the original saga, and Lucas saved the best for last. The culmination of decades of work."
712,8,The only prequel worthy of the name 'Star Wars',"Let's face it, whatever George Lucas did with the final instalment of his epic trilogy, there would be complainers. Of course, the man himself is to blame; The Phantom Menace is a horrible film, and while Attack of the Clones is a lot better than it's predecessor, it still leaves a lot to be desired when compared to the original classics. However, it's third time lucky for George as this time round he's done the fans - and himself - proud. Episode III is by far the best of the new Star Wars films, and the only one that even challenges for a place among the 'proper' movies. This is the film we've all been waiting for; the one that charts Anakin's fall from 'the chosen one' to an all powerful lord of the Sith. Before seeing the movie, like lots of fans I'm sure, I was dreading the possibility that Lucas might have messed this one up too. Of course, the story this time is much stronger and therefore harder to mess up, but the other films were giving me doubts. While I still regret the lower quality of the other two films; Lucas has redeemed himself here. THIS is Star Wars."
713,8,A worthy 'finale',"So here it is, the prequel to Star Wars, the film that features the 'death' of Anakin Skywalker and the 'birth' of Darth Vader, has George Lucas delivered?"
714,1,"Acting horrible, dialogue atrocious","I keep hoping that new three movies will be half way as decent as the originals. Well, the first three are done and boy am I glad that I won't subject myself to having to wait around to be disappointed again. I believed the reviews that said this one was good. What I want to know is, who are these people that thought this was a good movie (and gave it a 10)? Were they watching the same movie as me? Did they tune out the dialogue and not watch the wooden actors? If that's the case, then maybe I can understand their belief that it was good."
715,10,Finally a Star Wars to get excited about again.,"What an amazing film. I loved it. Definitely the best of the new trilogy and only slightly below Empire. Blew New Hope out of the water (still my least favorite of the original three...) and much better than Return of the Jedi. Think Jedi without the Ewoks, the tone of Empire and some of the endearing but terribly cheesy dialog of New Hope and you have Revenge of the Sith. And hands down, the final fight scene... BEST... LIGHTSABER FIGHT... EVER!!! Only a few real mistakes, but anyone who really gives an honest assessment of the series will see these same issues in all the films... most notably the fact that Lucas can't write a love scene or dialogue to save his life."
716,9,Probably the best so far of all the series,"To me it is like the best of the whole series, including the new one. It has pathos, mystery, it is well done.<br /><br />I like it much. Everytime I watch it."
717,9,"""Not if anything to say about it, I have""","I love it! In my opinion it is easily the greatest of the prequels. Ever single time it manages to make get emotional, I feel the hurt of all the characters and watch as the republic, a free state protected by the virtuous Jedi, is replaced by the evil empire.<br /><br />It shows the demise of the one of the greatest movie villains Darth Vader. It hurts even if in the first two movies his portrayal is sub par. Hayden Christenson stepped up his acting, not by much but it is better.<br /><br />Of all the Star Wars movies this one has the greatest and most exciting action. The battle of Corosant, Obi v Grevious, Yoda v Palpatine, and Anakin v Obi Wan. They are all entertaining, I don't care if anyone thinks they are over choreographed. The are entertaining and capture the magic of Star Wars.<br /><br />Every time it just gets better, with the addition of the clone wars and other smaller media it gives amazing context and makes the whole trilogy better. But even without it, this movie is still great.<br /><br />The story and characters do not compare to the original trilogy, but this one is far more exciting. I am not going to say it is better than the OT, but it is easily one of the best additions since then.<br /><br />None of the performances are through the roof, but Ewan McGregor, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Ian McDermid, and Samuel Jackson are all endearing characters and entertaining to watch on screen.<br /><br />In recent years this movie as gain more and more respect. It now has some of the most iconic scenes in all of Star Wars.<br /><br />The politics of all fictional world are always an element that pulls me and makes the situation be comparable to reality, though TPM may be about the taxation of trade routes this movies shows the fall of democracy and the rise of a ""fascist"" empire. And with Palpatine, an amazing villain pulling all the strings.<br /><br />Though the movie sucks it ends with hope and ends with a double sunset the perfect way that leads chronologically to the OT.<br /><br />Though I do have a few gripes with the movie they are all small compared to all the things I love.<br /><br />Anakin and Padme's dialogue with each other is in this movie better than the previous two movies, but in most scenes it still falls flat. Though the part it plays as a driving force of Anakin's fall is the falls nicely into everything Anakin has been warned about and Palpatine used it to fuel his turn.<br /><br />I do not like the excessive use of CGI clones, a bit more practicality would have been nice, though they are all supposed to look the same, it would have been hard to pull off the other way too, but they could have at least tried.<br /><br />And Chewbacca did not need to be in the movie, but that is silly and such a small insignificant nit pic.<br /><br />The Star Wars cannon still leaves open room for stories of Yoda, Obi Wan and Qui-Gon in exile, set up by this movie and leaves open how and if Palpatine had a part in Padme's death.<br /><br />This movie is great it is a toss up if I prefer it to my other favorite installments after the originals, but it is still great."
718,,'This is not the film you are looking for...!',"Of the three prequels this is, without a doubt, the most visually impressive. Like many recent fantasy films, however, it uses an abundance of (often quite obvious) CGI because it can rather than because it should. It becomes, therefore, quite exhausting to watch. The performances are, almost without exception, utterly dreadful."
719,3,My Words Waste I Will Not.,"""I'm running out of tricks here (5:50)... In the name of...(6:00)... I have a bad feeling about this (7:24)... I sense a trap... (8:14)..."" Ahhh... forget it, not even 10 minutes into a movie and nobody could put together a phrase longer than a sentence, yet. Since Mr. Lucas was taking vocabulary contraception pills, hopefully this is the last instalment of the Star Wars series. All the little magic from episode IV, V, VI is gone and ruined. Ratings like 8/10 on this site and 2 thumbs up, just doesn't make sense, and are unjust for other great movies, that are ranked behind this ...another episode of ReBoot cartoon. This movie has in places very nice futuristic background (and then again in other parts it is amateurish), also the revealing how Darth Vader got his suit is satisfactory to a sci-fi flick, and that's it. Nothing and I mean nothing else is worth to mention in this movie. 3 out of 10"
720,8,Finally... the prequel we've been waiting for,"There's no need for detail on this one... I'm sure other reviewers will provide that. Suffice to say, if you liked the original trilogy but thought Episodes 1 and 2 were self-important and awful, you're not alone. I swore I'd never see another Star Wars film after the truly abysmal Attack of the Clones. Then I got a free ticket for Episode 3."
721,6,The best of the rubbish ones,"Last in the collection of Star Wars prequels is a good film, but absolutely nothing more."
722,10,Underrated Gem,"This movie is all about what star wars truly is : emotion , lightsaber battles , music , emotion , drama , funny moments. My favourite star wars movie of all time and a gem that will never be forgotten."
723,1,A disappointing end preceded by disappointing prequels.,"I couldn't believe this movie. While the visual effects were very good and sometimes helped to add excitement - visually, at least - this was a horrible end to what could've been an amazing series. The first three made, parts 4,5, and 6, were quite good. Mostly because Lucas did not direct 5 and 6; which in my opinion were the best of the first three direction and storytelling wise. There was a key scene, which I won't spoil, that was one of the most important scenes of the entire series. That of Anakin Skywalker ""turning to the Dark Side"". Horrible. Laughable. Ridiculous excuse for a character turning evil. Parts 1 and 2, began the slow leak of air out of the Star Wars series. Part 3, sliced it completely open flattening the Star Wars legacy like a deflated tire."
724,2,basic misunderstanding of evil,"Don't see Star Wars, at least not at the theater. I'm not going to see another Star Wars film at the theater again."
725,9,Anakin and the Dark side,One of my favourite movies from the whole saga. The way Anakin turns to the Dark side is just unforgettable.
726,2,trash,"This movie is really really bad. the worst of the prequels. the dialogue might be the worst in any movie all time. i honestly couldn't believe it. the expression ""it sounds like it was written by a 12 year old"" is usually hyperbole, but in this movie it is absolutely accurate. i can't believe the actors even agreed to read these lines. and tried their best to make them sound good."
727,10,The Tragedy of Anakin Skywalker,"In an iconic franchise that has highs and lows, Revenge of the Sith stands out as one of the best films in Star Wars. While certainly not taking home the awards for best writing, it more than makes up for that with the best action, visuals and score out of the entire saga."
728,1,Lousy Movie,"The acting by Hayden Christensen was STIFF AGAIN. It isn't all his fault; the dialog was lousy. I really think that acting in front of a green screen doesn't help either, but he was awful."
729,7,The Wars To End All Wars,"And so it ends. 28 years on, Lucas finally says to the world ""There it is. That's the Legend of Star Wars. The story of the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker. An epic that spans 2 generations, star systems, love, hate, destiny, betrayal, greed, ambition and loyalty. Now leave me alone!!!"" You wonder why George wanted to do these prequels. Did he need to tell the full story he'd created? An obligation to the fans? Or maybe that they'd shut up about it. I can't help but think of Lucas as this hen-pecked father with a group of children begging for one more bedtime story before they go to sleep. The story is told but the kids aren't satisfied. That's not the way it's supposed to be. Jar Jar Binks is a silly character. You're not telling it right. Why can't the storm troopers shoot anyone? Why do we have to sit through the boring kissing bits? Tell us another one, then we'll go to sleep. What's a guy to do? If you're Lucas, with all the success and riches that your creation has brought, you can do whatever you want. So I'd like to think it's because he wanted to tell these stories that he's done so. We don't have to like it. Do we care about Anakin as a moppet? No. Do we want to see how he and Padme fell in love? No. Do we want to see Anakin's turn to the dark side? YES!!! Give it to us now!!! But Menace and Clones are important. This is EPIC film making. And epics mean having to get through some back story. We're dealing in universes here. Entire races of people. A treatise on the nature of good and evil. The preceding episodes add context. These six episodes are now Anakin's story, no-one else's. (Luke and Leia and Han have been all but reduced to supporting players) That story is also about the rise of the empire and destruction of the Jedi. To do that you have to see the Republic before hand. To jump straight to this film would have been to have tossed it out like so many cash-in prequels. We may not like them, but you can't do without them."
730,10,My actual favourite,"I'm not even Ginag lie when I say this episode is actually my favourite one. There's a lot of plot development, a bit of emotional turmoil and great fight scenes. I understand that the acting could have been better, but this episode had so much drama and plot twists. I love it."
731,10,An excellent movie,The wait is finally over and we get to see the end of the star wars saga...and in my opinion it was well worth the wait.
732,1,plan 10 from outer space,"It's a high school play on steroids. The scene-stopping dialogue makes me wonder what Ed Wood would have done with a comparable budget. I'm trying to remember the dialogue....something about ""elevator 3224"" being stuck. I think I liked the Wookies. Maybe. I even enjoyed that little Muppet guy. I remember laughing when a fellow movie-goer said, ""Sucks, this does."" Christopher Lee looked cool. But then, Christopher Lee always looks cool. This movie made me feel stupid. I feel stupid that I bothered to write these comments. I have to end on a positive note. Here it is - Gamers and third graders are going to love Star Wars episode III."
733,10,Sith Happens... Thank goodness!,"I saw this installment on opening day. It surpassed my expectations. And I believe that Mr. Lucas and company have finally gotten back ""into the zone"" with regard to acting and story. The principle characters are finally interacting with the same level of rapport and humor as the principle characters of the 1st installment (A New Hope). All of the plot points work, and he wisely decided to jettison the cutesy-pie, marketing friendly characters that diminished the appeal (from my perspective) of the previous 3 installments (Return of the Jedi, Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)."
734,10,This should have been Episode I,"I saw a sneak preview tonight (Tuesday night). The action starts right off the bat and does not stop until the very end! Lucas should have skipped Episodes I and II, and just started with this one!"
735,5,The best produced bad movie I've ever seen,There is one basic problem that shows itself with the release of every single Star Wars movie: George Lucas cannot direct human emotions.
736,7,Me'sa tinkin' dis wa'sa a guud mooveee,"First, if I see one more comment about how Lucas ruined the franchise with corny plots, bad direction, and bad acting I'm going to take a hostage."
737,10,My thoughts about the movie,"This movie was breath taking!!! I laughed with the characters, & suffered with them!!! The Star wars keep your attention from the first minute to the last!! It was great! The best moment from my point of view was a double battle in the end, where the viewer has the same emotions as Obi_Wan: either to be sorry for Skywalker, or to feel disappointed in him. & i just love Yoda: the way he thinks, talks & acts!!! He is incredible!As for the death of Padme it seems to be unclear, i mean it's understood that she has no will to live, but still... Also the motives of turning of Anakin to the dark side are very simple, but so human! frankly i expected some more unusual reasons & motivations, but these ones are really close to each of us!"
738,10,The best of the prequels. Darker. Scarier. Better.,"Now, I conclude my review of the STAR WARS prequel trilogy with EPISODE III: THE REVENGE OF THE SITH."
739,3,Well... here we go,"I'm guessing no one will read this, but I have to say my piece."
740,10,An all time favorite,"While I understand many don't like the prequels because of the poor dialogue and, at times, acting, I feel this film has less of it than the last two and brings the story of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side to a satisfying conclusion. The film is the darkest in the franchise, has many great fight scenes, Palpatine is a joy to watch, and while still having some issues with dialogue, I can't knock the film down points because I thoroughly enjoy it overall. Ewan McGregor stands out as Obi-Wan, and with so many iconic moments in the film it ranks as one of my favorite Star Wars films."
741,4,This movie was not very good,"I love Star Wars from the original 3 movies, but I won't like this one just because it has the same name. This movie(along with I & II) have a powerful legacy to follow and I was surprised at just how bad the script to this movie was. The dialogue was trite and cliché and there was little character development. In the original 3 movies, it was very easy to connect with the characters and to identify with the story simply because relating to the character's personalities was so easy. This should have been the *primary* focus in this movie. Special effects are wonderful, but they are icing on the cake and if the cake itself is ugly and no good, then the icing is suddenly very unimportant. Now I won't go as far to say this movie was ugly and no good(and maybe because I'm being nice to a degree), but the saying ""with greater power comes greater responsibility"" comes to mind. Much more should be expected of this movie because of its legacy and this movie did not deliver. I was tempted to rate it a 3, but I suppose 4 is probably more appropriate since I think I'd be letting my emotions get the better of me if I gave it a 3. I'm in awe that this movie had a user rating of 8 stars. Did we all see the same movie?"
742,7,Faust,"This is the part of the new series that Lucas was waiting to tell, and everyone else was waiting to see. Everything that precedes it is filler -- magnificent at times -- but something to keep fans in suspense and sustain the cliffhanger tragedy in the public mind. For all the lambasting Lucas receives, he is a good orchestrator of ideas, though he has lost touch with the energy and pacing of his earlier films. He has the same kind of foresight that Mephistopholes has in this play. It is a grand, but flawed vision, full of coercion for the fans through relentless persuasion in the media. "
743,3,Easily one of the worst pieces of Sci-Fi ever.,"I don't know where to start. How about quite simply I hated it. Absolutely, positively hated it. The plot was idiotic, the special effects were on fast forward and shoved down your throat, the acting was more wooden than a dime store Indian. And it committed the most cardinal sin a movie can make. It CGI'd a dead actor when a live one would do. Peter Cushing was a high point in Star Wars. In Sith he was random pixels. Come on George get an actor that looks vaguely like him that's 30 years younger than him when SW was made. Ain't that hard. The guy's on screen for only a few seconds, it would have been a nice touch."
744,10,One of my faves,"I've always admired this movie. Naturally it's the best of the prequels , but it really does a great job in telling the ark of Anakin Skywalker who is arguably the lead character in all 6 movies.<br /><br />What I love about the prequels, is the daring move to really planet build , you really get the sense of how big the galaxy is compared to the sequels which in my mind , suck !<br /><br />We love you George . The best story teller"
745,7,Getting closer to home...,"Of all three prequels under the care of George Lucas, ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is most definitely the best and it is also the one striking closest to the original trilogy."
746,5,"Dialogue, George... it's called dialogue","Question.... why does Obi Wan sound, at times, like a effete Englishman? More important question... why oh why won't Lucas let someone write the dialogue?! Third question.... did anyone else feel underwhelmed by the cheesy explosions and overall feel of the opening sequence? I LOVED Star Wars... and each film since Empire has disappointed. I will grant that Sith managed to disappoint me less than the previous 2 but it still was far short of spectacular."
747,1,"Terrible film, no passes from this moviegoer","Back when REVENGE OF THE SITH (2005) came out, because it was the ""last"" Star Wars film as far as I knew and the end of the flimsy prequel trilogy and (maybe) not as bad as Attack of the Clones, I gave it a bit of a pass for at least being mediocre and not awful. I was fully aware that Revenge of the Sith wasn't a good movie. Even back then and still to this day, I believe The Phantom Menace to be the best prequel trilogy movie. It's got the least cringe dialogue, a fast pace, a decent mixture of practical effects with CGI, and the actual best performance and character of the trilogy in Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn. Also, the innocent childhood friendship of Padme and Anakin is well done, with Natalie Portman giving her most natural performance of the trilogy. And Jake Lloyd was a better Anakin Skywalker than Hayden Christensen! Attack of the Clones is the worst Star Wars movie and probably always will be, in my opinion. Which leads to Revenge of the Sith. In retrospect, this is a very bad film and almost if not equally as bad as AOTC. And I'm at a point where I refuse to give passes to awful filmmaking, even if it is Star Wars. Bad is bad."
748,8,The best of the 1999-2005 edition,"STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH is the best of the Episode 1,2 and 3, by other words; ""the new ones"". George Lucas has achieved great and makes it all come together in a very convincing and entertaining way. Opening with a stunning opening sequence filled with action and laughs, the new Star Wars movie convinces immediately and sets off in a brilliant loop in Anakin becoming Darth Vader."
749,6,Not bad...once we actually got to the movie,I have no idea what Lucas was thinking about when he wrote this bloated mess. It seems so simple; everyone wants to see how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. So why are we watching 2 hours of Obi-Wan or Yoda chasing people around the galaxy with the requisite 15 minute long light saber battle? No one cares about any of that...just get to what the movie is actually about for God's sake.
750,10,Best Star Wars Movie,This movie is 100% a 10/10. The best part 100% was the fight between Anakin and Obi Wan. Darth Vader is the best villain ever. This movie is one of the best of all time. I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to everyone.
751,1,Epic Disappointment,"I was such a huge fan of the original trilogy, and Darth Vader in particular, that I was willing to give the prequel trilogy a pass so long as they got this movie right. Now I consider them fan fiction."
752,7,3rd best in the entire trilogy,"Finally, after 9984 days (or 27 and a half years) after A NEW HOPE opened in Switzerland, the saga is complete. Episode I had a great trailer but the film was disappointing. Episode II had a good trailer and was (at first sight) better than the previous effort. After watching it again and again even I realized that the love story between Anakin and Padme is god awful boring, but I still like the Obi Wan/Clone Army parts. Still, the film was not satisfying. NOw we have Episode III and let me tell you, it delivers. Best opening in the entire saga! even the Anakin/Padme sequences are better. Lucas knew much better when to cut away this time. "
753,10,The Force Keeps Getting Better and Better!,"This is the best of the best! Nothing keeps getting better than George's exiting space opera. Star Wars Episode III is an excellent film. After the original trilogy, The Special Edition and Episodes I & II, This is the final chapter that has all the answers and everything else. It's the most enjoyable. Who cares what other movie goers like! American movie goers nowadays are very shallow if you ask me! I'm true Star Wars fan and I say it's excellent, Period! I just hope that two years from now that Lucas will celebrate the Star Wars 30th anniversary, And if so I'm hoping that Lucas would rerelease the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screens in special edition form again,or maybe he'll do it twelve years from now, Cause that would be awesome if he could do it one more time! Who knows? Anything's possible in the future."
754,10,My Thoughts On Revenge Of The Sith,"Amazing... Purely amazing. Really, this was WAY better than Attack Of The Clones. This time both Portman and Christensen were superb actors (unlike the previous temper tantrums thrown by Anikan). For one thing, the movie was darker, unlike episodes 1 and 2, which were all bright and futuristic. This one had the feel of the original movies. The plot is full of action all the way through, and never has a dull point. Plus, the special effects are greatly done, so as to not look goofy. It's sad, it's exciting, it's romantic,it's philosophical, it's just plain... amazing. Really, if you haven't seen it yet, which almost everyone has, go NOW. You do NOT want to miss out on this one."
755,9,"Take a bow, George.","Believe it, people. This is not only the best of the Star Wars prequels, but the best Star Wars movie second to Episode V. All that was wrong with ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""The Phantom Menace"" has been completely fixed in this film. Barely any Jar Jar. No whiny teen Anakin. And some great acting! Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor, and Hayden Christensen all do a superb job. The action is intense, and JEEZ, you'll be doing your best not to cry, especially when Vader kills the younglings. This film will keep any Star Wars fan glued to the seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes. All of the film leads up to a truly dramatic conclusion that serves as a perfect bridge between the prequels and the original trilogy."
756,6,Using the wrong Anakin/Vader ruined it,"""Star Wars: Episode III"" was a decent enough effort to end the prequel trilogy. It would have been much better, IMHO, if George Lucas had the sense (or the balls) to replace Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader). Perhaps I am being over-critical, but I'm a fan; it's my job. Every time H.C. opened his big, fat mouth to deliver a line, well, it wasn't so much delivered as fell flat on its' face. Everyone around him was acting their butts off (even Padmé (Natalie Portman) turned in a halfway-decent performance, a welcome change from Ep.'s I & II), but H.C. was B.S."
757,2,Truly a revenge,Revenge of the Shi...Sith.
758,10,Excellent Movie - Also Read the Book,"Before seeing the film, I would recommend reading the book which was based upon the movie and Lucas's storyline. This will give you some insight into the goings on in poor Anakin's head. The guy is just so obsessed and pig-headed that he doesn't realize that once he become Darth Vader (duh!) he won't CARE about saving Padme! No kidding. Meanwhile, Sidious/Palpatine doesn't even say that he KNOWS how to do this whole stopping death thing, he's going to ""figure it out"" with Annie's help. Annie just is not paying attention to anyone! You really thought you'd be able to stay a good-guy? Um, no. Also in the book, you will be able to understand, in depth, the relationship between Obi Wan and Annie. These men are best friends who love each other and would die for one another. The fact that the two duel is the proof that Vader is NOT Anakin. Anakin is lost. (Until 15 minutes before his death in Luke's arms, of course). In the book, you read exactly what is Vader's first and foremost thought after regaining consciousness in his new ""body"": IS PADME ALRIGHT? WHAT HAVE I DONE!! Thus the ""NO!"" Come on guys, really. You need to at least read from page 339 on. I beg of you. If you could read 20 pages of IMDb comments to get to this one, you can handle a little book. PLEASE! I can't wait to see this movie over and over until I get my fill. Bravo Lucas, you're a millionaire! Ps - this would be an excellent tale to compare to the story of Jesus (for those of you still in college!) Here's a small hint: Immaculate conception . May the Force be with you. When you die, you become the force. HELLO"
759,,"Better than EP's 1 & 2, but still flawed . . .","Well, what can I say, I approached Revenge of the Sith with some trepidation, but was pleasantly surprised...to a point."
760,,A Vast Improvement...,"After suffering through the underwhelming, ""kid flick"" feel of MENACE, and the robotic stiffness of Hayden Christensen in CLONES, there was ample justification for lowered expectations for STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH."
761,2,Disappointing,"A long time ago and a bridge too far, far away."
762,9,Lucas Finally Gets It Right,"Third time is apparently the charm for Mr. Lucas, because ""Revenge of the Sith"" finally, FINALLY, feels like a ""Star Wars"" movie. ""Attack of the Clones"" was tons better than ""The Phantom Menace,"" and even ""Menace"" improves as part of the entire series when it doesn't have to stand alone, but ""Sith"" is the only installment in the new trilogy that deserves the ""Star Wars"" brand."
763,8,Return of the FUN,"Well, i just got back from the midnight show and... wow."
764,9,good film,Its a really cool film I can recommend it to you If you like smth like that.
765,1,The Worst Star wars movie ever,"This is the worst star wars movies of all, most of fans think that star wars episode 3 was the best of the best, i think that is a cover up of a stupid plot, with extreme battles and star-fights "
766,10,"Powerful, dark, and emotional. An excellent wrap-up to the successful star wars saga!!","What a film!! I got tickets that a friend got me tonight at a 9:40 showing since I have been a die hard fan of Star Wars for a long time now. My eyes were just glued to the 140 min film and after it, I was just simply amazed at what I just saw. The special effects for the film were phenomenal such as the space battles and lightsaber duels with great scenery in the backgrounds. The story had no problems at all because even before I even saw the film, I knew there were going to be no flaws since in every Star Wars movie there has been a plot. The acting was alright, but a lot better than the prequels in acting and dialouge. After viewing it, I also noticed how sad it was and powerful it became. The film was sad in many reasons and got me a little choked up and the darkness of the movie was revealed tons of times. Way Powerful!! Although this film is no Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi, I still think of it as an excellent and entertaining conclusion to the brilliant saga. Sci-fi at it's best!! "
767,1,It hurts,"I gave in to the pressure coming from my co-workers and watched the movie. I thought I was prepared after the first two movies of the same series. I was wrong, it was worse than I ever expected."
768,1,A stupid movie it is. Save your money you must.,I bought the DVD because it was star wars and i at least expected to be entertained.
769,10,the real end of a legend,"The end!That is the real end of a legend which lasts for 28 years long.I am lucky enough to see it in a cinema on 20th May ,the first day the great film runs in China.It is visually stunning battle and more violent than former 5 episodes.Darth Vader comes out instead of an ever upright handsome young warrior.A girl sitting beside me last night was very upset when Anakin disappeared. All warriors except 3 deceased and a time of Republic is over.Joda and Obi-wan are hermits before Luke is coming.So many scenes will not be seen forever.There will be no sabers swinging on a fire lake,no force used to protect justice,no lover's tears dropping out of affection.Goodbye Anakin,goodbye Padme,goodbye C3PU&R2D2,goodbye Han Solo,goodbye Jedi warriors,goodbye a world of star-wars!"
770,10,The best Star Wars film ever made,"This film is simply the best Star Wars film ever made. Endlessly quotable, incredibly emotional and narratively satisfying. Ignore the prequel haters and go in without bias."
771,5,Better without dialog,"You have to see a new episode of Star Wars. It's part of cultural awareness. The first three episodes are bound to lose suspense because the audience already knows how everything will end. So you have to go for action and drama, and great special effects. Two out of three ain't bad, but when the drama falls as flat on its face as it did here, it's hard to forgive."
772,7,"Great performance of visual effects and music, but the storytelling","I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid, and this has become a fond memory for me, it can be said that this movie opened my love for the Star Wars universe and even things related to it to space and planets, UFOs...<br /><br />Perhaps this is the perfect ending to the birth of the character Darth Vader. Music, it's perfection, wow especially at the end, music is my favorite. Visual effects, amazing. The lightsabers, perhaps Obi-wan and Anakin's battle in the volcanic planet is one of the best and most emotional fights in the world of action movies, where Obi-wan utters the words at the ending with Anakin was so good that I forgot about their old version in part 4 and 5, at that time I just wished they would remake the old versions. But despite such special things, part 3 still has some bad things, such as the quality of the dialogue, especially in the first half of the movie, the lines are quite simple and weird like in the cartoons for kids. Especially the storytelling. In the clone wars, there were scenes that helped develop the character well but were removed from the movie, and in this part I feel the same way. Why did Padme, a politician, overreact when Obi-wan mentioned the Sith? The film does not mention how people feel about Jedi and Sith, viewers only understand this conflict is simply between Jedi and Sith, no one else. Then the conflict between Obi-wan and Anakin is also not fully developed. At the part of Obi-wan's parting, Anakin and him were still very close, but after that Anakin had a grudge against Obi-wan very quickly. And the other characters like Yoda, the Jedi... are pretty faint and don't have much special. Everyone knows how strong General Grievous is but in this movie he is quite weak, even though it was the result of Windu's attack, but he still disappointed me a bit."
773,1,"o plot, and acting, where art thou?",That must've been the dumbest and most embarrassing movie i've ever seen. And these are two point some hours of my life that i will never regain. Not to mention the financial loss and moral trauma - cinema workers actually searched through my bag trying to find stashed camera equipment for illegal recording of the movie :).
774,10,A Brilliant Achievement - The End of a Saga,I cannot begin to express the sheer joy I had watching Revenge of the Sith. This film soars as an achievement in storytelling and as a bridge to the original Star Wars trilogy. As the opening scene blazed onto the screen I was riveted. 
775,10,Excellent - probably would have an 8.5 rating if not for Lucas haters,"This is certainly the best of the last three movies. Lucas did a great job as usual. It's the darkest of all the star wars movies of course because it deals with Anakin's decent to Darth Vader. Lucas didn't sugar coat this one, thankfully."
776,1,shallow,"It is 10pm the night before the Star Wars trilogy script is due. George Lucas says ""I... can... do... it"" and writes the whole thing in an hour. Congratulations George, you wrote a six hour movie that didn't make sense. It didn't have developed characters, it contradicted itself, it missed essential elements, it had dialog like cheese and it wasn't even enjoyable. This is not to mention the fact that it looked like a cartoon and you couldn't get the acting right."
777,7,A satisfying note to go out on,"Revenge of the Sith is the last Star Wars film George Lucas will suffer to make, unless he changes his mind or he needs the money (both of which seem remote at this time). But Lucas knew that going into this, I believe, and he also knew that this would be the last film he made that anyone wanted to see in his lifetime (I don't believe Indy 4 will ever get made. You can if you wish; I don't). That being said, there is always a certain aspect to any work of art when the artist knows it will be his last great offering, much like a farewell tour or a final exhibition. There's a little bit of ego involved, a little bit of nostalgia, and an insistence on hearkening back to earlier, better times, when things were shiny and new and you didn't know all this was coming to a close."
778,1,"A charmless, CGi extravaganza","George Lucas once said you can not replace good story telling with computer graphics, or words to that effect. It seems over the years that phrase became lost as George began creating and filming three of the most disappointing prequels ever to be released on celluloid."
779,10,Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?,"I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
780,10,"No woman no cry, man. I'm tellin' you.","(spoilers) I'll be the first to admit that I'm no Star Wars expert. I love the movies and I've seen them all, but I have friends who have such detailed knowledge about the mechanics and structure of the films and their interconnected stories that they make me feel like I've never seen any of them. That being said, I don't feel too bad about the knowledge coming as something of a surprise to me how much one woman played a role in the underlying conflict on which all six films are based. Bob Marley has never been so right (note: yes he has)."
781,1,"Milking the ""Srar Wars"" cow 'till the last drop...","George Lucas has milked the ""Star Wars"" cow until its last drop, cashing as much as he can on the Francaise name and wonderful memory from the 80's. Legions of SF fans and 80's nostalgics have given him 200 000 000 $ within one week to get in return what? I almost fell out of chair laughing on the old retro suit of Darth Vader - after all high tech rockets, clones, gizmo's..., finally Darth Vader rises with old 80's style suit with big red and green buttons sewed in the chest. All of the sudden the interior of the ships becomes laughably retro and the bad guys put the same Nazi style uniforms from 25 years a go. Even Ed Wood would be jealous on this. The dialog and the acting is mildly said - amateur league, the action although totally CGI-ed left me cold. I caught myself looking at my watch many times and counting minutes until the end after I finished the pop-corn , which was the only fun part in this movie visit of mine."
782,10,part 6 is better then part 4 and 5.,This is a great movie. It is not as good as the first Star wars movie. The empire strikes back is also better. The return of j.e.d.i is also better. But still this is a good movie. All the Star wars movies are great. This is better then The phantom menace and Attack of the clones. But still all the Star wars movies are great they have great story lines great acting great special effects. See all the Star wars movies. They all some of the beast science fiction movies ever made. Great movie. More c.a.n.d.a.i.n need to stop caring so much about kids games like hockey. Or reality television. And see more good science fiction. This a great movie see it
783,6,"Your lack of faith in these prequels is, broadly speaking, not disturbing.","If the final film of the original trilogy went out with somewhat of a bang, then this final film of the three prequels fizzles out with a bit of a whimper; the masking of the Vader character proving, it would seem, to be somewhat less enthralling than the unmasking. This is not to say that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is totally irredeemable, but its final act, the grand finale to the first half of the life-arc of a character that has captured people's imaginations for decades, plods to its destination and falls over the line instead of bursting through the tape, arms aloft. Much of this lies, I think, in the direction, which isn't entirely sure how to execute what is, in essence, a downer-ending to a summer blockbuster belonging to a franchise which has become synonymous with thrills; spills; excitement and, I suppose, HAPPY endings."
784,8,A Rousing Good Film!,"George Lucas saved his best for last - at least that can be said with no doubt for the second trilogy he put together. Revenge of the Sixth expertly weaves together a story that brings closure to the first three sagas of Star Wars and leaves a window open for the next three(those previously made decades ago). The line binding the two - save for obvious technological differences - is almost seamless. Everything of pertinent nature is explained, characters are set up to correspond with future actions, and the theme of the force vs. the dark side is as strong as ever. The dazzling CGI special effects of this film dominate a large portion of this film's success. They are most impressive(as they have been throughout the entire trilogy). Lucas directs with his usual abilities to ""tell"" a good story visually. The acting is generally very good with some very worthy performances. Ian McDiarmind, one of a handful of actors to appear in ALL six films, steals each of his scenes and gives his best performance on screen. Definitely an Oscar-worthy nod! McGregor and Portman do very credible jobs again. Hayden Christiansen, though no great thespian, does better this time round. But acting aside, the film is carried by story and special effects and by one's memories of what is to take place in Staw Wars(1977). For me, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is a very rewarding experience in that regard. One scene in particular summed up all those feelings...seeing Wayne Pygram - not even uttering a word and having less screen time than 30 seconds - standing there looking out in space with his sallow, sunken cheekbones as the young Moff Tarkin. He is the spitting image of the late, great Peter Cushing. Christopher Lee has a short reprisal as Count Dooku in the beginning of the film, and, in a way - if one really stretches things, it is like Lee and Cushing had one more film to share their names in the credits. But nostalgia notwithstanding, see Revenge of the Sith for the story, the special effects, McDiarmind's performance, and for closure of a kind."
785,9,A movie with heart and terror!,"Star Wars and it's legacy have left a landmark in the film-making industry. When the original trilogy hit theaters, George Lucas knew right away, he hit the biggest creation of his directing career. From ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" to ""Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi,"" Lucas knew he couldn't possibly make Star Wars any better than it was but when ""Star Wars: The Phathom Manace"" came out, he hit a roadblock. From the extreme dislike of the fans and the company's money, Lucas knew he wasn't giving it his all. He proved once again that he isn't quite up to par as he once was when ""Star Wars: The Attack of the Clones,"" came out. But he proved us all wrong, once ""Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith"" entered theaters. He not only proved wrong, but he proved to us, that his career is not over and his movies can be as heartfelt and dramatic as they once were because no story or movie can compare to this masterpiece."
786,9,An Emotional Journey,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a fantastic finale to the prequel trilogy, beautifully tying things together and setting up and leading to the original trilogy. The characters are amazing, with amazing designs, good performances, and poetic endings. The movie is surprisingly dark, perhaps the darkest movie in the franchise as of yet, though not the darkest entry period. The special effects have improved significantly over the course of this trilogy, going from strange looking in Episode I to beautiful sets and ships in Episode III. The story is easily the best of the trilogy, tied together much better and has the feeling of constantly ""going."""
787,7,Lucas was so close!,"After going to see Star Wars Episode 3, I have to admit that I have never breathed a sigh of relief so loud! Finally raising the bar to a high level, George Lucas has managed to make a movie that doesn't suffer from a slow pace like Episode 1, or an atrocious script like episode 2."
788,10,Lucas' masterpiece!!,"Star Wars Return of the Sith is one of those rare movies that is not just a film, it's not just a story, but it is an experience. It's sometimes hard to put into words what these films mean to me and many others. They represent my youth, my passion and everything that I love about film. They take you away to that galaxy far far away, a long time ago. This is nothing short of perfection and not just in ways that are visual, or emotional. This is the epitome of perfection in every sense of the word. It ties everything together, it furthers the story and bridges the gap between the old trilogy and the new one. As Star Wars fans, we have always wanted to know what it is that turned Anakin Skywalker from the promising young jedi into the most evil man in the universe. You meet this cloaked figure in black in ANH and are right away struck by his anger, his power and his pain. There must be pain behind someone who can destroy planets, kill at will and torture for convenience. Where did that pain come from, and what drives him to his insatiable desire for absolute power? All of your questions are answered here. You can see once and for all that Vader/Anakin is one of the most tortured souls in the universe. Knowing that you are powerful, knowing that you have a gift that some just can't appreciate and many don't trust, that can be painful. Seeing what you can see, knowing things ahead of time but yet are seemingly powerless to do anything about it. Darth Vader was born out of pain. He was born not out of a lust for power, but out of the need to save the one he loved. Darth Vader's power comes from hatred, sure, but the genesis of his transformation to the dark side was sealed when he wanted to save the one he loved."
789,1,Revenge of the Sh*t!,"Finally, we reach the final film in the prequel trilogy. And what's the worse thing about this film you might ask, The fact that so many people liked it and gave it good review. Why?! This film was just as bad as the last two films, and yet somehow this movie got rave reviews! One reviewer actually said that this movie was: ""Better than the original Star Wars."" Did we watch the same movie? or was that one reviewer on some hard, mind altering drugs? So any...way, The wars are in full swing and Anakin and Ewan Macgregor are on a mission to rescue the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine. They eventually find him, and get into a light saber dual with Count Dooku. Macgregor gets knocked out, and Anakin easily defeats Dooku, and nonchalantly cuts his head off. (Wow, What a hero!) So, they save the chancellor and everything's okay. Anakin returns to Padme and she tells him that she's pregnant. They talk a little while, then they go to bed. Anakin wakes up later, and Padme asks ""What's wrong?"" Anakin says that he had a prophetic dream that says that she'd die in childbirth. And right HERE! is where the film totally starts to fall apart. Because from here on in, all Padme will be in this movie is a plot device! (She was never fully developed as a character anyway, but who cares at this point?) So anyway, Anakin whines and moans about not being on the Jedi council. Then he's placed on an assignment by the council to spy on Palpatine. Macgregor tells Anakin that something is ""Out of place."" about Palpatine. Oh, just like something was ""Out of place"" about the clone army, but you decided to play right into the conspiracy anyway?! So any..way, Palpatine tells Anakin about an ancient dark side power used to stop people from dying. so to make a long story short, some stuff happens, Anakin embraces the Dark side, A bunch of Jedi, are killed, The republic falls, and Yoda, Ewan Macgregor, and Padme learn of Anakin's treachery. Finally we come to the climax. Padme goes to Mustafar to meet Anakin, and then he tells her the reason of why he turned to the dark side. Here's her reply to all this: ""I can't believe what I'm hearing."" ""You've changed."" How has he changed?! Why can't you believe what you're hearing?! He's killed children, and advocated for dictatorship before. Padme knew these things about Anakin already, and now for some asinine reason, she actually cares! God, this movie sucks! Ewan Macgregor then steps out of Padme's ship and then Anakin says: ""You brought him here to kill me!"" and then he puts Padme in a force choke. Even though, he did this whole thing to save her!! Then Anakin and Ewan Macgregor get into a light saber fight, Macgregor cuts off Anakin's legs, and says: ""You were the chosen one, Anakin!"" ""I loved you."" Why is Anakin the chosen one?! What makes Anakin so friggin' special?! What can Anakin do, that no other Jedi can't? Nothing!!! So what, if he's the only human that's ever driven a pod racer? That doesn't impress me!! So in the end, everything gets set up for the original trilogy, and then the movie ends. These movies are garbage!! It's seems like George Lucas wrote these God-awful films to deliberately infuriate us! If that was his intention all along, then on that level, he succeeded. Because these prequel films do not have the charm, or the magic that the original films have. You let us down George, you let us down big time."
790,2,Clowns vs. CPUs,"Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by the evil count Dooku. Obi-wan and Anakin ever the Republic servants dodge vulture droids , chop federation troops , disarm Dooku even avoid Miswire jokes and rescue the leader. Afterwards they deftly escape right into the waiting enemy generals patrols."
791,10,Greatest Movie Ever,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith has been in my view, the best movie of all time ever since I first watched it at the pictures back in 2005 when I was 8 years old. I could write for ages about all the great things in this movie, but I'll try and keep it to a respectable length. Firstly, I'll explain my thoughts on the things people often criticise this movie for. One of the criticisms is Vader's 'noooo' at the end but I don't see this as a flaw at all and I think the film is flawless. All Vader's friends and loved ones had died, he obviously thought his kid had died as well. He couldn't really do anything at this point except follow Palpatine and Palpatine at this stage was the only one he could really talk to. At this crucial point of time, Palpatine was pretty much the Emperor of the entire galaxy so for Vader to argue with Palpatine would've been suicidal, it would've destroyed him and made his life totally meaningless had he done that so it made total sense for him to show some restraint and take his anger out on the medical droids. There wasn't really much of a reason for Vader to turn on Palpatine at this point anyway, although he did say he could save his wife if he joined the dark side he did mislead Anakin a bit but he also implied Plagueis had achieved it so it makes sense to me that Vader wouldn't of had a reason to try and attack Palpatine so I think the people who hate on the film because they believe Vader should've tried attacking Palpatine for it to be realistic are wrong I believe."
792,10,Now I Am Complete,"I remember being eleven years old and it was the Christmas where we got our first PC with a CD-ROM. I was overwhelmed by the mere concept but I was also overwhelmed by the free computer games that came with the PC. One of these games was Star Wars: Rebel Assault, which was my introduction to the Star Wars galaxy. After I played it for the first time I couldn't stop. After that I was introduced to the original Episodes IV, V and VI for the first time, which changed me after that day. I wanted it all  toys, soundtracks, books, Lego sets, the card game and especially the video games. It wasn't until I saw the Special Editions of the first three movies on all three opening days back in 1997 that I felt complete."
793,9,"Better than the first two, but equally as soulless and bad","We can all agree that out of the Star Wars prequels, Revenge of the Sith (2005) was the best. That's kind of like agreeing being quickly decapitated is better than the hours-long ordeal of crucifixion."
794,8,AT LAST! Justice is given to a great story!,"Star Wars has been one of the most successful films, epics, ever created. When George Lucas decided to fill the void with creating Episodes 1, 2 and 3, I felt that at last the mystery and intrigue behind this fantastic story was going to be answered, in the terrific fashion that Episode 4, 5 and 6 were made. I was extremely disappointed with Episode 1 and 2, and therefore could only presume that 3 would just as shocking."
795,2,Sigh....,"Well, the great thing is, you can watch the first three movies by themselves and act like this 'prequel trilogy' never happened."
796,8,The Force vs. The Ultrasound,"In this particular galaxy, why wasn't anyone in the know regarding twins? "
797,7,"This film is decent, but that is not what this review is for.","This film is decent but very forgettable. That is not the topic of this review but I just wanted to mention that. The topic of this review is the fact that a lot of people say this is their favorite star wars film, and I am pretty sure I know why. (Keep in mind, if you genuinely think this is the best film, that's fine) it's an easy answer, nostalgia. I love the score, and the effects but every star wars film has those qualities, it is nostalgia. A lot of people who were born in the '90s or even the '00s grew up on these films. And because it is easily the best out of the prequel trilogy, people who grew up on these films say it is a 10/10 from straight nostalgia, ignoring the sometimes terrible dialogue, and bad acting at some points. Don't get me wrong I would call this a good film, but check any review from someone older than 30 and they will at most give this a 8/10 (which is very rare)"
798,7,Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequel trilogy (The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones being the two films that complete the trilogy). Revenge of the Sith is probably the third best film in the Star Wars canon -- behind only the original film and The Empire Strikes Back.
799,9,A Fantastic and Tragic Ending to the Trilogy,My 'Revenge of the Sith' Review:
800,10,Up there with Empire Strikes Back,"This is by far one of the best installments of the Star Wars series. The film jumps straight into the action from memorable scene after scene. The acting is better in this film than previous entries with some slight duds. Ewan McGregor shines in the role he was born to play Obi-Wan Kenobi providing the series with some of its best moments and giving one of the series best performances. Hayden Christensen while he gets a lot of criticism for his portrayal of Anakin he still manages to give a decent performance and provide a believable performance for Anakins's journey to become Darth Vader. The Villains are great in this film, with Count Dooku's arc finished up from the previous film and TV series with a brilliant performance from the late Sir Christopher Lee. This film provides the best scene in the entirety of the franchise in the climatic battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin. Overall, this is one of the strongest entry's into the series and a much watch for fans of the original"
801,10,Lucas ends masterfully,"If there's only one movie you plan to see this millennium, make sure it's Episode 3. The movie absolutely blew my mind from the moment that I first sat in the theater and saw the green Lucasfilm logo go on the screen. The movie was no stop action and suspense and parts of it were quite sad, but overall it was a superb way for Lucas to end his well loved series, and I think it is quite possibly of of the greatest works of film for this and all future generations. Take in the moment as you see it, and then just sit back, relax and enjoy the awesome movie that will be put before you. Be prepared to become extremely excited and passionate and you will walk out of the theater knowing that you saw the end of Star Wars, but the birth of a soon to be cinematic legend that will change the way people look at George Lucas and Star Wars."
802,9,A Star Wars film that modern Star Wars films need to take note of,"Episode 1 in the prequel trilogy was a very very mixed bag, bad CGI, not the greatest acting but it did have a pretty alright storyline. Episode 2 made some much needed improvements, it followed one of the best Star Wars Storylines out there and hit it pretty well! Not to mention some really great acting by Hayden Christensen and Ewan Mcgregor. Then we arrived at Episode 3, another mixed bag (for reasons unknown). Everyone has a right to have opinions, don't get me wrong! But this movie had one of the most incredible Storytelling I've ever seen, and not to mention really great foreshadowing! It gave us things we never knew we needed, Anakins build up to one of the greatest villains to date, and also some really good lines such as ""Hello there."" And ""This is where the fun begins."" But In all seriousness Episode 3 is really well done, sure it's not perfect, no movie is perfect. But this movie gets pretty close, only messing up on some CGI points and some of the acting feels a little out of place, but other than that a really well done movie and really deserves more recognition! Definitely check it out again when you get the chance."
803,8,The most average movie ever to deserve an 8,"Leading up to 'Sith', people weren't optimistic, given the lacklustre standard of the previous two. 'Sith' shouldn't have been as good as it was."
804,10,"an excellent finale, to an ""excellent"" trilogy","Taking into account that cynicism is now the new intellectualism, i am staggered at the unfocused, blind hatred being aimed at this film here, and the last two films. Without question i have thoroughly enjoyed these latest STAR WARS movies, the music, the fantastic effects, the feeling of depth and texture that only the STAR WARS movies have. The only problem really has not been the writing ,as such, but the writing about the writing, oh, and the constant moaning about the lack of a Han Solo type character. "
805,10,"Not a Die Hard fan, But I loved this!","So far in this galaxy ... on the USA news and entertainment shows ... this version of ""Star Wars"" is always referred to as ""for the fans"". I am not a die hard fan. I saw bits and pieces of the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi...I paid more attention to the new versions 1 and 2 but this one....now, this one is the one to see."
806,10,I have a very bad feeling about this,"Like many people I was expecting Sith to be another letdown, I mean Clones was quite good and Menace wasn't that bad but they just weren't in the same league as the original trilogy, the didn't feel like Star Wars."
807,9,"Brilliant, actually on the same par as the originals","What can I say that hasn't already been said by the cult fans? Well I don't have any of the merchandise, I couldn't tell you what planet Hans Solo came from and I didn't bring a light-saber to the movie theater but I would still call myself a fan of these movies. And I wasn't disappointed. The special effects were awesome as usual but I think thats come to be expected from Lucas. The main improvement from Episodes I and II was the characters. Hayden Christensen has improved dramatically since Attack of the Clones, the dark side really works for him, he's no longer a whiny teenager he is a more complex and powerful young man. Quite scary too. Ewan McGregor makes a good Jedi, he's cool calm and collected but he actually provides some of the lighter moments in the film too. And R2D2! He really had some good scenes this time, it's amazing how much personality they can put into a plastic box that beeps. He had me laughing and cheering, just like Yoda. Yoda is so much better in the first three movies, all his fight scenes always get a great reaction from the crowd and you have to love the little green guy. And green is the best light-saber colour. Except maybe for Jedi Windoo's purple."
808,,A spectacular action packed and emotional achievement. The best Star Wars film ever. ***** out of 5,I actually camped out 20 hours in front of the AMC theater in Chicago before seeing this. It was a once in a lifetime experience and one that I will never forget. Being with my Star Wars fan friends and playing Star Wars Trivial Pursuit with them is a lasting memory.
809,5,"still feels like ""diet"" Star Wars... not quite the real thing","This is the finale in a trio of reminders that Star Wars should have ended in 1983. Unless you saw these films as a child, you can recognize that the prequels are not good movies. How, you ask? Well, let me tell you."
810,6,Look Ma! It's full of those new-fangled special effects!,"And that, sadly, really does sum up the third, and last of the star wars sextet. It's rare that I'll say you can have too many special effects, but here, I'm afraid it's true. I pity the day when effects companies like ILM manage to do away entirely with the need for actors, because then we'll just get more movies like this, but without even the bad acting to look at."
811,1,Bad writing,"All of it. My word, what a terrible script from George Lucas. Turned to darkside too quick, yoda knew chewie...fighting on lava, lost the will to live...my oh my. Should have been like Rogue One."
812,10,A complex tale of tragedy.,"Revenge of the Sith is heartbreaking, it is hard to watch, it will make you cry. But it's also an essential watch, and an incredibly fun time also, somehow."
813,1,Mediocre,This film was laughable. I mean this literally...I spent a LOT of it film laughing in places I really shouldn't have been.
814,9,"""Henceforth you shall be known as Darth Vader""","Because my opinions on the two Star Wars films preceding this one are somewhat negative, you might think that Episode III is going to be more of the same and not worth anyone's time. You would be wrong because this is, without a doubt, the best movie of the prequel trilogy. It's like Lucas had 2 strikes and then a home run. The reason this film has been often cited as the best prequel has to do with the fact that it has a much more morbid and dark tone to it than the previous 2. It completes the story of Anakin's life and sees him get absolutely consumed by hatred; something a Jedi must never allow to happen. By the end of the film, anything resembling his former self is totally gone, and only Darth Vader remains. With this in mind, let's take a look at Revenge of the Sith's riveting story and discover why it acts as the perfect bridge between the prequels and the first Star Wars movie that was made. The story picks up where Attack of the Clones left off. Anakin and Obi-Wan have followed Count Dooku to the planet of Coruscant, where shortly before, he had met with Darth Sidious to share the schematics of the Death Star. Dooku is currently onboard the personal flagship of a ruthless warrior named General Grievous: a four-armed cyborg who kills Jedi and takes their lightsabers as trophies. Obi-Wan and his apprentice fight together as a team one last time and use starfighters to destroy swarms of enemy ships. After shooting their way into the Invisible Hand (Grievous' ship), they are both captured and brought before the General himself. Anakin and Obi-Wan manage to kill Grievous' droid bodyguards, but he manages to escape in a pod. Obi-Wan and Anakin find Chancellor Palpatine on the ship and are tasked with rescuing him, but Dooku appears and isn't ready to go down without a fight. Filled with rage after their previous encounter (in which Dooku severed Anakin's forearm), Anakin savagely fights with him until managing to slice off both of his hands. Anakin then beheads Dooku at Palpatine's request. After rescuing the Chancellor, Obi-Wan and Anakin take control of what's left of the Invisible Hand and crash land it on Coruscant. After landing, Anakin starts seeing his wife Padme again, who tells him she is going to have a baby. Anakin likes this news, but starts having disturbing dreams of Padme dying after giving birth. Meanwhile, Palpatine gets more acquainted with Anakin, the former saying he wants him to be his personal deputy. This move makes the Jedi Council uneasy, which leads to them making the decision to not appoint Anakin as a Jedi Master. They tell him he is to spy on Palpatine instead. Concurrently, Obi-Wan tracks Grievous to the planet of Utapau and kills him in a lightsaber duel, but not before he exiles the Separatist rulers to Mustafar, a lava world. Back on Coruscant, Palpatine lures Anakin into having more faith in the dark side of the Force by saying it's a gateway to many techniques deemed ""unethical."" Among them, the power to stop people Anakin cares about from dying. Anakin seems to be aware that Palpatine is Sidious by now and reports him to the Jedi Council. Master Windu confronts the Chancellor in his quarters and decides to kill him, but Anakin is convinced he must live since senseless killing is not part of Jedi tradition. Palpatine kills Windu after his hand is cut off by Anakin, and Anakin is now fully immersed in his evil side. Palpatine christens him Darth Vader, and then sends an order to all his clone troopers across the galaxy. This order forces all the clones to slaughter their former Jedi masters by telling them they're traitors to the Republic. Anakin (now Vader) accelerates the killing and murders a bunch of young Jedi in the Jedi Temple. Right after, he goes to Mustafar and does the same to all the Separatists. At Palpatine's behest, the Republic becomes the Galactic Empire, with himself as emperor. Obi-Wan meets with Padme and tells her her husband is a monster who has completely given in to his hatred and must be stopped. He and Padme go to Mustafar to seek out Anakin, who has no doubt changed a lot since he last saw his wife. Anakin tells Padme he sees nothing wrong with the evil things he's done, and how he's becoming more and more powerful just for her. Anakin flies into a rage when he sees Obi-Wan standing in the ship, convinced Padme brought him there to kill him. He uses the Force to choke her unconscious until his former master orders him to stop. Obi-Wan realizes it's time to put his former apprentice down for good and the two enter a brutal lightsaber duel. They both appear to be equally matched, but Obi-Wan wins when Anakin attempts to jump over him and gets both his legs severed. The barely alive Anakin is horrendously disfigured and burned by the bank of a lava river. While all this is happening, Master Yoda attempts to kill Palpatine in the Senate, but fails and goes into exile. Anakin is eventually retrieved by Lord Sidious, operated on, and given the iconic black suit of armor. Meanwhile, Padme gives birth to two children, Luke and his sister Leia, and then dies. As Vader and Sidious watch the first stages of the Death Star get constructed, Padme's children are separated to keep them safe from the Sith. Leia is taken to the planet Alderaan, and Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-uncle Owen Lars on his father Anakin's homeworld, Tatooine. I've said it before but I'll say it again: this movie is pretty damn good. I'm not sure if it's because the other two prequels are so lackluster that they make this one look amazing, but Episode III is still the most well made prequel. It carries a lot more emotional weight than the other two, and I especially love how macabre it gets towards the end when Anakin fights his former master and is gruesomely defeated. The main strength this movie possesses is how it shows Anakin's pathway to being Darth Vader. He was already showing signs of being consumed by anger in the previous film, but by this point, he's so twisted by hatred that he's simply not himself anymore. The murderer that tenaciously duels with Obi-Wan on Mustafar is Darth Vader, and nobody else. Just as Padme says, she doesn't know him anymore. Speaking of which, I found the acting to be quite good, which is a radical departure from the past 2 movies. When people say to me Hayden is a terrible actor, I sit there and wonder how they can possibly think that. He plays Anakin really well, especially the way he lashes out at everybody who used to love him. He's convinced everyone wants him dead, and is trying to acquire as much power as he can to avoid this. The scene in which Natalie Portman tries to convince him he's a good person that shouldn't stray onto the path of evil is heartbreaking. So is the scene where Obi-Wan leaves him for dead after cutting off his legs. Anakin was supposed to be the saving grace of the Jedi, but instead, he became one of the most infamous villains in film history. Vader is so blinded by hate that he unknowingly killed his wife, and is torn apart when Sidious tells him what he has done. It's moments like these that make me praise the acting in this movie when most people say it's just average and has a bad script. The movie also has a lot of action, such as Obi-Wan's fight with Grievous, Yoda's duel with Sidious, and of course, Vader against his old mentor. It's also great how the movie seamlessly transitions into Episode IV, which we can now completely understand why it's called ""A New Hope."" There's so many reasons why this is one of the best Star Wars movies, and I can't list them all. I know this has been a long review, but it goes to show how good this film is when I can talk about it to such an extent."
815,4,Talk about your pieces of crap.,"The mechanism for turning Anakin evil has got to be one of the most cliché and lazy ever. Hayden Christensen is a terrible actor, if this movie didn't have enough problems on its own, his bad acting would be enough to sink it faster than the Titanic (another bad movie). This film is an insult to the original trilogy. Years from now, no one will look back on this with fond feelings. Thank you Mr. Lucas, for destroying the Star Wars saga with your inept casting. And thank you Hayden Christensen for your hammy readings of shabbily written dialog."
816,4,What a waste of time and money,"Yeah, so the special effects are pretty spectacular, but aside from that, man. God help me, I absolutely adore Ewan McGregor, he is by far my favorite actor, however... his character was so flat in this movie. Obi-Wan practically lacked emotion entirely, as did Padme, Anakin, and the rest of the cast. They looked like they were doing a job they were utterly tired of doing. I will give the casting crew a thumbs up to Anakin. Hayden completely had that sinister look. Too bad the acting didn't match it."
817,4,"Monetary motivation leads to the Dark Side, and George turned a long time ago.","I won't say I absolutely hated it. At least it kept me awake and entertained (when I wasn't cringing or laughing out loud at the wrong moments). But sometime after Return of the Jedi, Lucas either lost or gave up his abilities to write and direct. Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones both proved that to this die-hard fan who was a 4-year-old when A New Hope was released. Star Wars was a big part of my childhood. I feel depressed about the way these prequels were handled. All three could have been so much better."
818,3,An Unengaging Conclusion to the Star Wars Saga,"As a fan of the original three Star Wars movies, I feel Revenge of the Sith definitely belongs in the same league as Episodes I and II. In none of these more recent additions to the Star Wars saga did I feel I remotely cared what happened to any of the characters. In contrast, Luke, Han, Obi-Wan, and Leia (and even Darth Vader) in the original films seemed more human and real. For whatever the reason, I walked out of Sith without the least desire to ever see the movie again. I found Anakin's motivation for going over to the Dark Side unrealistic. Bad dreams??? Some characters appeared in the story for little purpose. Count Dooku lasted all of a few minutes. The General Grievous character had no bearing on the plot. Chewbacca and the wookies appeared for little apparent reason. Additionally, the sense of mystery is totally gone. Remember when you wondered who Luke's father was? Remember Yoda's ""No, there is another ..."" line? All in all, Sith was a very unfulfilling ending to the entire storyline. The only moment that really captured my attention was when Luke's theme played as the baby was being secreted away on Tatooine at the end of the movie, briefly resurrecting the joy of seeing the original so many years ago."
819,6,"Badly acted, terrible plot, horrible dialog, but good special effects","What else can I say other than that I am disappointed. You fellow evaluators have overrated this movie far above its appeal. I certainly now understand why Lucas had to start from episode IV and not the special effects operas before it. BUT I would rather exchange the effects to better depicted characters, better dialog and good acting. There is none of this in the movie. Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is the best actor of the bunch. Hayden Christensen, I am sorry, but if you can act, you didn't do it in this movie."
820,9,"Finally, a film worthy of the Star Wars name... and one I don't have to hate","Finally Mr. Lucas by-and-large nails how to tell this most recent chapter in the Star Wars epic. He pulls out all the stops and other than an occasional hideous line of dialogue (far worse than any awkward line in The Matrix Trilogy), he creates a film that is majestic, poignant, utterly engrossing, and timeless. The single line that made this an 8.5 or 9 film out of 10 was the one said by Obi-wan, ""only Sith Lords deal in absolutes!"" This line is so inaccurate that it almost makes the viewer wonder if somehow a massive typo made it into the script and then onto ""film"" (of course we all know it wasn't shot on film, but was shot using digital cameras) with no one catching it. Because the line would make sense if Obi-wan said, only Sith Lords DON'T deal with absolutes... It's been so thoroughly established in the Star Wars universe that The Sith and the Darkside were those that got lost when they were led slowly astray by shades of grey until they were wholly in the darkness of the dark-side. The belief in shades of grey, of right and wrong, darkness and right are inherently a belief which is propagated by the ""Dark Side"" as it so effectively undermines the Light (or, the Jedi)... it was the shades of grey that were Anakins downfall... one step after another while his eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness. In short, as he so adequately established the Jedi Order was all about order, and a distinct right and wrong way to do things. What was interesting was how they depicted the difficulties that even a good Jedi struggles with at times, between right and wrong and what is most expeditious at the moment."
821,9,blockbuster entertainment,"Only looked at my watch once, during a quiet bit shortly into the movie - otherwise the time flew by. The FX and smooth editing hold the attention of the viewer."
822,3,Looks great... Errr. That all there is.,"My vote history for Star Wars goes 9, 10, 8, 5, 5 (for IV V VI I II) and 3 for this utter travesty of a film. It looks beautiful. Almost everything, apart from some of the Clone Troopers looks solid, and real. Pity about the dialogue and script, acting and delivery, not a single word of which was remotely believable. The plot was OK. Much better than I and II."
823,6,All the feelings of a wet handshake,"After the ""first"" two films, I admit I wasn't expecting too much, but the hype had me hoping. Unfortunately, I was right to not expect anything above the others."
824,1,A most absurd and horrible debacle,"I remain confused and confounded by those fans willing to claim that the wooden-acting of the previous two films in the prequel series is gone, replaced by something mildly palpable. The dialog, as horrible as ever, culminates in a love scene between our two star-crossed imbeciles which made an entire audience cringe as if nails were raked across a blackboard. ""You're beautiful. ""You only think that because you're so in love."" ""No, I only think that be...wait, what? what the hell are we talking about?"""
825,5,When the Sith hits the fan.,"Former Hypaspace host Jonathan Llyr stated when he saw the trailer to ""Revenge of the Sith,"" he said ""oh my god, it actually looks good."" Unfortunately looks can be deceiving."
826,8,You did it George!,The nickel Revenge of the Sith review: George Lucas redeems himself. 
827,9,Best of the Prequel Trilogy,"Star Wars is back! Of course, for me, it never left. But for those who disliked Episodes I and II, Revenge of the Sith will (should, anyway) make you happy. ""Sith"" is the bridge of the series. It shows you why everything in Episodes I and II had to happen, but without the context of ""Sith"" when Episode I came out, I can see why fans were startled. I recall having people asking why any of Episode I was important. But it was. When Episode II was released, people asked why things happened the way they did. But they had to. Looking back, I suppose it was inevitable that some would lose heart in Lucas and the prequel trilogy, but to me, ""Sith"" changes all that."
828,5,Nnooooooo!!!!!!,"PREQUEL REPUTATION: Aren't you a bit sh1t for a Star Wars film? ROTS: I'm Revenge of the Sith, I'm here to rescue you. "
829,7,Excellent Effects With Incomplete Plot(revisited),"The plot isn't without error or inconsistency. When our friends our battling it out in the beginning, it isn't even explained very well who the enemy is. Well, at least where the loyalties of the enemy fleet belong. The argument used by a certain dark side character is troublesome at best with the explanation given to understand why Anniken changes over to the dark side. "
830,3,I was expecting a good movie...and Lucas let me down...again.,"Imagine my hopeful surprise to hear that Revenge of the Sith was gaining wide-spread acceptance in the movie-lovers community. ""So much better than Ep 1 and 2!"" and ""Two thumbs up!"" and ""Oooh! Dark and Angsty!""."
831,8,"A fine transitional setup for the ""Star Wars"" original trilogy","Here's the truth, I've shamelessly LOVED both the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. Star Wars was the first movie I EVER saw in the theater, and I've seen all the others that way as well. In the beginning I knew only that it had cool space ships, epic space and lightsaber battles, an engaging mythos, and to this day---the GREATEST villain EVER! Then as I matured I came to feel that the stories and dialogue were lacking, but well compensated by the positives mentioned before, and I felt that both ""Menace"" and ""Clones"" were no exception to that rule. I went to ""Sith"" with the idea that I'd get nothing different, only to be surprised beyond my expectations. The dialogue problem was comparatively limited, the story with only a couple small plot holes, but otherwise powerfully engaging; and the emotional tension was incredible throughout the movie"
832,10,"""Oh How We Miss You, George Lucas....""","Dear, George Lucas."
833,7,What's this? A Star Wars prequel that doesn't stink to heavens??,"I'm not all that into Star Wars, but I've enjoyed the original trilogy well enough and, like most people, got carried away by the hysteria surrounding the release of Phantom Menace. Unfortunately, after the initial wave of excitement died down, I found the movie such a letdown that I didn't even go and see the Attack of the Clones when it came out. I have seen it eventually on TV a week ago and thought it was sooo mind-bogglingly terrible that the only way to make the third film any good would be to lock up George to toy with this beloved CGI and get someone else to do all the directing and writing instead. So as a result I went in with the lowest of low expectations which even the deluge of positive reviews couldn't lift."
834,5,with a bullet,"So the Star Wars saga comes to an end with Darth Vader's clenching his fist and letting out a whooping NOOOOOOOOOOOO over the inevitable death of Padme. All in all, this was the best of the new films, which isn't to say that it's any good. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are embarrassingly bad yet again. Ditto Ian McDiarmand. Thank god for Ewan McGregor. He did everything he could with the cheeseball dialogue. "
835,8,An Star Wars movie that made the prequels worth it,"Episode 1 felt like a kid's movie. Not a complicated, deep, and civilised war between light and dark."
836,8,"Everything occurs as I have foreseen it: sweeping, fast-paced, and flawed","George Lucas brings his series to its natural Wagnerian conclusion, smack in the middle of the storyline. This, the last of Lucas' Star Wars films, is no happy ending; rather it's the ultimate crisis point. If you're looking for a ""feel-good"" movie, this won't be it."
837,8,Amazing movie!,Star wars movies are amazing and i have nothing bad to say about them.
838,10,ROTS finally lives up to all the hype the Star Wars Prequels should have delivered...,"The Prequel Trilogy is Complete with the final installment re-assuring us Star Wars fans that George Lucas is still very capable of making a true Space Opera like he did with Star Wars: A New Hope, which was the only film he directed in the Original Trilogy."
839,4,The Fourth Star Wars Classic,"If there's one thing I've heard about Star Wars since 1999 it's been that Episode I and II don't even come close to the greatness of the original trilogy. And this is very true, those two movies pale in comparison on all levels to episodes IV, V and VI. I had high hopes for Episode III anyway."
840,3,Not Impressed with The Sith etc.,"My wife and I just got back from seeing this movie,and we are very disappointed. It has taken the last 3 episodes for me to realize a few things. For one, there is absolutely little or NO chemistry between Hayden C. and Natalie P. All of their scenes seem to be forced. Another is Ewan McGregor. I love this guy in ALL his other movies, he is talented as hell, but here he is trying to be the wise old Obewan, (Alec Guiness) instead of being a younger more vibrant Obewan."
841,5,Huh?,I'm writing this as a combination of all the prequels - note that in my opinion the 3rd was JUST as bad as the 1st and 2nd.
842,10,This was the best!,"First of all, if this doesn't get an Oscar nomination for best picture, and Ewan McGregor doesn't get a nomination for best actor....well I guess we already know the Oscars ""aren't fair"" so maybe that won't prove anything! But in a just world, these things would happen! I thought all the performances in this movie were first rate. Hayden Christiansen as Anakin also turned in a stellar performance. The rest of it was anything a true Star Wars fan would want from Light Saber battles to Wookies to the Droids! I'll be honest...I cheated and read the book first. So I knew what the story was. I remember thinking as I finished the book that the movie would stand or fall on the acting abilities of Christiansen and McGregor. As you can see from my comments above on those actors, I didn't think it disappointed one little bit! The movie lived up to the book, it lived up to the hype, it lived up to the legend which is Star Wars!"
843,10,It's an instant classic like the original.,"Revenge of the Sith could shatter box office records. Of course as anyone with any knowledge of macroeconomics (very few people) knows that really is meaningless because it doesn't account for inflation! But in any case it is one amazing film. The movie is fast-paced despite being over two and a half hours long. Some of the fighting became a little cheesy at times, more like a video game than a movie, but it didn't fall into this trap as much as the Matrix did. Early on the droids that Obi Wan and Anakin fight are literally no challenge. They are mowed down within seconds. I wish they would put up more of a challenge."
844,9,Amazing & Spectacular!,"As a fan of the old Star Wars Trilogy and one of those not too shattered by how glamor was given higher priority to quality in 1999's Episode I and 2002's Episode 2, I somewhat hoped Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith would be better than those. And I must say, it helped to be hopeful :-) The fact that this movie had to be a mere filler between the romance ruined Attack of the Clones and Star Wars IV: A New Hope (1976) probably helped a good deal. I'm also certain George Lucas finally heard the pleas of Star Wars fans not to wither away from the class that the original trilogy had, and how glamor and romance were not as important as the concept of ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away..."" Indeed, Star Wars III delivered very well. Good special effects, continuity (another lacking factor in episodes I & II), better acting, better makeup, less annoying characters (Jar-Jar, thank you for not speaking), and much better and maturer acting by Hayden Christiansen & Natalie Portman somehow managed to keep viewers attentive about the movie from the beginning to the end. From how Anakin was a hero of a Jedi to what drove him to the dark side - was illustrated exceptionally well. His transformation into the sith Lord Vader was the highlight of the movie, as was the final fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi. Ewon McGregor played a role much older to himself but did a superb job as the Jedi Master. Samuel L. Jackson filled in well as Mace Windu, as did the animated and automated Yoda, R2D2 and C3PO (a little annoying but he was ""helpless""). It has always been a delight to see Yoda preach and fight. The introduction of Chewbacca and Plo-Koon the wookies was also well done. They could have added Hans Solo's introduction as well (he was a young pilot then according to the book X-Wing), but glad they did not as an actor would have to be as sarcastic and carefree as Harrison Ford from the old trilogy."
845,4,Is this what society has come to?,"Although the end to the ongoing Star Wars ride explains much of how the older Star Wars began, I think we could have been spared this overly glorified prequel. The original Star Wars was gripping, edge-of-your-seat action that was way ahead of its time and although the story had many twists and turns in the plot, the real attraction was the special effects. It's possible that despite the effects that were put on screen in Revenge of the Sith, these movies were just made too late to really have the same effect on the audience. The cheesy, over dramatic lines put more of a grimace on the face of the audience than a look of delight, and the desire to have incredible effects from the filmmakers was overwhelming as you watched the film. Although the love story between Padame and Anikan was touching, the overall mood of the first two prequels was action. It clashed with what the filmmakers were going against for the past two films."
846,10,Peak,Everything about this film the tragedy the start the dialogue just felts so we'll to such a tragedy of the best fictional character and losing everything he loved to save the women he loves and getting manipulated this movie gets so much hate when to me it's a masterpiece and I can watch this all the time and seeing the end of an amazing brotherhood is just sad and Padmes death really hit hard I love vaders origin. Also all the fights scenes are so well done and the actors did a hell of a job with it and George Lucas casually made a masterpiece it's definitely a movie I'll continue to watch and show my kids one day.
847,3,Did anybody WATCH the movie???,"Has the whole world gone mad? Have otherwise intelligent movie critics taken a long walk off the short pier into the abyss of stupidity? The movie was dreadful. Oh yes, it was the best of the 3 new ""Star Wars"" movies, but that's like saying you're the best hockey team in the Congo. I think I know how Will Ferrell's character felt in ""Zoolander"". I couldn't stop laughing and for all the wrong reasons."
848,6,"The Best of the Prequels DOES NOT Equal a ""Good Movie""","Let me just say straight off that I'm a huge Star Wars Fan and in my eyes, the Original Trilogy are some of the greatest films ever made. Now that that's out of the way let's review this: There are some positives about this movie - not many - but there are positives. First off, let me list the positives. Thankfully, this movie is a massive departure from the previous two in terms of the tone. Gone are the days of JarJar Binks' idiotic slapstick and cringe-inducing child actors in pivotal roles, (Jake Lloyd anyone?). Also, in spite of the bad acting running rampant through this, and all other prequels, Ian McDiarmid does do a pretty admirable job in the role of Palpatine. He's the best actor and (coincidentally) does the best job with the material given to him in the film. Lastly, let's recognize some pretty damn good special effects. The special effects were outstanding, despite being the only real backbone to the film and not an interesting story of any kind. This brings me into the negatives of the film, and there's A LOT, so let's dive right in. First of all, as I just said, there isn't much of a story left. What I mean by that is that after the horrid debacle of the previous two films, the only thing that's really left to happen in this movie is the actual transition of Anakin Skywalker over to the Dark Side of the Force. Now, I'm sure that you (like I did when I was a kid) thought that would be a really cool concept: The movie could take it's time to develop the one defining catalyst that pushed Anakin over the edge after years spent in war and strife. You finally get to see the one singular second that forces Anakin to become Darth Vader and live a life of servitude and misery. And we as an audience could finally be redeemed from two films of crap...But no, we get the most stale, manufactured, insincere, boring and unbelievable character arcs in film history. I mean come on, I could buy the whole thing where Anakin reacts on impulse and severs Mace Windu's hand at the chance to save his wife from imminent death, but when it actually happened, it just seemed to me like that if Yoda had been there and run into the room at that very second and handed Anakin a MilkyWay, he wouldn't have turned to the Darkside. Basically, the entire Star Wars Prequel Saga tried (and failed I might add) to tell a similar story to Citizen Kane. Is that a common comparison? Yes. Is it inaccurate? No. Let me compare the two side-by-side and you decide for yourself if the characters and story are similar: CITIZEN KANE - A young boy is taken from his home at a young age and separated from his beloved mother. Flash forward to his young adult hood and we see that he is a brazen, idealistic person with a code that he lives by called the Declaration of Principles. Finally we see him mature into a very powerful and successful business man who has everything he wants, but eventually his power corrupt him and he becomes an arrogant and belligerent jerk who forces everyone he loves away from him. He eventually dies a very miserable and lonely man. OK, now there are obviously big differences in locations, events and people outside of Kane/Skywalker, but the basic character motivations that affect them are the same. Why were the Star Wars Prequels not just one movie, very similar in structure to Citizen Kane? I can tell you it's not because it couldn't have been done. In fact, George Lucas did base the original Star Wars movie off of an Akira Kurisawa film entitled ""The Hidden Fortress"". The Hidden Fortress is essentially the same story as Star Wars, but it's told in a way with Robots and not Japanese Peasants. Same rule applies to The Prequels and Citizen Kane. The reason why the prequels became three movies and not just ""The Star Wars Prequel"" is because Star Wars and its accompanying sequels are titled ""Episode IV, V, & VI"", respectfully. I'm sorry to break it to all you fan boys out there, but that's why we have 3 crappy movie and 3 great movies in this franchise, and not 4 great movies in this franchise. Now, moving away from the story and how it relates to other things, let's discuss the acting further. Ewan McGregor is pretty good in the role of Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman does a very good job with her crappy role. That's it. Now, moving onto the CGI in the movie. It is very good, but it's only good in its own right. What I mean by that is that though it's technologically impressive, it's wrong in the context of the story. There's no reason why there needs to be CGI everywhere in a scene that just involves two characters talking. It could (and should) just be a practically built set with CGI out a window or something. This is especially true considering that every single scene in this movie that is not intensive in CGI is shot like a soap opera in shot-reverse shot. Not only is this a sign of lazy filmmaking, but it's also a constant reminder of the lost potential that this and the other prequels had. While I'm on the subject of storytelling, the tone of this movie is A LOT darker than the other two prequels. That's good in the sense that we don't have to sit through anymore horribly idiotic scenes that leave us adults rolling our eyes. That being said, why was this movie SO DARK? I understand that Darth Vader was a bad guy, but did he have to be a homicidal maniac that killed small children? NO. Not needed. I'm going to stop before this gets ridiculous. Thanks."
849,9,"Best of the prequels, 3rd best overall","Episode 3 falls short of the Empire and A New Hope as there are still a few minor weaknesses compared to those films but is much better storytelling than Episode VI, and is a very significant improvement over Episodes I and II."
850,7,excellent when viewed as part of a larger story,******This comment contains spoilers********** 
851,9,Bayeaux Film-making,"This is a grand tapestry of a film, weaving iconic mythological images with a tangible science-fiction realm. As with all legends, the elite play out their tragedies and apotheoses for us - despite the pro-democracy message the film concentrates on events involving kings and lords, princesses, leaders and knights."
852,10,A Star Wars tragedy.,Star Wars is already a very interesting fantasy world that has been shown. This is my favorite movie of this kind.
853,9,Good Bridge to Episodes IV-VI,"Star Wars III will endure because a)as part of an epic, it explains a lot about why things are how they are in the earlier and later episodes, while bringing two relatively disjointed sections (the fancy but vacuous I and II with the more substantive IV-VI) together and b) as a film on its own standing, the characters and narrative are more fleshed out while including grand battles."
854,9,The best of the prequels,Star Wars revenge of the sith is one the best Star Wars movies it was the best action and had the best ever lightsaber fight ever and it shows anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side and into darth Vader and darth sidious is the best character in this film and obi wan is another great part of this movie since he has the high ground and another great thing about this movie is that the villain actually wins in the movie the only thing I don't like is some of the cheesy dialogue which sound really bad
855,1,The Hollywood 'Mahaabaaratham' finally came to an End,"First of all I am not from America and thank God, am not a Star Wars Super Freak. This is my first comment to a Star War movie. Even though I don't like the original Star Wars movies, and hates its new prequels, I wanted to watch the 'last epic event' in theaters. This was my first Star War movie (and probably the last one) I ever watched on a theater, because I was not born on the original trilogy times and was un-attracted to the new prequels."
856,1,Pure rubbish,"I haven't been a huge Star Wars fan, but I did enjoy Episodes 4-6 back in the day. 1 & 2 were worthless, and this one is no different than Lucas's other two recent failures."
857,5,Boring...,"Although this film certainly contained a small amount of emotional impact dearly lacking from Eps I & II, overall, I found this film to be boring. And if I never see another wide-angle shot of a perfectly realized computer generated image of a futuristic alien city, I certainly won't mind. This film is over-loaded with them."
858,6,Revenge of the Sith,"Definitely the best of the bunch! Jesus that ending is pretty graphic for a movie targeted towards kids haha! The birth of Luke and Leia, But also the birth of many memes from these films. The prequels as a whole I'd give a 7/10! Hoping the first three are better."
859,9,"A new ""Star Wars"" movie...","Not the two ""things"" that preceded it."
860,10,BEST STAR WARS MOVIE,An awesome movie. impeccable. clones and revenge of the sith were always better than the previous movie.anakin skywalker's dard vader could only be handled so perfectly ... anakin skywalker - obi wan and master yoda - dard deserved sidious dueling ... I remember watching them over and over again and again and again about 20 times ... luke and We see the birth of Leila in the film ... Let me tell you that the script is fully seated
861,5,ROTS - Tedious and over-political.,"Well, I have seen ""Revenge of the Sith"" and I find it interesting to note that - appropriately - the initials are ROTS."
862,8,Very good.,"I have to say it was a great movie to end off the trilogy, but Hayden Christensen's acting was just awful. He shows absolutely no emotion and in some bits Ewan McGregor showed no emotion either"
863,9,This is the Darkest of the Star Wars movies,"With out a doubt this is the darkest of all the movies in the Six part Star Wars movie series. The movie starts off light hearted enough, there are plenty of laughs within the first huge action sequence which brings back a small space battle though complex and wonderful and as good as the original trilogies space battles, it just isn't enough. Not after spending nearly 2 whole movies before this one not in Space at all. The movie moves very quickly which is a good thing, though there are parts after the rescue of Palpatine that kind of drag along, namely the scenes between Padame and Anakin, though they aren't all that bad at all and do add tension to the rest of the film. How the emperor turns Anakin is inspiring and wonderful, he uses Anakin's weakness against him, a weakness that by now after two movies and most of the third we know fully, his love for those that he cares about and does not wish to loose."
864,9,The THIRD best Star Wars!,"I am sure many people reading this will by now have seen the film, however, I won't be adding any spoilers ""just in case"""
865,10,The end of a visionary saga (CONTAINS SPOILERS),"After 28 long years of box office success, the Star Wars saga has finally reached its end. In 1977, George Lucas would release a film that has been considered to be the most successful film series of all time."
866,2,Bad Ending,"What a sad way to end a once great movie series. If George Lucus waited because there wasn't the technology to make the last three how he wanted, then he should have just filmed them anyways. The past three movies were so special effect saturated it ruined them. It doesn't make sense when the first three were mild on the technology and the last three were heavy on it, so it doesn't make sense where did all the technology, the cities, the crafts you see in the versions 1-3 to 4-6? This movie was in a hurry to get loose ends tied up and did such a bad job of it it got really bad in the end when Lucas thought he had to start mimicking things that were done in the first three. Obi-Wan twisting his mustache, Uncle Owen striking a Luke pose at the end, when he supposedly was against anything to do with the Jedi's. Lucas was on a roll with the writing when he wrote the first three that even if he couldn't do what he wanted technically until now, he should have at least written them, that way they would have had what the others did, a great plot. Waiting too long really messed these past three up. Lets all hope that too much time hasn't passed for him to write a good script for Indiana Jones 4."
867,,The saga ends,And so George Lucas brings his epic Star Wars saga to an end by finally letting the audiences see how the villain from the original trilogy Darth Vader came to be.
868,5,A Terrible Waste,"Before starting this review, I think it should be pointed out that the Phantom Menace is my most disliked movie ever, but I was an obsessive fan of the originals. Please don't listen to those misguided people who hail this movie as a masterpiece. Okay, it does start reasonably well and ends decently (barring Darth Vader's truly ludicrous 'nooooooo'), but the other hour and a half is junk. It's true to say that Revenge of the Sith is the best of the trilogy, but that really doesn't mean a thing."
869,1,Wounded me you have.,"Way to go Lucas. Not only did you waste many years in bring these piles of crap to the screen (when in reality, it could've all been done in 6 months) you totally destroyed the best movies series of all time."
870,5,"An improvement on previous prequels, but that's about it...","George Lucas conceptualized a world that would eventually capture the hearts of millions. With the help of talented individuals like John Williams, Ben Burtt and Ralph McQuarrie, he brought it to life. For many of the children of the 70s and early 80s, the Star Wars phenomenon served as a monumental inspiration that would resonate throughout their lives. Mr. Lucas' contemporary attempts to return us to a galaxy far, far away don't seem to have quite the charm that the original Star Wars trilogy did, but Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith comes the closest of all the prequel trilogy films to recapturing the feel of the original vision as it was presented to audiences over twenty years ago."
871,3,"I would call it a joke, but it's not even funny.","First off, how could anyone above the age of 6 give this movie more than 5 stars? The movie contains tons of logical errors, lengthy-and-stupid-dialogue (don't get me wrong, i have nothing against lengthy dialogue, as long as it is not as incredibly boring, meaningless and badly-written as it is in Episode III) and VERY bad acting (Ian McDiarmid and Hayden Christensen act so bad, it almost had me crying). Also, i can still only repeat that Samuel L. Jackson has nothing to do in a Star Wars movie. Nothing at all. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are the only actors who do a halfway decent job in this movie. Also, Grievous is very disappointing, if you saw the animated series ""Clone Wars""."
872,9,A fantastic ending to a flawed Trilogy,"This movie was by far the most surprising of the three prequel Star Wars films. It had a ton of groundcover like the second one but somehow managed to make it all palatable and not feel rushed or Hollow. The acting between Anakin and Obi-Wan and the final scene is probably one of the best acted scene in all of the Star Wars movies in my opinion you could truly feel the emotion behind Obi-Wan's eyes and, i'm not gonna lie, me and my wife both shut a tear both shed a tear. I know the prequel's get a lot of hate but if there's anyone of them that you're going to watch especially now that the Obi-Wan show is out you should really consider watching this one as it gives you a lot of fantastic context to the first trilogy and the new Star Wars shows like Obi-Wan, Mandalorian, and Boba Fett."
873,9,"The darkest chapter, the end of the tunnel, then the light of ""a new hope"" on the horizon...","Well, my only disappointment with Episode III is that I felt Anakin's reaction to Padme's death was ruined by the Darth Vader mask. I was hoping to see the burnt and crippled Anakin told about Padme while he was being repaired in the hospital. I would have liked to see Hayden's face, see him cry in anguish, knowing that after everything he did to ""save"" her, he actually was the one who killed her. Not by the death choke, but by killing her belief in him, killing her will to live. How horrible to learn that your husband has turned to evil when you're about to give birth to his children??? If you loved Anakin as much as she did, nothing could save you. Her hope and faith in him was destroyed, and that was a very powerful and emotional scene when she said, ""You're breaking my heart!!!"" Natalie Portman is to be commended for such a strong supportive role. Anyway, back to Anakin. Once that mask was on, he was indeed more machine than man, and the whole ""anguish and grief"" thing with Vader just didn't do it for me. "
874,8,The only worthy Star Wars film of the second trilogy,"After the pathetic Episodes I and II, Revenge of the Sith comes as a worthy addition to the franchise. It has a believable plot, good performances and the (wonderful) audiovisual effects complimenting and not starring in the film. It is utmost enjoyable, covers the plot holes from all previous films and leaves the viewer with a feeling of closure. I would go as far as considering this the deepest and darkest film of all six. If you leave your childhood fondness aside, RotS is definitely more subtle than the original trilogy. My only objection, we are still subjected to the love story torture, but it is definitely more bearable than the Episode II abomination. Finally, George Lucas is back with a vengeance (or is it a Revenge?)"
875,1,Scene after scene of boring chatter,"I REALLY did have high hopes for this movie. I'm not the biggest Star War fan out there, but the original three are some of my favorite movies, and are what made me as a kid want to get into movie making. When this movie starts off, of course there is a gigantic space battle and all, which was a little bit of computer graphic overkill. Then that scene comes to a climax, and of course, you couldn't care how it ends, because at that time, you're busy trying to get your equilibrium back in order. After that the film is mostly made up of scene after scene of boring chatter, basically nothing more than tying up loose ends of the six-part storyline. ""Where the Vader name came from"", and so forth. Honestly, I think this seemed more of a fan film made by an over computerized 14 year-old. The dialog's pretty childish, and the acting is over the top. The only thing to keep us in our seats and from leaving the theatre are the light saber fight scenes. The are all well done, and the only thing the actors seem to have a grasp of. The only disappointing fight scene was with the grevious character. I am still boggled by that character. Was he half human/half robot or what? E-mail me if you know! And the way he dies was just as pathetic as Mace Windu's death. ATTENTION SAMUEL L. JACKSON: Guess what? You DID go out like a bit** a$$ punk! The entire theatre LAUGHED when he was done with! So over all: If you are completely obsessed with the franchise, you've already seen it. If your not, wait till DVD and just rent it. E-mail me with any comments on this at moviekid21@msn.com"
876,7,"Good movie, plagued by some of the problems of the prequels","By now I'm sure everyone's had their say on the overall merits of the movie, so I'll be brief."
877,10,Superb. A Cinematic Achievement.,"Honestly. This is the greatest movie ever made. I am deeply saddened by the fact that i will never see a movie as good as this again, as long as I live. You may think that i am being sarcastic, but i am being 100% honest. If this movie was a person, i would marry it. Obi-Wan and Anakin's ""Battle of Heroes"" intercut with the Yoda and Palpatine's fight was the most amazing thing i have even seen put on the screen. "
878,9,Best Star Wars Film,I'll start by saying a ton was asked of this film: to end a poorly recieved trilogy and to lead the story into the most iconic sci-fi film of all time (SW: New Hope). This movie follows what is in my opinion the worst or maybe second worst star wars live action film (SW: Attack of the Clones) and has to cover a lot of ground. Hayden Christiansen as Anakin and Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is the best casting we could ask for. They ace their roles and dialogue. The film does a great job with General Grevious. It handles very well (the most critical part of the story) the development of Anakin Skywalker. George Lucas really pulled it all together soo well to create well built huge moments and a strong plot. We can feel alot of Anakin's strife and struggle in the film. The plot is so strong. This film did more for Star Wars than anyone gives it credit for and it keeps us having a blast along the way.
879,10,Best Star wars movie yet!,"Even if I loved the old Star Wars movie, I couldn't help but to enjoy this one better. It was so incredible tragic! And it had such a horrific ""love story"", that I was about to scream. luckily the good old robots R2D2 and C3PO we're still as funny as usual. Obi-wan's and Anakin's friendship was played out perfectly. I think Ewan McGregor did the best performance in the whole movie. Hayden Chirstensen was so bad himself, especially at the end of the movie. Padme (Natalie Portman) had the best costumes. The special effects we're totally cool and nicely done. If you would like to see the star wars movies, I would recommend you to watch THE OLD ONES first, and then the new ones. (Even if this ones the only new one that's good). I give this 5/5"
880,5,"duped again, but how could you be surprised by now?","Incredible movie! The acting was terribly terribly brilliant. The character development superb. Flawless plot line with beautiful chemistry between the deep, interesting, well developed characters. A brilliantly executed theme worthy of Shakespearian measures! The articulate six year old has spoken! EEEEHH! Sarcasm alert! Maybe I was reviewing episodes 10,11,and 12 which of course will wow audiences only to leave that same legion of geeks disappointed when episodes 7, 8, and 9 come out twenty years later."
881,8,Feeling the Force again,"Revenge of the Sith repairs the disappointment of the first two episodes. It has a good story, good action and good acting. Politics are not unnecessary complicated, as in Attack of the Clones, but simple and deceiving. The Jedi Council's motives may be true and good, their actions are not and it is them who allow the evil to take root in Anakin. His drift to the dark side of the force is carefully prepared even though a little short breathed in the decisive moment. Hayden Christensen is a credible Anakin, torn apart by love, ambition and politics and Ewan McGregor finally looks like a Jedi Master on screen. Ian McDiarmid's emperor dwarfs both. A good story and good acting have been missing since the first minutes of The Phantom Menace, and George Lucas finally pulled it off. R2D2 in action and intense showdown duels add to the pleasure, as well as very nice editing of Anakin's and Padme's destiny."
882,6,Featuring Darth Vader's most embarrassing moment ever!,"This film concludes the new Star Wars set of films, thankfully. The first two were weak, however this one has enough to it to be considered okay in my book. Still not perfect, but there are cooler things going on in this one than happened in the previous movies. Still, the guy doing Anakin is still painful to watch and Ewan still looks like he has really no interest in being in these films, but you get a few nice fights here and there and it ends so no more Star Wars films till they remake the original movies after George Lucas dies (come on, you know it is going to happen). The plot has them rescuing the guy that would become the evil emperor in the original set of films. They face down Christopher Lee's character again and for some reason Anakin has no trouble with him this time even though Lee wiped the floor with him in the last film. This also makes the last fight between Obi Wan and Anakin make little sense as Lee is still stronger than Obi Wan. Well it is not to long before the robot warriors are defeated and the emperor makes his move by dispatching Samuel L. Jackson who likes to star in as many movies a year as possible. I like him in most films, but he just did not fit into the Star Wars universe very well. What makes this one good though is the cool ending with fights between Yoda and the emperor and Obi and Anakin. With these cool fights though come awful scenes such as Darth going ""Nooooo"" like a pansy, Amidale naming the kids, and their crudely made up plan to wipe C-3PO's memory. Seriously, he should have just been left out of this series all together. It was not like he was all entertaining in the first films, in fact he was a bit annoying then too. Another plus though is Jar Jar is limited to a non-speaking role as the sad people of Naboo mourn their loss and everyone in the known universe forgets about their planet in the next films."
883,7,Fourth Best,"It's finally over. I viewed this film over the Memorial Day weekend. It was more as an act of faith than than a burning desire. The first two films of this new trilogy have left much to desire. Episode I was a kiddie film, Spy Kids set in a galaxy ""far, far, away."" There were good sections, but not a good film. Episode II was much better but Anakin Skywaler as a petulant teen got on the nerves. Thank God American teens can't access the Force! I know that the character was supposed to be a flawed and conflicted individual, but the story and dialog did nothing to present that case. Worse, Skywalker and Padme had no chemistry. This was supposed to be a love that shook worlds and destroyed governments. That's not what I saw on film."
884,3,the same two and a half hour space geek adventure,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith concludes George Lucas's space opera which first took flight back in the 1970's. The sixth installment (technically number 3 in the series, but who really cares) focuses on Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) transformation from Jedi Knight to the Dark Side apprentice, Darth Vader. Every little detail that leads up to the already released Star Wars: A New Hope is the focal point of this final act."
885,7,"Satisfying, but I cant help feel somewhat disappointed","In ROTS, George Lucas has managed to tie and complete the SW series quite well. He links all the stories well, and ROTS flows well into Episode IV. The visuals are stunning and every scene is carefully thought out (visually that is), giving us a convincing feel of the 'realness' of this very detailed world."
886,6,Better than Episode II ...,"A better title than Episode II at least, and a better movie. This one had more feeling to it, though it wasn't as good as Episode I. The movie was sad in parts when they killed the Jedi, but that's the way it happened, so it had to happen, I guess. Hayden was great as Anakin and better looking with long hair! Though I felt sorry for Obi-Wan when Anakin betrayed him, but again that's the way it happens as the story goes. I was disappointed how the scene with Qui-Gon and Yoda which was in the book was not in the movie. At least Qui-Gon got a mention though. That was really good. I muss him Qui so much! Perhaps the Qui-Gon/Yoda scene will be in the deleted scenes when the DVD comes out. We can hope! On the whole Revenge of the Sith was a good movie. *Off to view episodes 4,5And 6 now!*"
887,7,Good.. but,"It's a nice film with a good story, exciting action scenes, great visuals, and good acting; a HUGE upgrade from the last two in the prequel series (even Hayden Christensen's done better). But. There's a problem. The movie has too many villains and sub-plots, which makes it harder to follow and in the end we have no clue who is the real bad guy. All that said, it's totally worth a watch."
888,9,Great ending to the greatest sage of all time!,"I thought this movie was great, but not nearly the best. Even though I was as excited as any other fan I did not think that the movie itself was the greatest. I love the lightsaber duels. These are awesome and exciting, but without the fight scenes I don't really see any other memorable scenes. I think the parts with the jedis dying was sad and the ending where they separate the twins and the creation of Darth Vader was disturbing, yet satisfying. I really did enjoy it and i hate to see it end, but a 9 out of 10 is fair and I think it is good enough to go see the movie again and again. Ian McDiarmid does a great job. His role as the emperor is almost so convincing I want to be a part of the dark side. Hayden Christiansen should think twice about giving up acting. He is not the best actor, but his evil transitions are phenomenal. I have not seen too many actors who have done that well with changing to evil so fast. Ewan McGregor was the best. you just like Obi-Wan Kenobi so much more than when we firstgot to know him. Natalie Portman didn't even try. She did almost terrible. If it weren't for her crying scenes I would have topped it as one of the worst acting roles I have seen in a long time. Samuel Jackson just does not convince me in this role still. I think he is one of the greatest actors but he over acts in Star Wars. I forget I'm even watching him. Maybe George Lucas is that bad at writing dialogue. Above all the characters and planets are beyond awesome. The directing is Lucas' best in a long time. The music is good but not memorable. Williams should have come up with some kind of epic anthem for the last film. I thought it was great and I hope this is not the end of a great saga."
889,4,revenge of the sith... disappointing,"I saw the movie yesterday, and am very disappointed about it. I read so many positive comments, online and in the papers that i am wondering if i saw the same movie."
890,7,"Well, it's good....","""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is possibly the most anticipated movie of the year. And by possibly I mean definitely."
891,10,Fantastic action and explanation of how Anakin became Vader,"Numerous excellent lightsaber duels, good explanation of how a Jedi could turn into Vader, and Natalie Portman is terrific at making you feel the loss she feels when the man she loves turns against her. The fight between 4 Jedi and Palpatine was weak. All the other duels had quick, exciting moves, but this one lagged. "
892,1,A movie that only succeeds on the merits of lowered expectations...,"People have really lowered their standards in many aspects of life. Unfortunately this has also crept into the standard of entertainment we all watch. Let's face a simple truth: after the turd that was episode 1 and the arguably much worse episode 2, anything was bound to look far better by comparison. But when comparing the original trilogy to the prequel turdigy, I want you to consider the themes. Really, what ARE the themes in any of the prequels, even 3? If you're going to say anger for episode 3, that's fine but how does this one theme make this movie any good?! In order for us to enjoy this kind of film we need to have a protagonist we all clearly identify with! And do we identify with any of the Jedi? You might identify with Padme, but she doesn't really do anything except pout, cry and shoot some lasers. She's not a strong character with dimensions like Princess Leia."
893,5,"Best of the prequels, but a disappointment","*sigh*<br /><br />I can't speak for the generation who grew up with this trilogy as their Star Wars - a lot seem to love it. And I can't blame them; I grew up watching the original trilogy, and I love them unreservedly, flaws and all. But when you grew up imagining the Clone Wars, and what Obi-Wan and Anakin were like together as Jedi, when you imagined the story of Anakin's fall as dramatic and tragic, and what you get is this.... well, it's disappointing."
894,3,Episode III doesn't make sense,Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Star Wars and I really wanted to love this movie. I stayed away from all spoilers and even most of the TV spots. I really had hoped that this final movie would answer some questions and would tie in with the original trilogy.
895,1,Clearly this movie is a test...,"for GL to see exactly how gullible his audience is. He literally shat on a really expensive film reel and released this movie, hoping... no, knowing, somehow that people would be all over it like white on rice. The plot makes no emotional sense whatsoever. The core assumption is that the soon-to-be Darth Vader is so deeply in love with Padme (Natalie Portman, who's shown herself to be an artist of at least some depth as of late); but Padme is an empty shell of a woman, weepy, pregnant, dull, blindly attached to Skywalker, though supposedly principled and wise from her time as Queen and in the Senate. The lameness of her ""willing herself to die"" won't even be touched upon here. And can anyone say Cesearean Section?! if DV-to-be was so worried that Padme was going to die in labor, why didn't the couple go to their space-age medical facility and have the babes taken out? She's clearly at least 6 months along and didn't need to carry the kids to term. It's slap-you-in-the-face stupid. "
896,3,"No, it isn't any better","Just as poorly conceived, acted and executed as the first two prequels, the groundswell of support for the latest and (let's hope) final installment in the Star Wars saga can only be chalked up to desperation on behalf of the faithful, desperate to restore luster back to the faded crown of George Lucas and company. As much as one wants to like Episode III, alas, it is just as terrible - a complete failure as a screenplay, loaded with needless scenes and characters, long stretches of tedious action sequences that do nothing to further the plot, more awful CGI and lousy dialog. Even the film's concluding third act wastes most of the opportunities readily inherent in the material - how could such a sure-fire moment as Darth Vader at last donning his helmet have been so squandered? Another mess. Thank god it's the last one and hopefully Lucas will not return to commit more crimes against cinema in the future."
897,3,"Illogical and inconsistent - Good for kids, should be an animated Disney Classic","Count Duku: a great actor like C. Lee, I would at least let him play throughout the film and not kill him off in the first 20 minutes."
898,8,Fun ending to the Star Wars series,"""Star Wars"" goes out with a bang in the last prequel, and the last cinema episode of the saga, ""Revenge of the Sith"". Whilst the film is filled with the usual in-jokes and incidental references that appeal only to hard-core fans, and the last-minute introduction of ambiguity into the otherwise clear-cut moral universe of ""Star Wars"" reduces the emotional impact of the story, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is in the main a great success."
899,1,Truly disappointed !,"not only the way this film has been realized is messy ...the battle scene in the lava has taken 70 000 hours, more than 700 people, for 1 minute length and for what ? a great amount of money has been spent or should have said, spoiled and it is not something that has a great impact on the viewers at the end....not to mention...the fact that Anakin suddenly get evil from one minute to the other...this is not credible in the least... How can he says and believes that a true Jedi should be selfless and care for others for more than half of the movie and want to spare the life of Windu ( Samuel Jackson ) and then Palpatin is taking this chance to kill him and ANAKIN, IS not being in the least surprised, shocked or feeling guilty from this treachery attitude ? Truly disappointed !"
900,6,Finally Lucas Is Able To Redeem Himself,I had walked out of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones feeling utterly disappointed. They same thing with The Phantom Menace. I really had little hope for the third installment of the prequels. I went to see the late show last night and was pleasantly surprised.
901,2,please don't waste your time on this brainless wonder,Painfully moronic dialogue... Stick figure characters... Tediously droll 'action' scenes (aka a plethora of bathroom break time)... Editing via Cuisinart... Story by an ADD 5th grader.. (my apologies for the insult to 5th graders)
902,1,Revenge of the Turd,"This is by far the worst of the bunch. The voice overs, the terrible make up on the emperor, the bad acting, the ridiculous graphics, the cheesy stupid looks Aniken gives you once he turns to the dark side, did I mention the terrible make up on the emperor and his beyond horrible accent? If you really watch this movie and listen to the acting, its comical... Painful Even. Watch it again and study the acting job by all of them. It is so bad I cant believe people gave this turd anything higher than a 2. The acting and voice overs are bush league and a complete embarrassment to the franchise. Go back and watch it again... And really watch and listen To the actors. Director is to blame on this one... Horrible from start to finish..."
903,7,afterthoughts to ROTS...,"I have read hundreds of comments after impulsively posting mine on the week that this film was first released, and they were all good, bad, and ugly. But mostly good and ugly for the record. Being that I have been a fan since seeing the original at the golden, impressionable age of six, I worshipped the original trilogy and watched the first two cringing with inner trepidation. And despite of their flaws (and God were there SO many), I still secretly enjoyed ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"". And going to that theatre with the same trepidation/defense-mechanism that I had developed since 1999, I was expecting the worst. Many elements that destroyed the magic that the OT brought us and the PT raped us of were still present: the wooden acting and 5th-grade dialogue; the overuse of CGI; the protracting exposition. Although Ewan McGregor always had command of his role as Obi Wan Kenobi and was always able to deliver the most ridiculous of lines with such panache in these films. He has always made these films watchable (Liam Neeson wasn't that bad either in ""Episode I""). Ewan's uncanny Alec Guinness-like presence makes one think that they tweeked archived footage from ""The Bridge Over River Kwai"" at times and used that instead."
904,1,"Too much talk, not enough action",What a disappointment. Yak. Yak. Yak. I began looking at my watch to see the time remaining about forty minutes into the movie. Looking around the theater I wasn't the only one doing so. 
905,9,A Must see for Star Wars Fans,"Episode III, written and directed by George Lucas, had the task of bridging the 28 year gap between Episodes I-II and Episodes IV-VI, so let me put that one to rest quickly for all you fans out there  it was done superbly as only the creator himself could have done. Episode III continues the torments of Anakin Skywalker, believed to be the Chosen One by some in the Jedi Order, but having lost his mother in Episode II, Anakin is now consumed by the thought that he will lose his wife, Padme, and that thought drives his conflicts about whether to support the Jedi, who offer wisdom, or Chancellor Palpatine who offers Anakin the secrets of life and death through the dark side. You know the choice Anakin makes, so the question is whether Lucas convinces us as to why Anakin goes over to the dark side. And that also is handled quit well. I actually found myself siding with Anakin a few times, asking myself how could they do that to him? As far as the world goes, it's rich and spectacular, if only we could have spent a little bit more time exploring it, but ""the worlds"" are only a background to Anakin's story  as it should be. So what can I add? The special effects are incredible, the battles stupendous, the light saber duels better than all before, and as a friend said, all to come. The scene of Darth Vader's rising before our eyes, an instant classic for film fandom, can only be compared to the creation of Frankenstein's monster. This isn't the greatest film ever made, but it is a great Star Wars film  a must-see for fans. Unfortunately, if you are not familiar with what's come before or after before you see III, there is no way you will be able to appreciate all the nuances. Tomorrow, I plan on watching my copy of Episode IV, because it will have more dimension than ever now. You may have also heard that this is the first Star Wars film to earn a PG-13, and while there are some terrible images planted into our heads, this plot is actually the most adult oriented, dealing with inner conflict and politics, so expect the little ones to stir in their seats between the battles."
906,5,"To paraphrase Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon, ""I'm too old for this Sith"".","I went to see Star Wars at my local Warner Village in Newcastle under Lyme, and who should be there in person but Darth Vader himself, Dave Prowse! I was gutted that I didn't know in advance or I'd have brought my one of my Hammer DVDs for him to sign. He once played Frankenstein's monster, created by Peter Cushing's Baron. I was there too late to go home and get it, so I just went and spoke to him instead. He seemed quite pleased that I wanted to talk about Hammer films as no doubt everyone else was all about Star Wars. He was charging £20 for signed photos, so I made do with a handshake."
907,10,'Sith' does not disappoint,"It's the final instalment in the prequel saga and George Lucas certainly doesn't disappoint. If you thought 'The Phantom Menance' and 'Attack of the Clones' were terrible, then you're going to knocked out of your socks by 'Revenge of the Sith' because it is absolutely awesome! Clearly good Ole George was saving all the best stuff until last."
908,9,Nobody is better than Lucas,I don't know what people are being so bored of the first and the second part of the new star wars episodes when i look at the forth and the fifth episodes they look a lot like the first and the second but this time Lucas decided to go back to the very roots of Anakin when he is 10 years old when Luke was 10 he was probably colecting the harvest what's fun about that.Personally first second and third episodes show more about the nature and the feelings and the inner self of Anakin.Luke's personality is incomplete for me but seeing Anakin grow into a wise jedi and throw it away for the one thing he loved the most it's so much more powerful than Luke's love for his sister and his father.And am i the only one who notices that in the final battle between Luke and anakin in episode 6 anakin gives away the battle at the end before Luke s last strokes he just slides on the grond with no reason.As to revenge of the sith it's the best star wars ever because here there are no jokes no funny little aliens to amuse us this is a grown up movie a serious one which is more pationed and powerful than the older ones so that is why i like it.You never saw hate in the old episodes and true love as well and defiance.I love the new characters and jar jar is cool i prefer him to the silly little aliens at episode 6.So this is the best SW movie by far.
909,7,"Everyone will watch it, but is it worth it?","I really liked the atmosphere of the film, all the CGI and the acting of the supporting cast. But for me the film fails miserably exactly with the main story, what should have been the best of it - the birth of Vader. No way could Lucas make me believe that what was happening would force Anakin so easily to join the dark side. And all that cheesy drama doesn't belong to such a would-be classic. That's why I rate it so low. Also there are some so clichéd moments destroying the main plot, that you'd probably laugh at, but i won't spoil it to you, cause it's clear everyone will watch this movie. Only cause we're fans of Episodes 4-6."
910,9,This delivers. And then some.,"I managed to get myself invited to the 1st UK screening on Sunday morning and was surprised at my own excitement. After all, I thought the last 2 in the instalment were dire, and, of the first lot, I only really think that The Empire Strikes Back is truly great as a film."
911,9,Its Amazing!,"The Star Wars saga continues in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Episode III stars Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christen. In Episode III Anakin Skywalker goes to the dark side of the force and the continuing Clone Wars and the final fate of the Old Republic are revealed. Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is an amazing movie with great special effects, acting and fight scenes. Two of the many amazing fight scenes are Anakin vs Obi-Wan and Obi Wan vs General Grievous. George Lucas has directed and written another masterpiece in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of The Sith. Star Wars Episode III is an amazing movie and a must see and I give it a 9 out of 10 which is the same rating I gave episodes I and II."
912,10,The dark side of the force has consumed you.,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. The dark side of the force has consumed you. One of the most difficult episodes of the space saga. Betrayal, death, torment and drama. At the same time, the lightsaber fights are very beautifully staged."
913,10,This is where the fun begins...,"Entertaining, exciting, and tragic. Ol' George does it again."
914,8,Never Believe a Sith,"While ""Revenge of the Sith"" is much better than the last two Star Wars, it is not as good as the first 3. And like the last two, the missing element is that the characters lack personality. But ""Revenge of the Sith"" makes a big improvement because the characters show more emotion and therefore we care more about them more."
915,5,"The best of the new trilogy, but can't quite reach the heights of the original three...","With Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas redeems himself for the first two Star Wars 'prequels', however he is unable to escape the huge weight of expectations which were placed upon him by older fans since the completion of the original trilogy in 1983. "
916,7,Doesn't suck?!,"Any spoilers contained herein are for the people who will be shocked to learn that Darth Vader is really Luke's father, or that Bruce Willis was dead all along. I'm just putting that warning there for good measure."
917,10,Almost perfect,"The Revenge of the Sith was one of most expected movie over last 2 years and I have to admit I am not disappointed. I don't think it makes sense to discuss the visual effects as this part of all episodes is outstanding. What makes me feel again like 30 years ago is the climate of the movie. Once again I could feel ""electrocity"" when watching intrigue made by senator Palpatine and once again I could sense something intangible...THE FORCE. It is a pity that the spirit of THE FORCE was lost in Episode I when Quin-Gon discovered large amount of midichlo(something) in blood of young Anakin. Before then I was pretty sure that THE FORCE is something one has to feel and no blood or urine test are necessary to make sure that someone has it or not. "
918,10,George Lucas gets it right!,"After the extremely disappointing ""Attack of the Clones"", I was expecting next to nothing from the next instalment in the Star Wars saga— ""Revenge of the Sith"". Luckily, ""Revenge of the Sith"" completely outdid its predecessor. For once, George Lucas got it completely right: a good story, good acting, great special effects, and John Williams' fabulous music all add up to create a really good movie."
919,10,The Perfect Tragedy,The story of Anakin Skywalker is just so heartbreaking. The amount of loss he has been through and the amount of manipulation that was done to him is insurmountable. I just wish he would have left to Naboo with Padme to raise their child once they learned she was pregnant. His feelings got the best of him. Such a heartbreaking story.
920,4,great CGI action but tired dialog and bad Christensen acting,"After three years of the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine is kidnapped by the besieging droid army led by from General Grievous. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) kill Count Dooku to rescue Palpatine. Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) reveals her pregnancy. Anakin falls under the spell of Palpatine who suggests a way to surpass death with the Dark Side as the Jedi Order starts to suspect an insidious plan."
921,7,Worked for me and my daughter,"My 12 year old daughter and I saw the movie on opening ""afternoon"". Theater was filled more than I thought it would be for this time of day on a Thursday. We noticed at least one light saber in the audience, which both of us thought was cool. She had tried to talk me into the midnight showing, but with school and work looming....."
922,9,What have you been waiting for . . .,"So if you have been waiting since 1977 to see how it all began for the first time you may have been a little disappointed; if, however you have been waiting since 1999 to see the transformation of a boy to a Lord then this was more than worth the wait. Now we can argue plot vs. book, that as in all cases is your imagination vs. someone else, and that simply does not give this film the chance it has earned. From the moment we begin until the very bitter and angry end Revenge of the Sith does not disappoint. I would strongly recommend this film to any fan new or old not only for its fantastic visuals but also for the complete closure or opening that we could only take into our own minds eye."
923,10,Review- Contains Spoilers,"A truly awesome movie, it recaptures the magic of the first one."
924,1,"Is it possible to have ""spoilers"" with this one?","I was very optimistic about this one after all the positive reviews. What a disappointment. I think, in a way, that it was worse than the other two because the ending was so very very dumb."
925,10,"Excellent !, Amazing, Impressive",Lucas did it right this time. I think that the first minutes of this movie set a new standard about how to deal with epic battles. I hope this technology reach more and more movies.
926,,They saved the best for last !,"The film has a slow start but the suspense and action builds as the film goes further. George Lucas redeemed himself after the flaw in Star Wars trilogy, Episode 2 was produced and released. Little romance, a lot of action in Episode 3 and a lot of romance and little action was the problem with episode 2. Ewan Macgregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, and the rest of the Star Wars crew deliver great performances once again. Yoda may lose the final battle against the Emperor, but still kicks butt. The special effects, crew, casting, and direction are combine to provide a great Star Wars film and maybe the best out of the six. Finally, I can say It's safe to be a Star Wars fan again. If you have not seen this film, go out and see it because if you like star wars this is one film you'll never forget."
927,10,Really enjoyed it,"Star Wars has been a part of my life for a long time, and I'm very fond of it. I've watched all of the movies and most of the TV shows. Out of all of them, I've found that this one entertains me the most. While a lot of dialogue in it is a bit odd, and the romance aspect of it can be a bit much sometimes, lots of those aspects have been put in a different light to me from the millions of memes created from this movie alone. This movie also does a great job of connecting episodes 1 and 2 with the original trilogy in ways such as revealing the Venator class Star Destroyer, showing how Palpatine was able to wipe out the Jedi, seeing how Luke and Leia were hidden away on different planets, the rise of Darth Vader, and many more things. While this movie won't be for everyone, it's one of my favorite Star Wars movies and much better than anything Disney has made."
928,2,Better than Star Wars 4 and 5 but still a mediocre movie.,I give this 2 out of 10.
929,8,The first Star Wars movie to do war right,"This movie is great. Unfortunately, because of how memed it's become, it's hard to take seriously. But this is a very dark story done very well. The Obi-Wan and Anakin duel is probably the most intense fight in cinema history."
930,8,'...Like a hit song that sounds better when played again...',"Blinding special effects that do just that. Blind us in places to some of the drama of the dialogue to follow. BUT...that can't be helped, can it? A second viewing of this film will reap rewards you that would surprise you. Like a hit song that sounds better when played again. The intensity and drama in this film are shadowed by the epic and breathtaking action sequences, but it is the drama that ultimately makes this film a true classic. After the second viewing, it is possible to understand the tragedy and pain that Anakin is truly suffering, that your senses struggle to take in on first view as they struggle to adapt from turbo boosted action scenes into deep dialogue. George Lucas does attempt, and in my opinion succeeds, in finally getting some semblance of this across in an extended finale of tying up of loose ends after the end fight sequences. And just when u think it may be beginning to drag, he adds a nice twist that adds to the tragedy and despair of the situation. In my eyes, this managed to match the ending of empire strikes back, not in spite of the fact that in this you already know what was to follow, but because of it. U can feel Anakins pain (even if u don't like him), Yoda's despair, Obi-wan's loss, even the malevolence of the truly excellent (could I risk brilliant?) Ian Macdiarmid as Darth/Lord Sidious. Intense. But granted, it did take a second viewing for me to appreciate the majority of this."
931,5,"Much better than the last two, this motion picture is","I realize there's a whole generation of American moviegoers who erroneously believe American cinema - or cinema itself - didn't begin until 1977 with the release of ""Star Wars."""
932,4,Finally---a Star Wars film designed just for kids and dumb people!,"Well, at the outset, this film already lost a point or two from me since it, once again, features that nauseating character ""Jar-Jar"". While some of my friends pointed out that he wasn't in this film as much as in the previous two, having him in the film at all makes me hate the movie. Why George Lucas dogmatically refused to admit that this character was a HUGE marketing mistake AND that he even went back to the earlier films to add him into irrelevant scenes for the DVD release is beyond me. Obviously, he is NOT a person who can admit he was wrong! All the unpurchased Jar-Jar merchandise sitting on store shelves as well as all the ""I hate Jar-Jar"" web sites SHOULD be an indication that he is less than loved by the public!"
933,10,"Underrated classic, great film","I love all three of the prequel trilogy movies, but this one is my favorite, it's fun to watch, has great action/fight scenes and finishes an character arc that started in the first movie, in a really good way."
934,,this one delivers,"Connect-the-dots installment of the Star Wars saga centers around Anakin Skywalker as his loyalty and commitment to the Jedi Council, his passionate love for Padmé Amidala, and his insatiable hunger for power ultimately seal his fate as he's seduced by the dark side of the Force. This leads him into conflict with friend and master Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Knights as he suddenly becomes a dangerous threat to the Republic which he once so proudly served. Not likely to win any writing awards for its occasionally banal dialogue, but the story is compelling, the pace swift and exciting, and the battle scenes simply breathtaking. The most memorable and entertaining prequel in the Star Wars series. ***"
935,10,2nd best of the Star Wars saga behind Episode I,"Revenge of the Sith is a ton of fun. It has everything I could ever ask for in a movie(like The Phantom Menace) and is the darkest of the saga. It has amazing CGI, amazing performances, amazing action scenes, amazing characters, and an amazing score. Although there is a dark heart in Episode III, there is still humor involved, and it's actually funny(ex. ""Flying is for droids""). ROTS features a few of the best action scenes in the series- Yoda vs. Sidious(both the lightsaber battle and the flying discs) Anakin vs. Dooku Anakin vs. Obi-Wan Order 66 Intro dogfight Mace Windu vs. Palpatine Overall, ROTS is a fantastic movie for everyone filled with heart-pounding action scenes, good humor, stunning visual effects, top-notch performances, and a dark heart. Prepare to be dazzled."
936,4,Darth's Draggy Debut,"I checked out of the ""Star Wars"" target demographic long ago, and can only look at the newer films with disengagement. Is it me, or is it writer-director George Lucas?"
937,10,Amazing!,Most bad reviews are just people that are all-in Original Trilogy fans thinking the Prequels are a piece of garbage barely even giving a chance watching the movies.
938,1,I don't get it.,"Why do we get that awesome camera ""eye"" in the first 5-7 minutes of the movie, then get stuck in that old Lucas-Kurosawa mode for the rest of the movie? The answer might be... Lucas doesn't care. All he has to do is put ""Star Wars"" up on the marquee and people will come running to buy tickets. It doesn't make any sense to show a story of what we already know will happen, and then not throw any technical innovations at us. The future of the movies is a camera ""eye"" that moves in and out of different points of view, swooping, dancing, making use of 3 dimensions. What we get here is just a static camera, except for the first minutes that I reference at the start of the article. These prequels should be considered a scandal as to the quality of the writing, acting, and yes, the visual effects, which for the most part, do not impress. Why should anyone be surprised when the man himself is on record as saying ""Empire didn't need to be that good""."
939,5,"Well, it wasn't Gigli, but . . .",The good news: Revenge of the Sith is visually sumptuous; each new world created is exquisite. The CGI techs who put together the backdrops did themselves very proud.
940,5,Waste,"Both my wife and I decided that the screening audiences had to have been too intimidated by George Lucas to comment on the fact that there is no dialogue or story underpinning the very pretty pictures. Maybe George just sees more in a scene than the rest of us and tries to minimize lines to avoid taking away from the pictures. Still this is at best boring, stilted, and at times comical in the inconsistencies of the actions, powers, and knowledge of the characters. Really, until the end no one is supposed to suspect that Darth is the father? Please! Everyone could have died at the end and there would be no sense of loss. I've seen them all from the beginning and after the first 3 there has been no quality in these films worth mentioning. The critics live in world of awe for the directors or executive producers and have had to swallow Kubrick's last picture and most of Spielberg's recent stuff knowing that they are addressing icons. Sorry. Nothing worse than genius that has lost its special gift. Few are great for a life time. These have left their great works far behind them. We can only be glad that the first 3 had a special quality. Enjoy the good and try to tolerate the rest."
941,1,"If the DGA were survivor, Lucas would have been voted off a long time ago in this galaxy","I saw the movie twice- the second time because I missed some stuff the first due to my sobbing, the second viewing I enjoyed quite a bit (as a comedy). Having grown up with these films I was amazed at how much the originator himself could mess things up. The one thing that we strive for as filmmakers is a terrific story to tell- something that is timeless. Lucas's story is AMAZING- everything you could ask for- a story that every filmmaker wishes they could tell! Until the Editor in Lucas got in his way. CGI is there to help us make our films- not take over- and from the CGI fire and computer game like scenes to the CGI ""baby Luke""- things began to go down hill. But the horror of the ruination of one of the most timeless stories of our time didn't end there- if it did I may have been able to overlook Lucas's EGO (gigantic as it is)- the writing was excruciating! I understand Clarity- but scene after scene driving in the point that Anakin is doing this for Padme- the whole time not FEELING that he is doing it for Padme- this film has bigger issues that gaining clarity (which is the only thing it did achieve). He assumes we, as audience member are idiots from the very beginning, TELLING us everything we need- in the first thirty minutes there is not a single line that requires SUBTEXT!- we are told absolutely everything the characters are doing or feeling. ANAKIN: ""I had a dream"" PADME ""Was it Bad?"" (""No it was terrific I'm sitting here in a cold sweat because it's fun"") / YODA: Hello Count or should I say LORD SIDIOUS (God I am so glad Yoda explained that because I had not guessed from Episode One that that guy was actually the Emperor in the end!) OK so not verbatim but we get the point. The only good scenes were the ones with no dialog- The Jedi Dieing- Conversations between R2 and C- 3PO- Though Ewan McGregor did a great job pulling his weight (The relationship between he and Anakin was the only one that I began to FEEL) and Haden ""Whiner"" Christiansen wasn't helping. But I'd have to say my favourite part of this failure was the directing- or complete lack thereof. I felt terrible for Natalie Portman, who directors can get a good performance from, of course it helps when you aren't fighting the lines you have to deliver. Above all, however, directing the terrible CGI- the even worse love scenes, the KILLER directing really came into play in a sequence which should have been the most impressive part of the entire movie. From the time the Vader helmet tilted into frame at 36 fps to the cheap inserts of breaking glass to the Frankenstein like escape and my favourite line of the whole movie ""NO!"" (which summed up my feelings precisely) George Lucas managed to make the most frightening film villain of so many generations (After Hitler) the equivalent of his SNL counterpart- though the SNL version may have been closer. In the end, Vader crosses his arms in front of his chest- a HUGE body language movement for and actor- and more importantly one that Vader would have never made!- and Lucas- the director- Let it into the film! But we have to give Lucas more credit than just coming up with the most amazing idea of our time and then ruining it- for even though he redefined every character (suddenly R2 can jettison himself and catch things) and completely changed some parts of the galaxy- simply because he thought it was cool- he did keep in the cheesy 1970's wipes and if you wanna keep anything about your style it's the cheesy 70's wipes! I think what bothers me the most is the amazing potential of this terrific story (I mean the old ones are amazing- and the story line for the new ones even better) but because he could not turn it over to another writer and director (like he did with Return of the Jedi- the best of Star Wars) and because he had to show off what Lucas film computers can do (which isn't as much as he thinks) he ruined the Star Wars of OUR children's childhood."
942,9,Awesome movie,The circle is now complete with this 6th movie which was great fun to watch but also an extremely emotional experience.
943,7,Tottally Awesome!!!,Warning: Contains LOTS of spoilers.
944,2,From film creator to film crater,"I have just watched this movie on DVD with the family and the verdict is unanimous...this film is utter garbage! My kids stopped watching after about 45 minutes and found something else to do while we adults (unfortunately) continued watching hoping for an improvement that never came. I don't know where to start- there are too many starting points available...Suffice to say that there are many wheel-done reviews here already summarizing the flagrant weaknesses of this film. The night before I watched a TV doc on the making of the original Star Wars episodes where we see Lucas struggle to bring his films and vision to the screen. At the end of the documentary Lucas, after having achieved fame and fortune, says that he has now ironically become the studio establishment boss that he initially set out to circumvent. Truer words were never spoken! Welcome to Hollywood!!"
945,8,"Rational Review, Better than I and II, Visually Amazing, but Still Something Missing",Let me begin by stating growing up that I was a huge Star Wars fan. I was one who was extremely disappointed at the Phantom Menace (e.g. I hated it) and thought Clones was just going through the motions.
946,8,"As of 2017, this is the fourth best SW film IMO","The prequels get a ton of hate but the hate for the third prequel is unfounded if you ask me. Sure, sure the first half of the film is a little rocky but the second half more than makes up for it. The tone is mature and dark. The lightsaber battles are intense. Even what's his name acting is a little better. But yeah, the original three are head over heels better. At least Revenge of the Sith is better than Force Awakens. As far as I'm concerned the current Star Wars universe is nothing but filler. A total cash grab on the level of those stupid Transformer movies."
947,4,"Thrilling plot, limited by Lucas's usual flaws","This film was guaranteed success and praise from fans of the original trilogy. Many hated Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace but this was always going to be better because it links with the original films. Revenge of the Sith has a great plot which a good film could have been made out of but George Lucas fails in his execution. The dialogue is painfully bad and the acting is wooden. The main intrigue of the film was how Anakin turned to the Dark Side but there is little explanation of how this happened. The film doesn't explore Anakin's psychology or create a character which intrigues us. The fact is that Lucas has always been limited in these areas. He created a great concept but has never been a good director. The Empire Strikes Back is the only Star Wars film I consider great, it was the only one with real depth and the only one not directed by George Lucas."
948,1,Scenery Chewing Debacle,"Okay, I'll cop to this up front. I'm not of the Star Wars faithful. I thought it was a poorly done excuse for compelling science fiction back in 1976 and nothing has changed. George Lucas has perfected the art of printing money thanks to a generation of paying customers who think that visual and audio stimulation, combined with cheesy and unconvincingly delivered dialogue, makes for a good film franchise. The geeks will slap down their money at least ten times each for this chunk. The profit machine that is Star Wars is not in doubt. However, don't try to sell me the fiction that this is good film making. Where to start? The acting was horrific in ""Revenge of the Sith"". The story was apparently doodled on the back of a matchbook cover. The good guys dress like fashion challenged apostles and the bad guys resemble mechanized cartoon insects. The fight scenes look exactly as they did 30 years ago. Dialogue is delivered awkwardly and oh so s-l-o-w-l-y to suggest that what is being said is grandly significant. If you're a Star Wars fan, you will pay and gush and pay and gush again and again. If they ever finally do move out of their parent's basements, they may realize that they are only worshipping at the altar of the greatest marketing machine ever conceived. There's not a thing wrong with money, but just once, give the rest of us something worth paying for. You shouldn't have to be a hardened cult member to enjoy a film. Though I was dragged to ""Revenge of the Sith"" by a friend, I take full responsibility for utterly wasting $9.75. I can only hope that George Lucas will invest my money in a used copy of ""Screenplay"" by Syd Field."
949,10,Very satisfying,"First off, let me say that I would not take my ten year old nephew to this film, which is disturbing both visually and emotionally in places. I would say 12 or 13 would likely be fine, but the PG (parental guidance) part of PG-13 should be taken under advisement. The up-side of the disturbing images is that Lucas has finally shown a more realistic view of the consequences of war and violence, a complaint I've had with the cartoonish violence shown in the other films."
950,10,Execute order 66,This is the final from the prequel trilogy and is chronologically the third movie of the franchise.
951,6,Of course this movie is going to look incredible when we were fed crap for so many years.,"The syndrome works like this - If you are given nothing but McDonalds food for two weeks, and then one day you are taken to TGI Fridays, the food at Fridays is naturally going to seem far better than it really is. Episodes 1 & 2 were bad. So bad in fact, that we (as an audience) were willing and ready to latch on to anything that was remotely better. Then came 3. Ep 3 is NOT a great movie, but it sure as hell is going to seem like it in the wake of Ep 1 & 2."
952,5,Unconvinced,The story just looks forced to me: 
953,9,Revenge of the Sith does not disappoint.,"After liking the first two Star Wars but feeling that they were missing something I was very pleased to see that Revenge of the Sith was all that I hoped for. It was visually spectacular as were all of the Star Wars movies but now the characters have matured and we do care about what happens to them. You may, if you allow yourself, even shed a tear or two. For those who like to see Jedi fighting Revenge of the Sith has no less than five impressive light saber duels including Obi-Wan taking on the four armed General Grievous who fights with a light saber in each hand. Yoda once again shows that he is a fordable fighter as he takes on the Emperor. And of course there is the spectacular battle between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader. The film also links the two trilogies together quite nicely even introducing some of the familiar ships from A New Hope. After seeing Revenge of the Sith you can watch the original trilogy with a new perspective that adds to the whole experience. Revenge of the Sith is definitely fun, impressive and worth seeing."
954,7,By far the best in the prequel trilogy,"Episode I was an overall disappointing movie - it's successor, a slight improvement, but nowhere near being good - The third and final installment in the trilogy, the good one! Yes, I just said that. Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a good movie."
955,7,"Ego, George, ego!","Like many of the reviewers here, I grew up with the ""Star Wars"" movies and was enthralled by them. Of course, looking back, I can see their defects: the clunky writing, stagy dramatics, the weird mishmash of acting styles, and so on, but there is an attraction to the movies even today. As much as I wanted to love the last of the ""Star Wars"" movies, I cannot embrace it completely. It has the same problems as the previous ones: lifeless dialog, non actors and non acting, and a triumph of computer graphics over any human engagement or emotion. The difference this time is that things have been pumped up to an almost operatic excess, but without the rigid underpinnings that would make it work. Hayden Christensen's Darth Vader remains the same as his Anakin Skywalker, a lumpen, petulant crybaby who's transformation into Vader is so unconvincing as to be laughable. Lucas' own misstep here, I think, is to fall back on the lame love story between Skywalker and Amidala; Skywalker is more interesting in his moments of hubris and arrogance (Christensen's petulance comes off more convincingly here), than in his stilted, grade school ""all we need is our love"" scenes with Natalie Portman, who is as much a non-actor as Christensen is. The scene of Vader (now possessing James Earl Jones' iconic voice) screaming ""noooo!"" in slow motion shows that Lucas did not pay nearly enough attention to the quality of his script as he claimed he did, or those who surround him are as bereft of dramatic judgment as he is (honestly, were any of you out there moved by that hokey moment?). That said, the computer effects are impressive, there is no doubt about that, the fight scenes are excellent, especially the concluding Vader/Kenobi duel (at least when no one is talking or attempting to emote, though Kenobi's final words to Vader are effective). Lucas is to be congratulated for not tip toeing around Vader's transformation into a cruel figure, he slaughters little children, his friends and allies, and even nearly kills his own wife. These scenes work simply because the innate dramatic intensity of the scenes (the the weight of the entire series) come to the forefront, rather than the unconvincing dramatic chops of his leads. The fact that a good portion of the movie is fighting, flying, and killing is what, in my mind, rates it as high as it does, these scenes are excellent in their own right. If only Lucas' ego hadn't gotten in the way, and he turned the script over to a writer of talent!"
956,10,Finally... a heart-breaking and emotional Star Wars movie,"I walked into this movie expecting to be upset by Anakin being converted to the Dark Side, and I assumed that Padme was going to do die somehow, because she isn't in the other three movies. However, I walked out of the movie, not only upset for Anakin, but crying and grieving for the conclusion of the film, and I'm a guy!"
957,10,Excellent Star Wars movie,"It's a really excellent Star Wars movie. Avoid all those reviews that give it a 1 they went in expecting bad things as usual, to nitpick at everything instead of listing any good things whatsoever. Well it's not up to par w/ the original trilogy, but surpasses Episode I and II (despite me enjoying them). OK I just wanted to give it a 10 so it can stay in the top 250, but now it's dropped to 249 :(. All the actors do a fine job despite a few overacted scenes including the so called romantic scenes w/Anakin and Padme, ""Palpatine's No, No, No You will die"" line. However, storyline is good, characters are great, but the best lies w/ the Visual Effects, they are the best I've ever seen for awhile especially in the 1st 10 minutes and the climax in the Mustafar scenes. Anyway, if you really thought it was excellent, see it as many times as possible."
958,1,just plain garbage,"I am not a hater, I used to be a star wars fan. I waited in line for hours to see The Empire Strikes Back. I was so hyped when the new story line started. I was like a kid again. But from jar-jar to this movie.....I have come to the conclusion, I am going to sell my DVD trilogy collection from the first three. My 2 year old son said it was stupid. The price paid for this movie to be made could have repaired all the damage from hurricane Katrina and the Pakistan earthquake and no one would have noticed that this film had not been made. This whole crappy movie was a spoiler. It spoiled my memories from childhood and each of the sorry ""prequels"" only made it worse. An average of $7 a ticket.....makes me want to puke."
959,8,The best Star Wars Prequel,"I will try not to include any spoilers in here.<br /><br />First off, i am a huge star wars fan and watched the originals and prequels several times, with empire strikes back being one of my favourite movies. I will have to admit george lucas and his career are going down the drain nowadays but he had something that the new star wars films(with the exception of rogue one) could not beat: imagination:<br /><br />Positive:<br /><br />Lightsaber fights<br /><br />The acting is the best out of all of the prequels( though samuel l jackson feels out of place in this franchise, hayden christensen is sometimes unbalanced in his performance but his performance has improved)<br /><br />The visuals obviously<br /><br />No more jar jar binks moments(except for two brief appearances)<br /><br />The story is dark and one of the best stories in the star wars franchise since empire strikes back.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />some of the dialogue can be irritating <br /><br />A few unanswered questions(look at star wars the clone wars for answers)"
960,9,Nothing Could Prepare Me For This,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) 
961,5,Even Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett couldn't save this one...,"For those Star Wars fans who don't know who Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett are, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Lawrence Kasdan was the screenplay writer who helped edit out most of Lucas's God awful dialog and Leigh Brackett, was the one who wrote the original screenplay Empire Strikes Back. Maybe they deserve more credit for making Star Wars the success that it is because, without them the franchise just sucks."
962,5,"First 110 minutes below-average, then 30 minutes of sheer magic!","Even though I am a huge Star Wars and Sci-Fi fan, I cannot ignore the first 110 minutes of the movie. Almost the exact feel of Attack of the Clones, with wooden acting, horrible laughable dialog, and twice the CGI needed to tell the story (how I longed for the dogfights of the original movies). All the heart, bravery, and emotion of the first movies is still missing, instead while watching I am constantly aware that actors are standing in front of blue screens, and cannot see what the final product will look like. Again, I yearn for real sets and locations, and I would rather see an elephant in a costume (Banthas) than a CGI lizard any day."
963,9,Lucas Getting all...Philosophical?,"""Well, that's the real trick, isn't it...The ""how"" and the ""who"" are just scenery, prevents 'em from asking the most important question: Why?"" -- Mr. X, ""JFK"""
964,4,i am sorry Lucas,"This movie and other star wars movies are all cinema industry movies. As a person who looks and searches the real art cinema like Tarkovsky, Bergman,Bresson, Sokurov etc. , for me these Star Wars series are just a kiddie level of cinema. That is ,they are technological achievements, but no human inside, no art inside and no ""real cinema"" inside. Sorry from all star wars fans, but you are all watching just a technology ,special effect movie for dummies. Not a piece of art. These movies entertains, make people have fun, but nothing else. No thinking, no feeling, no real human, no heart, no brain. Lucas, Spielberg and directors like them killing the cinema itself. Because for those directors, the real cinema artists like Bela Tarr, Alexander Sokurov or for example Terrence Malick have no chance to distribute their movies because of the wild Hollywood hegemony."
965,2,Extra Ordinary Again,"Saw this film on 06/04/05, so the ""hype"" was over by then. There was almost no audience reaction to it, except for 1 scene, where there was some modest laughter."
966,10,George Lucas' Masterpiece,"I thought this was edge of the seat material from the moment the curtains opened. Action from beginning to end, great story line and amazing special effects that still hold up in 2020."
967,2,Did Lucas' children write and direct this movie?,"This movie had so much going for it, and in the end it didn't live up to any of my expectations. I disliked the dialog in the first two films in the new trilogy, but the dialog in this film is ten times worse. The acting is so emotionless across the board that I have to give R2 the best performance nod. It is hard to make all these great actors look like they are half awake. The worst part is however the plot. Padme was once a strong independent senator that made incredibly intelligent decisions. In this firm, she acts as if she has the IQ of a beach ball. Same thing can be said about Anakin. All the flying must have gotten to him in the end... People can love each other so much that they do horrible things, but the scenario in the firm is just not believable especially considering what is at stake. I might as well have read a short story on this and that would have provoked more emotion out of me. Shame on you Lucas."
968,6,Logically Confusing,"Like so many others, I was looking forward to this film. And considering most aspects, viewers will not be disappointed. The action is relentless. The pace is breathtaking. The betrayals and reversals are heart-wrenching. It is exactly as predicted: the darkest of all 6 Star Wars movies."
969,9,The power of character building emphasized in best of three,"As the Clone War rages on, Anakin (Christensen) is angry with the Jedi Council's decision to not make him a Jedi master, which leads him to find comfort and advice in Chancellor Palpatine (McDiarmid) as his visions of his wife's death plague his dreams."
970,10,"The Force will be with you, always...","What a ride, George. What a ride."
971,10,fantastic ending of a saga,"A bit more than a year ago, I wrote my comment for Star Wars Episode II. I wrote that Episode I was a good movie, but not Star Wars-good, that Episode II was a lot better and that I couldn't wait to watch Episode III. Episode I was with Jar-Jar and a really annoying Jake Lloyd a movie for the kids, Episode II with waaaaay too much romance and an annoying Christensen was more for the ladies, and Episode III is a movie I adore! It's got great special effects (the vehicles look as 'used' as they did in the original Saga, not so fancy as in Episode I), Christensen has obviously had some great acting lessons, the tad of romance(/drama), although corny (""You've changed"", ""You're breaking my heart"" and ""I don't know you anymore""), is not irritating (mostly becáuse it's just a tad this time), the added humor is better than in the two other prequels and the space and light-saber battles are downright amazing! There are some nods to the clone wars, like Anakin's scar, 3PO's new color, the kidnapping of Palpatine and the breathing problems of General Grievous, sadly these nods won't be picked up in many countries (one of my friends asked me, ""if that General Grievous is a robot, why does he seem to be so ill?"") since they didn't show up on TV but as I've seen them, I myself can't complain (I downloaded them, as I did with season one and two, these however have just recently made it to DVD in the Netherlands). I love to see the Star Wars Saga completed, and I love that it ended with such a great movie. Two thumbs up!"
972,,The First and Last Star Wars Prequel To Deserve Respect.,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM, BE AWARE."
973,10,Best movie ever,"I don't care what the reviews say, this is the best movie I've ever seen!"
974,10,AMAZING!,A spectacular film from start to finish! A must watch!
975,6,I mean...it's fine,"It's the best prequel, but not that good. The acting is really bad for the most part, especially Anakin."
976,10,Wonderful Film... Stands Out... Bridges The Gap,"There is no getting around the fact that Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a great film. It is unlike any of the previous Star Wars films, both the Original Trilogy and the prequels. The movie is very dark and intense, even brutal at times. It is not a gore-fest, but this movie is definitely not for little kids and the PG-13 rating is appropriate. The movie seems to stand out on its own as more of a bridge between the old and new than an ending to the prequel trilogy. It is the best of the prequels (and I liked the previous 2) and is on par with Return of the Jedi."
977,8,I love Star Wars,"This is a feeling that I have been experiencing for a long time since I set out to see again the saga that amazed me as a child, I love star wars I understand their mistakes and I embrace them as a friend is honestly amazing how this saga has marked me, George lucas thank you for everything, The birth of Dark Vader is the only scene that even knowing that it is inevitable what will happen manages to move me, as a slave boy hoping to save the people he loves falls into the wrong steps, it is nothing that is really new, but with an almost infinite universe memorable characters and historical scenes in the film is inevitable to see it as something perfect."
978,5,Far from great,"First, the winner of the ""Samuel L. Jackson 'Phoning it In' Award"" was not Mr. Jacskon for this film, it was Ms. Portman. But I think this has more to do with the general problem of the film: an awkward, disengaging (not just unengaging) script and a director who is a master on the technical aspects but just doesn't allow for any type of real interplay between the characters or for any rhythm in the dialog. While I do believe this is the most enjoyable of the second Trilogy, I am ever reminded that without a sense of ""fun"" or a stand-in for the rogue-ish charm of a Han Solo character, the characters seem stiff and whiny. Also, (the spoiler bit), I would have been happier with the characterization of Light v. Dark Sides if the Emperor and Vader were still shone to have ""good"" goals pursued with ""evil"" means because the Jedi way just wasn't getting it done. The point-of-view argument at the end should have been staged as two legitimate, contrasting philosophies. It instead played out as curt dialog between two characters who never really seemed to have any affection for one another."
979,10,Great,"The last of the star wars films to be made and done in spectacular style. The only thing with this film is that it relies too much on digital technology, which causes it to lose some of the charm of the original trilogy."
980,10,"Ends In A Bang! (Spoilers, are they!)","""Revenge of The Sith"" is a welcome reward for the countless fans that had to sit through the garbage that was ""The Phantom Menance"" and ""Attack Of The Clones."" From the moment the music explodes on the screen, the moviegoer is immediately drawn into the story by a single word: ""war!"" A HUGE battle is going on among the stars and we see Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor)and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen)are on a mission to save Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)from General Grievous. Once that's done, Anakin is reunited with Padme(Natalie Portman), his secret wife, who announces her pregnancy."
981,4,Not a surprise for me... piece of crap,Remembering the awkwardness from episode one and two I didn't really expect Revenge of the Sith (ROTS) to be any better. And it wasn't.
982,10,Lucas' Best Work,"I have rewatched this movie countless times and I must say: what is there to dislike about this movie? Yes, the script can be a little strange at times but seriously I love everything about this film. The opening scene is done extremely well, and it keeps you hooked for the rest of the movie. The scenes on the ground are great, and Palpatine's masterful manipulation of Anakin slowly but surely causing him to fall to the dark side is just so well executed. Anakin vs Obi-Wan will forever be the best duel in Star Wars history. Overall, this movie is a George Lucas masterpiece and I highly, highly reccomend it."
983,8,How sad...,"Good movie. Sad story, very sad. Watch Star Wars after you see this one so you can feel better."
984,9,"Brilliant Effects, Great Story Arch, Lame Writing","George Lucas is a great story teller and the undisputed master of creating special effects that serve a film. He cannot write, and Revenge of the Sith simply in the hands of a better writer could have been the best of the Star Wars Series. It is still excellent, third best of the six by my take (I rank them Empire, Hope, Sith, Clones, Jedi, Menace), but it misses an opportunity for greatness."
985,1,Absolute Trash.,"Seeing this movie reminds me of the saying 'You can't kick a bark out of a dead dog.' That being said, this movie seems so forced in its attempts to be everything to everyone that it doesn't achieve any one particular aspect very well. The drama presented between characters is oddly placed when thinking of what kind of care they movie attempts to make you have for them. Basically, the character interaction is stagnant, with some contractually obligated hints at Anakin's angst or whatever, until such time as the obvious crescendo is is reached and signals another stagnant character interaction. There is nothing that makes you care what happens between Anakin and the ex-Queens relationship, save for an excuse to fart out some of the most forced and/or disinterested acting in Hollywood... and that says a lot. Normally that wouldn't directly make a movie abysmally bad if it has action or other redeeming entertainment value (like special effects), but all the pomp in this film cannot save it from the commitment the movie requires you to invest. It's long, long and cheesy. The movies cares little to present Anakins inner turmoil, and if it gives reason for it, it doesn't bother to make it a focal point. If an audience isn't made to care about the characters inner developments, then how are they supposed to care about the cliché twists and turns it attempts to make? If you don't care about the characters, something the original trilogy succeeded in, you aren't going to care when Padame has twins in a minute and spits out both their names in the same breath. What? Why'd she pick those names? Was she looking for the first thing that came to her head? WHy didn't Lucas have enough sense to foreshadow an influence for her name ideas. All this would seem moot if the scene wasn't supposed to be so important in the entire saga. ANakin, as well is presented as a plastic 2 dimensional character, and I say 2 dimensional, because the film tries to fart out a sorry excuse of struggle of good and evil within him which basically consists in him saying the appropriate lines to tell us which side he is leaning on at the moment. Rubbish! And when he converts he is reduced to the one dimensional archetype tattered super-villain we have all seen before. The only relation I had with this film was when Vader gets off his operation table and shouts in the worst and most unconvincing 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' I have seen in a film since your favorite Ed Wood film, and the reason for this connection is that that is what i was screaming in my head during this entire picture. I wasn't expecting much in the first place. The first two prequels were horrible, with an amusing battle scene at the end of part II, but this film is exactly what Star Wars film shouldn't be - Star Trek parading around as Star Wars."
986,7,I'm not sure how I feel...,***SPOILERS***
987,1,No Hope Left...,"After a long debate, I finally decided to post my feelings about Revenge of the Sith. I despise the movie. There, I said it. Before someone screams ""troll"" to the top of their lungs, please allow me to explain."
988,3,Total BullSith,I thought the film was flat. The acting was dry. I couldn't grasp the concepts. The entire film seemed forced.
989,4,I'm glad it's over,"Take a great story, cooler than cool characters, add ripping good action and what do you have? The first three Star Wars movies, Episodes 4-6. Then, take these same characters, attempt to add depth by delving into their pasts to show how it all came about, and what do you have? Episode 1, and a lot of potential for the greatest movie series ever made. Now take that same potential and layer it over with so many special effects it's hard to find the plot, and insert acting so bad it makes you grit your teeth, even when fine and experienced actors are doing it, and what do you have? Episodes 2 and 3."
990,,A fine end to the saga,"The final installment of the prequel trilogy is the best film among the three- which isn't saying much at all. Revenge of the Sith is a dark movie and even its few lighthearted moments come under a cloud of grim expectations. Although Revenge of the Sith is the third volume of the prequel trilogy, its quality places it alongside A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars has to offer. Its flaws are easily forgiven; it offers the same successful blend of high energy sci-fi melodrama, epic tragedy, and satisfying storytelling provided by Episodes IV and V. In many ways, Revenge of the Sith is the most important chapter of the first six episodes and, until its release, the Star Wars saga remained incomplete. Revenge of the Sith exists not only as a fine chapter in its own right but its existence improves the other five segments, adding context and depth not only to the two other prequels but to all three members of the original trilogy."
991,7,Obi wan vs Anakin Skywalker,"First of all, i am not a very huge fan of star wars movies. In fact, i would rather play the star wars game on best possible gaming console than watching the movies. But i find this movie better than last two of this second trilogy. Their is this feeling of desperation and will to become most powerful by anakin skywalker which is the foundation of this movie. And it is quite nicely shown how he turns toward dark side. performances are not great but decent enough. It also gives answer to various questions like how the twins were separated and who is the dark lord who lures anakin towards dark side."
992,5,Just say Noooooooooooooooooooo!,"Hey, this review does contain the dreaded spoilers, so be warned. This film is easily the best of the three prequels. Unfourtunatly it too, is plagued with some of the problems and inconsistencies in the other prequels. Despite most of the major actors being okay there are two real problems with the acting. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen. Anytime these two hit the screen I found myself turning my head in disgust. The interaction between these two was just stupid. Overall this film was very easy to abuse. Many of the scenes are quite comical and goofy. Not to mention the most made fun of scene in the history of Star Wars. Ever. I marked this spoilers, and most of you already know about this, so I am going to bring this up. Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! When Vader finds out that Padme is dead he yells out Noooooooooooooo in a most ridiculous manner. I have seen this turned into so many joke websites that just hearing the word ""no"" or anything even slightly related to rejection I think of Vader. I have seen everything from Vader on wheel of fortune to Vader singing the ""last train to clarksville"". Another problem in the film is the whole massive Jedi conspiracy plot. Okay, if the Jedi are the supposedly most perceptive beings in the universe, and on many occasions can read or influence the minds of others how can they not even recognize a massive plot against them that many people they have close contact with share. Not even Yoda...who can sense just about anything even realizes that a bunch of people are going to try to kill him. Nice try captain perceptive. Other than that, the action in this film is decent. Fans of the series will find it easy to forgive all of the shortcomings. The film itself is not poorly directed, and the subplot is thankfully less involved than in Episode II. I would recommend that if you liked the others to check this out, but if you are trying to get into the series start with Episode IV and V. Don't come into this expecting the Empire Strikes Back like some of the hype will tell you. To me this a middle of the road film. By no means bad, and pretty entertaining. Just don't come in expecting it to be anything more than aesthetically pleasing."
993,7,A Good End To The Prequel Films,"Now we are here to the end of the prequel trilogy with The Revenge Of The Sith, yes this is the film that sees Anakin Skywalker turn into Darth Vader which at the time was probably the most anticipated film ever and the first film I remember vividly seeing in the cinema so this film was a big part of my childhood and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Obi-Wan & Anakin sent to rescue Chancellor Palpatine from The Sepratists and aim to use their powers to try and end The Clone Wars."
994,3,Why?,"First, who are these people describing this as ""perfect""? LOL! I can't even..."
995,2,How Punny!,"The first 15 minutes of the film felt like the entire run of Sex and the City. It was nothing but pun after pun and it grated on not only my nerves, but the nerves of the others in the theatre. With collective groans, we watched the film. We laughed at the ""serious"" parts and pondered the idea of not taking our younger family members to see the film. I became so board that I started to count the times Padme cries. Yes, the film is darker and even upsetting at times; but for the most part, it felt like there was a lot missing. But, for those who are die hard Star Wars Fans, you may enjoy the film. The only real positive thing that I can say about the film was that I saw Chewbacca. I wish that I could say more, but I won't give out any ""spoilers""."
996,7,"Incredible Special Effects, Golden Turkey Acting","Once again George Lucas has made an incredibly stunning movie with great special effects and fight scenes. Why oh why can't he write a script? Hayden Christensen really should never be given another major movie ever again. Time after time he looked like he had just read the script of the scene before the final scene was shot. I know Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are gifted actors with numerous credits in there career, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last we will ever hear of Hayden Christensen until the Golden Turkey awards are handed out next Winter. Still this is a very good movie if you want to see great special effects, this is what George Lucas will be famous for 50 years from now. The story is dictated by the previous 5 movies, so ""predictability"" is something every Star Wars expert can expect. Still it would have been nice to have a twist on the story, something the old Star Wars always brought in. Maybe seeing Liam Nieson appear next to Yoda at the end would have been nice."
997,8,Actually a solid prequel movie,"Say what you want, but I actually enjoyed this one out of the prequels."
998,10,The Best Star Wars ever!,"Just before the opening of Episode III at the theaters, I have watched the first two episodes of Star Wars(The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones). Then I watched episode III and after that, all of the old episodes, from the previous trilogy. So, I can say now: Revenge of the Sith IS THE BEST Star Wars ever. It answers very well to all of that old questions we had...the action is breathtaking, and so are the images in the movie, from the very beginning. The criticism over George Lucas on the previous episodes were certainly exaggerated. Some of the fans wished to freeze the first trilogy (episodes IV trough VI) characteristics for ever. Lucas, very wisely, as the original and legitimate creator of all Star Wars universe, did exactly what he was supposed to do: he told the story as he had imagined it should be. Lucky us: the new trilogy is fantastic, outstanding...it surpasses all previous parameters we had. It is a galactic adventure that every boy or girl could wish to have. It is visually wonderful and unforgettable! I never forgot the first time I watched Star Wars as a child, back in 1977. And Episode III will remain the same way in my mind. For now, many of us should thank Mr. Lucas for its brave work and hope that the saga will not end with this episode. What about Episodes VII to IX? We would love to see the New Republic, the new Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker as a Jedi Master and Anakin Solo running away from the Palpatine clones the Sith created. Please, Mr. Lucas: give us a new trilogy and keep up the good job in Episode III."
999,10,Saving the Best for last,"This is the one where all ""Star Wars"" fans have been waiting for. It has been six years since the first prequel came out, where many people were so hyped up about it that they were left disappointed because the hero was cute and Jar-Jar was an annoying S.O.B.; part 2 came out in 2002, though I didn't watch the film for personal reasons, people were somewhat lukewarm about the story and dialog as the action sequences were the reason to see the films; now in the grand finale, George Lucas has put audiences back where not only does he blend in special effects, but there is no holding back when it comes to the fight scenes in which every main character is involve."
1000,9,I would not believe that it would be this good.,"There were a couple things that disappointed me. Like Padme. I guess I was a little unhappy about the way they portrayed her here. That was not that way I see her. So yeah, a little disappointed with the wimpy Padme."
1001,4,"Only a master of crap, George","And now, to quote the once Arch-Badass Himself, the circle is complete. I walked out of this final installment of what should go down as one of the grossest miscalculations in the history of gross miscalculations telling myself, as we all have since 1999, that ""It's still good! It's still good!"" In reality I had already given up after The Phantom Menace. It's not a coincidence that I watched Attack of the Clones in the same week as Alien vs. Predator (both on DVD, both for a lark). I had no intention of seeing Revenge of the Sith until critics and friends were proclaiming it to be the best Star Wars film since Empire. Now, what we have here is one of the largest cases of mass cognitive dissonance in history, a product of doublethink on the part of the masses, doublespeak on the part of the critics, and deception on the part of Lucas' Culture Industry. We all desperately wanted to believe. Hell, for the first few hours after seeing Sith, even I believed. But upon ""searching my feelings,"" I realize that I can't pretend any longer. I was a Star Wars kid, but any good will I, and I will argue anyone else, ever held towards these cartoons was a product of sheer desperation. The saga is over and the final nail is in the coffin. All that is left is the ancillary exploitation."
1002,9,Finally...George Lucas make's it right again!,"Finally George Lucas returned to make a decent Star War's movie. After the great original trilogy of Star Wars, George Lucas promised to make the sequel trilogy of it, but he gave up due to family problems. Years passed and Gerge Lucas promised to make a new Star Wars trilogy, only it was counting before the events of the original trilogy, telling the story of the best villain of all time ... Darth Vader. The fans were exited to this new trilogy, and finally in 2001, ""Phantom menace"" came and it was awful, so much boring. And then the sequel ""Attack of the Clones"" came in 2002 and and was a little better, but continued boring. And 2004 came, and with him Episode 3 - ""The Revenge of the Sith,"" I, who was disappointed with the previous episodes, I was waiting for something boring again, actually I had an pleasant surprise waiting for me. The Revenge of the Sith hit me, and hit me good, this was the movie that George should have done from the beginning. He was very loyal to the original trilogy, to the fate of the characters and the events that led to the original trilogy, but also as Darth Vader himself. George gives a focus on character and what led her to become the greatest villain of cinema. He was good before, it was Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi with a good heart and intentions of justice, but he was denied that, he saw their beliefs being destroyed, I personally would have done the same as him, but not so exaggerated, because As said before, this situation led him to madness, turning into pure evil. Not only with him but with all characters get better, Obi Wan learns to be more mature when needed, Yoda is more Badass than ever, The Emperor was the best surprise for me, I hate him more than before. The film begins with that boringness of the previous ones, but it improves over increasingly. Staying with the ambiance of the original trilogy, with absolute tension and we are very concerned about the fate of the characters. And how George can put history, politics, and action sequences with this magnificent world is fantastic to see. With stunning scenery, a delightful soundtrack to listen, with an exciting ending, Episode 3 is one of the best Star Wars movie ever."
1003,9,The Best Since 'Empire' - An Absolute Triumph in Film-making!,"I have to say, I was extremely enthusiastic about seeing this movie. I really like Star Wars, and this was supposedly the last film they'd ever have. It would tie up all the loose ends of the saga, and complete one of the most loved and successful movie sagas of all time. The whole ride over to the movie theater that was playing 'Revenge of the Sith', the Star Wars theme was playing in my head, and I was beyond anxious to see how good (or unfortunately, how bad) this film would be. I read good and bad reviews of the third episode of the Star Wars films, some said it was the best one since 'The Empire Strikes Back', and other said it was just a poorly written, loud and expensive peace of Hollywood junk. I had an idea I would enjoy the film, but I didn't know how much. After waiting in line for a half an hour, and sitting in the movie theater for forty-five minutes, those legendary opening credits started to roll, and the crowd started screaming and cheering in excitement. After the film was completed, I knew that this was the best Star Wars installment since 'The Empire Strikes Back', and maybe even better. 'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' is more then just a great movie, it's a triumph and a hell of a way to end a mind-boggling Sci-Fi saga. I loved it!"
1004,5,Not worth the price of a cinema ticket,"Again, too much CGI and no real acting. What acting there is came over as laughable, and not just because the actors had a weak script. It is a long time since I have been in a cinema where the audience laughed at how bad an actor is. This Darth Vader is as scary as a cardboard cut out in a well lit room."
1005,10,Phenomenal,"Easily the best film in the Star Wars franchise. Amazing character development, action packed fun with countless connections to both new and old Star Wars. Some scenes might not have been portrayed in the same tone we would expect but you have to think of the tone of the film. It's dark, gritty, and exciting. Highly recommend you watch this film and keep an open mind!"
1006,1,Strike Three,"I was six when I saw Star Wars (New Hope) in a movie theater. I remember going home after the movie and trying to move things with the force. I am very grateful for Lucas adding something magical to my childhood. A really good movie can do that. These last three Star Wars movies have done the opposite. They have sucked out the magic and replaced it with disgust and disdain. Why I think the movie/s sucked: 1. Poor acting: whether it was the actors, the script, or the director is irrelevant, the acting was lousy. 2. Special effects: they are supposed to augment a good story, especially in scifi, not take over the movie. 3. Horrible script: cheesy lines are not only annoying but distracting as well. 4. Political messages: I think Lucas was taking a stab at current politics. I watch movies to take a brake from reality. I do not care about the political opinions of a movie director."
1007,8,Exciting sci-if action,"Star Wars revenge of the sith is an exciting sequel to attack of the clones and finale to the prequels. Immediately hooking the audience with a high energy fight between the Jedi anakin, Obi-Wan and count Dooku to save chancellor palpatine and our first encounter with general grievous a cyborg in charge of the rebel cis droid army. By the end of this encounter dooku is dead and palpatine is acting strange towards anakin. Once back we find out Anakin has been having dreams/visions of padames death which pushes him into the arms of palpatine and leads to the events of order 66."
1008,4,Pretty Bad but still enjoyable,"Thoughts on: Revenge of the Sith (2005)  George Lucas can be a decent director (he showed he could back in American Graffiti (1973)) but all 3 recent Star Wars movies have suffered from bad directing, this one as much as if not worse than the last two.  The dialogue still sucks.. in a bad way.  The timing of the movie felt at times to be right on and at other times to be off. Curiously this was happening within scenes. For example the opening space fight had good rhythm and moved right along, however the scenes that take place right afterward felt off beat and lacking in motion.  That opening fight looked awesome. I want to see that again.  There is some very poor acting, which is made worse by some very good acting: Ewan McGregor and specially Ian McDiarmid did a great job which unfortunately made Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman look all that much worse. I KNOW Natalie Portman can be a very good actress but she seems to require a good director which is absent in these movies. Hayden Christensen does better in Episode III than in I or II which is to say he does badly but does not make you want to wretch in your seat.... as much.  Lucas thankfully showed some restraint in using characters (the droids) purely for comedic relief. There are still some hokey and unnecessary scenes but they are shorter and seem to belong more than the ones from episodes I and II.  I prefer puppet Yoda to digital Yoda. Puppet Yoda looks more real.  One wonders if George Lucas has ever had a good relationship with a woman because the romantic scenes he writes and directs are gut-wrenching bad. Portman and Christensen show all the screen chemistry of water and oil.  I was thrilled to hear Vader's first breath.  I enjoyed myself."
1009,6,Much better but still not great,"I've always regarded the Star Wars films as mostly enjoyable special effects driven action flicks and never been particularly impressed by the story. Episode three certainly doesn't disappoint in that regard. It's much better than episodes 1 and 2 but is still let down by a rather simplistic plot, occasionally awful script and poor acting although Hayden Christensen is marginally better than he was in episode 2. He does tend to get worse as the film proceeds though and overacts terribly during his transformation into Vader. The scene where he is told of the death of his wife is laughably unconvincing. The worst acting in my opinion though is from Natalie Portman. She is truly awful and most of her scenes with Christensen just made me cringe."
1010,1,Two hours of yawns and frantic laughter.,"After witnessing a plot, acting and flow of story as unconvincing and unprofessional as in ROTS unfold like a plague before our eyes, AOTC and TPM (out of all films) really stand out as excellent works of art. Thank you Lucas for the previous successful episodes and then ROTS which ruined them all."
1011,6,A Disappointing Finale,"""Revenge of the Sith"": Getting Down with the Darkside "
1012,10,Amazing story,The story leads straight into the originals perfectly.
1013,9,The best of the prequel Trilogy by far!,"I love star wars even with all the mistakes in Episodes I and II! I wish Lucas would of had as much passion for the first Two installments as he did for Episode III. Even he admitted the third was 60% of the story and the other 40% was Episodes I and II. But This is the one all the fans waited for! And you can tell Lucas was a lot more passionate with the script! Example When Palp is telling Anakin about the Sith at the theater. There was emotion and meaning with this, there was a real story to it! Not just saying something to move you along to the next scene! You can tell he took his time in writing this and you can see who he kind of short changed us with the first two episodes at the same time! This movie makes you want to watch the original trilogy and makes the end of Episode II much better. I just wish he would have thought more about certain things and had more character development. These movies should have been 3 hours long each of them instead of rushing to get the point across! It seemed like he cared more about the tech then the story at times. But makes up for it in Episode III. The heartbreaking loss of friendship and love to the loss of Anakins soul and becoming the ultimate evil. You wanted to yell out to Anakin stop you don't have to go down this path! Can't you see you are the cause of everyones downfall. Episode III is the only movie out of the prequels that makes you care. Just think how much better Episode III would have been if episodes I and II scripts would have been stronger and more put together!"
1014,10,The best Star Wars film in the Series,My absolute favourite Star Wars film. They nail absolutely everything. It's the Star Wars film I can always go back to and watch over and over again.
1015,,AN INSULT TO Film-making,"This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen this year, and I've seen a few seriously poor offerings. This movie really takes the cake. Being a fan (although not an obsessive) I like many others, could appreciate the tactility of the original works, the use of live action modelling, compelling performances from the cast and a sparing sincerity in terms of the cinematic space. The Sith is a nonsense, saturated with way too many characters, deeming it more of a cgi wet dream than anything else. The acting by all is unspeakable, almost as if little or no effort or direction was given at any time.The story does not convince on any levels-extremely poor cgi. I really am at a loss to find any redeeming quality, maybe the title sequence as it was the only element of the film that offered any warmth-as it was conceived in the 70's I can only say that If the score of zero were available it would be given to this. It disgusts me that such a worthless piece of kaka can receive such high praise. You are all bonkers. If Lucas makes any more films, i dearly hope he only takes on the role of a producer, because he can't direct for toffee."
1016,9,"Definitely the best of the prequels, and one of the best in years----9/10","The greatest saga in history comes full circle with Revenge of the Sith, the third prequel to Star Wars. After the breakout of the Clone Wars in Episode II, Anakin and Obi-Wan are defending the Republic from the Seperatists, Padme is pregnant with Anakin's children, and Senator Palpatine is hatching a plan to become ruler of the galaxy. Oh, and did i mention Vader is born?"
1017,1,I wasn't sure what I was watching.,"The ticket said Star Wars, but it seemed like I was watching one of those independent sci-fi films on the sci-fi channel. The light saber sound effects made me wish I had a mute button. Actually I wished I had my own light saber, so could hack and slash the sound system. I would comment on the acting, but there was none. Too bad Samuel L. Jackson didn't use profanity in this movie, could have been awesome. There was one part of the movie that could have been good, but George Lucas screwed it up. I don't think he's seen enough action films. The Natalie Portman character was like WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, then there is a close up on the Anakin guys face... George Lucas, at that point, if you gave Anakin the line ...I'M GOING TO KILL THEM ALL..! This movie could have been worth the ticket price."
1018,5,nice video game ...,I do not understand why so many people think that the film is better then the parts I and II. A bad film is still a bad film...
1019,8,"Best of the New ones, but Hayden cant act!","Star Wars Episode III is, and I stand by this, the best of the new films. George Lucas, after two strikes with the Episodes I and II, hits a home run here, and he made my day when I saw this movie. Its visuals are some of the best I have ever seen, the fight scenes are insanely good, and the cinematography and costumes are well created. But, there is one major key point I would like to address here: Hayden Christensen, the Anakin Skywalker who becomes the evil Darth Vader, nearly ruined all of his scenes because of his acting."
1020,10,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...",STAR WARS
1021,4,Not a fitting end to the legacy,The effects by today's standards were average. There was too much of these average effects crowding out any story. Many parts of the story didn't flow together. This movie was essentially forced.
1022,6,"Not great, but a nice conclusion to the series","One could spend a whole day going over the reasons why The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were such train-wrecks, but one of the most obvious problems was George Lucas's basic reason for making them. Instead of existing in their own right, these movies were made to set up a story that had already been told, filling in the gaps of the complicated back-story. For all of the noisy effort and expense put into them, Episode I and II seemed perfunctory, as if Lucas was making them basically just for the sake of symmetry. Episode III benefits from the start from having a real sense of direction and purpose. The story of how Anakin Skywalker was corrupted and became Darth Vader is much more interesting than wars between obscure alien races with bizarre names. In the weeks before the movie came out, rumors were floating around the Internet that the playwright Tom Stoppard had done an uncredited re-write of the dialogue. If this is true, then I can see why Stoppard wouldn't go out of his way to associate himself with the script. Like Episodes 1 and 2, the acting and dialogue are sometimes atrocious, and rarely less than stiff. Hayden Christansen, who plays Anakin, comes off as particularly inept, but since almost no one manages to give a really decent performance, perhaps most of the blame should be placed on the shoulders of George Lucas, who obviously doesn't really understand how to work with actors. Lucas's attempts at lacing Revenge with political undertones are as muddled as the Jedi philosophy, which is particularly incoherent in this installment. At one point we are told that only Sith think in terms of black and white, which might have been meant as a jab at Bush but comes off as nonsensical in the context of the Manichean system on which all of the films are based. And if the Jedi are supposed to let their emotions guide them, then why is Anakin warned that passion will lead him to the Sith? For anyone who hasn't already caught on, this movie will provide conclusive proof that Lucas, whatever his merits as a filmmaker, should not be taken as a great philosopher. I don't think that should at all be held against him; what bothers me is that he tries to include philosophical points in the Star Wars films anyway. For all these faults, I found Revenge of the Sith, on the whole, to be a satisfactory conclusion to the series. It succeeds where it is supposed to: as a spectacle and an origin story for Darth Vader. Lucas kills off Count Dooku too quickly, considering that Christopher Lee is maybe the only non-digitally generated actor who seems comfortable in this trilogy, but the future Emperor proves to be an effective villain; his methods of seducing Anakin to the dark side of the force are considerably more subtle than those he uses on Luke (which basically consist of saying over and over again, ""Embrace your hatred and you will come under my power!"") Where the movie really takes off, however, is when Anakin, caught in a confrontation between the Chancellor and the Jedi leaders, finally does turn to the Dark Side, beginning with a Godfather baptism- style massacre of the Jedi across the galaxy. At last Lucas has delivered an action scene where we have a real emotional stake in what happens. He concluded The Phantom Menace with a technically well-filmed light-saber duel that nonetheless fell flat dramatically because the participants had no personal grudge against each other but just happened to be on opposing sides. The moment where Yoda turns the tables on his would-be assassins is almost satisfying enough to make up for this dull climax. By now it's a meaningless cliché to praise something for being ""dark,"" but these scenes have a real dramatic intensity that the new trilogy had been lacking. Lucas, however, goes a little too far in his desire to be ""dark"" when, in one of the most talked-about moments in this sequence, Anakin decides to kill a whole group of children in a Jedi training school. The scene ends before he actually does anything, but it's still a pretty bold scene for the series that also introduced Jar Jar Binks to the world. Maybe a little too bold; the scene comes early on in Anakin's conversion to evil and too quickly pushes him beyond the pale. Of course I knew, as did almost everyone in the theater that night, that Anakin was going to turn into the incarnation of evil, but Lucas should have made this change from asshole to evil incarnate at least a little more gradual. As it is, the long-awaited confrontation between Anakin and Obi-Wan lacks some the power it should have had, since there's not even the possibility that Obi-Wan can pull his student back from the Dark Side. Lucas does a fair job of setting everything up for the real first movie, even managing to explain the presence of R2-D2 and C3-PO, which in Phantom struck me as a cheap, crowd-pleasing sop to the fans. The series' storyline is still riddled with holes, but that shouldn't bother anyone who has realized by now that Lucas never had a real overarching plan, but has really just been winging it for over a quarter of a century. But for all of my misgivings about the Star Wars series in general and this entry in particular, I couldn't help but be moved at Sith's conclusion as familiar images appeared- of Tatooine's twin suns, of the druids in the gleaming white halls of a spaceship, and of Darth Vader standing menacingly on the command deck of his battleship- bringing the story full circle."
1023,,"A worthy final episode, but really number 3 which leads to the first. Confusing? Maybe.","As I was watching this movie tonight on DVD I found myself wondering what it would have been like had all 6 movies been made in the correct sequence, instead of 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, and finally 3. But that brought me to another thought, namely that maybe 6 movies on the same theme is just too much. Oh! I enjoyed this one, a bit more than episodes 1 and 2 (which were really the 4th and 5th made), and at the end it ties up all loose ends to lead into what we know as the original Star Wars, which is now known as episode 4 but one that most saw initially over 20 years ago. The actors are good. I had harsh criticism for Natalie Portman in Episode 2, for wooden acting, but she was much better here. I always like Ewan McGregor. But I can never find Hayden Christensen as a credible Anakin Skywalker. Still, overall a very nice final installment but episode 3, and with good light saber fights."
1024,10,"""A presence I've not felt since....""",(disclaimer: I'm too excited to be aware of any spoilers I might leak by accident.....read at your own risk!) 
1025,7,"Better than I or II, but nowhere near Empire","This movie would be worth it just for the last half hour or 45 minutes, but two things keep me from rating it higher 1) the humor that appears in the initial trilogy is lost, or forced, here. Nothing to equal the Han/Leia type stuff like ""Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder. Who's scruffy-looking?"" 2) Portman and Cristensen have all the chemistry of a used Kleenex. (Heck, Cristensen has more chemistry with McGregor than with Portman.)"

1028,10,The Epic Saga goes out with a bang!,"In 2005, George Lucas finished making his final Star Wars Live Action film. It had to be epic. It had to beat his previous two films. It had to make an impact."
1029,7,The Sum of All Parts...,"Whenever anyone mentions ""The Prequels"" you can almost be guaranteed to hear a collective moan filled with the pains of disappointment. Episode I was undeniably a horrible movie. I would go so far as to say that it is actually overrated when you look at its IMDb score here. I would be hard pressed to give the movie much higher than a four here."
1030,7,Really for the fans,"This last instalment of the Star Wars saga does have a strong storyline... for a Star Wars movie. The story fills in the key gaps that any intelligent person would be wondering about: How the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker devoted to selfless service evolved completely into the self-centred and evil Darth Vader; the genesis of Luke and Leia Skywalker; the origin of Darth Vader's evil Master. Not that much in the way of surprise, almost no suspense and relatively weak drama meant that coming into the last third of the movie I was clockwatching."
1031,9,The best film in the saga,"What happens when innocence gets corrupted? When goodness is taken over by a tragic evil? You get Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and his transformation into the pop culture iconic villain known to virtually everyone in the world as ""Darth Vader."""
1032,10,The best out of the prequel trilogy,"There were so many good and bad (in a good way) moments but I won't spoil it, it was not like the last 2 we got, that was one hell of a finale, we finally get to see (after all these years) how Anakin Skywalker betrayed his friends and family to join the dark side of the force to become (who we all know him as) Darth Vader"
1033,8,Best of the 'new' trilogy,"This is the best out of the latest three star wars films, and possibly up there with ROTJ in my opinion. The action scenes are definitely the best in the whole series, and there are very few 'flat' moments throughout the film. As is expected, some of the dialogue is a little bit woeful but this has never been one of Lucas' strong points, and in a way this is a part of Star Wars for me. I'd probably say that you have to have watched the other movies to get the most out of this episode, as it ties up some loose ends very nicely. Good points - Very little Jar Jar Binks, lots of 'climactic scenes' (each action scene seems to be bettered by the next), decent Yoda fight scene. Bad points - Doesn't seem to be enough internal emotional conflict before anakin 'turns', Padme/Anakin's relationship doesn't seem to ring true (Lucas' dialogue) To summarise, I'd like to say that I'm not a die-hard star wars fan, but this film made me want to run home and put the original trilogy on..."
1034,7,the end has arrived,"The war is coming to an end. The separatists are running and the clone army is dwindling. The new ruler of the clone army, the robotic general grieves is on the run but is quickly found out and followed by Obi Wan. Anikin has news from Padme, she's pregnant with child; or two. Anikin is also being tempted by Chancellor Palpatine, who we find is the Sith Lord. He gets Anikin to join the dark side, and puts his giant plan into complete action; to destroy all the Jedi."

I accept you have to allow for fact that you're watching a story the outcome of which you know."
1041,10,A great finale to the Star Wars movies!,Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith
1042,,What a God Awful Film,"My room mates asked me last night if I wanted to watch this on their home theatre system and, though I hadn't seen The Attack of the Clones, I said yes, and was actually looking forward to it -- for about 20 minutes. Had I gone to a theatre to see this, I would have been royally ticked off; indeed, I might have stormed to the box office and, under the new policies, demanded my money back."
1043,10,Wow just wow,Wow just wow. The final fight between Obi Wan and Anakin has to be the most iconic scene in all of cinema maybe after the 'I am your father' scene in ESB.
1044,5,"""Noooooooo...""","I wish, oh how I wish, that Lucas stuck to what he is best at - Producing, visual effects, being the overall visionary - and had given the movies to other directors to realise."
1045,2,Just so unbelievably bad,"First, the CGI doesn't hold up like other movies, made way before this. Alien, Aliens, Blade Runner, even the original Star Wars movies had more believable CGI. It just looks bad, sterile and obvious terrible compositing."
1046,5,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005),"Directed by George Lucas. Starring Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels, Jimmy Smits, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison, (voice) Matthew Wood. (PG-13)"
1047,4,"Lucas, Lucas, Lucas...","What have you done, man? This guy is 3 in 3 right now. He's made Episodes IV - VI and those were BRILLIANT, and he's made I - III and those were poo."
1048,10,Excellent movie almost as good as the originals,"Well I liked the movie a lot, the special effects were excellent and this time the plot is much better and interesting than the other two prequels, was good to see old characters back and the evolution of the space ships of the original star wars, George Lucas did a great job with this movie the character of the emperor is a villain that you would like to hate, great movie very entertaining to watch again and again."
1049,4,I was disappointed,"After seeing the movie I am astounded by the number of people rating this a ""10"". The last 5-10 minutes were good when everything was being wrapped up but before that, I was having a hard time maintaining interest. For the sake of drama all the high Jedi's weren't able to tell who the Sith lord was in the 1st 2 movies and that doesn't change here even though he is right in their laps. Beyond that I didn't have any problems with the plot as it fit into the logic that exists in the star wars universe. If this was the actually first movie I might have appreciated more but the ending is a foregone conclusion so there is really no tension about what the possible outcome is."
1050,5,"Unemotional, unengaging and does not deliver","The first twenty to thirty moments of Episode III consists of very good action yet manages to be extremely boring. I will compare Return of the Jedi with Revenge of the Sith here. In Jedi, the action scenes with Jabba are thrilling. I saw the flick when I was 10 and the moment when Luke springboards off of the platform, catches the lightsaber and goes to town was one of the coolest things I've ever seen (and still is actually.) The Star Wars music was blaring after a tedious setup and I was excited off of my you-know-what. In Revenge of the Sith, the lead up to the fight with Count Dooku, the fight itself and then the other stuff leading up the crash of the disintegrating ship should have been thrilling also but there was next to no music and it just sort of happened. When the ship landed, I just said to myself ""That was really, really boring."" Christopher Lee is a great resource and they should have used him more. I was pulling for Hayden Christensen but it was painfully obvious early on that he was just way too boring in his role. Playing a young Jedi with few lines and some fight scenes would have better for him but he is just NOT Darth Vader. McDiarmid steals the acting show as Palpatine but his relationship with Anakin is just not evil enough, not for lack of trying on Palpatine's part. Anakin turns to enormous evil because of his wife? She then dies and he continues on being evil? Psychologically it is just lame and does not hold water at all. Lucas contradicts his own Jedi lingo in this a few times also. Obi Wan and Yoda are almost bored after the carnage that Anakin wreaks. Shouldn't they have been sad or crying or something? In the prequel, Jedi are supposed to be unemotional servants yet they keep talking about ""Searching out with their feelings?"" Luke was emotional in 4, 5 and 6. Shouldn't anybody have cared in Episode III? It's probable that Christensen wasn't given much of a chance to be emotional. The only chances that he gets are toward the end and they are just not enough. Natalie Portmann is also given a tremendous challenge as she has to cry in almost every scene. She gives it a shot but it just isn't enough. The moments with Vader in the suit are nothing. VADER IS THE GUY IN THE SUIT WITH THE VOICE OF JAMES EARL JONES!!! We get that Vader, the real Vader, for about fifteen seconds. The lines that Jones does have bring back the magic so Lucas responds by giving us fifteen seconds of it. That is NOT a payoff. The special effects are great but other that McDiarmid, the actors don't pay off and the script is boring and unemotional to the point of tedium. Shouldn't somebody have cared here?"
1051,10,Episode III is a cinematic masterpiece!!!,"I don't usually write reviews for movies and I don't like the insults that I've seen on previous forums. But when I have just seen a movie that I can't stop talking about and more than that has made me cry every time I have gone to see it then this kind of film deserves a review. My Dad took me to go see Star Wars: A new Hope when it was re-released in the early 80's and then me and him went and saw Return of the Jedi twice. I have been a fan of the films ever since. I have probably put more money in Lucas's pocket than I should. In Episode I yes Jar-Jar was annoying but I liked the story and even little Jake Lloyd as Anakin was not a bad choice at all. The critical reaction from fans on Episode I in my opinion is unfair. The same with Attack of the Clones, the romance between Anakin and Padme may seem a bit contrived but it needs to be told and come on seeing Yoda fight with a light saber even if it is a short time. Now on to Episode III which has become my favorite of all the Star Wars movies. I loved Empire but now it has fallen to second place. Revenge of the Sith is a cinematic masterpiece and I loved it. It was one of the most phenomenal experiences of my life. The light saber duels to Anakins dark transformation were wonders to behold. It was chilling, disturbing and overall just very tragic to see the domino effect that was put in place by Palpatine. Hayden stepped it up from Attack of the Clones. His portrayal of a tormented Anakin Skywalker was off of the charts. Also, unbelievable connections were made to Episode IV and the other movies. I don't care what box office this movie makes. Even if you are not a Star Wars fan go and see it. I saw it at midnight on the 18th and saw it two more times after that. Please go and see this film. It is well worth the price of admission. Thank you George Lucas for giving me some of the most brilliant motion pictures in cinema history. Thank you for Revenge of the Sith. This opinion can be criticized I don't care. I will stand by it till the day I die."
1052,10,Great Conclusion to the Star Wars Saga!!!,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the third and final chapter of the prequels in the Star Wars Saga. WAR!!! In this episode, the Clone Wars, which have been fought for three years, are underway (which is how the movie starts out!), Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) is the General of the Clone Wars and his apprentice Anakin (Hayden Christensen), is stronger than ever before (even though he is married to Padme, something that the Jedi are unaware of and which is forbidden). But, unaware that Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is behind the Clone Wars and is also the evil Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, Anakin,(prophesied throughout the entire saga to be ""The Chosen One,"" the one to bring balance to the Force), begins to succumb to Palpatine's mind-twisting ways, which will eventually lead him to kill Mace Windu, turn to the Dark Side, and aid Palpatine in hunting down and killing every single Jedi (except for Yoda and Obi-Wan), thus allowing Palpatine to turn the clones against the Jedi (which is the epic turning point of the movie and the entire saga), and become the evil Emperor and destroy the Republic to make way for the Galactic Empire. Like the other two prequel episodes, Episode III did everything it was supposed to: Show us the epic Clone Wars, reveal Palpatine's true identity, show us Luke and Leia's birth and their fates, and tragically show us how Anakin turns to the Dark Side and transforms into the evil Darth Vader! Out of all the duels in this movie, the best one was Anakin vs Obi-Wan (which is the second best in the entire saga)!!! Loved that George Lucas wanted the fight to take place on a fiery planet! The awesomeness of John Williams once again shines with ""Battle of the Heroes,"" the theme of Episode III!!! With all that being said, this movie deserves nothing less than a 10!!! This and Episode I are my two favorite episodes of the entire saga!!! Never grow tired of them! Rating: 10/10!!!"
1053,8,No good reason ...,"... could possibly explain Anakin's turn to the dark side and Lucas consequently is unable to give us one. Unfortunately, he still tries."
1054,8,an excellent end that makes an excellent introduction,"First, I'll say that I don't feel any o this review is a spoiler, as all the things I said, as far as I know, have become common knowledge by now. "
1055,9,Best of the first 3,"In my personal opinion, I think that this epic movie is the best of the first three prequels. It ties up alot of loose ends. Well not loose ends per SE, but gives many answers to Star Wars: A New Hope questions that I had. I know that everyone may not feel the same way about it, but this is the way I feel. I really hope people will enjoy this movie any how."
1056,4,"In the end, it is still corny tripe made for six year-olds and nostalgic thirty-somethings.","Last night, a friend offered to buy me a ticket to a midnight showing of ""Star Wars 6"" (And yeah, yeah... I know about the episode order -- I just do it that way to irritate you). The idea initially sounded like hell on earth, what with having to deal with fanatics and their silly masks, pretend Darth Vader helmets and plastic lightsabers. I almost said no. But I am not one to pass up a free movie... after all, going to 100+ movies a year gets expensive! This sixth ""Star Wars"" probably ranks as the third best in the series. The original and its sequel only surpass it. And as hard as it is for me to say, there are many things worthwhile in ""Revenge of the Sith"" *Lets out a giggle*."
1057,8,Save the best till Last,Spoilers included.
1058,7,Get a grip,"It's a good film, yeah, but I would hardly say that the aggressively mediocre dialog (and line delivery) was rare, or that McDiarmid's performance was riveting. I think he did the best job of the lot--until he turned into a B-movie hambone channeling an inebriated combination of Emperor Ming and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. I mean, really."
1059,1,Wow!,"When I say wow I mean wow! It was that bad! Yes the action was awesome, but that does not make a movie. Neither does HORRIBLE acting, HORRIBLE plot, and HORRIBLE characters. Why didn't Lucas leave his masterpiece alone? Why did he have to ruin it? I would be much happier if these movies were never made, but no Lucas needs the money. Lucas should take his money and shove it down his throat. I wonder if that would make his neck any fatter. In ROTS why did he have to copy off of other movies? The whole Darth Vader suiting was a copy off of Frankenstein. These movies could have been a lot better. Lucas had one of the best trilogies in the world. I don't know how he could then make one of the most disappointing trilogies. But with the good always comes the bad..."
1060,4,umm....,"I've never been much of a star wars fan, but I had the usual love of the original series as a child. The first two prequels were embarrassing at best, and this last one wasn't much better. Lucas spends far too much time on special effects and imagery and too little time on dialog and story. Haden Christianson's acting is atrocious and painful to watch. Lucas has absolutely no business writing dialog in the first place, but the banter between Anakin and Padme is inexcusable. The way Anakin finally becomes Vader makes no sense whatsoever and was simply a quick way to get from point A to point B. The only reason this didn't get a one is because the effects were cool and I was impressed by the light saber battles."
1061,10,It's the Dark Side that rules.,"Thank you Mr. Lucas for letting us finally believe that you still have that magic. The magic that divides the entire history of cinema into two parts -- pre- and post- Star Wars era i.e. before and after 1977. The magic that draws the greatest number of net surfers to visit a movie site. And now in 2005, you delivered the true nature of that Force in a final movie about which everybody knows everything before seeing it, about which 'spoiler' is an invalid term, which doesn't make one happy face in the crowd that leaves the theatre."
1062,7,"Third time is the lucky charm, I guess?","I was very reluctant from watching Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith because of how bad the previous two movies were, but to my shock this one was actually pretty good! Now of course this isn't some absolutely masterpiece movie that could be remembered for being classic, but at least it saved the entire prequel trilogy by simply not doing anything bad. I had been waiting to watch this movie ever since I began bingewatching Star Wars. I watched this two years back, so the rating is from that time. I haven't changed it after seeing the cult following."
1063,4,I really can't believe the reviews,"WARNING!! SPOILERS AHEAD!! I'm shocked that this is getting the reviews that it is receiving. As a stand alone movie, it is okay, not good, but okay. Taken with the entire Star Wars mythos, however, it is an abomination. Darth Vader was the galaxies biggest bad ass because he hunted down and destroyed all of the jedi. Oh wait, now he actually DIDN'T hunt them down, he just killed a few little kids. Princess Leia remembers her mother, but not her father. Oh wait, actually, she shouldn't remember either. I could go on and on about the continuity this movie screws up."
1064,10,"""Revenge of the Sith"" - An epic closer that shows Lucas' return to form","The saying ""Third time's a charm"" is more relevant with the fantastic ""Star Wars"" films than I think it's been with any other action series. Its creator, George Lucas, first kicked off ""Star Wars"" in 1977, and revolutionized the way people made movies, as well as how people view them."
1065,8,Very good apart from the small flaws...,"I had no doubt in my mind that this film was going to be anything other than good. The start throws the viewer into a space battle. Ships are everywhere. Looks absolutely fantastic. However, most of the film looks brilliant. The main reason why this film worked for me is the story roles beautifully from start to finish. The politics are well explained and it ties all the loose ends together. It actually makes the viewer very much interested in the politics and plays a major part in setting the story for the final three episodes."
1066,8,Special Effects+Average Acting+interesting Story=Flirting With Success,"George Lucas is not an amazing director, he has been and never will be. The shots are very simple and there aren't any shots that truly capture the moment, this is due to the fact that Lucas relies on Special effects and the Star Wars plot to make him seem like a God. He is a great writer a director, and hopefully if he makes the next three (God I hope not), he leaves it to someone else. Maybe if the acting wasn't so damned stiff, you would care about the characters, especially when Padame was trying to get ""Annie"" to stop his Dark Side pursuits. It was just stupid, and the cheesy moment, the one that sent me over the top was when Lord Vader first rises and is informed he killed his wife, and he steps out like Godzilla with his new legs, throws his arms back and screams in a Godzilla like fashion. Damn you Lucas, damn you for your trickery, using special effects make nerds wet dreams come true (Albiet it did look abso-f**king-lutely fantastic, it just lacked in every other aspect) Natalie Portman is hot, in a weird pregnant woman/expecting mom sort of way, and no I'm not a pervert, I swear."
1067,8,By far the best of the prequels,"Star Wars is, in my opinion, one of the greatest film sagas of our time. Every film has been an enjoyable one, some less than others (most notably the first two prequels and certain aspects of the chronologically final film). I admit that I was expecting a little less satisfying ending. But this film blew the other two prequels out of th ball park. I connected with the characters. Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor, and even Hayden Christensen were very well played and had improved greatly since their last two appearances. Natalie Portman was better, but I could not identify with her as well as I could the other three. Count Dooku's face as he realizes he has been betrayed was a pang in my heart, as was his silent pleading for Anakin's mercy. Kudos to Christopher Lee. Yoda was a CGI character, so his acting can't really be judged, but towards the end, Yoda's facial expressions are heart-breaking as he takes in everything that happened. The classic duel is well done, and the final parting of Anakin and Obi-Wan made me cry because it was so well-done. Mace Windu's death...Samuel L. Jackson certainly made sure his character died with a bang, and a bang that was a real emotional shocker. The Jedi death scenes were also very emotional, and Ki-Adi-Mundi's face (Yeah, enough with the faces) as he turned to see his fellow comrades turn on him....Pricelessly tragic."
1068,10,A film to end all films,"There are just no words to describe it. Powerful, depressing, sad, exciting; those words alone cannot do this film justice. I have been looking forward to this for three years. After seeing it, I was in a state of shock. No ""Star Wars"" film has come close to this in terms of visual spectacle, fine performances, and trenchant emotion. I knew pretty much the whole story before seeing this. But upon seeing it, I was cinematic overload. Granted, the dialog wasn't exactly Shakespearian but the emotions behind it and the fact that people tends to put other films on such a high pedestal that I have been more than willing to forgive the shortcomings. I don't think any other films will have this effect on me again. The experience was that profound. Maybe I am biased because I am a ""Star Wars"" fan from way back but I still think this is an excellent film. A warning to parents: this films is not for the squeamish or faint-hearted."
1069,3,Open Letter to George Lucas,"Dear George, Thank you for all the time and effort you put into completing the cycle of Star Wars movies for your fans. I was raised on the original episodes, and they had a huge effect on my life. "
1070,10,"a solid ""A-minus"" grade, but not perfect","The cheesiness that plagued Ep.s 1 and 2 is mostly gone here. Lucas establishes that he means business in the opening action-packed sequences, replete with R2D2 kicking the asses of several battledroids. These are the types of sequences I missed from the first two: big spaceships in big spaceship battles with lots of little fighters everywhere and lasers shooting all over the place. I really dug the crash landing sequence (although, to be fair, it was a little bit convenient that a landing strip happened to be directly in front of the crashing ship's flightpath)."
1071,8,The darkest--and best--of the prequels. Period.,"It is difficult for me to evaluate the STAR WARS movies individually because each has been intended to be viewed as one whole saga. But EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH is a definite step-up from its last two flawed yet serviceable predecessors, THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, respectively. Whereas the aforementioned prequels took their time to set up exposition, this one unfolds at such a fierce, kinetic pace that you'll be hanging on for dear life."
1072,2,Astonishingly bad,"To all those who gave this pile of turd 10/10 - what are you on? I know Lucas can make a good film, and I hoped in vain that he would redeem himself after the the childish TPM and laughable AOTC. Unfortunately Lucas is no longer an imaginative storyteller, he's a Chief Exec of a multi-billion dollar franchise. I can see him sitting there at Skywalker Ranch surrounded by advisers, being told ""CGI - yes lot's of it"", ""great dialogue George"" and ""yeah Hayden's great isn't he"" Firstly I make no apology for spoilers - if you haven't seen this yet it's best avoided, no actually go and see it for comedy value. Besides, Lucas does a great job of spoiling this film himself. Please if you want to see a decent trilogy, watch the original again, or see LOTR. Christ, Peter Jackson must have laughed so hard he cried. Onto the plot, or what passes for it. The first word of the scrolling intro was WAR! I looked around expecting everyone to start singing ""WAR, HUH, what is it good for, absolutely nothing"", you could say the same about this film. Believe me this wasn't the last comedy moment. The only decent character from the previous two, Count Dooku played by Christopher Lee, is killed off immediately. First his arms are chopped off by Anakin, and as he ponders killing him he says to Chancellor Palpatine ""I shouldn't kill an unarmed man!"" Are you serious? After seemingly 5 hours of pointless CGI battles (I forget how long), Anakin turns to the dark side in an effort to save his pregnant Padmé. It doesn't take much to turn poor Anakin, the dialogue is like this (I paraphrase): Palpatine - ""Join me"" Anakin - ""I shouldn't"" P - ""Go on"" A - ""Alright then"". And how does Lucas depict this most evil of villains post-switch? Anakin lowers his eyebrows and wears eye-shadow. Anakin and the evil Empire then set about trying to kill all the Jedis. Predictably only the Jedis that we have been introduced to offer any sort of fight, most seem rather easy to kill for Jedi Masters. Not even the Younglings (no, not the Youngling family) are spared, though by this point we have been put under anaesthetic which renders this important scene somewhat insignificant. Obi-Wan looks back at the security hologram to see the slaughter taking place then exclaims ""I can't watch this anymore"". How do you think we feel Obi-Wan?! Yet more pointless battle scenes take place for the next few hours, including Obi-Wan vs Anakin/Vader on a planet of molten lava (why do they choose the most precarious places to fight?). Meanwhile Padmé is about to have her babies. In one scene she looks slim and normal, in her next (after the Anakin lightsabre fight) she is sporting a large bulge. In any other film the length of her pregnancy may have raised a few eyebrows, but this fight scene really did seem like 9 months. Padmé falls ill as she goes into labour. A medical robot says to Obi-Wan ""There's nothing medically wrong with her, but she's losing the will to live"". With that I couldn't contain myself any longer and laughed out loud, thinking ""we all know that feeling!"" The laughs don't end there. After losing the battle, Anakin is horribly burned and has to put on the Vader costume. After the operation he gets off the table, raises both arms aloft and in the style of Frankenstein lets out a long ""NNNNNOOOOOOOO!!!"". A good summary of the entire film in that one moment."
1073,1,"Like this film,you won't","If you want to test out your surround sound system, especially your sub woofer, then this is the movie for you. It is a whirlwind of noise and special effects. The acting is cardboard, and the cheesy dialog atrocious. Over the years since it's release, I've tried to watch it a number of times, but can never make it further than 20 minutes. In hindsight I should have left this movie out of my collection - at least it won't wear out! Maybe the reason I've never reviewed it before is because I couldn't come up with ten lines? Either way, only watch this movie if you are a total die hard fan who doesn't care about quality, and don't pay for it - watch it on free to air - although they should pay us to watch this failure."
1074,9,The prequels got too much hate when they came out,I dont often give high ratings for movies but the way this movie ties the rest together is much more mature than anything of the other movies has done. If you assume that palpatine planned every step in this entire series:<br /><br />
1075,3,Objective Overview,"I'm not a SW fan but I really enjoined episodes IV, V and VI mostly because the idea of the movie was so original. Episodes I and II, if you ask me, were ones of the worst disappointments ever, the story was bad, the acting was bad, the only thing that made the movies worth it were the special effects. You'll probably think that I'm going to say that episode III was the best one yet, well.... think again. It wasn't. I started watching the movie with a big YAWN, if you think that a couple of ships and lasers make a movie these days you probably have no idea what good movies are all about. Sure the special effects were great but it would have been more exciting if I haven't seen similar scenes all before. You see, I play a lot of video games and believe me when I say that Lucas should have been more careful with the battle scenes. If you have an extended knowledge of storyline you'll know that the episode III story has a smell of ""deja vu"" from a mile away. The reason Anakin turns to the Dark Side is very obvious thus you end watching the movie only for the special effects. As if thing couldn't get any worse the acting is very poorly made... the only one who made an effort in bringing the movie to life is Ewan McGregor, which did a hell of a job in his role. I never realized how ""wise"" was Yoda until this movie, I mean he never says anything that would help the heroes, he only says things that anybody, and I mean anybody, already know about."
1076,6,Six for the visuals,"The effects and visuals were a+ but overall it was rather boring. The writing was so melodramatic and the acting was sub par as usual. I also found the editing a little rigid. No real flare or pace to it. I also was disappointed with the way he (Lucas)basically threw away Padames character. When did she get so dumb? The way that Anakin switches to the dark side is also very weak. He is also not to bright for the so-called ""chosen one"". And then all these ""powerful"" Jedi's get assassinated without any trouble at all.George next time please hire a writer and give up a little control, please! Thank God that the sequels are finally over and Lucas can stop making movies without any checks and balances."
1077,7,Lucas Strikes Back,"Finally, after 22 years, the first ""Star Wars""-movie that really deserves the huge title ""Star Wars""."
1078,5,"Starts bottom low, ends up OK...",The first 10 minutes are so embarrassing you can't help wondering if Lucas actually copied someone else's work when he did the first 3 movies... maybe his secret twin brother or something...
1079,1,Save your money,"Never have I felt so compelled to comment on a film. This has got to be the most awful of the three prequels. The disgraceful script, shocking direction and lack of on screen chemistry between the central characters is completely overwhelming. People who have given this film a rating of more than 3/10 should go and read The Emperors's New Suit by Hans Christian Anderson..... you have all been fooled! what were you watching ??"
1080,10,The best of the new three,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was an excellent movie, a large number of question that I was wondering for years were finally answered with this movie. This film does take a different approach than the other Star Wars films. For one thing, given the fact that it received a PG-13 rating compared to the other films where they were rated PG, Revenge of the Sth has a darker approach to the plot which makes me understand why they gave the rating they did. The special effects were excellent and the plot and action was as well. The only drawback is we may never get to see another Star Wars film ever again but with respect to that this film was a good one to finish the series with. I really enjoyed the film and I hope it isn't too long until it come to video. Well done George Lucas! I give Revenge of the Sith 10 out of 10."
1081,,Revenge of the Sith,"Revenge of the Sith is the best of the Star Wars movies. Ewan McGregor rises up to do a strong Obi-Wan, and Hayden Christensen is quite sinister as he slowly sinks into Darth Vader. Episode 3 links the two trilogies. Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader by signing a pact with the devil in hell, a planet made of volcanoes. Anakin marries Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Their kids are Luke and Princess Leia. The younger Portman plays the mother of the older Carrie Fisher. Wookies appear in Revenge of the Sith. We see C3PO, R2D2, Yoda and Jar Jar Binks. George Lucas swears this is the last Star Wars despite originally saying there were 9 stories. Someone in the next generation will carry the franchise forward."
1082,7,Best Movie of the Star Wars Prequels.,This one is the most strongest within the Prequel Trilogy and that's saying a lot as it's the worst Trilogy in the Franchise.
1083,10,What it says on the tin...,"Okay, this one I really love, and I already love all three. This takes the cake. This movie has the High Ground. Hello there, General Kenobi. And General Grievous. The CGI in these is actually quite decent for the time in my opinion. Seeing Anakin burning and crawling towards his old master, after everything, really tears at the heartstrings...and whatever C-3PO has, I'm sure. With all the memes and clips available, seeing them all side by side, in order, in harmony, is beautiful. It completes the saga, somewhat. Each is perfectly balanced, like all things should be."
1084,1,"Ever heard of something called ""acting?""","I hated Ep. I and II (""I love you Padme! I hate you world!"") ugg. Garbage. But those looked like Hitchcock compared to this awful ""movie."""
1085,3,The Captain Should be Relieved,"""Revenge of the Sith"". As a movie, It is hardly better than ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"". And as the final jig-saw piece in the Mammoth Six Part Star Wars Epic, its terribly disappointing."
1086,10,Darth vader is heckin scary,How this sith lord is scary is that one he is very powerful 2 he is a good person at lightsabers 3 he is evil that is how darth vader is scary
1087,9,Wicked!,"***Seriously, LOTS of spoilers, so proceed with caution!*** Revenge of the Sith is so good, I hardly have words to describe it. My wife, who is not a particular fan of the series, came out of the theater asking, ""Where did all that good acting come from?"" It is a legitimate question after Jake Lloyd's wooden acting and Jar-Jar's entire ""performance"" in Ep. I, and the absolutely wretched romance scenes in Ep. II. Here, you care about the characters. You feel Anakin's ambivalence, Obi-Wan's anguish, Padme's sadness, Mace Windu's righteous anger, even the Emporer's lust for power."
1088,8,great,"Well, what can i say the third and final movie in the Star Wars franchise takes a devastating turn towards the dark side, as we see Anikin turn into the monstrous apprentice to the Emperor Darth Vader. The story carry's on by Obi and Anikin returning from the long, ongoing clone wars, but not all is as it seams. Anikins lust for greater power grows stronger in the presence of Chancerlorr Palpatine as he tries to manipulate Anikin into turning to the Dark side, and his love for Padme. Obi One who has now turned Jedi Master is sent to look for the droid commander General Grevious as he continuous to wage war on the Jedi Council. Whilst Obi is looking for the General Anikin is left on his own and so his lust for power and the fear that Padme will die in child birth grows. But all is realised when Anikin keeps attending the Chancerlorrs presence. When Obi returns the Jedi temple has been destroyed the Jedi are dead and the Chanserlor has a new Apprentice. On a security video, Obi One witnesses the destruction and cause of death that only a dark lord can prevent."
1089,5,So what...,This movie had great graphics and special effects.
1090,9,Ties it all together - Parental guideline,"Definitely one of my favorite movies and not because I am a Star Wars fan, but for the simple fact that George Lucas brought us from point A to point C, knowing that we might not want to see what occurs at point B! Truly a sinister movie that makes us wince at some of the actions of the main characters, yet the story must be told in order for following episodes to come together. The acting was on par with the High School play I just saw, but the special effects pulled this one through."
1091,8,Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is the best movie I've ever seen. It's more than your favorite episode,it's your favorite movie!! Adults will love it,and kids will think it's their favorite movie!! I loved it so much,when it comes on DVD on November 1,I'm going to wake up at 6:00,go to the store,be first in live to get Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith,and watch over and over and over again! You should too.It's the most saddest Star Wars movie,but it's the best! You'll love it! It captured my imagination! It will do it to you too!!!! It's really,really,really,violent! Just the way I like it!!!!!!!"
1092,5,forced,"Typical of 21st century Hollywood: pretentious, devoid of spontaneous humor and emotions, charmless, heavy, predictable Everything we expected and hoped for is here, thank you Mr Lukas, but nothing unexpected. I wish the audience had, sometimes, been rubbed the wrong way. The first half-hour is entirely gratuitous  nothing regarding the main characters and their relationships is at stake until the confrontation with Dooku. As for Anakin's dilemma, please, it sounds so conveeeeenient But deep down, what is it that really drives him? The script never seems to completely make up its mind: is it his overplayed love (stilted, unconvincing and terribly written) for Padmé, or his underplayed lust for power (this at least very well acted)? The latter would be more convincing  because you don't do the terrible thing Anakin does just for the love of a woman. Unless you really dramatize it and include the scene that is missing between Padmé and Anaking: i.e ""please Anakin, don't turn to the dark side, don't do the terrible thing you're about to do, just because you had a bad dream!"" And then see how he reacts to that. That would have really revealed what's in his mind. And in Padme's as well (what a one-dimensional character she is). Oh, and one other thing: when you dream that the woman you love, and who's pregnant, dies during childbirth, you keep it to yourself! Unless you're stupid or completely immature."
1093,7,At least Lucas ends the prequel trilogy on a (relatively) high note.,"Just like Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace before it, Revenge of the Sith, the last in George Lucas's Star Wars prequel trilogy, suffers from CGI visual overload, lots of preposterous action sequences and wooden acting from some of its stars."
1094,10,"""Everything it should have been""","""Everything it should have been"" After watching ""Attack of the Clones"" I was left wondering how on earth they could wrap up the transition from that to StarWars in a single movie. Well ""Revenge of the Sith"" not only accomplishes this, it is absolutely everything it should be. The special effects, story, everything was A+ quality. Its Achilles' heal; CG special effects, we've seen it all before. Star Wars redefined special effects. Revenge of the Sith only uses it. And because of this, it will entertain all, but be appreciated by few. It can never, and will never replace the original Star Wars, any more then we can return to our childhood and experience Star Wars for the first time. However, it is a worthy completion to the series. If seen before Star Wars, maybe our view would be switched."
1095,5,Mixed even after all this time,"While the Jedi are portrayed as so flawed (intentionally or unintentionally by George Lucas, mainly I think of Obi Wan's, ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes.""), Anakin's betrayal of Mace Windu in particular is one of the most ridiculous shifts I've seen, period. It is so hypocritical and bizarre of Anakin who literally killed a Sith lord, for ""being too powerful to be kept alive"" at the beginning of the movie! It is a betrayal and character turn that I need to be able to get behind and it's always rubbed me the wrong way."
1096,2,I can't believe it.,"Opinions are just that I guess. Individual viewpoints that people have gained from their own feelings about a particular thing. But for ""Revenge of the Sith"" to have received so many votes of 10/10 just dumbfounds me."
1097,3,Watching a cat cleaning itself is more entertaining!!!,"Before you read this review, I just want to let you know that I love the Star Wars stories and have been a fan since 6 years old. And I truly appreciate what George Lucas has done to the Hollywood industry with THX, ILM, Skywalker sound, and Skywalker ranch."
1098,6,A Lot of Missed Chances,"This is a nicely dark movie after the blandness of the first two, but I thought there were a lot of ways it could have been improved."
1099,9,Far better than it could have been,"I had been anticipating ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" since ""Attack of the Clones"" came out in 2002. That was when I really got into this saga and couldn't wait for the final film to be made. Despite that, I always feared that this film would be extremely disturbing and hard to watch, based on what I had read about the events that would take place in Episode III. Though the film was depressing and dramatic in parts, I was actually not bothered by that as much as I thought I would be. This film ended up having some of the best action scenes in the entire saga. For example, the battle between Mace Windu and Emperor Palpatine is one of the most exciting and fun-to-watch scenes in the series, not to mention Obi-Wan and Anakin's long-anticipated battle at the end. In any other case, I would hate to know how a movie is going to end before seeing it, but here, the ending is already well-known, and we are simply seeing the film to know how the events from Episode II are going to lead up to those of ""A New Hope."" The main problem with this film is the poorly-written dialogue, which doesn't seem to fit with that of the rest of the ""Star Wars"" films. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this film greatly and found it to be very well made. Anakin's downfall is made believable in this film, and the story is very interesting and kept me engaged for the entire time. Easily the best of the three newer ""Star Wars"" films, and the third best of the entire saga (behind ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back""). Pretty close to perfect."
1100,10,Pride goes before a fall.,"Of all the characters in Revenge of the sith. There's one character that I found interesting and almost felt sorry for. The character is Anakin Skywalker. As soon as Anakin became a well trained Jedi, there was one thing that he wanted and that was become a Jedi master just like the others. But as the council members rejected him, he became extremely angry and outraged. And felt he felt like that was unwelcomed and worthless. Then he did something that was strictly forbidden and that was making a pact with the dark side and soon enough, he allowed the forces of evil to consume his mind and corrupt him. By the time evil overpowered him, it was too late. He lost his friendship with Obi-wan and his beloved wife. The ultimate demise of him was that he had his legs and arm destroyed and ended up burning in lava. And became the infamous villain, Darth Vader. So if there's anything that we can learn from this movie and that don't let our egotistical behavior get the best of us and don't let evil influences ruin our lives."
1101,6,"SITH: Right letters, wrong order.","Lucas' last visit to Planet Hype is a disappointing affair and provides final proof that his obsession with digital effects and the possibilities they allow has, in a disturbing parallel with his ill fated on screen protagonist, blinded him to whats really important - the storytelling fundamentals. Having now seen the third and final Star Wars prequel I'm as confused as ever by the hysteria it's generated, especially in light of the hyperbole that has followed this film into cinemas, not least by those whom have actually SEEN it. Inital reviews have been overwhelmingly positive with comments like ""Lucas recaptures the old magic"" and endless variations on old chestnuts like ""a worthy addition to the Star Wara saga"" and ""wonderful storytelling"". I'm here to tell you this is nonsense. Revenge of the Sith may be better than its two predecessors but contrary to what you may have read it doesn't address any of the fundamental flaws that mired those films nor can it claim to be a success in its own right as it fails to adequately resolve the series back story satisfactorily. Once again you have a movie in which two years are allocated for visual effects but comparatively little time is spent on character direction or the screenplay. Consequently Sith is doomed before a single pixel has been generated because no volume of visual splendour can touch up those performances or that dialogue. Lucas may think these things are unimportant, in fact he's on record as having described dialogue (astonishingly) as just another sound effect, seemingly having forgotten that audience's relate to and invest in characters not rendered spaceships and lightsaber noises. The acting here is uniformly atrocious with good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman looking as though they were terrified of the camera and loathe to speak the plodding words that have been forced into their mouths. Mimimalist direction plays a part sure but the actors themselves should take some responsibility for every cringe inducing moment. The stilted, slow delivery and the lack of any verifiable emotion serves only to blunt the impact of the stories various moments of 'high drama'. Helen Keller would have made a more communicative Annakin Skywalker than Hayden Christensen. Ian MaDarmid makes the best of the material but even he, this time having been tantalisingly placed at the forefront of proceedings, veers from effective hamming to simple embarrassment on a few occasions. A tighter plot is nevertheless laden with botched plot points and continuity errors. The Jedi purge for example comes at the execution (no pun intended) of the Emperor's ""order 66"" which turns the cloned troopers on their Jedi masters. Fine but why hasn't this order been alluded to previously? A hint, a passing reference, a mention in Episode II, anything would have done but nothing until the moment itself?! Equally the double whammy of the Jedi's immortality via the force and Padme's death are poorly and thoughtlessly handled. Padme, taking her lead from the audience, apparently dies having 'lost the will to live', otherwise in perfect health. A midwife-droid tells Obi-Wan that he can't explain her condition which would be OK if there were any possibility the question may be answered later but with IV, V and VI in the can we now know it will never be addressed. Why set up a plot point you can't deal with? Utterly ridiculous. If Lucas is telling us she died of a broken heart he's officially and finally broken mine. The Jedi's immortality is also a fudge. Yoda tells Obi-Wan he must use his time in exile to gain the ability from no less than Qui-Gon. Assuming you accept that this has any internal story logic you might want to ask why or rather Qui the great man hasn't appeared to Obi-Wan previously, why just Yoda? In any event we now know why Yoda and Kenobi can do it, how you may ask, did Annakin learn? Palpatine made no mention of a Sith lord having the ability to bring THEMSELVES back from the dead. In fact the inconsistencies go on and on from Leia having memories of the mother she met for all of five seconds to the Death Star's embryonic appearance at the end prompting the question of just how long they actually take to build. Return of the Jedi suggests the turnover time is a great deal less than 20 years but why let what you've already established get in the way of a good story? Speaking of that story the devil is once again in the detail and if you look closely you can see him sticking two fingers up at you throughout the running time. The Jedi are still mirth inducingly slow to see the bleedin' obvious and as most of them are about as charismatic as plant life it's difficult to feel sympathy when they're brutally slain. So Star Wars in finally all over and so too I think, is its reputation. Millions felt it belonged to them but one man knew they were wrong and brutally proved it. This 2nd set of films was intended to broaden and deepen the series' mythology but in fact its betrayed the source of its own success, namely its fans, by replacing the dynamism, adventure and memorable characters of those films with self-important and ill-conceived prequels which have weakened the series overall and tarnished the older episodes by locking them into a back story with little or no emotive resonance. What you're left with then, when all the hype and related nonsense finally fritters away, is a six act movie in which the first act is unwatchable, the second is patchy but poor and the third ups the tempo but makes a mess of its promise. It's all very well telling people it gets better in the second 7 hours but seriously, who's going to want to watch a movie like that? Over to you world."
1102,6,"Far better than the first two, but not for the right reasons...","Revenge of the Sith occupies an odd position in terms of its' fans expectations--pretty much everyone who cares even a bit about the Star Wars saga knows exactly what's going to happen in the film, at least in a broad sense. The thrill that people flock to the theaters for is to see HOW it happens--how the monumental original trilogy will be connected to the far more lackluster recent two films to complete one of the grandest (at least in terms of popularity) movie sagas of all time."
1103,8,...and the Bridge is complete...,"STAR WARS: REVENGE OF THE SITH is, perhaps, the best film in the STAR WARS saga (the only possible exception is Episode V). This film does what I thought was impossible -- it ties up every lose end that was introduced in Episodes I, and II (as well as a few that took place in the outstanding Cartoon Network CLONE WARS tales) and ties them in well with where everything was starting in Episode IV... and it does it in a very entertaining way! I mean, let's face it: WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE! The acting in this film is the best of any STAR WARS film. The dialog is about on par with other STAR WARS films, but the delivery of that dialog is second to none. The Emperor feels terrifying and powerful, even as he sits in a chair in his office; the Jedi feel confident and unaware of the plots that are unfolding around them. The pain and betrayal in the characters comes through the film very well. The emotions are running high (something George Lucas is notoriously bad at) and it is very well handled."
1104,10,Lucas and ILM finally redeem themselves!,First off let me say that 'Episode III' features the greatest visual effects on film ever. No other movie has included computer animation at such scale that blends flawlessly with the real action. After visual effects disasters like the 'Mummy II' ILM proves that they are still the best.
1105,1,The worst of the lot?,"My friend got a copy of this movie over Christmas and insisted I watch it. So I did. This is the same friend who introduced me to parts 1 and 2 after telling him that I didn't find the Star Wars epic anything more then an over inflated episode of Star Trek and the like. Having watch 3 now, all I can say it must have been an advertisement for some computer fighting game because there was little else of note. Anyone who has watched someone else playing a computer game will know how boring this is. On top of that the script and acting were so poor that maybe they should have used animated people. I will give this movie 1 out of 10 because I did sit right through it and my friend seemed to like it a lot. And please don't tell me its deep. Thats pure crap. My friend likes space movies but thought the movies I like are boring as there is no action in them. Ah, well, each to his own. And, yes, he does go around carrying a light sabre. Hmmmmmmmm."
1106,9,ROTS makes the Kessel run in less then 12 parsecs,"As someone who never had the privilege of seeing the originals when they were in the theater, I belonged to a generation that picked up on the Star Wars craze later in life. I grew up watching Episodes 4, 5 and 6 and eagerly awaited the release of 1, 2 and 3 to finish the story. I am by no means a Star Wars fanatic but I do enjoy the movies a great deal. I was one of the very few that deeply enjoyed episodes 1 and 2 except for the rather amateur performance of Hayden Christensen in Episode 2. Now, to the movie. The energy in the theater was absolutely hair raising as we anxiously awaited the signature Star Wars theme. As the blue colored text faded back into space informing us of the story we were about to be told from ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."", anticipation in the theater reached it's absolute plateau when ""STAR WARS"" screamed to to life in front of us and the signature music sounded to loud cheers and hoots and screams. After the intro story had rolled telling us of what we were in for, I found myself absolutely riveted. The movie explodes in the early going in a fury of action and one-liners. This worried me because early explosions of action are usually indicative of a movie that is going to run out of gas and quick. Fortunately, the action never subsides and is complimented by strong performances by all actors and actresses, including the young Hayden who to this point had not impressed me with his acting ability. He had shown signs of promise but only signs. I enjoy his on screen time but it is far too obvious that he is still in the early stages of his acting potential. Natalie Portman is stunning as Padmei Omidala, furthering my belief that she has a great future in Hollywood. Once again, the theater erupted into hoots and cheers at the sight of a mad green midget with a light saber leaping everywhere (yes, Yoda). Ian McDermaid (sp?) shines as the sinister and scheming Emperor-to-be, presenting a truly terrifying performance. Ewan McGregor scores huge as Obi Wan, truly complimenting the role once played by Sir Alec Guiness (sp?). All in all, no disappointments are in this movie, except for one sighting of Jar Jar which was completely uncalled for in my opinion, it starts strong, stays strong and mixes the magic of ILM into a perfect conclusion of the prequel. Cudos to everyone in this film and to Lucas for giving us a great ending to this story."
1107,7,"Lucas: Great storyteller, horrible director","This will be short and sweet...Episode III is by far the best of the prequels, however it is still not the Star Wars that we all grew up with, and I'm not even from the original Star Wars generation. Once again the acting is dry, really, really dry. Once again there is too much CGI. I really hate how Lucas feels the need to use CGI just cause he can. Real creativity and power come from those who choose not to use all they have at once...Lucas chooses to use CGI in EVERY scene! It's distracting and just plain annoying. When the first and second trilogies are visually compared generations from now people will wonder why the first looks so fake and then second so real. Nice job George. Like I said once again the acting is dry, like Episode I and II. It's easy to see that Lucas can just not direct actors. Even the amazing, Oscar Nominated Natalie Portman is boring here! So to all those who are rating this a 10, please stop. Casablanca is a 10, Chinatown is a 10, The Empire Strikes Back is a 10. Revenge of the Sith is not. It's nice to the trilogy come to a close, however I know that many directors could have made this 7 into a 10 and that would have been amazing! Through the 2+hrs there are so many poor transitions and slow scenes and then heavy action scenes that one can easily ask what's going on? Forget about character development too. Yeah Anikan becomes evil, goes to the dark side....but it's weak. His emotions are weak, and that just goes back to the acting. Go see this in the theaters, just because it's Star Wars, but don't get your hopes up. All in all this does not deserve to be 236 on the IMDb list, and it does not deserve a 10. A 7 yes...it's an entertaining movie, but nothing GREAT. Good, but only good. Go see is and wait for James Earl Jones' horrible line, you'll know it when you hear it. Please just stick to coming up with the stories George, get some help with the writing and just give the directing chair to someone else."
1108,9,You Were the Chosen One!!!!!,"I watched Star Wars yesterday. It is the closing of a cycle, a very spectacular cycle that has influenced Hollywood for the last 28 years."
1109,4,Boring Wooden Acting! Zzzzz.......,"When Obi-Wan Kenobi uttered those immortal words after watching the hologram ""I cannot watch anymore"" it should read ""I cannot ACT anymore"". As for the fight sequences they seemed to drag on forever, and, when the Jedi were being betrayed, why did they not foresee the danger beforehand (so much for Jedi skills). In fact the only reasonable actor in this mess seemed to be Yoda, at least he seemed to extol some kind of expression on his face. The special effects were as I expected, way over the top. This film although it tried to exemplify itself by tying up loose ends does not compare at all to the Star Wars original first two films where at least good acting and original scripting held sway."
1110,7,Passion of the Lucas,"George Lucas had to deliver this time. And delivered it well, he has. Episode III is the bridging between the twenty some-odd years off a dynasty that has defined a generation. It brings in those viewers now who grew up knowing that generation. Towards the end of Episode III, the chaos brings about the identity we all know and love. The music. The style. Darth Vader. And the 'New Hope.' Sure, it's havoc to watch. But after the first two prequels, I was kind of hoping that's what I would get."
1111,7,It's over!,"So at last we come full circle to the supposedly climactic ending of the first three episodes in Lucas' lifelong project. First of all, don't let its box office records fool you. Relying entirely on the previous five movies for its audience, ""Revenge Of The Sith"" takes the let's-get-this-over-with approach to story telling. But hey, at least it looks cool. I like to think that I walked into this movie the way everyone should: with no expectations. From experiencing the first two episodes, it's more than obvious that if you are expecting any kind of award winning performances, deep and thought provoking plot developments, or memorable moments... you'd better head back to the original three movies. This movie is all about overwhelmingly overdone CG settings and scenes, loose ends being tied up, and numerous flashy saber battles. Now, I'm not saying any of these things are bad, however like the first two episodes, ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is nowhere near the degree of the aged and classic original series. It suffers once again from a hammy love story, a rushed conclusion, and what has to be the single worst ""NOOOOOO"" scene ever recorded on film. Also, while it's no secret that Lucas is a fan of wipe transitions for the films, I honestly think he went overboard with the things in this one. It doesn't help that each scene averages at about five to seven minutes before leaping somewhere else in the story. I can appreciate speedy pacing, but this isn't supposed to be a music video. The last twenty minutes of the film serve as a reminder of how exactly this series ties in with the one we grew up with as kids, by showing each character going their separate ways and heading to their waiting place for the whole story to pick up again in episode four. As for the actors, I'm pretty sure most of them were more or less tired of playing the same roles, along with the same dialog and character ranges, for the second or third (or in some cases fourth or sixth) time. You can tell just by their shallow performances that most of them have had enough. All that aside, let us not forget that we are dealing with a Star Wars movie. There's always room for saber fights, gun battles, and ship to ship combat, and ""Revenge Of The Sith"" has more than enough of those to keep you from walking out of the theater. The series has really gotten an MTV makeover in the last 20 years as well. No more final saber battles in a wussy Emperor chamber. Nope, now we have to have the climactic battle of Jedi and Sith on hovering platforms each resting a foot over a river of lava. Oh well... it's Star Wars. And besides, the kids will love it. "
1112,2,Watch with earplugs and it improves a star,"Utter crap. Too busy to look at and will melt your brain if you listen to the actors line read their dialogue. I cannot, for the life of me, understand the people writing reviews claiming that this is the best thing since antibiotics. I've heard better dialogue in late night infomercials. Obviously in dire need of the Han Solo character who stands back and asks, ""You can't possibly be serious about any of this joining the dark side crap, right?"" I am looking forward to seeing the film student cut of this film - like the ones that come out after each of the new Episodes- where some younger, talented person who actually gives a crap about the franchise manages to dub in entertaining and respectable dialogue and reshape the action into something I can enjoy without having ADHD."
1113,6,Strictly OK,"Well, it wasn't as bad as Episode 2. I thought the first hour plus was extremely slow, in spite of the much-talked about opening battle scene. But once things started getting darker it became more interesting, especially the descent of Anakin. However, the reason for him turning to the Dark Side was lame at best, and never fully developed. The dialogue was terrible as usual (Obi-Wan inserting ""witty"" comments into every sentence is NOT funny), and the light sabre work is getting a little wearying. And don't let me start on the love scenes. Not as Bollywood as Episode II but still quite sickening, frankly. But I feel Anakin was much better played this time, as was Obi Wan and the brilliant Palpatine. But I can only hope Natalie Portman gets better scripts, because her lines were just awful: ""You've changed Anakin! I don't know who you are any more!"" It WAS heck of an exciting feeling to see Darth Vader, and hear the Darth Vader theme we know so well. Plus the best and most powerful scenes, I feel, were the mass betrayals and the unfolding of Palpatine's plan. So I'd give it a 9 for action, and overall darkness, but a 4 for acting and dialogue, plot and character development. Oh and a 10 for limiting Jar Jar Binks to a five second slot!"
1114,8,CGI vs. puppets: What does it take to make a good star wars movie?,"I have been an avid fan of star wars since I was a young boy. I have seen the old trilogy countless times and know many of the lines by heart. It is then expected that coming into this new trilogy, I had quite high expectations. Unfortunately, most of those died after Episode I and an insufferable Anakin Skywalker that looked like he was pulled out of Nickelodeon. "
1115,6,the final act of what could have been....,"Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the recent trilogy, but this really isn't saying much. In order to fully appreciate the film it must be considered the final third act of one piece of work. Unfortunately although this final film is much more entertaining and contains much that is worthy of credit, it has to pull itself up from the appalling first two films. I found the story of Annakin's rise and fall to the dark-side interesting and filled with dramatic potential and perhaps in better hands this would have been better realised. Unfortunately George Lucas's skills as a scriptwriter are non-existent and whilst the story is excellent, the realisation of it is very poor."
1116,1,Wow - I was very disappointed,"This movie was pure tripe. So many plot holes left open, so little explanation for the turning of Anakin to the dark side - it is almost farcical. I saw the movie with my girlfriend and we just turned and looked at one another during some of the dialogue and groaned. The action sequences aren't well executed even if the graphics are superb."
1117,3,What was Lucas thinking!?!?!,"George Lucas may have been showered with praise and given a life-time achievement award at Cannes recently, but that doesn't excuse the fact that he cannot write decent dialogue and has no talent for directing. He may have blagged it with the original Star Wars, but he used his head and paid someone else to write & direct The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi for him - and boy did it show!! "
1118,9,The Force is strong with this one...,*contains mild spoilers*
1119,3,Revenge of the Sh*t,"After posting equal reviews for the other two films I decided to post one for this as well. First I will list plot holes in the films, and on to bad acting, then flaws in design."
1120,6,Not as good as the originals,"I originally gave this a 5/10 but Palpatine gained it an extra star. The story was decent, but found Christiansen's delivery very wooden and lacking the spirit and enthusiasm I saw in A new Hope which I recently rewatched."
1121,10,It was worth the wait! -- One mother of a force-tale...,"I have been a major Star Wars fan since I was about six years old, and I can tell you quite simply: It was worth the wait! Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a magnificent ending on one of the greatest sagas of all time (including future). First I must emphasize the visuals in this movie WILL blow you away, it's just ludicrous cool quality constantly and it is very hard to point a finger at just about any of the visuals. The sound is just as good as the first trilogy, although I must admit listening to the sweet music was not the top priority when seeing it the first time. Hayden (Anakin) does a really good job of turning evil, compared to his pretty vague performance in Episode II, you can easily tell that his skills have improved, but I'm sure his script has too! Personally I think the 'turning evil' part happens a little to quick, but I guess the show must go on, this movie is just like going nuts in a candy store, sweet treats everywhere. Even though this is by far the most dark of the films, it's quite possibly also the most laugh-inducing, being filled with small jokes and silly comments especially from our droid friends. The movie puts many things in perspective and you will be given a great deal of information that will combine the whole saga in to one mother of a force-tale I rate it at 9.8 out of 10, were it not for a few worrying details it would be perfect, but again nothing can be that perfect..?  Thanks Lucas, I owe you one!"
1122,10,Star Wars at it's finnest,"The best Star Wars movie there is, I Empire Strikes Back is the fan favourite, but this movie expands the galaxy of starwars any other movie of the Franchise done before, with great character development and a great story this movie does make history making the best Star Wars story ever seen"
1123,7,Solid Acting and Great Battles,"This was a good film, the story flows through each scene. Everything is connected well, and the acting was great. Of course, what is Star Wars without battles? This has possibly the best choreographed Star Wars battles of in all the films. Solid film, and a step up from the other two prequels."
1124,10,What a way to go out with a bang!,"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away arguably the best trilogy of all time was made, Star Wars. As a trilogy it had it all, the characters (namely Vader and Han Solo), the plot (""I am your father"") and the 'out of the box' mentality, Star Wars really did set the world alight. With the trilogy ended and fans hungry for more what next? Prequels, based on the film's best loved villain Darth Vader."
1125,2,"Just awful, so sad.","Other than the fact that this film fills out what ever plot holes are left, and does it in the most rudimentary way possible, there is no reason to see this film. The acting is awful, the dialog is laughable, and the action is anti-climatic to a fault. Lucas has fun never actually doing anything daring with any of the characters, I wanted so badly for Darth (Anakin) to revel in the dark side and allow himself to be consumed by evil, but it never happened, or at least the character never showed it. I constantly found myself saying, when two paths diverged in the plot, ""No, Lucas wouldn't do it that way, it's much to obvious""; every time I was disappointed at how right I could be, and how unwilling Lucas was to take chances. This was the last movie, Lucas could have done whatever he wanted as long as a few things fell into place and he didn't he played it safe and unoriginal every time, leading to a really timid and lackluster end. I really feel like the good reviews given by the media are simply because there is no point in hurting the man's feelings, we're at the end, it's over, it isn't like he's going to continue making films now, except maybe ""Indy"", and if we're lucky, he'll stay the hell away from that. Lucas is a bad writer and a worse director, what I can't help but notice is that Ewan Mcgregor and Natalie Portman can act, I've seen it, but in this movie there just terrible. I cannot fathom a way to blame anyone but Lucas, for their shortcomings. I think that it's obvious that the best Star Wars movie, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was not helmed or written by Lucas, and it's for that reason."
1126,9,Watch it twice 1st!,"Well, I'm not going to go on babbling about how good or bad this movie was. I was pretty excited a few hours before heading out to see it how I was about to come full circle with this ongoing saga that Mr. Lucas has made for himself over the last 28 years."
1127,9,I finally liked this Star Wars movie...,"unlike Episodes 1 and 2 that sucked. My big complaint with Episodes 1 and 2 was the cheesy, simplistic dialog. While this movie had a few of those scenes, especially in the beginning, the dialog got better. It didn't sound as if written by an 8 year old. I'll skip the plot since about everyone already knows it. I think the rise of the ""dark side"" and how Aniken became Darth Vader was very cool since you know how it all turns out once he meets his son again. I cringed when we find out how Aniken gets all his scars and loses his limbs. That part was gruesome for a pg-13 film. And all the fights with light sabers were well done. Obi-Wan was really good in that fight at the end. The movie even made you feel bad for the jedi when they are being assassinated."
1128,3,What a disappointment,The story everybody has been waiting for...the grand finale. What a disappointment.
1129,8,Well done,"This was worth waiting for. The story was smooth and all the pieces fell into place. Aniken is still a little whinny for my taste (so was Luke) but the movie was definitely good story telling. Special effects were stunning as always. Sound effects were great. A great family film, even the children in the theater were quite, imagine. Daughters should take their fathers for the bonding experience. My father and I have seen all of the Star Wars movies together. Now we need a history on Yoda and Star Wars is complete. Maybe the extended versions could include a bit more? Hats off to the cast and crew..... again. Well done."
1130,8,"Despite some holes, it still holds up","We had to endure the first two films of the prequel trilogy to get to Revenge of the Sith. Like two opening acts before a Rolling Stones concert, the undercard will never be as good. Sith does not disappoint."
1131,8,Simply Amazing!,"After watching the ""Clone Wars"" cartoon series (not to mention the previous two prequels), I was prepared to be fairly blown away by this movie - and I wasn't - initially. I saw it on opening night and was so nervous that it was going to have that cheesy dialogue and pointless, unbelievable moments like the last ones, but I was wrong. Overall, it was a solid film - I thoroughly enjoyed it - but I still felt like I wanted more. "
1132,8,"Best Star Wars Prequel, on Par with the Originals","Revenge of the Sith is definitely the best prequel. It fixes almost all mistakes done through the first two movies. This movie is emotional, dark, well-driven, and the story is excellent. Anakin Skywalker is a complete step-up from the character he was in Episode II, it almost feels like he's another character. Hayden's modified acting makes Anakin a protagonist you can understand, encourage, and stand with. A weak character, however, was Padme, at times she felt unneeded and filler, even though she should be an essential point in this movie. The antagonist is perfect. He is well-driven, motivated, and is basically a mastermind. The way the movie's tension increases as we progress is incredible, all the way leading up to the final confrontation, which is also a masterpiece. The CGI is also a minor weakness, but doesn't necessarily ruin the viewing. While you might find yourself bored at times, the end result is a powerful, fun, and emotional conclusion to the prequel trilogy."
1133,1,Worst movie ever.,"This movie was terrible. The acting was so terrible, I can't even explain how much disgust I felt upon seeing the credits pop up. I can't believe that Lucas or any editor would allow that to make it to theatres. Most of the scenes seemed as if they were the first and only take, and it wasn't a good take. "
1134,,I rate it 8.1,"Great story line, nearly makes up for the previous two films, awesome fight scenes, great music by John Williams as usual to go with it, the romance between Anakin and Padmé is finally done RIGHT. Links perfectly with the original trilogy and no Jar Jar Binks!"
1135,10,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith Review,"This movie for any fan of star wars is a must see. After episodes 1 & 2 put doubt in the minds of many people that George Lucas was going to disappoint when he brought the saga full circle is thrown out instead you are left with an exhilarating even enlightening feeling that the star wars episode 3 has finally achieved what it had to do the saga is now complete. The only disappointment i felt was that this is it, no more star wars but do we need it the story of the tragedy Anakin has been told and Lucas has bought that to us in a 6 episode series of films which will thrill us from start to finish every time. So get out and watch EP3 and hope you feel the same way."
1136,9,Lucas saved the best for last.,"Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee (Voices of Matthew Wood, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz) Directed by George Lucas."
1137,10,The one you've been waiting for,An epic 28 years in the making. Revenge of the Sith takes its rightful place in the pantheon alongside A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.
1138,10,Not to give it away but... Anakin becomes Darth Vader,"Remember when Attack of the Clones came out and you were thinking, ""I really wish Anakin would shut up and Yoda's fight have gone for longer.""? In Revenge of the Sith, Anakin shut up and Yoda's fight went for longer. Even the small amounts of humour of the other movies are missing from the final (sort of) chapter of this epic piece. This is due to the pulling out all the stops and just showing the dark side weave its cruelty. It begins with the Clone Wars and they are dark, brutal and well portrayed. For the first time, a ship is shown entering an atmosphere and you'll think that looks more amazing than any other effect because you'll forget it isn't real. Suddenly, you are in a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. Speaks like this Yoda still does, but his fight with Darth Sidious is the coolest thing in Star Wars. Two masters each balancing the other perfectly, each incapable of defeating the other. It is so good, the cuts to Anakin and Obi-Wan having their own duel is, if anything, a little reliever from the suspense. Too many people hated this movie before it was made and many more suggest that, of course, ""The originals were better."" In the case of the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, this is somewhat true, but not for this movie. For the fanatical Star Wars fans, this is the movie they always wished for and any fan who doesn't like it is not in touch with the Force."
1139,4,I was disappointed,"I have never written a review on this website before but I felt very frustrated after watching RotS last night. Not as frustrated as after watching Matrix 3 but frustrated none the less. Here was a chance for Lucas to make a movie without a happy ending and create the Vader character we all appreciate. After Clones, I felt we could only get better. But every time Anikin and Padme were on the screen I was cringing. The dialogue was so bad I thought my seven year old daughter could have written more real conversations. I really like the opening sequence and the juxtaposition of the battle between Obi-Wan/Vader and Yoda/Lord Sidius. But even these light saber battle paled in comparison to previous scenes (eg. the battle between Obi Wan and Qui-Gon/Darth Maul). The camera angles always seemed wrong. The close-ups always ruined the flow. These battles should be seen from afar (think the last sword fight in the Errol Flyn version of Robin Hood) but all Lucas could come up with was camera angles that showed the faces of the fencers with flashes of light. It was lame! One thing that really made me mad was the love story and its role in Padme's demise. I left the movie thinking that she gave up on her children. They said nothing was wrong with her and she lost the will to live. I have to assume this was due to a broken heart. So, this suggests her love of Anikin was stronger than her love of her own children. I thought this was unbelievable. Lucas should have just let her die during child birth. It would have been more believable. The other thing that really made me mad was the creation of the re-engineered Darth Vader. When his table was raised all I could think of was Professional Wrestlers crossed with Muppets. Then when Lord Sidius told him he caused Padme's death (which was kind of true) and he screamed No, I actually started laughing at how lame it was. Do not get me wrong, I am a real Star Wars fan but I expected more. Maybe I expected too much. But, this is just me $0.02"
1140,10,Why the Star Wars prequels deserve due recognition....,People habitually criticise George Lucas.
1141,7,"Highly flawed, but still effective","Do not get the idea that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a perfect movie. There are both issues that Lucas failed to confront from Episodes I and II that, unfortunately, still exist, and there are definitely questions about areas that are introduced in this movie. Nevertheless, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is still by far the best of Lucas' three prequels, and it does set the stage well for what is to come in what became the masterpieces of the saga."
1142,6,A disappointing end to a rather disappointing prequel trilogy.,"When I started watching the Star Wars prequels I was maybe expecting something a little higher than what I actually found. I hadn't seen the original trilogy but I was confident Lucas would be able to make a couple of good films using today's CGI and since you can only get better at something the more you do it; maybe these films thirty years on would, in fact, be rather impressive. The only negative opinions I'd heard surrounding these films were from hardcore fans of the originals anyway; something I certainly am not. But, what was disappointing in the end was that this little series of films missed the mark more often than not; episode three guilty in its own way."
1143,7,A tad better than episode 2.,"Hayden Christensen is still wooden. However, it ties it all together. Hayden's best scene is where he blames<br /><br />OB1 for all his troubles and becomes Darth Vador"
1144,10,"gory, innocence gone, adventure gone, soap opera not for kids","I have always been a fan of star wars and star trek. It started to slip in clones because it was too soap opera like. This one is extremely dark and all the adventure is gone. We get to see a disgusting scene in which Anakin is burned and mutilated going on and on.The coughing cancer victim bad guy is quite revolting and the closeups of dead woman is nasty. We have reached a new low with Anakin's slaughter of children and of course we see the dead children's bodies.This is not for kids or the young at heart. Obviously Lucas has gotten old and jaded and it shows. I only give high ratings for special effects and great music which divert from this dark film, not at all for kids. Go Luke!"
1145,1,Guide to ruining a great story,"First of all i'd like to point out i have always been a big fan of Star Wars. ALready in my early years i dreamed about this exciting far away galaxy, stunned by the special effects in the movies, the acting the exciting creatures there is in this Universe. First the special edition box came out, wow! that cant be bad can it? well Geroge manage to screw that up anyway, the classic example Han Solo shoots first! why would you ever wanna change that? it ruins the whole point of the scene, too see what kind of guy he is. A smart and experienced Bounty Hunter but no no. oh well lets get back to this movie (could go on and on for hours but lets not waste IMDb space.) "
1146,9,Entertaining...so give on your loathing,"Anyone who goes to a star wars movie to witness a spectacle of quality film making will be disappointed. Notice the fact that I never said the new star wars. I really do mean all of them. I'm sorry if your one of the millions that think that the original three are a gift from god and the new three are pure sin, because the difference in quality between the two is far less great than you realize. Star Wars was never a classic because of great script writing and in case you haven't noticed, the acting has always sucked, save a performance or two in every movie. The reason that the first two sucked is because you go from good verses evil to something about a trade federation and a blockade. Star Wars and big words don't go well together. 3 reverts back to a simple story with lots of action, exactly what we all love about the originals. And whether you like it or not, Hayden did a great job if you think about the lines he had to say and the director he had to work with. The CGI gets in the way much less than in the past and the Obi-Wan- Anakin fight is awesome. And best of all, if all of this doesn't delight you, you can always revert to wondering what in gods name possessed Lucas to create that last Vader scene with the ""NOOOOOOOOO"" or why the hell Greivios keeps coughing. Final word...entertaining"
1147,10,Amazing,"This movie finally puts Star Wars back where it belongs. Everyone knew this film would be darker and boy did it live up to that. The battle sequences are absolutely amazing over Coruscant and with 5 different lightsaber fights through the movie that makes this the fastest paced hand to hand Star Wars out of all 6. It's hard to tell where it ranks among the original trilogy but I can guarantee you it towers over Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace. Yoda sums up all of George Lucas's feelings when skeptics were looking for another let down when he quipped ""Not if anything to say about it I have"". This is going to be the best movie of the summer, I am sure. The actors are actually quite good compared to Episodes I and II so that is big as well."
1148,9,Final Star Wars Bears Messege (By Charlotte Higgins),"The republic is crumbling under attack from alien forces. Democracy is threatened as the leader plays on the people's paranoia. Amid the confusion it is suddenly unclear whether the state is in more danger from insurgents, or from the leader himself."
1149,1,Quite simply the worst big budget movie I've ever seen !!,"After episodes 1 and 2 I had no expectations towards this film. But with ""Revenge of the Sith"" George Lucas has done the impossible: Inspite of a huge budget, incredible special effects and an interesting story he managed to create the worst movie I have ever seen!"
1150,,The Saga Concludes,"And what a conclusion it is. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a brilliantly constructed film that very neatly ties up all the loose ends from the previous 5 chapters. While it begins almost comically, it takes on a decidedly sinister tone once Anakin's corruption to the dark side begins to take hold."
1151,9,The Star Wars Franchise is set to turn 30,Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is a great movie that I saw twice in the theater. I would say that Star Wars 3 has an ensemble cast. I was sad when Samuel L Jacksons character met his demise. The special effects in this film are better than in Episode 1. It is nice to see Natalie Portman still in the franchise as Princess Padme. General Grevious is defeated after it is foreshadowed that this robot is headed for the coughin'. That must have been some virus. 
1152,2,Don't Give George Lucas your money EVER!!!,I give this a 2 and not a 1 just because the ghost of Alec Guinness deserves better. 
1153,7,Very Disappointed,"OK so after episodes I and II, I wasn't really expecting very much from this movie. There seemed like a lot of ground for Lucas to cover which had been exacerbated by the slow pace of the previous two films. The plot was actually pretty good and the story ties everything together much better than I thought it was going to, by the end I wasn't really think such and such a part didn't make sense... However... the acting was really terrible (and as Portman and McGregor have proved themselves to be excellent actors it is hard to blame anything other than the direction), the editing was really really terrible, the script was horrible, the pace was all wrong, and it was probably an hour too short. Many of the above problems were to be expected, Lucas is a poor script writer and is not good at getting the best of performances from his actors. There are far too many scenes in the film that were not needed and because of this the important scenes feel rushed and squeezed into the remaining time."
1154,10,"Great movie, one of the best.",Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith should be called Star Wars: Making the Galaxy Great Again.
1155,1,Re-Watching today...and it's still a steaming pile,"I'm only watching to watch frail stick-insect-thin Padme die in childbirth. (you'd think they would have solved that problem, robot midwives or not, by then!). Natalie Portman is SO miscast. She looks barely capable of hefting a cosmopolitan martini to her trembling lips, never mind wielding a sword and hopping around. No feeling about any other dumb thing and not a flicker of awe over THA RISE OF DARTH VADER. Ho and hum. ....I will say this in defense of Hayden Christensen: he said in an interview he was ORDERED to play his role in an emotionless way. If people watched the young future DV and sympathized with him, it would kill the vibe of him as a villain."
1156,9,Best Served Sith,"Revenge is a dish best served ""Sith."" Consequently, audiences soon realized the ""Empire"" was a force to be reckoned with back in 1980. A word to the wise: Read the book after you see the movie because the latter never usually lives up to expectations. Viewers are not sure what the character is thinking at that practical moment unless their watching a Scorsese or film noir. The motion picture and graphic novel--hence the name & nature--dramatize parts compared to the film-based novel. For instance, Anakin (Hayden Christensen) Skywalker maims Mace (Samuel L. Jackson) Windu instead of simply ""knocking his lightsaber aside."" On the contrary, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) persuades Young Skywalker--with the greatest of ease--to decapitate Count (Christopher Lee) Dooku. The cloaked creator loses his novel enthusiasm on-screen--even at the sight of Vader's first steps. George Lucas gets the parallelism right; sadly, the scene is a little trite. Rest assured, Lord Sidious does not scream, ""It's alive!"" Lucas masters the art of insinuation since most feel 99 percent confident Sidious killed Plagueis. For a long time, die-hard fans were led to believe the power of the dark side from within caused the Emperor's deformity. Come to find out, the culprits are his Force lightning and Master Windu. Darth Sidious disfigures himself within 28 seconds of electrocution. Near the end of ""Jedi,"" Luke (Mark Hamill) Skywalker maintains his boyish looks after a total of 45 excruciating secs. Georgie-boy, that's what's called a discrepancy. In spite of smite, the lack of criticism implies concord in the unspoken elements that complete the saga. Crowds, far and wide, must journey a short way to revel in the monumental movie. Grieve for Gen. Grievous (Matthew Wood), the once-cybernetically-sustained Kaleesh saves the life of a being that sought to destroy him. Shame, shame, the people know his survivor's name--the one who's ""so uncivilized."" Nothing discreet comes of Anakin & Padmé (Natalie Portman) sharing the same quarters, yet none are the wiser regardless of the hour. Coruscant residents need to restructure neighborhood watch rather than their government. ""Revenge"" prevails as one of those seven deadlies humankind gladly embraces on a daily basis. If you allow yourself, anyone (including the best) is susceptible to the dark side. For the hard of head, love is sacrifice--learn from the mistakes of Poor Little Anni."
1157,3,An unimaginative bore,"It is strange to see a film so lacking in imagination. Two hours and a half with, apart from some obvious and puerile slapstick, no humour or irony is a bit wearing. Yankland set in the future with some chaps with funny hats on seems a pretty feeble thing to imagine too."
1158,10,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is amazing,The story is very interesting and well paced. The characters are really well written and fun to watch. The score is beautiful with amazing fight scenes. The dialogue is much better than in Episode 1 and 2. The movie has beautiful emotional moments. The acting is also very good and believable. One of my favorite Star Wars movie.
1159,10,Spectacular Special Effects,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (2005) is one of the prequels to the later Star Wars movies that were made in the 70s and 80s. It is an Action/Adventure/Fantasy/Sci-Fi flick about Anakin's struggle regarding whether or not he should stay true to the Jedi order or if he should switch to the dark side in order to protect his pregnant wife from dying as he had seen in a premonition. 
1160,8,"Flawed, but excellent","First of all, I'd like to say that I don't consider myself to be a huge fan of the Star Wars movies, but I can see their appeal. Thanks to ""Revenge Of The Sith"" I'm a born-again Star Wars fan. Seeing the third installment of the infamous saga made me want to go home and watch the 4th, 5th and 6th episodes again. There's a lot to like in this film, which is definitely the strongest of the prequels."
1161,5,"Revenge of the Sith is completely forgettable, cheesy and worst of all, a shadow of what might have been.","Revenge of the Sith is, in my view, the worst Star Wars film, not just for its many flaws, but for the lost potential in making this film. I beseech all Star Wars fans to seek out Matthew Stover's novelisation of this film, in which he fixes EVERY single flaw and delves so much deeper into the seduction of the dark side and the transition to the Empire. Stover's novel is the reason I find this film so hard to watch - its just a harsh reminder of how bad the acting can be."
1162,1,One of the worst movies ever,"Yes I am old enough to remember the first Star Wars movie, in theaters. It was an exciting ride, and a great story. The special effect actually augmented the story, rather than detracting from it. Sad to say that trend has flipped -- the series started downhill at ""Revenge of the Jedi"" and has swirled into the toilet of bad storytelling ever since."
1163,10,Without a doubt - Best of the Saga (that INCLUDES Empire),"I guess the first thing people will want to know is whether this film is as dark as George Lucas has consistently promised. Well in a word, yes. It is as dark as dark can be, everything goes to hell! It's a different sort of darkness to 'Empire Strikes Back'. We can totally relate to what Anakin goes through  his fears of losing another loved one, the lust for power and respect. There is also a shadow of suspicion and doubt that looms over the characters of 'Sith', no one trusts anyone. The Senate, the Jedi, the Chancellor, the Republic and the Separatists are all played off against one another. Even Anakin is used as a Pawn in a political game of tug-o-war between the Chancellor's office and the Jedi Council. His loyalties are tested, but we all know what side he chooses in the end! Revenge of the Sith opens immediately with an amazing space battle. The level of detail and dozens of ships within this battle was awesome. The first half-hour of the film feels very much like Episodes 1 & 4 with its light-hearted gags and general banter. What immediately stands out is the change in the relationship between Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, acting as equal Brothers rather than with Student/Master subordination. It makes their inevitable squaring off all the more tragic. Another thing that strikes you is the maturity of Anakin, how he has evolved from that annoying teenager last seen in 'Attack of the Clones' to a more mature, disciplined and well-rounded Jedi. Overcritical Fanboys have NO RIGHT to b-itch about Hayden Christenson's performance within this film. He delivers. Lucas masterfully feeds us Palpertine's seduction of Anakin with believability. For all the loyalty Anakin has for the Jedi Order, they simply don't understand  they could never accept his marriage and love for Padme, never allay his anxieties about becoming a father, and most importantly NEVER understand Anakin's desperation to prevent realisation of the premonition of his wife's death at all costs. It is these fears that Palpertine exploits  telling Anakin 'takes from the Darkside' of unnatural Sith powers (that Jedi try to keep secret) that will prevent all of these terrible things from happening. You can see that Anakin's interest in dabbling into the Darkside is for good intension as he THINKS he is doing the right thing, but as Yoda told Luke so rightly within 'Empire', ""once you go down the dark path, consume you it will"" Anakin becomes an uncontrollable man, possessed."
1164,9,Excellent 9/11 Analysis: Sad but True - The Force *IS* in force!,"The fight scenes were out of this world, whether General Grievous against Obi-Wan or Obi-Wan vs. Anakin or Yoda vs. Sidious/Palpatine... Well-choreographed! It tied up about 90% of the loose ends from Parts 4, 5 and 6! "
1165,,OK so its not what it used to be! But I was 4 yrs old then.,Saw ROTS about an hour ago and read some comments about the film. Lots giving 10/10 and some giving 1/10.
1166,1,Even Worse than the first 2,"This movie was a great disappointment to me. Even more-so than the first 2, which were horrible as well. The corny dialogue between Anakin and Padme that began in episode 2 soars to new heights in this one. (I literally laughed out loud in the theater during what was supposed to be a touching seen.) Good actors must be hard to find these days, because no one is really good in their role. This is probably due to the fact that the dialogue is so stupid that it's impossible to pull off believably. The special effects were good of course, but many of the shots were too busy and distracting which took away from the overall grandeur of some shots. The story line was not bad, but as I have previously stated it was hampered by poor acting and even worse dialogue. Overall, definitely not deserving of the hype it has received."
1167,5,Best of the three isn't saying much,"Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith is generally regarded as the best of the prequels, but that's like saying it's the best dump you had all day. All the problems of the previous two films are still here: the awkward romantic scenes, the turgid script, uneven acting and waaay too much unnecessary CGI."
1168,9,The perfect way to end a trilogy,"From the years 1977-1983, many people saw how Vader went from evil to coming back as Anakin again along with the story about his twin children that we all know and love. But, the question was back then is how did it all happened? For example, how did Anakin become Vader? How did the fall of the Jedi happened? And why were the Skywalker twins separated from birth? Well, this movie had all the answers everyone needed and it's perfect."
1169,10,"Not only the best Star Wars film, but on of the best films ever made","A heartbreaking story of a hero becoming a villain. If you watch the films in the production order, it hits especially hard. Acting is on point: Hayden Christensen is especially impressive: how one could so perfectly capture all the love of Anakin as well as the dark side of Vader is beyond my comprehension. The story itself makes you feel all the emotions. Prepare to watch a visually stunning film with profound philosophical, psychological and political questions which is going to make you cry about the doomed romance even if you didn't cry during Titanic."
1170,5,Sleeping pill,There are two great lines in this movie:
1171,10,"The Last Piece of the Puzzle (Spoiler, I guess, but is it really?)","In the beginning of this film, I couldn't wait for the appearance of Darth Vader. By the end, I was saddened by his presence. I never thought, in the 18 years I've waited to see this movie, that would ever happen. This film is the most powerful of the entire series. It may not be the absolute best, but it is relentless in its action, its consequence, and its warnings of how darkness can prevail. A note to Star Wars fans: watch Episode IV immediately after viewing this or you will be depressed. To non-Star Wars fans: watch Episode IV anyway after viewing this. George Lucas has done the impossible: he has put mythology on the big screen. Bravo, Lucas, bravo."
1172,7,Has there ever been a more rapid decent into evil?,"Darth Vader, a name that for most people (even with his redemption in E6) is the very pinnacle of evil. George Lucas took him, from basically a shallow egotistical kid, to cold-blooded baby killer in the span of about 45 seconds. I think more time and effort should have been given to this transformation. Would have cost less money than the special effects that fill the bulk of the movie and would have developed the character to make the transformation more believable."
1173,6,OK,Pretty good movie best of the sequels The ending was really good but still not the best movie but not the worst either I recommend you watching it because it is a pretty good movie.
1174,,Best out of the new trilogy!!!,"This movie was definitely the best out of the newer trilogy. Great action, great story, acting was o.k. Oh, and did I mention the action was amazing?! It ties all the questions you'd ask while watching Episodes IV,V,and VI together so well. It seems so much more full and makes a lot more sense. Anakins turn to the dark side was incredibly intense and awesome.We know why Darth Vader is Darth Vader and why Luke and Leia end up where they are and how the emperor comes to be. Truly an amazing piece of action and intelligence. Luckily, the mistake character of ""Jar Jar Binks"" hadn't a line in this film. This story is a lot more mature than that of Episodes I and II. Good job, George."
1175,7,The second half is a great movie,"The film opens with a big space battle - fair enough. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor are on a mission to rescue Ian McDiarmid from Christopher Lee in what we presume is a put-up job, although it's never made clear. Lee is killed off pretty swiftly in a scene that is very effective if you've seen Return Of The Jedi, but not to worry - he's in cahoots with the leader of the Seperatists, a half-droid creature called General Greivous. Yes, that is his name."
1176,8,Awesome Action!,"The whole of the Movie was good and bad. The Action was so good that my heart kept stopping. In some scenes though the lines isn't as great. That is why I rate it at a eight not a ten. I love the movie, both for the plot and for the continuous action that takes place in the movie. I recommend to see this movie because the plot just keeps getting better and better as the movie progresses. Though at sometimes i find the movie a little too predicting. Each time something would happen i would have already have seen it. And the music from John Williams is Superb!I hope that you see this movie and rate it for yourself because i did. And i guarantee that this movie will be the best movie you have seen in a very long time."
1177,7,"Powerful at times, lacking at others","Good news. After two duds, Revenge of the Sith is actually a good movie. In some places, it's really good. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as it could have been. This one had the potential to be up there with Empire Strikes Back."
1178,7,The Only Decent Prequel,"The good thing about Attack of the Clones, is that Lucas could only improve. That he did with his third installment, Revenge of the Sith. In this outing, war has broken out. Separatists, led by General Greivous, have split the Republic. Now with a standing army of clones, Emperor Palpatine has them dispensed to quell the uprisings. Secretly, though, Palpatine is the one behind the separatist movement - using them to give himself emergency powers. While the Jedi oversee the clone troops, the Emperor works against them. Enter Anakin Skywalker and Ben Kenobi who are trying to bring the war to an end. Skywalker kills Count Dooku, leaving Palpatine without an apprentice. He takes interest in Anakin as Ben Kenobi tries to locate General Greivous to bring the Separatist Movement to an end. That is when Palpatine seduces Anakin to the dark side, promising him a way to keep alive the ones he loves. After Kenobi finally brings an end to the separatist military leader, though, Palpatine does not relinquish power. Anakin discovers he is a Sith and brings Mace Windu in. However, tempted again by the Dark Side, Anakin ascends to Palpatine's apprentice. He must now rid the galaxy of Jedi. Kenobi somehow returns, then follows a pregnant Padme to the planet of Mustafar where Anakin is. Yoda confronts Palpatine, and loses. However, Kenobi defeats Anakin, rendering him to a life forever in a special life- support suit. Padme gives birth to twins that will be kept in hiding. Yoda exiles himself. This is a dark episode of Star Wars - as well as the most violent. It also has better dialog, especially when the Emperor is tempting Anakin. The plot is much more streamlined, and there is an even pace of the story. True, some of the exposition involves people sitting and talking, but there is more action interlaced with the plot. The acting, too, is not very deep. It keeps the audience from getting completely involved in the conflicts and temptations, but the performances are not as wooden and the previous installments. Overall, though, Revenge of the Sith was a decent, watchable prequel. It was not as stellar as the original trilogy, but still entertains far better than Phantom Menace and Attac of the Clones."
1179,10,Unanswered question(s),"I was shocked at how amazing this film was in all respects, and it answers almost every question that I could think of, except for one."
1180,10,The Best Prequel,"The Star Wars franchise has brought back the magic of the Star Wars series with ""Revenge of the Sith."" How does it do this? It simply learns from the mistakes of the past two films."
1181,9,"After almost 30 years, I finally have met my Messiah.","I grew up with Yoda on my Lunchbox, Han Solo figure in my room with the blaster sounds, the Jabba the Hutt setup with the Rancor and Ewok village. Characters that I spent my whole life admiring and the ideology of the Force which inspires me spiritually throughout my life. I was born in 1977 and after all this time it all finally ended with such a bang and this time ROTS proved to be a very emotional movie. This movie redeemed George Lucas. It really did. I must admit, although I was disappointed in Episodes 1 and 2, I still watched both movies over 10 times already. I finally realized that they were nothing but a prelude to the story of Revenge of the Sith. Lucas needed 2 movies to set up his 3rd episode. The way he connects all the dots, and Lucas is a straight up genius, his writing and imagination is phenomenal. It all came together. I think AOTC did a great job with character development of Obi Wan and Anakin and the love story with him and Padme. I know realize why the Jedi code forbids any attatchments. Jedi must not fall in love with anyone, and after you watch ROTS, you will understand why."
1182,5,On the cusp of greatness...,"George Lucas, has a brilliant creative mind. However he must be completely unable to filter good ideas from bad ones and that is exactly the problem with this film."
1183,2,Too much to take in!,"So many promised aspects of this story thrown down the drain, wasted! Wookies - pointless, wasted. Why even bother? Death of Count Dooku - I seriously expected a darn sight more there! General Grievous, like Darth Maul, much promised, zero delivered. Wasted! Skywalker becoming Vader - I think I'll call you Darth Vader. Yes, Padme was pregnant but hadn't given birth yet so he wasn't a father. Idiot! This film ran way too long (2hrs 13mins from start of start credits to beginning of end credits), It threw us way too far into the deep end at the start of the film with a huge space battle that was ripped wholesale out of A New Hope (we've seen this before). The film teemed with things pulled out of the previous 5 movies, (Oh and some of the stuff out of the Star Wars PC games as well, someone called Lucas is running out of ideas I think? Perhaps this is why he won't bother making the last 3 movies) I just sat there thinking ""Why show me something I've seen already? Where's all the new stuff?"". Ships looking so much like X-wings, Star Destroyers, Tie fighters. Grievous died way too easily, I was expecting something else from him after his death. Crap, George, sheer crap there. All the Jedi were killed far too easily, These people are supposed to be expert fighters trained to know the feelings of those around them, little evidence of that happening at all. We'd previously seen them use force powers in the last film) that would have held them in good stead against numerous enemies at once (like force push & force shield) but none were seen used here. If Samuel L Jackson thinks he had a good death as Mace Windu, think again Sam. I personally think you did go out exactly the way you didn't want to, like a punk. If Mace Windu was able to defeat Palpatine so easily why couldn't Yoda? There were just way too many inconsistencies popping up everywhere. See the film if you must. I found it too long, and badly thought out in sections that should have mattered. I waited all this time and was given a pile of poorly constructed scraps. George had to literally cobble things together to force (no pun intended) this film to flow into the next one. It saddens me that the Star Wars franchise was reduced to this, wasted on someone who obviously didn't care what he gave us, as long as he has our money lining his pockets. "
1184,7,Butterfingers!!,"Well, I just saw Star Wars Revenge of the Sith today and there are a few things that I found a bit amusing. I think it is a good movie (much, much better than the last two) but not a great movie. But what I found was most humorous, was it seems that every Jedi knight can't hang on to their light sabers! It seems that in all six movies, they are constantly dropping their sabers. I would really like to watch all six movies sometime and keep count. Also, they are always hanging on for dear life to some edge to keep from falling into a bottomless pit or abyss. If the Empire ever discovers silicone spray, the Jedi are in deep trouble. Again, I'd have to watch them all and keep count. Lastly is a problem I have with Yoda. A great character, but from the first time I heard his voice in Empire Strikes Back, (I believe that was his first appearance), I always think of Fozzy Bear from the Muppet show. As all of you probably know, Frank Oz is the voice of Yoda and Fozzy. I keep waiting for Yoda to say something deep and meaningful followed by ""Waka, waka, waka,"" which is what Fozzy always said after one of his jokes."
1185,6,A Grand and worthy farewell to a wonderful Saga,"So Finally it arrived...phew....the very last Star Wars movie you will ever see (or at least for a very long time). This movie is close to excellent, sometimes dragging in parts when there is little action, and the dialog is a bit dry and a bit TV-soap-ish, but then again it delivers on the intrigue, special effects and laser blazing, light-saber flashing and clashing, big stunts, yes very well choreographed duels, fights and action. All with a sinister edge when the darkness spreads in the Galaxy, with old themes like doomed love, betrayal, yes it is a space opera with over the top emotion and acting. This is the darkest of the prequels even though The Empire Strikes Back is darker and a better film in the series as a whole. Episode III does deliver though on all its promises. There are however no big surprises for at least those who know and has seen the other movies in the series. I may not be a big fan but I do enjoy them a lot and know they are a vital part of the modern cinema. But back to Episode III, in which we see the dramatic changes in Anakin (Hayden Christensen, more grown into the role) growing more corrupt and twisted, crossing slowly over to the dark side, full of doubt, confusion and turmoil. The key figure in the change is Chancellor Palpatine (a brilliant Ian McDiarmid) of hidden agendas, with quiet menace under his calm surface. Anakin's friendship with Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor more adapted into his role) also slipping away, also marriage to Amidala (Natalie Portman, wonderful and ever confident in her role) shaking in its joints. Anakin is let into the Jedi Council but on a short leash and charged with spying in on Chancellor Palpatine. Back is also little green frog wonder Yoda (Frank Oz) who fights even more in this film than before as does the ever cool Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson, as bankable as ever), of course no Star Wars movie is ever complete without C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). Plus near cameos by Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits), Clone Commander Cody (Temuera Morrison). And Count Dooku (The Legendary Movie Icon Christopher Lee) is offed early on. And the musical score by John Williams reaches new heights of ingenuity and depth. The Movie itself is very beautifully made if not a bit too clean, it is rather too colorful, but the storytelling is right on the spot."
1186,8,Manages to engage both the mind and the eye,"This is the best one of the new trilogy, without a doubt. The acting is better and there are even some welcome moments of slower pacing which adds to the overall dynamic and allows breathing space. This is very much needed since the action is relentless, and even becomes a bit too repetitious after a while, its one cliffhanger after another. Some of these action scenes are also a bit too cluttered, and makes me long for the cleaner style in the first trilogy. Every frame tends to become overloaded. These criticisms aside, it is still the best looking one of the new trilogy. The movie improves towards the end and ultimately manages to engage both the mind and the eye. And Yoda kicks ass!"
1187,8,Darker With More Elaborate Score,"I agree with some other comments re. the acting and dialog here. This is not an in-depth psychological thriller and I didn't expect that kind of profundity shall we say. Yeah, Christensen COULD have been a little weak for the crucial pivotal role he played but there were some very fine sequences and scenes nevertheless. I particularly appreciated the way in which Lucas interspersed Episode IV images into the movie: Senator Organa's ship is the same type that opens Stars Wars: New Hope. The star-cruisers look more closely like the Imperial Star Destroyers in New Hope. Of course Palpatine assumes his Emperor garb and voice. A true SW fan will enjoy this yarn. I think by now non-fans will not expect anything other than what they get in the film if they watch it."
1188,10,Amazing movie,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!The best Star Wars movie ever. The battle scenes are amazing. and the dialogue is memorable, thx to memes. Hayden Christensen does an amazing job at portraying Anakin Skywalker, Ewan McGregor does a fantastic job at playing Obi-Wan Kenobi. I just love this movie. But the best scene was when Obi-Wan confronted Anakin about turning to the dark side. It was so sad, but so good! Obviously the best SW movie"
1189,10,If you like the sequels find better taste in movies like this one,"Great filled with some of the best quotes. In 2020 the cgi is still awesome. There are a few things that don't make sense. When palpatin and Yoda duke it out, Yoda is spinning around with his lightsaber which means palpatin also known as sidious has no time for close-ups and yet they still get one of him getting frustrated 2 times. Another thing is don't look at the lava closely it ruins the cgi. Overall I know most of the quotes and enjoy the prequels as well as the originals and I hate the sequels even though I am a millennial but thankfully I watched the originals and prequels before Disney owned Star Wars so I'm a very long-time Star Wars fan."
1190,10,My favorite episode of the saga!,"Well, I believe that this is the best episode of the saga and one of the best movies that I have seen."
1191,9,The Saga is now complete,"With the release of Revenge of the Sith, the Saga is finally complete. And it ended in an amazing way. This third and last movie of the prequel trilogy is by far the best one of it."
1192,10,Brilliant End to a Saga That Rivals the Greek Tragedies,"Although we all knew how it was going to end, the drama that leads up to Skywalker's transformation is tremendously passionate and powerfully acted on-screen. The movie has the philosophical undertones of A New Hope, as well as Shakspearian drama and Eastern mysticism. Most importantly, the viewer develops compassion for Vadar as we begin to see that his descent into the dark side is a result of his violent, unfortunate and sad past, and his tremendous love for Padme. As Yoda explains, it is through the fear of loss that we unintentionally walk the dark path, and this is what becomes of Annakin Skywalker. His love and compassion for Padme, and his fear of losing her the way he lost his mother, forces him to protect her by any means and ultimately leading to his own demise. In a Romeo and Juliet twist, all is lost."
1193,4,What were the Sith getting revenge for?,"Mercifully for Starwars fans, the prequel fiasco went out with a whimper, with this stumbling, awkward closer. Throughout all three of the prequels, we were assaulted with inside-out thinking, inept useless Jedi knights that couldn't protect the universe from a teddy-bear, Aniken Skywalker groaning and blubbering, idiotic political intrigue, and occasional mugging by C3PO and Jar-Jar Binks. Tack on the repulsive romance of Princess/Senator Whateverhernameis and Darth Emo, and you've got quite a mess."
1194,8,Star Wars episode three. The dramatic ending to 28 years of Star Wars.,"I have always loved Star Wars, always! Revenge of the Sith was only good because it was much darker and much more serious than the previous two episodes. The main reason for this is because everything i starting to come to a dramatic conclusion and everything starts to make sense....even though there are serious contradictions."
1195,6,"Plot weak, still lacks the fun of the original","Yes, it's got a spoiler, but there is no way to relate the problems with this movie without disclosing certain parts."
1196,8,Great Way To End The Prequels,There's not really much to say but this movie was pretty awesome. They did an awesome job in ending the triology of the prequels. Anakin's fall to the dark side was definitely believable and we get to see his motives and the way he turns into Darth Vader. Great film and I definitely recommend that you watch.
1197,8,The Penultimate Star Wars Film!!,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, is the penultimate Star Wars film and is everything that Star Wars fans wanted in a film when it was released back in 2005!! Coming off a slow & rather dramatic film in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith is faced paced, & immediately starts out with a space battle above Coruscant, the capitol planet of the Star Wars galaxy. What makes this film so special is that we get all the questions that have come to mind answered ever since the original Star Wars film hit the silver screen back in 1977!! How did Anakin Skywalker go from such a dashing and loyal hero to the metallic and black clad villain that we knew from Episodes IV through VI? How did Luke end up on Tatooine with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Bert? How did Leia end up on Alderaan with her parents? What happened to Anakin's wife Padme after the birth of their children? What happened to Yoda & Obi-Wan after the Jedi were ""hunted down and defeated."" Just about every question, including an appearance by everyone's favorite Wookiee Chewbacca, is answered in this movie that has more lightsaber fights than ANY other Star Wars film!! In essence, George Lucas gives you what you want and he throws in the kitchen sink in Revenge of the Sith!! Canadian actor Hayden Christensen's acting picks up in this film, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are great in it again, the action is outstanding, the special effects are outstanding, the costuming is outstanding, the sound editing is outstanding, the soundtrack done by genius and legendary composer John Williams is second to none and the writing and direction by God and legend George Lucas is superb!! This is the Star Wars movie that Star Wars fans were waiting for and, at the time, was a nice way to see the saga out. 8 out of 10 stars!!"
1198,5,Short to the point review,A first hour as dull and uninteresting as The Phantom Menace and the first half of Attack Of The Clones followed by a far more interesting and exciting finale.
1199,8,The Sith Has Hit The Fan,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith Back in good old '83, Lucas replaced the word 'Revenge' with 'Return' for Episode VI's title. Clearly a Jedi cannot take revenge- a Jedi's way is not hate or aggression. In reference to this change, Episode III's title returns to that word 'revenge'- and thus marks itself out as the polar opposite of the original trilogy's finale. It is an intensely dark affair, dealing with Anakin's fall from the grace of the Jedi council through Chancellor Palpantine's manipulation, and to his final transformation to Darth Vader. Lucas referred to the film as 'Titanic in space', and he is right; essentially a Shakespearian tragedy in nature, the climax is a predetermined catastrophe which the film cannot escape."
1200,2,Made great actors look like amateurs,"I'm not judging the special effects by today's standards...no, my rating is a reflection of how horrendous the writing, editing, depiction of character development, and action sequences are. No thrill, and worse, zero emotional impact. Even the experienced actors in this film-actors we KNOW can act well like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman-gave shaky performances because of the material they were given. How Anakin became Darth Vader is one of the most interesting things about the Star Wars mythology, so what an absolute waste it is that his story was depicted so badly. George Lucas may be a great visionary, but a director and screenwriter...especially after seeing this film...I don't see it."
1201,9,a nice fill in the gap to the Trilogies,"This movie, I must say, was pretty cool. Of the prequels however, I still must say I found Phantom Menace somewhat most satisfying (despite Jar Jar). Simply put, Darth Maul was just a cool villain, what can I say? I mean you KNEW Obi-wan was in trouble when he faced Darth Maul (even if you knew Obi-wan would win). I just loved those kinds of moments. Anyways, to get back to Episode III, I just love the progression of story and just seeing how Anakin turns to the dark side made a lot of sense. One of the best scenes, oddly enough, was when there were no special effects at all but just seeing two characters (Palpatine and Anakin) just talking. The way Palpatine throws little doubts into Anakin about the Jedi way is just so snakily well-done, I was surprised I was still watching the same movie. And, when that black metal mask finally is placed on Anakin's head, there's a great sense of finality, not only for the Anakin's character, but for the series as well (given the fact this is supposedly the last Star Wars film George Lucas makes -- a blessing or a curse, you decide). I still find the special effects of fully-CG animals rather distracting (as I found in the previous installments, including the revamped original trilogy). They're just way too pretty and fluid and mechanical to be realistic-looking and they never sit still! (wobbly heads are always bad news) But overall, a great progression to the original series and little fan-boy moments that reference Episode IV are quite justified, if not expected."
1202,8,A warm fuzzy feeling,The last installment of the epic star wars saga.
1203,10,The best of the entire saga,"I just finished re-watching all six Lucas-era Star Wars films in episode order (I-VI) with the commentary and want to give my reviews of each film. Let me preface by saying that I am a lifelong Star Wars fan who grew up with the original trilogy and literally have no memory of a time in my life before SW. As such, I am not going to be totally unbiased in my reviews, but I will try to be somewhat objective."
1204,10,Speaking for ALL of the Prequels,"Now everyone knows that the prequels got a rather large amount of hate but honestly that 10/10 is my opinion. As someone who grew up with the Prequels as a kid I obviously loved them and now when I'm getting old I still love them because I can see the genius behind each and every film and the bad things don't matter to me! Each of the Prequels have so many stand out amazing Star Wars things in them and Revenge of the Sith is an absolutely incredible film! The story of all 3 films is very interesting and suprising even though we know how it will end, the CGI is remarkable for its time and honestly still holds up now a days and the vastness of the Star Wars galaxy is really shown in the Prequels more than any of the originals or sequels. So yeah, I love the Star Wars Prequels"
1205,7,Too little too late,"When George Lucas announced he was to make a trilogy of movies that told the back story to the original Star Wars films I was delighted. After The Phantom Menace I was a little disappointed but I assumed he was trying to attract a new generation of kids to Star Wars and then move on with the story. Then Attack of the Clones happened, the worst Star Wars film. Terrible acting and again the story concentrates on the Clone Wars and not on the fact Anakin is supposed to be turning to the dark side any time soon. So two films pass and not much has happened, Palpatine has moved up in power, Anakin kills some sandpeople and falls in love during a terrible 20 minute spell."
1206,4,Connect the dots,"The special effects keep getting better and better, but there was just nowhere interesting to take the plot. So, connect the dots from movie 2 to movie 4:"
1207,4,"Visually Stunning, But Has The Soul Of A Droid","When I saw Revenge of the Sith on Thursday in Westwood at the Village it was with a packed house of hyped-up mostly under 30 fans, in other words the optimum type of crowd to be in the right frame of mind to like/love it. There were light sabers all over the place and several people had sneaked in big beach balls that the crowd started flying around. Then the house lights dimmed, the curtain lowered and the applause level really took off."
1208,7,What Star wars is suppose to be!,May be som questionable CGI and acting but you can't deny that the amount of action and the quality of the last duel is outstanding. The last duel is the best duel in Star wars history so far. It is the most memeble and quotable Star wars.
1209,10,The Magic is Back,Terrific tie-off to the long awaited prequel series. This is what Star Wars fans have waited patiently for over the last six years.
1210,,Episode III is everything the two other prequels should have been.,"Well, folks. It's been almost 30 years since the first Star Wars film graced the screen and now it has finally ended. It started out with a bang and ends with a bang again. This is ""Revenge of the Sith"". Everything you've ever wanted to know about how Darth Vader came to power is explained in this vast improvement from Episodes I and II."
1211,9,Star Wars III: Our Last Hope,**Small Spoilers in this review**
1212,5,This film is getting overrated,"Let me cut right to the chase here. I loved the original trilogy in this series. Having said that this one here is the best of the latest installments, but do not let that fool you, because the first 2 here suck badly!! Lucas once again shows his ego is out of control by insisting on directing this film. He flat out is terrible director, which explains the common criticism of "" The acting is wooden"" Hayden Christenson is NOT A BAD ACTOR. This is the problem; You take young actors and put them in front of a blue screen, you need to DIRECT THEM and inspire them to imagine. Note the acting in the original star wars film episode 4;"
1213,10,Masterpiece,"This movie is quite possibly the greatest single piece of art ever created. I've watched it at least 200 times. A lot of people don't understand the intricacies of this movie, so they give it bad reviews. Unfortunately, these people simply do not have the required IQ to comprehend George Lucas's vision."
1214,3,Bitterly disappointed,"I guess I must be one of the few people out here that actually loved the first two films of the new trilogy. I loved Anakin as a little boy, he brought out the maternal instinct in me, I thought it jolly good entertainment. The Attack of the Clones developed for me one of the best love stories that I've seen. Padme was a great character and like all great love stories there had to be a tragedy."
1215,7,"Good, no bad, no good, wait ... bad ... maybe ...",Right I am somewhat torn.
1216,10,George Lucas Must Be A Billionaire.,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith Rating: 10/10
1217,6,best of a bad bunch,"I think it's fair to say, if George Lucas had messed up this one he would have well and truly been considered a bigger muppet than Miss Piggy."
1218,1,Lucas Thinks We're Stupid......AND HE'S CORRECT!!!,"It was bad enough when Lucas shoved the completely unbelievable notion that Luke was Darth Vader's son in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" down our throats (Hey, when did Darth realize this? A little after trying to kill him in the original movie?). But when he so clumsily tries to tie every loose end together in this horrible film I found myself shaking my head repeatedly in disbelief. Others here have detailed the litany of bad writing, bad acting, leaps of logic and bad direction and I agree. One other element that really bugged me here was the notion of space being incredibly crowded and noisy. See Kubrick's 2001 for a credible notion of the vastness of outer space. In this turkey it's more crowded and noisy that Time's Square at rush hour. Lucas shows no regard for any fan who had paid attention to any of the plot developments from the first three films and it shows. Of the many stupid things that Lucas expects us to swallow is that C3P0 AND R2D2 knew all the main characters generations ago, had superior abilities (apps?), and were not relegated to the scrap heap after a few years use. Hey, my cellphone becomes obsolete after a few months! I could go on and on but others here have done a fine job exposing Lucas' lack of respect for his fan base. But Lucas has laughed to the bank. In fact he may own the bank. We're all suckers for sure. How else can one justify the 7.7 rating?"
1219,1,What a waste,"If I could give it a 1/2 star I would.  In all seriousness. For all those that wrote a ""glowing"" review. What  movie did you watch? Not the one that I saw.  I have to say that Lucas was a smart man. He made the first 3 films,  then went into hiding, because he knew that other 3 would blow. For all  those that are saying that the special effects in this movie were good,  again. What movie were you watching. You could turn on the game for  XBOX and get the same stupid light sabers and crappy blasters.  From the fist scenes where me and my wife looked at each other and  rolled our eyes in disgust, till the final moans when Darth Vader  breaks out of his ""creation bed"" ala Frankenstein monster, this movie  was a total waste of time.  I have a question for all you star wars fans out there. Did you notice  when the flaming ship in the beginning was crashing (yes I said  flaming... in space) how were people being thrown around when there is  no gravity in space? Again through out the reviews I read about how  fans who line up to spend their money on sh*t, drool over Yoda and his  light saber battles. Little sh*t bag jumping around does not make for  $11 investment on my part. ""Been taken for my money have I."" I honestly  have nothing and I mean nothing good to say about this movie. From the  manikin Anakin acting, which could be blamed upon the script,  direction, or even just the actors. All the way to the same old washed  up special effects from the first series.  I cringe every time I hear somebody say how much better star wars was  than Star Trek. Yeah, Lucas's vision of Muppet's on all these stupid  worlds running around and some mystical magics  super power that people will discover is so much more realistic.  Waste your money on lottery tickets, as you have a better  chance of winning the lottery then you do of Lucas making another good  movie.  I heard that he plans on retiring now that he is done with his 6th  attempt at making a good movie. He plans to farm out the rest of the  movies. Thank God. Perhaps we can get a real director behind the wheel  and maybe salvage what is left of this train wreck.  Just my 2 cents."
1220,5,"C'mon, you can't seriously believe this is a top 250 film!?","Granted it's better than I and II, but the acting is still execrable apart from Ian McDiarmid and the plot is still bordering on the childish."
1221,6,"Seen this before, we have","I waited in great anticipation for the release of this film, as most did and have. Disappointment was all that followed. From the well paced beginning, the film sinks into pointless territory, regarding how Anakin Skywalker 'became' Darth Vader. The reason, which I will not reveal for those that still wish to see it, is so completely hackneyed and preposterous it still astounds me now. Everything we see of Anakin early on is thrown away and he, with no thought to character development, changes into a Sith Lord. There is simply no real, credible, reason why this happens and it ultimately lets down that which could of been George's finest hour in this century. There are also too many characters, none of which are allowed free reign and no sooner are they allowed to develop, they are discarded like everything else. The performers do what they can with the awful script, Ian McDiarmid seems to really enjoy his job portraying the puppeteer to the demise of the republic and the Jedi. Natalie Portman is keen to look beautiful, but has little on-screen time to go through as many outfits as normal. Ewan McGregor puts his best foot forward and practically steals every scene he's in, displaying flair and wisdom that fits the character perfectly. For years now, we have all wanted to see the great light saber battle between Obi-Wan and Darth/Anakin. Having to wait all the way through the film to see it, I was let down by a mix of CGI-composites that did nothing but detract from the action. The close-ups ruined what looked like months of practice for Hayden and Ewan as all their show boating was over far too quickly. Put simply, there is no progression in this film and what happens at the end has no meaning as a result. Yes, it does have spectacular special effects. Yes, it does have superb music and sound. Yes, it is a 'Star Wars film'. I'm sorry to say that is not enough to iron out the rough spots in plot, script and story enough for me. Comparisons to the original films, will, in time, show that the story is what will always hold the imagination and hearts of hungry audiences. Good versus Evil will always be better than hole ridden plots about trade routes and democracy. I'm not going to say Star Wars fans will love it, but because it's a Star Wars film, you can decide how much you can forgive it's significant and varied flaws. A contradicting mess of a film."
1222,3,"Hey, guess what? A Star Wars veteran did not like it","There is always one isn't it? Always one which disagrees with the crowd...But remember this, I saw Star Wars in 1977 in the big screen and have been a big fan since then..so you can say I belong to the old guard! "
1223,2,A disappointment,"I am sorry. For all you Star Wars fans out there, this will be a disappointment. Whilst not being a hardcore Star Wars fan, I can appreciate its value and contribution to cinema. But Episode III is truly a disgrace. I would even go so far as to strip it of its right to be called a film, instead referring to it as a spectacle, in that it is devoid of cohesion and lacks what most films require at its core, the flow of a storyline. Instead you have a large number of short scenes that flick between events and time frames. The battle scenes are uninteresting and unexciting and there is no development of atmosphere. On top of that, you don't feel for the characters. As the film unfolds, you find that you really do not care what happens to any of them. My friend sitting next to me, a die-hard Star Wars fan, tried to cry at certain points in the movie but found that she couldn't as the film was just so unrealistic. On coming out, she admitted that it really was a disgrace. Other Star Wars fans were actually laughing out loud throughout at the ridiculous scenes and acting. Unbelievingly, Episode III actually succeeds in making the usually brilliant Natalie Portman look unattractive, but I believe this can be accredited to working in front of a blue screen. I gave the film two points, one point for trying, and another for the fact that you can actually see the influence of modern day political ideas and discussions. For Star Wars fans this is worth seeing to bring a conclusion to the series, but to others, maybe your money would be better spent watching something else."
1224,2,Give me back my money Lucas!,"This has got to be the worst movie ever! I'm not going to repeat everything that has already been said about this movie. But the one main theme, why ""good"" Anakin Skywlaker changes into the ""evil"" Darth Vader, come on. It took about 1 minute to do that. What did the sith lord do? Use the Sith mind trick on Ananik? Anakin: Lord sith you are my enemy and I must destroy you. Sidious: No I am not your enemy. You must obey me. Anakin: Maybe you're not. And I will obey you. Come on man. You can't be serious! About the CGI. Ever since Jurasic Park CGI should not be considered amazing! Been there, done that. The CGI was as expected. And when something is expected it is not good, let alone amazing. It's just there! One last comment on the action. It sucked! Hollywood people cannot shoot fight scenes! Please, I beg you, watch some Hong Kong flicks. It's easy. Use a wide angle!!!!! There should have been some great fight scenes in this movie. We only saw some elbows! George Lucas, give me back my money. This movie sucked!"
1225,4,What's so great?,"First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES...I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of the films."
1226,1,"Wish it were better, but....","This movie, much like Episodes 1 and 2, is one where everybody wished so hard for it to be good. It just doesn't seem fair, or even possible, that any film in the Star Wars franchise could possess the ability to disappoint. And, no matter how much we try to convince ourselves that these movies are in fact in the same league as the 3 master pieces that Lucas directed years ago, the movies exist as they are: Mediocre SciFi. Lucas ability to direct the more recent movies is quite suspect. We all agree Episode I was a horrible abortion. Episode II, though better than Episode I, still failed to capture the spirit of Star Wars. Lucas greatest failure seems to be that he is bent on modernizing the films, per se. I feel as if he is trying to do too much with the movies. The story is obviously flawless. Yet, he someone fails to realize that the story can in many ways stand on its own, and he doesn't need to add ridiculous cheesy lines or overly fantastic colored scenes and obvious CGI. The movie, is in a sense, too busy. "
1227,7,No... the prequels are still not as good,"Everyone going back saying these sequels were always good or are now good just because disney is so called ""ruining"" Star Wars are getting me mad. These films are very flawed. Now, I decided to review this because I believe it's definitely the best of the 3. Phantom menace IS what it's title says as far as SW. it is a menace to SW. and attack of the clones is JUST as bad if not worse. Personally... I prefer that over menace but that's really not saying much... here's my review and PLEASE UNDERSTAND MY OPINION"
1228,4,The War is Lost: Episode III,"Undoubtedly the best of the 3 prequels... But, to be honest, I'm impressed by this movie, only when comparing it to it's 2 predecessors. The first 2 - The Phantom Menace (1999) and The Attack of the Clones (2002) are so horrendous, that by just being better than them, Revenge of the Sith feels amazing... But, it's not."
1229,10,The Final Masterpiece: THE BEST,"Please stop bashing this wonderful film. Episode 3 is the last film we'll ever see of Star Wars on the big screen, proof enough of its value. But maybe the reason so many people disliked this film was because the majority of the older audiences are fans of the old Star Wars (1977-1983) and in truth there is a generation gap and even rivalry between these old-timers and the new generation of Star Wars fans who saw Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and now this last installment (1999-2005). Now, let's put it this way. Lucas had already intended to write a 6 part saga back in the 70's when he first conceived Star Wars, influenced in part by Joseph Campbell's teachings about what constitutes heroism. Episodes 4-6 (New Hope, Empire and Return of the Jedi) deal with the fall of the Empire by the efforts of the Rebel Alliance lead by Luke Skywalker, Leia and Han Solo. But it's really about the redemption of Anakin Skywaler/Darth Vader through his son. Episodes 1-3 look back at the Old Republic and its collapse, the takeover of the evil Dark Side Lords the Sith (Emperor Palpatine) who manages to convert the otherwise good Jedi Anakin to the Dark Side. The evil scheming Palpatine manages to do this by tricking him into believing only the Sith magic of preventing death of loved ones would save Padme Amidala from dying at childbirth. This is the darkest of the trilogy, with a feeling of despair and tragedy as the Jedi are slaughtered (including children) as Anakin succumbs to the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader, the new right hand man of the Emperor who has formed the Empire."
1230,4,Disappointed with Lucas,"I just saw ""Star Wars: Episode III,"" and I am very disappointed."
1231,6,"Hook, Line and STinker","It was George Lucas' last chance to go out with a bang, but it was a lackluster performance. Oh yeah, the sets and special effects were over the top, but they couldn't save the film. I need to see it again as usual to get a clearer perception, but it just seemed like a lot of anachronistic direction and interminable hand-wringing over what the dark side has planned next. Spoilers follow, so don't read on if you don't want:"
1232,4,George Lucas is not capable,"While I am naturally enthusiast in my life and I am more inclined to enjoy whatever I participate in, I am obliged to say this movie is crap. This is for many reasons, more or less the ones many people already pointed out: poor acting, poor scripting, too much scene jumping destroying the moment, quite everything has been explained but it is like a necessity to justify an embarrassing story.What if this movie would have been assigned to Peter Jackson? or Steven Spielberg? on Christopher Nolan? I am angry because with the power in the hands of George Lucas, this saga could have become a legend, instead of an example of bad directing. It seems to me like the story of an ancient Roman Emperor who wasn't absolutely able to write poems but since he was the Emperor, every one in the court and in the Empire was forced to listen, and applause, his writings."
1233,,The Way we dreamed it could be.,"The prequels until this point had been shamelessly empty. In episodes I & II half aborted ideas, were poorly scripted poorly filmed, and poorly realized. Lucas is unapologetic in this regard. Just read any interview about Revenge of the Sith. The man admits that he had very little to say with either the Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones, the man himself calls them ""mostly filler"". While he may be right that we were at fault for wanting to skip to the end, Revenge of the Sith proves that that's exactly where everything we've been waiting for happens. You can't blame us. "
1234,10,George Lucas redeems himself in spectacular style,"I was lucky enough to go to the cast and crew premiere at the Odeon in Leicester square today. Thanks to Deano who I now owe loads of beers for inviting me along(check out the flight deck of Bail Organas ship, he built it)."
1235,10,"Dark, action-packed, emotional, simply great","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Out of all three of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith is the only one where it is not too uncommon to like it. Most people hate it, or at least dislike it, but there are still those of us who love this movie. And I am one of those, because this movie is almost perfect. Almost. The special effects are dazzling, the space combat looks so much more sleek now that Lucas upgraded to CGI, and did away with models (a controversial move, but personally I think it was the right choice, I mean, you can't argue with these results). A lot of people complained about the first two movies being too boring, but Lucas knew what he was doing. He was building up to the war, and now it's here. And now... it's all out war! I can't cover all of the great battles in this movie, because there are a lot, and trying to do all of those justice is...daunting. However, I will point out a few of the highlights. Of course there is the best light-saber duel ever when Anakin and Obi-Wan finally have their big duel. It has just about everything you could want from a light-saber duel. Action-wise it's the best, emotionally it's the best, it has a great environment, and the exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan before they fight is so epic, I've tried to memorize that whole speech (yes, I'm a nerd, I know). Yoda and Sidious also have a pretty great duel; watching the two most powerful people in the universe fight it out is pretty much guaranteed to be entertaining, and it pays off. But it's not all about the action, the characters are great as well. Hayden Christensen does a really good job at playing the conflicted, bitter, and angry Anakin Skywalker. His previous performance was a bit shaky (though I personally liked it), but here, he's really good. Natalie Portman doesn't have a lot to do in this movie, but she's still fine. Some of her reactions to Anakin's fall are a little... overblown. Ewan McGregor is also really good, after Anakin's fall, you can tell he's really effected by it, and he's trying to not let it show, and he does a good job with that as well. Palpatine is also a great character, his subtle manipulations of the Republic are a good plot-point, and seeing him finally cut loose and let the Jedi have it is very entertaining. For me though, the tone and themes of this movie are what really makes it great. It has an ominous tone going the whole time, which is y'know, how it should be. There's no comic relief in this movie, though we still get a little trademark Star Wars banter. Anakin's fall to the dark side is tragic, and the final battle between him and Obi-Wan is both heartbreaking and exhilarating. And... wow, I'm really going to get a lot of hate for this, but... here goes. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is... the best Star Wars movie of all time, and will likely remain the champ forever. There, I said it. I know this review will disagree with popular opinion, and I'm not doing this to rile up the prequel haters. I am doing this to put out my very controversial opinion of the Star Wars prequels, because frankly, all the prequel hate is getting annoying, and I'm going to do my part to give the prequels the respect they deserve. Thank you, George Lucas, for making this great movie, which is, as I said, the best Star Wars movie ever."
1236,,Geat VFX but weak dialog. The best of the prequels,"This is the best of the prequels by far but doesn't come close to the strongest entry in the series - The Empire Strikes Back. The film is better focused, the VFX are impressive as usual, and there is a lot of action. In fact, some of the fighting could have been toned down. Yoda remains the most expressive of all the performers(!) Hayden Christensen is stiff as usual while Natalie Portman gets some awful dialog. Ewan McGregor tries his hand at an Alec Guinness accent. The (MINOR SPOILERS) battle between Yoda and the emperor is a treat to watch. The film is a solidly entertaining watch."
1237,5,Lucas need's a re-think on why he made this prequel.,"I cannot say i watched very much of the original sequel in much detail, but still have quite a good understanding that it topped this prequel and film by a mile. I saw this at the cinema and immediately bought the DVD as soon as it came out. However, i won't go as far to say i was 'dissapointed' with the film, but i did go away feeling rather questionable on whether my £4.95 was worth it."
1238,2,A Lost Opportunity,"The Prequel Trilogy is complete. It has been an experience... but not the experience that I had hoped. Now I suppose, my expectations of the new Star Wars movies may have been set a bit too high (but then again weren't all of ours), but after watching the last of the new movies I can say without a doubt that this Prequel Trilogy contains three of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1239,10,The Best Movie of all Time,"From the moment the STAR WARS screen rolled in I knew this would be the best of the Star Wars saga. The movie starts of with the best opening sequence of all the Star Wars films, with the space battle to save Chancellor Palpitine. During the opening battle scene there is some clunky dialog, but this is the only scene with bad dialog. The dialog gets way better throughout the film and it also gets very emotional."
1240,10,"Emotional, Powerful and Captivating","This movie is one of my favorites. Sure every time I watch it I get sad for about a month, but that just portrays about how deeply this movie moved me. People have made fun of me saying that 'its just a movie', but because of the fact that its just a movie and it had the power to impact me proved that it is superb. The love story of Anakin and Padme is a love story that perhaps conveys a great message. You need to train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose, and everything happens for a reason. "
1241,8,The ending for a great Saga,"It's been a great ride. I was only born when Return of the Jedi came out to theaters so I never got to see any of the originals in theaters... until 1997, I saw Star Wars: A New Hope when it was re-released. That's when I fell in love with Star Wars. Great characters, action, and the special effects were great for it's time."
1242,1,as bad as it gets,"the last time i was so disappointed with a movie, it had vin diesel in it. lucas wasn't even trying with 'revenge of the sith'. the story did not measure up to the first three, the cgi was second-rate at best, and the story was weak from the start. like episodes 1 and 2, this movie had loads of potential, but failed to deliver at every step. die hards will see this movie and probably not complain too much, but the casual star wars fan will recognize how truly bad this movie is. the movie had few moments that were classic. like the way yoda escaped after his fight with palpating (i won't tell you, but it reminds you of something in empire strikes back.) yoda was the best part of this movie. sadly, that's just not saying much. in short, when a movie is this bad, it spurs you. it makes you want to get on the internet and tell everyone just how bad it is. its not that they made a bad movie that ticks me off. the problem is that they made a bad movie and they are still going to clean up at the box office."
1243,3,This movie sucked,The acting was horrible Samuel L. Jackson was a poor poor choice for all three of the prequals Hayden Christensen .... Anakin Skywalker may have been worse. Ian McDiarmid .... Supreme Chancellor Palpatine sucked towards the end. If it wasn't for Ewan McGregor .... Obi-Wan Kenobi the movie would have been a total washout.
1244,1,Unwatchable,This may be the single worst movie ever made. And I have seen some real clunkers. The fall of George Lucas is utterly stunning. This man co-wrote and directed two of the greatest movies of all time -- American Graffiti and the original 1977 Star Wars. But that was three decades ago and he has spent way too much time isolated from anyone who can say no to him.
1245,5,What a disappointment!,"Like every single Star Wars fan in the universe, I had high expectations for the third chapter in the saga. This was the episode that would bring the whole story together. Well, they did achieve that but the had to rush it all in in the final half hour of the film. But I feel that Lucas faltered with the second film and it affected this one greatly. Before I touch upon on the negatives, I will talk about the positives first. Great action. Seriously, an awesome thrill ride. A true Star Wars film completely with cutting back in forth to different characters and battles. SPOILER ALERT!! Negatives, well first of all. The screenplay is a big problem. Some of the dialogue is just sad, all characters except for Palpatine and Yoda speak in simple English. Another negative, is the special effects. Although very great, there is way to much and it doesn't connect with the next three films. Next is the Wookies, we did not need to see them. It was irrelevant. Good excuse for action sequences, that is the only reason they were there. On top of that, Chewbacca. Definitely shouldn't of seen him, especially interacting with Yoda like they know each other. But there is just Lucas trying to please everyone by putting in our favorite characters. Lastly, the most important part of all of the prequels is Anakin's turn to the darkside. I feel they screwed up here. Let me explain myself. The darkside is all about fear, hate, and anger. Anakin turned to the darkside all because of hope. It was the hope that Padme could survive childbirth. I think that that is wrong. He should have turned to the darkside because of the death of his mother. She was the reason that he left to become a Jedi and she could very well have been the reason he turned to the Sith. He had so much hate and anger that this could have made him go all out and mad and Palpatine could have convinced him that turning to the darkside could bring her back. I believe they could have done this towards the end of the second movie and also had the birth of the twins so that time progression through the prequels to the original tri.logy wouldn't feel so rushed. They could have expanded upon the separation of Luke and Leia in the third film instead of worrying about all the action. Overall, this film shows the future of film-making as a digital medium and has a lot of action that will keep any viewer excited but overall a disappointment for any true Star Wars fan."
1246,9,Best Wars since Empire!,"I've just seen RotS and boy... does it rock! The FX blew me away. Everybody knows what's going to happen with Anakin, but when the inevitable happens, it still comes as a shock to me. The film has a lot of 'best of's'. To name but a few: best space battle, best villain (not Vader but his master), best cyborg (eat your heart out Arnie). Lucas ties all the story lines together, maybe a little too hasty. I think there are at least two movies in RotS. Amongst all the brilliant stuff this criticism is not that big of a deal. More important the dark themes of The Empire Strikes Back are well... back. It's even more dark and gruesome than I could have imagined. I hope I get you all excited, because you should be.This is the Star Wars you have been waiting for all these years!"
1247,7,The more Lightsabers the better?,"This film is certainly the best of the New Trilogy, not that that title says much considering the woeful errors made in the creation of the last two."
1248,8,"Well, it could have been a lot worse...","For anyone who wasn't living under a rock when this came out, you would probably have gotten the idea that this was the star Wars everyone was hoping for. There are certainly a great deal to recommend viewing it."
1249,1,Flamed out fail fest,At last the end. Well of this trilogy.the only way out is through it. 
1250,8,"Great space opera with heart, soul and a glorious sense of wonder","Once obsessed by STAR WARS IV and deflated by the last two prequels, I approached REVENGE OF THE SITH with caution."
1251,8,"Very Pleasing Conclusion to the Prequel Trilogy,","Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's certainly the best of the prequel trilogy, it informs us on what lead Anakin to become Darth Vader, which is the main reason we watch these movies in the first place, it has the most action sequences as well and much more intense and shocking scenes than the previous two offered. My main problem is that it is too dark, a lot more than it needs to be, Phantom Menace had too much comic relief, but I think Attack the Clones balanced it out perfectly, but this movie had very little, it took itself very seriously and I understand with the story matter that it should, but it could have taken time to lighten the mood every now and again. The performances here are the best of the trilogy, I complained about Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman in my review of Episode II, but they have improved immensely as actors this time around, Christensen isn't good at sweet and emotional love scenes, and thankfully he is given very little of that here, and Portman seems much more confident as an actress this time around, of course Ewan McGregor continues to delight as Obi-Wan, Ian McDiarmid and Samuel L Jackson finally get to shine as Palpatine and Windu, and also superb voice over work from both Frank Oz and Anthony Daniels as the very lovable Yoda and C3PO. It may still be lacking the magic from the original trilogy, as all the prequels did, but it is certainly a great ride and all Star Wars fans will surely be pleased, I would recommend Star Wars Episode III- Revenge of the Sith to anyone looking for a good adventure or sci-fi film. "
1252,9,great,"Given everything that had to go into this film: a confluence of music, effects, and acting, I have to tip my proverbial hat. "
1253,1,"lame plot line, awful film, mindless reviewers","I simply cannot believe the kind of reviews people have given this movie. Its like they are trying to save face for george lucas. Or retain some kind of the magic they felt when seeing the first star wars films. Everything about this movie was bad 1. The Plot My god, could the premise be any more stupid. I don't wanna ruin things for people who haven't seen the movie yet but jeez how much simpler and more unbelievable could you get for a plot line. George lucas must have, quite like most of his fans i would guess, not have gotten any in highschool which is prominently displayed in the fact that every jedi who does not seem to be a eunich ends up falling for the darkside."
1254,8,"Episode III: The ""Star Wars"" Crossroads","George Lucas brings the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy to an end with the third episode, ""Revenge of the Sith."" In this installment, we get to see how Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen) was manipulated into crossing over to the ""Dark Side,"" and becoming Darth Vader. It's an emotional turn for Anakin, as well as for his Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). The story also shows how the Republic was built up, and how the Jedis were crushed. A dark story, to be sure, but it does pave the way for the story arc of the original trilogy. The imagery and visual effects were very well done, and there was a lot of excitement packed into each light sabre battle. The story tends to get bogged down when it came to Anakin and Padme's love. But in the end, ""Star Wars"" fans couldn't ask for a better close to the epic trilogy!"
1255,2,Ultimate disappointment!,"The theater was packed, but I can honestly say that the majority of the viewers were extremely disappointed. I could have happily left after the first 20 minutes and seriously wondered if the movie was going to be a spoof on the original, but no such luck."
1256,9,Episode III - the best movie of the prequels,"Now the end of the saga of Star Wars is here and it awakes a lot of my memories from the old trilogy, the ones with Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. First, I want to thank George Lucas for having managed to create a spectacular movie when he failed to do that by episodes I and II, which lacked me. But this doesn't. It completely obsesses me. With cold breezes and applause, Episode III starts its beginning. The war in the space crash in full swing and it gets me to remember episode IV, which started just like that. "
1257,10,Star Wars: - Episode III: - Revenge of the Sith (This movie is amazing - go and see it!!!),"George Lucus has made this movie spectacular and I can see him winning Oscar's for it. OK I'm a huge fan of Star Wars but I admit I haven't seen episodes 4 - 6 because I'm still a teenager myself. I was so excited about the third and final movie. When I first saw The Phantom Menace I was let down. Then I saw Attack of the Clones - again a let down. But then Revenge of the Sith comes along and wow it's an amazing. It's everything the reviews I have read had said it to be. I'm a huge fan of Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor myself. "
1258,8,Without a doubt the best Prequel,"The Revenge of the Sith had spectacular special effects and fight scenes, which Steven Spielberg himself helped make. Now nothing, in my opinion, compares to the Obi-wan/Darth Maul fight scene in Phantom Menace, but the good thing about this Star Wars installment is that there are many fight scenes that come close. Anikain Skywalker looks convincingly evil althroughout this installment which should put to sleep Hayden Christensens's harsh critics in Attack of the Clones. There are some scenes that can leave one feeling if George Lucus really prepared his actors (which I've read he didn't leaving his dialog coach to prepare his actors). Some scenes, the dialog is so bad you can almost see the actor turn to stone such as the introduction scene of Darth Vadar and his, ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!"" That was kind of cheesy and left me wondering if it was done digitally. "
1259,10,Once again the Sith rule the galaxy...,"Unlike most Star Wars fans, I really didn't have that much negative intent toward the prequels. It cannot be just like the original trilogy because it tells a wholenother story, or rather a different part of the same story. If you're telling your life story some parts are bound to be more interesting than others. Having said that, I think Ep. III just brings everything together so nicely that the shortcomings of the previous films can be forgiven. My biggest surprise was Hayden Christensen. I was shocked at how accurately he portrayed a brooding, frustrated war hero. It was more than I imagined it would be! That one scene on Mustafar where he's just staring with his hood up and crying...he gave me chills for real! And that duel! I have been waiting all my life to see this duel. It's up there with Achilled vs. Hector from THE ILLIAD, it's just an epic struggle that decides the outcome of everyone else's lives! I thought Anakin's actual betrayal happened too quick and could have been built upon, I REALLY wanted to see Qui-Gon but it wasn't necessary, I wished Yoda/Palpatine and Mace/Palpatine's duels had of been not longer but had more detail but damn, the movie was great anyway! This is truly a modern Shakespearean-style tale and finally, after 30 years, the story is told. The best of the series."
1260,8,Almost perfect end to pave the road for the subsequent chapters.,"The disaster that ""The Phantom Menace"" almost caused, and the redemption of ""The Clone Wars"", brought the series to a serious crisis that would've only be saved by a masterpiece of the new millennium."
1261,10,Well done,"The acting was great, the fight scenes believable and the overall storyline was intense and grabbing at your emotions. Much better than what Disney has done to the newer releases."
1262,10,Even Better than the Originals,"This movie is beyond fantastic. It perfectly ties together the whole prequel trilogy and leads up to the original trilogy. The villain of this movie is probably the best movie of all time. There are twists you will not see coming, there is the tragedy you expect, and there is fun action. This is a movie for all ages, older people will love the story while younger kids will like the fun action."
1263,10,The End of an Era....,"For all us true ""Stars Wars"" fans, ""Stars Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" is a bittersweet masterpiece. Watching the movie is some-what gut wrenching, not only because we know what is going to happen, but also because we are powerless to stop it."
1264,9,I can die happy,"Having been raised on the Star Wars films as a child, played hooky from high school to catch the first showing of Episode I, failed a class to catch the first showing of Episode II and as a person who is not ashamed to admit that he has Jedi robes and a suit of Clone Trooper armor hanging in his closet ... I can die a happy man, because the saga is now complete. This movie is everything I could have asked for and then some. It is not only visually stunning but also emotionally powerful. For fans of the original trilogy who felt that the newest movies have been disappointments, it may come as a pleasant surprise at how many loose ends are tied up with this movie, as it does an exceptional job of linking the two trilogies together. I could prattle on and on about how wonderful I thought the movie was, but, then again, I also had the patience to find redeeming qualities even in Episode I: The Phantom Menace (they really are there if you have the inclination to look hard enough)... What it really boils down to is this - If you are a Star Wars fan, see this movie. You will not regret it."
1265,3,A horrifically blown opportunity,"Only George Lucas could take the chance to give us the story of how the galaxy's biggest bad**s came to be such, and, instead, give us an effects-laden, heavy-handed, boring treatise on Palpatine's ascendancy. Who cares about Palpatine? For three movies we got Palpatine, who was never particularly interesting. Could we not simply stipulate that, yes, he is evil and badly in need of some sun, and get on with the REAL story? Anakin Skywalker could have been SO much more interesting than the shallow, moody little twit we were given."
1266,6,It was actually nice,"George Lucas took advantage of the mastery display of CGI sword play which was the only good thing about Attack of the Clones, as we get to see Master Yoda will the lightsaber again this time take on the Sith Lord and let's not forget the wonderful introduction of Darth Vader, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the new Star Wars trilogy. The thing I did enjoy most in the movie is the pace it moved, it was all happening fast from the dissolving of the Republic, the corruption of Anakin and then Lucas made we the viewers eager to see the faceoff between the Mentor and apprentice, as we wait to see Obi-Wan Kenobi take on young, proud and powerful Anakin Skywalker."
1267,6,A thoroughly enjoyable movie going experience,"I was nervous as I sat down in the theater on opening night. Nervous that this Episode would be as lame as the one before it. After the catastrophe that was episode 2, I had begun to lose faith in George Lucas. How wrong I was. This is by far the best film of the newest trilogy. It is a long movie but it doesn't feel like it. The script is decent, the acting, while still wooden at times, is vastly improved (especially by Hayden Christensen). The action scenes are breath taking and John Williams is tremendous as always, but that wasn't what made this film. The high point for me was the way it lined up so perfectly with the original trilogy. Every little detail was arranged so neatly. Lucas even brought in James Earl Jones to be the voice of Vader once Anakin's transformation is complete. All in all it is a very enjoyable movie that is good for almost all ages."
1268,1,"Ugh, just ugh...with a side of ugh.","""Ugh, just ugh...with a side of ugh."""
1269,9,"An Excellent, Entertaining Mid-Installment with Few Shortcomings","Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was literally the last hope any and all Star Wars fans had for George Lucas to even come close to matching the original trilogy. Despite the uneasy and lukewarm-at-best reception The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones garnered, anticipations were set high after the promising trailers along with multiple light saber duals being touted. This was the last major, on-screen film Lucas had left to release, and how did it manage and hold up? About as good as realistically possible."
1270,9,Back to The Future,I rank Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Episode III right up there with the first Star Wars. I would have give it a 10 except for the hand-wringing angst about childbirth.
1271,10,Incredible,"Absolutely incredible film, great acting from the main and supporting cast, including Hayden Christensen. Good scenes with a lot of action and important non-action scenes, we really feel the power of the emperor in this film, as we learn a major secret about his true identity that changes the course of the film.

1272,9,"""Join me, Padmé and together we can rule this galaxy.""","Yes, we are supposed to look at the movie we've just seen and decide whether the casual movie goer will enjoy it or not. But in this case, I'm going to go with a big ""who cares"" to that idea. This is the film made for those who have interest in the Star Wars story. This is the film that people who have even a passing interest in the characters we first met 28 years ago will want to see. A person plucked off the street, never seeing any of the first 3 movies, may not get Revenge of the Sith, but those who have invested any time into any of the Star Wars movies will need to see this film. The two hours fly by, leaving me wanting even more, possibly because there a few more scenes I would have loved to see, but mainly because I was so immersed into the story that I just wanted the movie to keep going. Who cares about the love story dialog (yes, some of the lower moments of Attack of the Clones come back in cringe-inducing scenes), the action and storytelling scenes more than make up for it. Unlike the previous Star Wars films which open on scenes of a single ship flying through space, Revenge of the Sith opens in mid battle, as Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) are chasing down the dastardly General Grievous (the wheezing voice of Matthew Wood) who has kidnapped the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Senate, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). A great looking action sequence to the film gets us right into the action, and Star Wars fans will immediately recognize prototypes of TIE fighters chasing down prototype X-Wings. R2-D2 plays a familiar and amusing role during the first 20 minutes as the helpful little droid. After the rescue mission, Anakin meets up with his secret wife, Padmé (Natalie Portman) who has big news: she's pregnant. There were gasps in the audience I was in after it was revealed who she was about to bare, but for those who paid attention to Return of the Jedi, there's no surprise at all. The rest of the film plays off the fact that Anakin had dreams of his mother dying just before she did in Attack of the Clones, as he begins to dream of his wife dying. Anakin's quest to save his wife is what sends him down the path to the dark side, ending with him becoming Darth Vader. Back in 1977 when Star Wars (now known as A New Hope) first came out, we thought Darth Vader was just pure evil, but after Revenge of the Sith, there is depth, there is humanity, there is some sympathy in Darth Vader. So much is added to the three movies that come after Revenge of the Sith. Sadly, this will probably be the final Star Wars movie (at least that's what George Lucas says), just when the story becomes the most interesting. There was a lump in my throat watching the final scenes, as Anakin succumbs to the dark side and I realized this was it. Perhaps some of my feelings came from the fact that The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones added so little to the story and Revenge of the Sith was just so good by comparison that so much more could have been done. This movie also gave Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) something to do, and he does it well. We also finally hear from Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) who plays a larger role in the story. The movies emotional pull reaches a peak when Darth Sidious initiates Order 66. Without giving much away, we see the pure evil that exists inside of Darth Vader and the unsuspecting end of several characters from the two previous films. When we see Yoda (Frank Oz) fight the Emporer (Palpatine gave himself that designation) and Obi-Wan fight Anakin, cross cut beautifully by Lucas, the six film saga is complete, everything had lead up to that point. We knew the first time we saw Obi-Wan in A New Hope we knew there was more to his relationship with Darth Vader, and here we see it. George Lucas has completed his story with the strongest chapter since The Empire Strikes Back. So does this mean we never have to watch Attack of the Clones again?"
1273,10,The Force is back for the Final Attack,"this movie makes up for the short falls of it's two prequels. The two previous films didn't really fell like I was watching a star wars movie, instead they felt more like star wars spin offs that should have been called ""This Young Obi-Won & Anakin Adventures""."
1274,1,A dreadful ending,"George Lucas how you have fallen. Your work used to be much better than this. You have always been a technical guy. The effects are very good but the story was, how should I put it, awful. This is a travesty of the original series. The only reason I can come up with as to why you have done this, is that you needed the money."
1275,8,Excellent Film,"I thought it was definitely interesting. The acting in this one was far better than the first two. In my opinion this is about the same caliber as Return of the Jedi. I think the plot took some time to start up, but once it got going, which was about halfway through the film, it was pretty dang good. The dialogue at times was a little cheesy, but hey what do you expect from Christiansen/Lucas. I was extremely impressed after he turned dark; I think he did an excellent job of portraying a villain. There was very little comic relief, and most of it was at the beginning. I think if you cut out the first 20 minutes of the film, it would be a superb movie. Character development was excellent. Lucas did a great job of building up to the characters that you see in Episode IV - VI. There were a TON of subtle references that I caught, which was absolutely awesome. The first thing I wanted to do after seeing this one was watch Episode IV, because you have such a different view of the Empire and Rebellion after seeing this one. After seeing this film it changes your whole perspective on the classic three movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It just gives you a different view on Vader; it demonstrates just why he's such a menacing villain, and you completely understand why he is the way he is after that event happened in his life."
1276,6,Certainly Better than the Last Two but Still Flawed,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is usually the film that people describe as being the only good Star Wars prequel out there. One of the most used words to describe this film is dark. People often call it the darkest film of the entire Star Wars saga, but is it a good movie outside of being dark? Let's find out!"
1277,,Something is missing,"The main problem of a new trilogy is how they presented a story - they put CGI on the first place and emotions and Star Wars style on the second. Something is missing, the charm of romantic adventures with hope is lost."
1278,1,Lucas' Latest Belch,"Now, don't get me wrong: I don't mind escapist entertainment  what the Star Wars universe is all about. HOWEVER, the narrative material that was dealt with here was indeed tragic. Come on, we knew what was going to happen in the end, we just came to see HOW it was going to happen. But was it appropriate to unfold this as hollow-like as possible?"
1279,8,The Force is Strong in This One,"I have one ****SPOILER**** near the end, so you have been warned."
1280,9,The third times the charm!!!,"I remember going to the theater, butterflies in my stomach, towards the release of the final Star Wars movie in fear of being disappointed after the bitter taste of the prequels. Talk about a great movie; it was the BEST one out of them all!!! Can't believe I'm saying this but this one recaptured that vibe that was sorely missing in the first two films!!! For once, more attention is paid to the story and characters rather than bang and boom and most importantly of all, it didn't cater to the child demographic. There's some faults with the dialog, but they're rarely mentioned and don't hurt the overall product. A plus. This is the darkest, morally and emotionally complex of the prequel trilogy with scenes that can actually make you feel sad and heartbreaking thanks in part to the script and performances out of the lead players in this tale of galactic conflict dipped in space-opera fudge. And Ian McDiarmid is simply great as the evil Emperor Palpatine. And last but not least, Jar Jar is barely seen in the film although in my heart I wished he was ""vindicated""."
1281,9,The force is with this one.,"George Lucas goes all out in the third and final chapter of the Star wars prequels, We finally get to see Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the greatest movie villain of all time: Darth Vader. The movie is non-stop action from start to finish culminating between the best lightsaber fight of all the six movies. Ewan McGregor is wonderful as Obi-Wan Kenobi as well as the rest of the cast, specifically Ian McDermaid as the emperor. The story takes place near the end of the clone wars when Anakin and Obi-Wan battle the separatist droids who are under the leadership of Count Dooku and new character, the cyborg General Grevious. Anakin continues to have horribles nightmares of his wife Padme who is now pregnant, and is willing to do anything to try to prevent his dream coming true. It is that weakness that Senator Palpatine uses to convince Anakin to join the dark side of the force. Watching him turn to the dark side you can't help but feel sympathy even though has done horrible things because he feels what he's doing is right. The climax of the movie is of Anakin and Obi-Wan lightsaber duel witch has disastrous consequences. Sith has more than one lightsaber fight in the film among various characters such as Yoda, Mace Windu, and even General Grievous who is trained in the Jedi Arts by Count Dooku. ROTS is quite possibly the best of the entire six movies and is a fitting ending for George Lucas Star Wars Saga. (or is it the end?) It has action, drama and seeing Vader is perhaps the most chilling moment. What a thrill!"
1282,9,Wow,I just wrote out a really long review and then i lost it so i'll just leave my rating here.
1283,,Joined at the hip and detached at the legs,I watched this flick without ever seeing any of the other Star Wars movies. In fact during the 80's I thought Star Wars was a cold war reference when hearing about it on the news. I think much like these old re-emerging hippies speaking out against the war. Maybe they are reminiscing of the free love and drugs that powered a generation of war haters. Lucas delivers a few jabs at the political jaw of his country's leader. This can be seen in a few of the movies out now---'World Police' 'Passion of J. C.' 'Kingdom of Heaven' ---the new movie staring Orlando Blume--- was a better comment on this current situation of the war in Iraq.
1284,3,oh boy :(,"i won't go into a long discussion about the downfall of the star wars franchise in the this final installment, there are quite a few other reviews that will go into lots of details. however, i will sum it up in one statement... thank god i don't have to watch another useless, 2 minute spaceship flyby as an establishing shot, that has no relevance to telling the story and is something we've seen a million times now."
1285,10,It's very good,Its good. Watch it because it is the best star wars movie and all that other stuff. H
1286,10,FOR THE REPUBLIC,The Sith will have their Revenge.
1287,8,An outstanding end,A great Ed to the 2nd Star Wars trilogy. So far my favorite movie. It has an amazing story. Good performances by the cast. Great visuals and CGI. Definitely a must watch if you are a Star Wars fan.
1288,10,Top 10 movie of all time,"Best Star Wars Film Ever, the battles are unlike any other film. The acting is incredible."
1289,2,Glad it is finished,"I am glad it is finished! I have been waiting for years for the beginning of what i consider the best saga ever and Lucas came out with these three terrible movies. And full of mistakes, too. First of all, the Jedi knights were wise, calm and Lucas depicted Obi-Wan and Anakin as two cowboys with a terrible sense of humor (see the line ""Jedi business"" in the bar in Episode II). They look more like Mel Gibson and Denny Glover in Lethal Weapon than two peace guardians working for the Republic. And going on with the mistakes in all the new trilogy: 1)In the original Star Wars Obi-Wan (Ben at the time) says that he doesn't recognize the droids, especially this last model. We can clearly see that these droids should be at least 35 years old. What is worse, though, is that the line in the DVD version of the movie has been changed in ""interesting"". I couldn't believe it! 2)Two full movies talk about the clone army, but no explanation is given on where the officers of the army come from. The people with the gray uniform without the mask, apparently with higher rank, are not clones and since there is no army before the clones one I don't get how they can be present at the end of Episode III. 3)Apparently Chewbacca knows Yoda and the Jedis. So why when Obi-Wan and Luke hire Han Solo and Chewbacca they keep laughing about the force and the Jedis? What's happened to the Wookie? Did he forget anything? 4)In Episode II Obi-Wan finds that the clone army has been built with the help of Jango Fet and, towards the end of the movie, that Jango is helping count Dooku to built the droids army. Now, i understand that Palpatine is hampering the judgment ability of the Jedis, but even a two-year-old kid would see that those two things are related. And what do they do? They use the clones to fight the droids! Does it make sense? 5)In the first movie Darth Vader is not in command of anything. He is a subordinate to the commander of the station. Isn't it in contradiction with the role the Siths have in the empire? He should be the emperor's right arm. 6)Maybe this is not a mistake, but something that really bothers me: why doesn't Obi-Wan kill Anakin? Couldn't Lucas find a way to let Anakin live without make a total fool of Obi-Wan?"
1290,8,The best prequel,"While most people criticize the prequels. There is no reason to criticize ROTS for anything except the acting. Sometimes the movie has it's stale movies and lines sound bland, but if you're a real fan and not someone who follows the crowd you'd be watching this for the story and quickly over look any of the ""flaws"" of this movie. Also this movie can have a, ""gets better every time"" effect or, ""gets worst every time"" effect. But I assure you that if you're a fan you'll like this movie. If you not, oh well, Why are you watching it in the first place? Anytime a slow scene comes up there is a fast scene to replace it. So it's completely balanced in terms of battle and dialog."
1291,4,Minimal effort,"Revenge of the Sith fittingly concludes a disastrous trilogy. Although it has a protagonist arc, its writing remains abysmal. The tone is erratic, dialogue is blunt, character choices are confusing, and the narrative is needlessly convoluted (a flaw worsened by the prequel's predictable nature). Specifically, side characters and plotlines are unproductive filler. Really, this story should've focused on Anakin's unraveling, allowing him to evolve naturally. Instead, he's consistently angsty and deprioritized behind illogical politics. Thus, Anakin's descent is faint and the script is disengaging. Despite centering around a downfall, Revenge of the Sith fails to emotionally connect."
1292,4,Opera!,"Star Wars is the most popular cinematic work of all time, and the classic trilogy is almost universally regarded as the crown jewel of cinematic escapism. The prequel trilogy, however, has not fared so well."
1293,10,A great Star Wars film at last,"It's a big ask to sell people on a film series where the entire trajectory is a young man becoming increasingly corrupted and fall from grace, particularly when the fate of many of the characters you're depicting is a well known, and often celebrated fact of cinematic history, but on George Lucas plowed through two uneven prequel films to bring us here, the one where the bad guys win, and win emphatically."
1294,4,The Writers took Revenge on Us **,Believe my title.
1295,10,My First review of a current movie.......,"Well what can I say? but yet another brilliant Sci Fi Movie.In this one Star wars writer George Lucas ties up all loose ends. such as how Arran Skywalker became Darth Vader. I never knew that the Chancellor became that awful evil Emperor, all the digital effects are first class every planet has a sky full of spaceships, these are the buses and cars of the future, taking everybody from work and meetings. I quite like little Yoda, he is very knowledgeable on the fate of our Galaxy and it's affairs. all the Star wars movies start with the words,""A long Time Ago, in a Galaxy far far away....."" I also like the flat writing at the beginning of the credits. I really enjoyed the film from beginning to the very end.In our cinema, there was a person dressed up as Darth Vader, he looked very life like. That Genaral Grevis was very bad! but interesting how he was constructed. to look like a robot! I also like C3PO. This is my first ever review of a 2005 movie."
1296,9,I Liked It,I thought that it was really good! 
1297,9,How did Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader,"He had everything he ever needed-his love Padme,his teacher and best friend Obi-Wan Kenobi,he was faithful to Republic,he was best Jedi,someone who would never betray his ideals and beliefs. He would die for them. So,what happened to him,how he betrayed himself? That happened to him because he lost his balance between good and dark side of ""force"". And what is force. It represents our personality,our life strength,our faith in our selves,our life energy. But as everything else it can be used in service of good and evil. Good and evil are in all of us-symbols of our virtues and faults. And side that prevails will define the way we are. He was a person of extremity- if he was faithful to someone or something he would n't hesitate to sacrifice himself. If he was fighting against somebody or something he would fight until complete destruction of that. That was dangerous side of him,that side eventually pushing him from one end to another one. That commitment became fatal to him."
1298,5,Top notch action scenes....otherwise absolute drivel.,"George Lucas is a disappointing guy. He brings the world the first three Star Wars films, which were fun, funny and fairly low on their level of cheese. Now, CGI is much better, and George Lucas throws away the script and goes for lots of drawn out action scenes. And those action scenes are very cool looking, though they do make up quite a lot of the film, but is that a positive or a negative? If the movie had more action scenes, then there will be less story and dialogue. More action it is. The dialogue in this Star Wars especially is so god-awful and corny you might want to claw your ears off."
1299,8,"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY THE SITH, NOT JOIN THEM!!","This is where Star Wars really begins. The Clone Wars rages on and whilst Obi Wan is off across the galaxy taking down General Grievous, Anakin falls into the clutches of the dark side when Emperor Palpatine slays Mace Windu and puts Order 66 in motion. Anakin becomes Darth Vader and slays the younglings and seperatists until he has his showdown with Obi Wan. The CGI was perfected more in this film and the writing and acting is much better to the point it actually feels like a Star Wars film."
1300,,Yet another Prequel tragedy...spoilers...of what I'm spoiling I don't know... may follow:,"Episode 3 was yet another prequel tragedy proving once again that nothing is better than the original films. Due to extreme lack of sleep from the midnight showing, I will try to make this easier on myself by making a few major points: Unfortunately Jar Jar did not die."
1301,9,The best of the bunch,"There are few films I love enough to go see them twice at the cinema but this was one of them. What a stunning, exhilarating, thunderous end to a mediocre trilogy. Not only is this the best of the newer films, it is the best of all the Star Wars films. Something I would not have believed Lucas able to pull off."
1302,4,I'm So Confused!,"Alright, I admit that I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. The original premiered on May 25, 1977, which I know only because it was my 15th birthday. I loved the first two. What I enjoy about a good movie is being transported into a fictional world. If I'm watching a movie and thinking about the storyboard, or the clunky dialog, or the utter lack of chemistry between romantic leads, and of the repeated 'wtf??"" illogical factors; if I laugh more at places the audience isn't supposed to laugh than at the places we ARE. . ."
1303,10,Absolutely stunning,"This is the movie I was waiting for because it had to tackle the toughest, most complicated part of the Star Wars series: how can a good kid become Darth Vader. It's the first of all six that has enough depth of emotion and richness of plot for me to truly love as an adult."
1304,9,Thank god,"Just when you thought star wars was dead (Well, i did!), along comes revenge of the sith. After the boring and dull 1 and 2 of the star wars saga, this was exactly the shot in the arm this series of films deserved. George Lucas delivers in this fantastic 'finale' of flicks that gives the viewer thrills, spills, and everything else!. Its just got it all, for the old and the young, light sabres, fights galore and the sad, but brilliantly shot turning of anniken skywalker into the infamous darth vader."
1305,9,The Defining Episode.,This episode introduces the major characters in episodes 1 through 6. It also shows Anikan decent into darkness becoming Darth Vader through the manipulation of Senator Palpatime.
1306,5,Everybody has gone hoopla,"I gave the first two parts a 1 and a 3, placing them amongst one of the worst in film history. This new episode actually surprised and relatively impressed, hence the respectable 5. One more episode and I might just give Lucas a 7... :) This is undoubtedly the only of the 'new' Staw Wars episodes worth mentioning. But is it just me or has the taste of the majority of our populous hit the bottom? I guess in comparison with part I and II this film is 'a masterpiece', but how does it rank with any one of the original movies? Let me put it this way. Part I is Britney Spears. Part II Jennifer Lopez. Part III Madonna. Part IV-VI would then probably be Debussy, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven (in that order)."
1307,9,Great movie,"This movie was totally sweet and if I do say so myself it was better than the original star wars just because of the special effects. I have never seen such good special effects in my life. If for some reason you have'not seen this movie than you really should and it is great for children and my parents liked it too. The only flaw in this movie was that of the wookie war, they should have made that a lot longer. And knowing exactly what was going to happen. Hayden Cristiansen is THE best pick for anikin George Lucas could not have picked a better actor for that role.Ewan Mcgregor and the rest of the cast were great. This movie is well worth the $8.00 to see it.9/10 stars."
1308,10,Best film I've ever watched,"This film is action packed, but very tastefully. It perfectly sets up the original trilogy and is full of minute details which immerse the viewer in a galaxy far far away."
1309,8,Revenge of the Sith -- A review from a guy who really saw it!,"With the thunder of war drums blasting, George Lucas dangles you over a Republic Star Cruiser for about a minute only to reveal a space battle so electric it was hard to keep up with, much less blink my eyes. John Williams' amazing score makes it even better. Visually, it is probably the best sequence of the entire ""Star Wars"" saga, and a brilliant way to reintroduce the major characters around whom the prequel trilogy is based."
1310,9,Lucas strikes back!,"George Lucas tied up all of the loose ends of the Star Wars epic. We finally see how exactly how Anakin Skywalker fell to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader. The story is no secret: Palpatine uses the Force to gain absolute power both as a Sith Lord and as the Chancellor/Emperor, and seduces Anakin to the Dark Side."
1311,6,A so-so film with few redeeming qualities,"This may be the best of the Prequels but doesn't even come close to the level of the original three. What can I say that hasn't already been said. The movie has it's highs and lows. More lows though. Where to begin? The acting is horrible. Some say the acting in the originals wasn't great either. But at least they put energy into the acting back then. These actors come off as high school kids in a play. Either the energy is flat or it's so high strung it'll make you cringe. The special effects are good for the most part, though some are just stupidly unnecessary. Like Temuera Morrison's head pasted on a CGI Clonetroopers body. It looks as bad as you think it would. The plot is okay but is so full of holes. Padme dies for no reason. Although some say she died of a broken heart, that is just a load of crap. Anakin turns to the darkside with a flick of the switch. Trusting 1 man's word over those who raised him for the last 10 years. The droid humor is not funny. It's quite dumb actually. And it doesn't help this film's attempt to be dark. Notice I said attempt. This movie is more silly than tragic and I laugh at all the idiots who said they cried during this movie. It's worth the 1 viewing I guess, but it's not the masterpiece all these critic and fans claim it to be."
1312,10,My favorite Star Wars movie,"I was absolutely blown away by this masterpiece when I first saw it. In 2019 I made it my mission to watch every Star Wars film. I began with the prequels and finished with the sequels. I had heard how ""awful"" the prequels were, however I enjoyed all 3 of them. I was not prepared for episode III. There were so many incredible elements packed into this film and so many mind blowing moments (Order 66, Anakin vs Obi-Wan on Mustafar, Mace Windu's death, chaos all over, etc.) and I was immersed throughout. At the beginning of the film there were plenty of Jedis as well as a few siths and other characters but by the end, very few remained and it is such a great cinematic experience. Please watch this movie, but I assume you already have since my review contains spoilers and you are reading this right now."
1313,1,The best of the prequels... but ....,My criticisms are this: - 
1314,9,"Apart from Natalie Portman's Scene, a Great Movie","Not to pick on Natalie Portman, but those sections of movie which featured her interaction with Hayden Christenson were still lacking in watchability. The only scene between them that succeeds is when they are gazing at each other across the city during sunset, the somber wails of an Arabic maiden reaching out of the scene and taking hold of the viewer."
1315,1,unforgiven,"friends and family warned me not to go. not because they had seen it, but because there was no way lucas could become a director of people, complete with emotions and humanoid speech patterns, after all that had gone before. i would not listen, i wanted desperately to have this monstrous trilogy redeemed by the end."
1316,7,Good not great,"Being a large economy sized nerd I saw the midnight opening. I found the action to be excellent and it is a far better film than Episode I. That being said I thought there were a number of holes in the story and I thought that much of the plot was too simplified. I felt like Anakin's relationships all seemed forced, that his turn to the dark side was unbelievable at best (actually more laughable), and that storyline was rushed at times to crowd in more action. Of the three new films I'd say two was the most enjoyable, but this is a decent installment. The weak point here was definitely the writing with some of the acting also being a bit weak."
1317,1,"Revenge of the S%^$ ( A stupid joke, a much more stupid movie)","I have somehow been brainwashed by my father with the starwars saga when I was a kid. Although the old starwars movies aren't masterpieces, but fun entertainment (that I used to love as a child), the two precedent movies were not so good: Bad digital effects, bad dialogue/acting and cinematography. I'd rate the phantom menace with a 5,5 out of 10 and Attack of the clones with a 5."
1318,4,Will it ever end? No!,This was the first time I fell asleep during a Star Wars movie and it was during the explosions. That might say something about the dialogue.
1319,7,The Saga is Complete,"There was a bittersweet feeling to watching this movie. One one side, the crowd cheered when the Star Wars letters boomed onto the screen and clapped when the end credits ensued. On the other side, we are done. There is no more movies, no more anticipation of the next installment, no more questions on how the saber duel between Vader and Obi-Wan occurs. There will be much analysis and commentary on if this satisfied us in the close to 20 year buildup."
1320,3,I've got a bad feeling about this...,"I actually heard one reviewer (for whom I have no respect) proclaim that this movie might be the best Star Wars film ever, including the original three. Is that even possible? Or, was it at least the best of the prequels? Or, given the low standards set by the first two parts of the prequel trilogy, could Revenge of the Sith at least not be a disappointment? The answers to those questions is no, no, and no (that last one is tricky, given the double negative). To cut to the chase of this review, I thought this movie was terrible. The worst of the whole bunch. Worse than Attack of the Clones (which I did not like at all), worse than The Phantom Menace (which I didn't mind, and found to be average). Now that I've seen all the prequels, as a moderate fan of the original trilogy, I'm going to pretend that they never happened."
1321,9,Welcome Back Mr Lucas,"As the Star Wars movie franchise comes to an end (perhaps), George Lucas has made a prequel worthy of comparison with Empire and the original Star Wars. Although darker and more brooding than any of the other movies, the M rating being well deserved, Lucas has scored again, finally, with the fast paced, action packed, character driven story, laced with traces of humour that made the original trilogy classic."
1322,10,Made me love Star Wars,"To be honest, in my opinion is Revenge of the sith the most entertanting star wars movie there is. I know Empire is great and all (and i do think its the best one) but revenge of the Sith just has those intense lightsaber Battles and one of the biggest betrayals in cinematic history in my opinion."
1323,8,Finally Lucas Has Done Something to Match the Success of the Original Trilogy,"I went and saw this on opening day thinking this was going to be the end to it all. It was going tho complete the saga. It did. But the problem is, Lucas held back so much with the previous two movies so that this one could deliver the goods. This movie is definitely up to par with the Original Trilogy, but it has some flaws. The only bad acting comes from Hayden Christianson, who plays Anikan. The rest of the cast is phenomenal. Another thing is that George Lucas has went a little overboard with the CGI. I have to admit that this movie actually used a lot less CGI than Episode II. Mabey George learned his lesson from the box office blunder of Episode II. But still there is still too much of it. Almost everything was sot in front of a green-screen. But at least the CGI is realistic looking in this film, unlike Attack of the Clones. But this movie has the greatness and originality of the Original Trilogy. I know people give a lot of crap about this film. But it delivered the Star Wars gold standard. At least there was no Jar Jar. If you want to dump your crap on a Star Wars movie, do it to Episode II: Attack of the Clones."
1324,10,Arguably the Best Start Wars Movie,"Truly perfection. From start to finish, this movie is a masterpiece. It possesses a good balance of top-notch action and fighting scenes and moments of excellent storytelling and incredible exchanges amongst characters (Yes, I'm looking at you Opera Scene with Anakin and the Chancellor)."
1325,3,The worst of the lot...,"The reason, I think, that I hated this so much is because people raved about it. People even went so far as to say it was the best of all the six films. Then I saw it."
1326,3,What a steaming load,"one of the most over-hyped movies I've ever had the mis-fortune to see. I hated the first two prequels and had very low expectations going into this film. Seeing reviews that said it was the best of the series next to Empire got my hopes up a little higher but they were quickly dashed in the opening sequence. Once again Lucas is just way too pleased with his ability to create digital effects and has decided that good dialogue, actor chemistry, appropriate casting, plausible story lines, and good acting are unnecessary. There's no point in going into great detail as there wasn't much I found enjoyable about this film. As far as action scenes and light-saber dueling, both the prequels topped this one in my opinion. After watching RotS I'm just reminded of how badly Lucas missed the mark on these endeavors, and what a terrific opportunity was wasted. It's not often a director has so much free reign to do whatever he wants and spend what ever it takes. The only solace I take is that I won't have to sit through yet another bastardization of a story I once truly loved, and I only hope that I will one day be able to watch the original trilogy without thinking about what a steaming load the prequels were."
1327,10,Truly the best of it's kind...,"Over the last few years, George Lucas has released two Star Wars films that seemed to have inevitably missed the intended mark with Star Wars fans. Both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, although visually stunning never really lived up to the name of Star Wars. This film...Revenge of the Sith, is everything the last two should have been. The problem with Menace was that it was too kid friendly and Clones was too political...and almost didn't have a plot line to deal with the battle between the Sith and the Jedi if the scene between Count Dooku and an elevated Obi-Wan Kenobi wasn't in there. But all of that is behind us now...Now we can rejoice in the finale of the Star Wars films (although the films aren't really over...the Billion dollars this movie makes will ensure that)."
1328,10,The purest Star Wars film,This film is the best Star Wars film because<br /><br />1. It has the best duel of all Star Wars (Anakin vs Obi-wan )<br /><br />2. It is the end of George Lucas vision<br /><br />3. It has the best story out of all Star Wars films the most emotional ending and the most heartbreaking fight again between Anakin and obi-wan<br /><br />It might have some Cheesy Lines but it doesn't affect the final product
1329,10,Perfect film,"This is an amazing film, the best star wars prequel film, and better than others also."
1330,9,Great Movie and Memes,This is not only a meme gold mine but it is a great conclution to the trilogy with a lot of emotional weight to it. This movie excels in almost every category.
1331,10,Isn't that what makes a movie great?,"It is hard to express how amazing this film is. It is a flying success in all its areas. The acting is near perfect, with Hayden Christiensen giving his most convincing performance as Anakin, and Ewan McGregor delivering an outright iconic Obi-Wan Kenobi. Together they sell you the brotherhood of these two characters so well that by the end, you're throwing your money at them begging for more. The plot is so engaging, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as the events unfold, even though we've known for over 40 years what would happen. It'll have you laughing with the casually witty banter in the opening scene, and crying at the heartbreaking climax between Anakin and Obi-Wan. At the same time, John Williams creates some of his most iconic music since the originals. The sadness you feel as the orchestra and choir swell during Order 66 is immense. Throughout the film, the music is immersive, and plays a truly important role in the flow of the film. Lastly, this is a visually stunning film. The ILM team attempts some of their most ambitious effects to date, and the execution is perfect. The effects are flawless and convincing. Overall this is a truly great film. It is emotional, beautiful, and a perfect end to the saga. I think is is vastly misunderstood. This film, as well as the other prequels, were never meant to be like the originals. They're more poetic, more dramatic, and this film is the pinnacle of George Lucas' intentions. I rank it 3rd in the entire eleven film canon behind only A New Hope and Empire (of course). Even outside of Star Wars it is one of my favourite films of all time, it deserves some serious respect. It is a fun, exciting, heartbreaking story, and seeing the title scroll onto the screen at the beginning of the film always makes me smile. I truly do enjoy watching this film. Isn't that what makes a movie great?"
1332,,Excellent!,"I absolutely loved this movie! The fight scenes were great, the storyline was good, it was funny, and it was just plain cool, especially close to the end, when Vader is getting suited. I knew this movie was gonna be good but it passed my expectations by a ton."
1333,6,"Wait a minute, how'd this happen? We're smarter than this!","Did I like this film? Growing up in the 80s, I remember the passion and intense love that I had for the original Star Wars films. I remember being able to watch them everyday, all day, and never growing tired of the story, the characters, or the beautiful imagery. Sadly, I cannot say the same about these newer episodes. They have been created for a different generation than mine. A generation that would rather see bold explosions, intense fighting, and stunning CGI over a powerful story and decent acting any day. It is sad, because while Revenge of the Sith did answer some of the questions that I always wondered with the original three films, it did fall prey to this change of dynamic. Lucas is a brilliant storyteller. He has redefined and rebirthed the science fiction genre into ways that I will always be grateful, but his inability to control his actors, to have them work for him instead of fight him, have plagued these newer three chapters. Here you have these intense action sequences in which Lucas' eye has perfected, but then you have these moments where our central characters are all stuck in a paper bag, unable to free themselves with acting. It is pathetic, and I do believe it is what has placed these final three chapters behind the original."
1334,10,Fantastic movie,My favorite movie of all time. Hayden does a great job as Anakin and portrays his struggles very well
1335,5,"""Nooooooo"" : why did this film have to be made?","It's a paradox, really. This movie feels like a mere imitation, a story without depth or feeling - and yet, it's imitating itself. The problem is that we know the story too well and so all that this film does is animate (in a far too CG-dependent way) what we already know - without the subtlety, the wit, the complex characters that the Episode 4, 5, and 6 provided."
1336,10,2nd best in the series,"Even prequel haters will admit that this is the one that stood out from the others, and for many reasons. For one thing, this was Star Wars as we've never seen it before. The fall of Anakin Skywalker. We all wondered how he became Darth Vader, and we all knew it was going to happen, but I don't think anyone was prepared for what we got. This movie was not only dark, it ended in complete tragedy. To see the Jedi getting wiped out, witnessing Anakin's fall from grace, his relationship with Obi-Wan and Padme falling apart, the Empire rising. It was all very bold, despite us knowing that it had to happen, and the movie did a good job of setting things up for A New Hope very well."
1337,2,Better than the previous two....how?,"The refrain we've heard from every review of this movie is that at least it's better than Episodes I and II. Uh, how exactly is it better? Like I and II, this one suffers from cringe-worthy dialog (I was especially embarrassed for James Earl Jones during his few lines), wooden acting, uneven pacing, and nonsensical plot elements. In addition, because we know almost every detail of what's going to happen to every character, there isn't even the tiniest element of surprise in plot direction that we might have had in the first two prequels."
1338,9,Satisfaction,"I have to say that I have very clear memories of seeing the first Star Wars back in '77 in the teeny tiny theater in my teeny tiny hometown, but that since that time I have not been a particularly big fan of the series. I barely remember the next two installments and found Episodes 1 & 2 to be remarkably unremarkable. So I didn't have the highest expectations for Episode 3."
1339,5,"Good finish for the prequels, only behind Episode V","One of the most interesting things told in a Star Wars movie, script wise. That last step from Anakin to become the Darth Vader that we already knew. Hayden improves quite a lot and, in general, gives us a fine performance in a hard role to play."
1340,1,"Glossy and action packed, BUT abysmal delivery of the plot","The ships looked great. The action was great. The effects were great. To those aspects I would give 10/10, 9/10 and 10/10 respectively. But as everyone should know by now, most of what makes a good film is the plot and the script."
1341,9,A fun movie for the fans,In Episode III Lucas worked most of the irks out of his direction (or the lack there of) and Ewan McGregor finally got a beard which demands respect.
1342,9,"Stunning finale to the first trilogy; dark, thoughtful and flowing direction compliments a truly enthralling story...",There are many detractors to this prequel trilogy but in my opinion this is a stunning piece of film making that perfectly rounds off the most popular film series of all time. Frank Oz as Yoda along with Ewan MacGregor are excellent in their roles as they watch Hayerson as Darth Vadar descend into the Dark Side. The fall of the republic into the empire is paced perfectly and the romance between Anakin and Padema is kept in tact without overdoing the film.
1343,9,The Story comes full circle,"This is the first movie I have seen in many years that actually gave me nightmares. It is no accident, after all, that the three greatest entertainment phenomena of the late 20th-early 21st centuries (Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter) are all classic battles between good and evil. These epics all tell the tale, in story and metaphor, of the struggle that goes on inside each and every one of us. This movie, more than any other, strikes to the core of that struggle and brings it alive in us."
1344,3,Only for children less than 8 years old,"If you are older than 7 years old, you'll find this movie has no sense and destros all the saga."
1345,8,A grand finale and a new beginning.,"The prequel trilogy had a rather rocky start with episode one with some elements that didn't fit that well with us Star Wars fans like Jar Jar Binks. Then things got improved with episode two with grander action scenes and better character development. Now the time has come for the Empire to rise as the Jedi face their greatest challenge yet from General Grievous, Emperor Palpatine, and the most shocking of all (though not shocking to us) Darth Vader."
1346,3,Not what I expected.,"When I sat down for the third instalment of the recent Star Wars Saga I was expecting a roller-coaster ride of epic proportions, how unenthralled I would become."
1347,5,Disappointment!!,"As many others I was looking forward to the last episode. Having in mind the first two disasters (well, let's say, one and a half) I kind of reduced my expectations anyway, but was still hoping for a nice surprise. The surprise never came. Of course the movie is nice to watch, which it should be, taking into account the technical possibilities at hand. But the screenplay and acting are (again) not even close to satisfactory. One of the worst scenes is the one where Mace Windu tries to arrest the chancellor and Anakin becomes Lord Vader. Ridiculous! Or when Padmé tells him that she's pregnant: I've never heard somebody say ""This is the happiest day in my life"" with such an amount of boredom in their voice. To conclude: technically up-to date, story boring (I don't think oversimplification is necessary here) and partially nonsensical, no surprises whatsoever (if I had just seen the discussions on TV and not the movie, I would have been able to tell the story up to some minor details), acting pretty bad in some scenes."
1348,9,Anakin turns to the dark side!,I had the chance to see the movie early in Mannheim Germany on May 18th 2005. My dad and I drove 3 hours just to see this movie. i told my dad that this would be the last movie I would ever really want to see. Boy was I in for a surprise...
1349,10,Pretty much connects to the original trilogy.,"Episode III does a pretty good job connecting to Episode IV. There are, however, a couple of loose ends that it did not explain. First, in Empire Strikes Back, Luke says that there is something familiar about Dagobah (Yoda's home-in-exile) shortly after landing there. But he has never been to Dagobah before. Secondly, in Return of the Jedi, Leia claims to remember her ""real"" mother -- that she was very ""beautiful, but sad"". How could this have been possible when Padme died right after giving birth to the twins, unless Leia had mistaken her adoptive mother (on Alderaan) for her real mother. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie."
1350,10,The birth of an evil man!,"This is where the fun ends of the Stars Wars trilogy. This episode is where Darth Vader is born! Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen), is a fine Jedi Knight, who indeed falls under the sway of Chancellor Palpatine(Ian McDermid) who happens to be a very powerful Sith leader(Sith is a Jedi who craves power; they have fallen to the Dark Side of the Force) who decides to get rid of Count Dooku(Christopher Lee) who realized he was just a pawn in the Dark Side. Losing both hands and his head to Skywalker. Yoda and Obi-Wan know something is wrong, and they rely on each other throughout the adventure. In the planet Kyshyyyk,is populated by wookies the home world of Chewbacca who helps Yoda when the Clone troopers switches sides. Obi-Wan does a fierce battle with General Grievous. This villain is unbelievable. He can fight with more light sabers than any Jedi. After killing all those Jedis, Obi-Wan and Anakin go light-saber to light-saber with each other, and that's how Darth Vader was born. It's very distraught this has have to happen. But George Lucas knows what he's doing. He is giving us insight of the Star Wars saga and everything makes sense. I liked this movie despite the turnout, it fulfills my curiosity every second! 5 stars!"
1351,8,Political warning - US is going to the dark side...,Actually you could read this in a variety of ways. Emperor Palpatine's consolidation of power and rule seems to dovetail with what Putin seems to be doing in Russia.
1352,7,I'm happy to report low suckage!,"What can be said? The first two Star Wars prequels were disappointing at best. Although they made tons of cash, they just lacked everything that made Star Wars, well, Star Wars. There was little heart, charm, adventure or even real tension. With Episode III, however, the quality of the prequels takes a sharp u-turn. Revenge of the Sith is good, really good in fact."
1353,10,"It's over Anakin, I have the high ground",I love it. The best prequel of the three and they story is well set out
1354,10,The Best Star Wars Movie,"I'll start out by saying yes this movie has its flaws - everyone knows that. But if you are a true fan of Star Wars, you look past that and see the emotion of the characters and the how the soundtrack truly puts this specific movie above the rest. Watching the animated shows does help make sense of the ""abruptness"" of Anakin's transformation, while some argue a show shouldn't have to compensate for poor decisions in the movie script. Leaving that opinion aside and to the viewer's interpretation, this movie is a perfect culmination of George Lucas's vision and was such an impactful film, as unlike most movies, the ""bad guys"" finally win. Was a refreshing film at the time, and to this day it still gets better and better. It's nice to see Ewan and Hayden finally getting the recognition that was denied to them at the time of release."
1355,10,Best stars wars movie,I really enjoy story's where a good person becomes the villain. This is one of those movies and it does a really good job at making me care for the character even after they turn bad.
1356,8,"And on this note, Star Wars is finally done being milked. Except for the DVD sales now, of course","Okay, before I get to the core of this review, I'd like to make a couple notes. First, it was very pleasant to have the nearly complete absence of Jar Jar in this installment of the Star Wars saga. I can handle it if all he does is make a small cameo and his mouth never opens. Second, somebody really needs to tell George that it gets pretty annoying after a while if you use all those different scene transition effects, all the wipes and swooshes and swirls. He's like a teenager who is just learning how to use Powerpoint. But I digress."
1357,10,Absolutely awesome,"This is my favorite star wars movie. The star wars prequels might not be loved by everyone, but imo its great"
1358,7,The best of this particular trilogy,"Three years have passed and the clone wars are still raging on and Jedi Knights have been tasked with rescuing Chancellor Palpadine from the clutches of the evil Count Dooku. Following the rescue mission, Anakin Skywalker begins to tell Palpadine of nightmares he's been having about Padame dying in childbirth. When Palpadine explains to Anakin that joining the dark side will mean that he can save Padame's life Anakin finds his loyalties are divided..."
1359,10,Because of obi-wan?,This is best Star Wars movie by far. Nothing compares. Best fight scenes in all the movies including the trash Disney came out with years later
1360,8,My view.,"Well I thought it was great. By far the best of the new SW films. And one of the better SW films in all too (better than ""Jedi"" anyway). Thing is, you have to remember that this is part of a saga and not a stand alone film. I thought Matrix:Reloaded was crap until I saw all 3 as one. Now I think it's great."
1361,9,Just brilliant!,I just saw Episode 3 on a special screening here in Sofia. I had the chance to be there as a journalist. I don't wanna spoil your great moment of seeing Episode 3 for the first time. I just needed to share my great feeling after watching it. All the actors including Mr. Christensen showed their very very best.The transformation of his character into Lord Vader was more than brilliant. Great respect to Lucas as the saga is now complete even in my heart. I even cried.:) I didn't have any expectations but this movie brought me back to my childhood and now my soul will rest in peace:) May the force be with you on May 19th.
1362,9,Sith comparable to Empire,Lucas finally managed to pull it off. A week ago I was privileged enough to see a screening of Revenge of the Sith.
1363,10,Outstanding finale to the prequels...,"Lucas certainly went out with a bang. I just saw the finale and I am awestruck. I honestly don't even know where to begin, but I can say that it has everything you could ever hope to see. Huge space battles that dwarf anything from any of the other installments; a slew of lightsaber battles that every Star Wars fan has wanted to see; and some plot developments that actually elicit emotional response from the audience, something that was sorely lacking in the other two prequel installments. Now unlike a lot of the so called ""fanboys"" of this Series, I enjoyed the first two prequels; however, there was still something lacking when compared with the earlier saga. I call it the little things, which are back in a big way here. It seems Lucas finally heeded some of the criticism from the earlier installments and put all of his creative forces towards bringing back some of the original feelings and ideas from the earlier movies. The movie is dark, darker even than Empire Strikes Back, and gruesome at times. But all this does is bring a more realistic feeling to the movie, something that was often lacking in the more kid-friendly Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The movie ties up the plot lines very well and sets everything up for A New Hope. Questions about why certain things were done in episodes IV, V and VI are answered here. And in the end, this was the most important aspect of this movie. However, it is a testament to Lucas' willingness to listen to his fans that this movie is as much of a success as it is. Bravo George."
1364,4,A Saga that contradicts everything that goes on in IV-VI.,A very good story but also very disappointing.
1365,3,The final battle on the volcanic planet says it all.,"Both Anakin and Obi wan would have been burned to smithereens just going near the lava in the final battle between the pair. Until that moment, the CGI, although I'm not a fan, was quite good."
1366,10,I love it!!!,This is one of the best movies ive ever seen!<br /><br />This is how star wars should be
1367,4,Warning: This Movie Contains Spoilers,"The most disappointing aspect of the last two movies in the genre is that Lucas has completely removed all elements of mystery and surprise with respect to the storyline. Should anyone wish to view all six movies in numerical order, there is no element of surprise as to whom Luke, Leia and Darth Vader are with respect to each other."
1368,8,"Alas, the end of Star Wars. Alas, George goes out with a BANG!","Star Wars has taken nearly 30 years to become a complete saga. There have been rough bumps along the way (The ""Special"" Edition and Jar Jar Binky come to mind), but overall, this saga consists of some of the best made pictures ever (""Star Wars"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and ""Return of the Jedi""). And now, I am proud to say that the best Star Wars movie is-----""Revenge of the Sith"". Yes folks, this is a darker, scarier, and PG-13 rated movie that only Star Wars fans from the old days (1977, 1980, 1983) will appreciate. The kids won't care, so long as they get their Star Wars light-sabers and Darth Vader masks. All Star Wars fans who fully understand Star Wars (ages 11-up, 'cause my son now understands that 1 and 2 and the ""Special"" Editions are crap, and he's 11) will get that ""Oh, I see now!"" feeling. "
1369,4,Better than Episode I and II But....,"While this episode is definitely the best of this trilogy it doesn't come close to the greatness of the ""original"". Lucas should have left well enough alone. These last three films have only served to lower the standing of the Star Wars story overall."
1370,8,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith Is a Welcome Return to the Dark Side,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Is a Welcome Return to the Dark Side
1371,2,Star Wars critique - a lesson in uselessness,"What is the point of writing a review of a Star Wars movie? Nothing. No matter what is written, everyone will go see it, maybe even twice or three times, and Lucas will make another gazillion dollars. Incredible, because along with the first two installments, this movie is not very good. But it is Star Wars, and it is filled with out favourite characters, so we love it anyways. But boy is it bad.... I thought Episode I was lame and childish - bad: JarJar, Midichlorian, the pod race Episode II held great promise but ended up being a Beverly Hills 90210 episode with space violence - bad: one-liners, Natalie Portman's acting, most of the acting, dialogue, ""gladiator"" scene with the heroes escaping chains to fight a multitude of lame aliens. Episode III held the most promise of all the films. After two lame prequels we finally were gonna able to bite into the meat of the story and delve deep. Boy was that a mistake to believe! This is probably one of the most illogical movies I have ever seen. There isn't much in it that makes sense, that fits the grand scheme. And some things are completely irrational and illogical. If I am fighting with lightsabers on a volcanic planet, why would I wander on to some overhanging piece of metal where I can suddenly start tight-rope walking, and then resume my saber fight. When Luke and Vader fight on the precipice of Bespin's ventilation shaft, it makes sense because you see how they got there, it had a logic to it. In Episode 3, this logic is seriously missing. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the action scenes - they were that ridiculous. The big battle scenes have no sense of danger or purpose, but the set pieces do have some grandeur that lacked in previous battle scenes of the prequels. How is it possible that in the middle of a chaotic and very dangerous space battle (opening scene), Annakin and Obi-Wan can focus on those stupid buzz droids without having to worry about other attacks from other ships. One minute everyone is targeting them, the next, they are off playing ""sweep the buzzdroid off my wing"". Totally silly. Once again Natalie Portman is horrendous and useless in the film. Did she just not try? or does she have no real talent and gets by with looks and croneyism? On the other hand Ewan McGregor is a truly redeeming aspect of the film. He is the one actor who managed to truly inhabit his role in all the films. Hayden Christensen is a great actor too, put his part is so ""half-written"" he never gets the chance to truly show his transformation from jedi to Vader - all we get is stupid ""look at me, I'm a model"" looks - kinda like if Derek Zoolander had Jedi powers, or if Brad Pitt from Troy made a cameo appearance in a monk's cloak. This is one of the major disappointments of the film. No one cares and wants to see Annakin and Padme play teenie bopper movie-of-the-week melodrama for the weak minded. We all want Annakin going bad and becoming Vader. And we do get treated to that, its just not good enough though. The reasons for switching to the dark side are almost comical, they are that lame. The murder of the Jedis? A joke. Supposed to be the great tragedy of the story line, and it comes off as unimportant, almost happenstance. And cmon, can these soldier clones really kill all the Jedis with a couple of blaster shots. What should have been the major plot point of the 1st act, becomes a throwaway scene. The jedi have become incompetent and quite unwise. They haven't seemed to make a wise choice in any of the movies. Put Annakin on the Jedi council before he becomes a master, thus infuriating him and creating a schism between him and the jedi - wise it is not Master Yoda!! Oh, and Sam Jackson didn't want Mace Windu ""to die like a sucka"". Sorry Sammy, you did! These movie are simply not thought through well enough. The story lines lack cohesion, there is no logic to anything in it, and in the end, it turns out that the Jedi kinda suck. Shame on you Georgie, you are capable of much more thought and passion. This is not meant to be a review, more of just a rant. I love Star Wars and I wanted to films to be better than any other ones. But they are not. They are watchable and fun, but they did nothing to cement this mythology into our cultures. They have become as disposable as a BigMac or the Matrix sequels, or the Nightmare on Elm street movies. With as much freedom as Lucas has on a movie set, why he choose to take the easy cash cow route instead of making scifi art is astounding. All I can say now is - stick to Star Trek - a much better, more thoughtful and satisfying film franchise (even is ST10 was a lame ending for STTNG)."
1372,7,Wow.,"This is definitely the best prequel to date. George Lucas set million upon millions of viewers awestruck with the original STAR WARS, and he didn't let fans down with its two immediate sequels. This was the biggest movie franchise of all time (unless I'm wrong), and with good reason. The man and the films didn't disappoint. It was a thrill to watch. His first two prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, unfortunately, did. Talks of these films seemed to end with, ""Yes, it's a shame the man let us down."" The series lost popularity. But now, with REVENGE OF THE SITH, these movies inspire a spark of interest again. From its incredible battles to its dramatic finale, George Lucas has said, ""I CAN do this. Just watch."" The movie is a thrill ride, though, parents, take heed, this is not a film for your four-year-old to see. The PG-13 rating is for a reason. The characters are more real, and Lucas seems to have gotten his head around the special effects. When you leave the theater, you, too, will want to see the two TV series projects he has planned for us. This film can make the unbelievers into fans. I believe."
1373,6,Lucas not redeemed.,"I recognize that it's hard for me to be objective with the prequel episodes of Star Wars--I grew up with Episodes 4, 5, and 6, and they are the bar at which the new movies are compared. I realize that this bias is not entirely fair, but it's the way it is. Sequels are held to a different standard, because they are built upon earlier work, and they have an obligation to that material."
1374,8,By far the best prequel with the best sabre to sabre fights in SW,Visual 5/5<br /><br />Sound 4/5<br /><br />Story 3/5<br /><br />Cast 4/5<br /><br />Nostalgia 5/5
1375,10,Finally-the one everyone's been waiting for.,"Before my account got blocked, I had written that I saw this at the midnight screening. And I'll stay as true as possible to the other comment I wrote: this movie was amazing. Months of anticipation indeed paid off. This is easily the best of the six films. It sure as hell is the best of the prequels. Pros: Special effects were great, acting was better, dialogue was better too, plot, ENDING(really great), How Palpatine manipulates Anakin. Cons: Dialogue still kinda sucked-you knooooooow what I'm talking about. It wasn't that bad, but it almost killed the scene. Acting- still not great, but indeed, as I said before, better. Hayden Christensen does a better job, especially towards the last half hour. Actually, everyone does a better acting job in the last half hour. The Obi-Wan vs. Vader duel was excellent-all other duels suck compared to this one. Except Yoda vs. Sidious- that was the 2nd best lightsaber fight in the movie, but the best when it came to using the force. Obi-Wan vs. Grievous was OK, but the end of that fight, even though I read the book, was a joke. Dooku vs. Anakin? Nice pace, but a little too short. Mace vs. Palpatine was just there for Anakin to turn to the dark, but was decent nonetheless. My favorite part of the movie was the entire last half hour-from Padme landing on Mustafar to the end credits. The music was even better in this one. Overall, my ranking of the six are 1. Revenge of the Sith 2. Return of the Jedi 3. The empire strikes back (neck and neck with episode VI) 4. A new hope 5. Attack of the clones 6. The phantom menace. I cannot wait for the DVD on November 1st. You heard it was emotional, and it's true. Padme's death was emotional, as was her funeral. When Anakin choked her, it was one of the most emotional parts of the saga, not just the movie. The most emotional part of the movie? The delivering of the twins, especially Luke. The best scene in the movie? The birth of the twins and Vader getting the suit. The best part of that scene, was the first breath in Vader's mask. Powerful stuff right there. So, in short, this movie didn't meet my expectations. It absolutely shattered them. When the 2 hours and 20 minutes were over at about 2:30 am, I was wide awake. I got home at about 3 am and had school the next day. I was tired, to say the least, but this movie was worth it. Thank you George Lucas."
1376,10,Maybe my favourite of the saga?,"Last movie produced in the saga, maybe it's the best! Great Effects, dramticity of the characters and the events, this is the most tragic episode of the saga."
1377,9,Good enough!,"What every fan of Star Wars hoped would get accomplished in this movie almost certainly did...and it was done in a smart way. We all started to wonder how/why Anakin turned to the Dark Side at the beginning of the below-par ""Phantom Menace""...as this was the most compelling story of all the movies. THANK YOU George Lucas for doing this part well, as it was believable and really made sense."
1378,10,Absolutely Superb,"Star Wars is one of the greatest stories of our time. In my opinion, the Star Wars franchise is the greatest one in the history of movies. The Original movie was to me, as many other people, a big part of my life. Empire Strikes Back could not have been a better sequel, and Return of the Jedi, despite the Ewoks, was also amazing. I, like most people, was disappointed with Episode I. That's not to say that I didn't like it, but it was simply just not up to par with the other Star Wars movies. Simply put, it was made for kids, and the people that loved the originals are no longer kids. It did, however, bring the lightsaber duels to the new age, and the battle between Obi-wan and Darth Maul was not in any bit disappointing. However, a few minutes of greatness does not make up for the disappointment of the rest of the movie. Episode II, in my opinion, was a fantastic film. It was everything I was hoping for and more. It finally brought about the change of Yoda to CGI, which I believe was done beautifully and was a good decision. Now that the past is done with, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, is simply one of the most brilliant things ever to be put on film. The story, of course, could not be any better because it is Star Wars. The action is stunning and beautifully done and the lightsaber fights are so well put together, it is unbelievable. Although the acting has been somewhat of a disappointment in the other prequels, I think amazing performances are given by all, except for Natalie Portman, who wasn't terrible, but she wasn't great either. Her performance, however, does not at all affect the greatness of this movie. It has to be one of my favorite movies ever, and I simply don't understand how a movie-goer could be at all disappointed. Just unbelievable. Revenge of the Sith has my highest possible recommendation."
1379,10,Amazing,Movie with excellent actors and music. Acting is great and the movie by it self is unpredictable and fun to watch. In my opinion Revenge of the Sith is best star wars movie.
1380,10,Finally,"Being a SW fan I gotta say I liked Ep I and II, however I can clearly say they aren't as good as the old trilogy."
1381,8,Good Enough (Some Spoilers),"Certainly this is not in the league of the last 2 entries, the newest edition of Star Wars at least had legible dialogue and plot. I also wouldn't go as far as to say that Lucas has redeemed himself. A monkey could have drawn the lines to putting this one together, it practically was already written by the previous entries. Now for the good: special Effects A+, Action Sequences B+ (i felt some of the duels where obviously lacking, Grevious came off as a boring character in his fight as did Dooku. Some one please send The Emperor to a fencing class, I'm not even sure he knew which end of the saber to grab. Also how long can we pause a light saber battle so that heroes can monologue, are we supposed to believe Mace cant feel whats going on with Anakin and then wait to strike the decisive blow ) Dialogue B- (way better then Eps 1 & 2, but not nearly the classic of Ep 4 & 5) also We should have taken time to written decent lines for Padme, 3PO and Bail Organa. Plot A- over all good but what else could it have been, although too many holes left open. Apparently Jedi can only feel evil intent when it suits Lucas's need to kill them. Also there are still some contradictions between the episodes."
1382,4,Don't believe the hype,"I know that I will probably get a lot of people mad but what a terrible piece of film this was. Going in to this movie I had a lot of expectations that were built up from other reviews from prescreenings. Everyone kept saying in their reviews how amazing and satisfying this movie was, boy were they wrong. George Lucas has done nothing but show that he can put out a very pretty product. With lots of beautiful scenery and flashy action sequences he has fooled everyone. One question remains where's the story? We knew exactly where Anakin was going to end twenty years ago we just didn't know the particulars and this movies plot did little to add to the overall mythic nature of the original trilogy. I didn't expect academy award acting but Hayden Christenson must be the worlds worst actor( right up there with Adam West and William Shatner). Spoiler warning*** True SOME of the light saber battles were cool and Mace Windu's demise was very dramatic but was it really necessary to have the Wookies in this at all other than to ""tie"" this to the original trilogy? Even Obi Wan's and Anakin's final battle was BORING the dialog was preachy and stilted. As was the rest of the movie a total BORE FEST with a couple of cool action sequences sprinkled in. Here's a hint George. When you bring the Star Wars saga to television keep as far away from it as possible and maybe we'll see something worthy of the legacy YOU created. If you want to see Star Wars at it finest go watch The Empire Strkes Back. It's still the best and the one that George did the least amount of tweaking to."
1383,10,Best of this Trilogy!,"Well, this is a continuation of the previous movie, Anakin is still portrayed as a whining brat. At least at the beginning. At the end his temper tantrum is almost epic."
1384,1,Makes Gigli look like Shawshank,I do not understand the positive reviews for this movie.
1385,5,"The best of the prequels, but still not a very good movie.","I'm sure many people will find this comment un-useful, go ahead, click away, it still won't change my view."
1386,8,Always on the move.... *Beware of spoilers!!!!!!!!!*,"This is one excellent movie!!! The effects, the story, the action, it was tremendous! The story opens up over the home-world of Coruscant. Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi have been summoned to help stop the attack and save Chancellor Palpatine who has been kidnapped and taken onto one of the enemy ships by the movie's new enemy, General Grievous (a half droid, half alien commander). When Anakin and Obi-Wan find Palpatine, they have to confront Count Dooku, the guy who sliced off Anakin's arm in the last film. Obi-Wan is knocked out and it's down to Anakin and Dooku. In his anger, Anakin chops off Dooku's arms before slicing off his head with his own lightsaber. The Dark Lord of the Sith now had to look for a new apprentice. And he has someone in mind."
1387,10,Back and Better than ever the force is...,"It's been a couple of weeks since I saw Revenge of the Sith at a midnight premiere in D.C. and I've been struggling to debate whether it was good enough to dethrone my all time Star Wars fav: Empire Strikes Back. And it does my friends, it does."
1388,8,Wow!,"Even better then Attack of the Clones, saw it twice so far and was awed the first time , and surprised by it even more subplot the second time. Loved it even better the second time. Way to go George Lucas, now if he has anymore ideas for the series I wouldn't be surprised. This film blends perfectly into Episode four, five and six. It's very comparable to the Return of the Jedi (still my favorite)in many respects including editing and of course the fact that a major war ends in both films (for better or worse). There is so much going on, but like all the Star Wars films, the first time you see it it seems like your watching a huge epic, but when see it again and again it goes by too darned fast, I do hate that. You really hate Anakin Skywalker at the end when he becomes Darth Vader. Hayden is very good in this part, But the ones who really steal the film (which is no great surprise) are Ewan McGregor, Frank Oz (as Yoda's voice), Natalie Portman and of course Samuel L. Jackson. Ian McDiarmid is as always quite convincing as Palpatine. The music is as has become custom to Star Wars absolutely stellar and matches perfectly all the other Star Wars John Williams' scores. The editing is very good and the fact that it's shot on digital video and not film is not at all noticeable, as my film professor was lecturing us about. It looks like regular film to me, even better to tell you the truth, but as the norm with all the installments it is simply beautiful on the big movie screen and in surround sound (THX)."
1389,7,"Entertaining, but thats about it.","You'll notice on this title that it got a fairly good rating, and most of the reviews ecstatically blurt ""Incredible!!!"" ""The best!"" etc. While I respect other reviewers opinions, I don't believe that this title should have gotten such a good rating (Blade runner was also rated 8.2 and see how good it is). Here is a quick overview of the major pros and cons The good: CGI: Holy noodles, this is some of the best stuff I've seen. Everything looks great, and the areas are well designed Ewan Mcgregor: Yeah I know, his performance wasn't the epitome of flawless acting, but hey, he did was pretty good. Especially when Anakin was deep fried in the lava place. That was a touching scene."
1390,10,Because of Obi Wan,"Revenge of the Sith may not have the best acting, but it makes up for it everywhere else. The movie is a great improvement over the other prequels. Its story of Anakin's fall is incredible and a well thought out story. The music is stellar, thanks to John Williams. The CGI, at least for its time was great. Its lighsaber duels are emotional and well choreographed. The best part? Jar jar was barely in the movie!"
1391,10,Masterpiece!,My fav film. I'm on Anakin's side. He sacrificed himself for his loved ones.
1392,8,Revenge of the Lucas,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is action packed science fiction at its best. It is the sixth and final installment of the Star Wars saga that writer/director George Lucas started in 1977. It is the continuation of the story of Obi-Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor; Anakin Skywalker played by Hayden Christiensen, and Padme Amedala played by Natalie Portman. The story takes place three years after the last movie Attack of the Clones. It shows that the relationship between Anakin and Padme is going to become a major problem and that know one will be able to stop what is about to happen. The theme of Sith is the classic coming of age story with a very tragic twist. It shows the struggle young people have trying to come to grip with their true feelings with out considering the consequences of their action. George Lucas does a masterful job of allowing the viewer to feel the internal strife of Anakin and how he views Obi-Wan as a father figure. The problem with young people and father figures is that young people do not like to listen to them and when they do, they believe whatever they say is wrong. Anakin does find someone he can confide in. the problem is that senator Palpatine is that person. The Senator has a hidden agenda of wanting to rule the galaxy and the only way he can do it is by aligning himself with Anakin. Palpatine tells Anakin what he wants to hear in order to gain his trust. He tells Anakin that he is afraid for the future and that he needs his help by telling him ""I need your help son. I want you to be the eyes, ears, and voice of the republic"". This sounds great to Anakin since he feels that Obi-Wan is afraid to give him any responsibility. When Anakin and Palpatine are talking Lucas uses low-key lighting and shadowing to show that the discussions main point is dark and evil. Lucas perfects in Sith what he has been trying to do since 1977, perfect the art of special effects. Special effects have been around for a long time, however Lucas shows how CGI (Computer Generated Imaging) can put the viewer in the scene with the actors. The final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan on the lava planet Mustafar is spectacular. Lucas makes it feel as though it is a real place where the actors could have been in danger during filming. If it weren't for Lucas and his imagination and creativity we may never have seen the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or the amazing world of Avatar. By the end of the movie we see that Anakin like so many other troubled youth listen to the wrong people and ignore who they should be listening too. We see it in everyday life, lucky for us we do not have to worry about one of these kids turning into Darth Vader and taking over the galaxy. The most important thing to remember here is that Lucas once said that he did not care what critics thought of the acting in the films or how the films were made. He made them for himself and the fans enjoyment. And in this instance he succeeded."
1393,5,3 Very Good films and 3 Average films,I have just got back and I am left confused.
1394,10,Supern,"The emotion the acting and the memes make this film amazing. The cgi for the time is really good and for the most part looks really good. Seeing how Anakin goes to Darth Vader is convincing and is till shocking to this day, even though we know what happens. This film is well paced. There isn't alot of sitting and standing and alot more doing. But it still has some of the political stuff in there. But revenge of the Sith makes it exciting. And the best part is Jar Jar has one appearance in it, making it already better than the other sequels. This is also darker than any other star wars film which is needed for anakin turning to the dark side. As someone who isn't a huge star wars fan, I think this film is well worth the watch or rewatch."
1395,3,THE FORCE IS BACK!!!! (with me...),"Sure, compared to many other movies, this one doesn't deserve a 10."
1396,9,Tear dropping,"I actually did like Spielberg and dropped some tears. The movie was very touching, especially when Anakin showed the dark side of him, which converted him to Darth Vader. Not very many movies make me cry, but this did."
1397,2,Feel cheated? You should be.,"The only positive things to say about this ""film"" are that it is better than either of its two dire predecessors, and that Jar-Jar Binks is barely in it. At least Lucas has listened a little bit."
1398,4,Is that really the best you could do George?,"I feel cheated. It's as though I was promised something six years ago by George Lucas that he couldn't deliver. Worse than that, he didn't even try very hard."
1399,10,Perfect!!,"Beautiful. Epic. Did I mention perfect? I usually rant on and on about a film, but this one speaks for itself."
1400,1,Boring.,"Its a first! My entire family was bored stiff. Lucas has to phone the directing in as he cannot possibly have seen the wooden expressions of his actors. The story and script could have been written on the back of a cereal packet with toe curling opening lines from Skywalker and Kenobi. It really doesn't do the actors any good credit wise as they clearly only participate for the paychecks. Ewan and Natalie managed to inject a minute amount of personality into their roles and struggled manfully with the thinest narrative structure I have ever witnessed, The fight scenes were meaningless and interminable with Hayden whatshisname putting on this bizarre Lauren Bacall (The Look) expression throughout. He makes Orlando Bloom look like L.Olivier and thats saying something."
1401,9,The best of the new trilogy - not a hard task it is.,"Maybe its just me..but i thought that episode 3's script isn't just tight enough. and sometimes some of the action scenes seemed a little too much on the eyes. Also the ""loose strings"" from the other episodes seemed a little tacked on. I also thought that NOT all the loose threads were tied up. however on the plus side, ROTS was still highly enjoyable. some of the scenes may offend the lesser de-sensitised of us, and it was good to see that Mr. LUCAS didn't hold back as much as he could have. Recommended, this movie is. 5*****."
1402,6,Better...but still not as good as the original trilogy,"Plain and simple, there was just not enough here to make it better than the originals. Yes, there are plenty of battles, and special effects in every shot, but as has been well understood by now, the dialog and acting are most horrible and truly draw away from some otherwise good ideas. You can tell that Lucas was trying to actually write something that would live up the expectations, but what it comes down to is Anikan's transition to the dark side was muddled and really too fast for me to believe. He started the movie appreciating his master and trying to be a good guy, and by the end he really plunges. Perhaps this is the effect of the dark side, and we are just not in the know, but it was just unsettling how he turned, and not in a cool way. This was also aided by the actor's failure to really try and bring true passion (as they all did) into the character."
1403,3,The worst of the Star Wars films,"I came to Episode 3 full of hope. After two less than brilliant entries into the franchise, I thought mistakes would be fixed, ideas freshened and all loose ends tied up. I was wrong. I have seen better story lines in video games and professional wrestling, only they come with more interesting characters. "
1404,10,The Force is strong with this one..,"A few weeks ago I was very pleased to see that George Lucas his astonishing ending of the greatest film saga in the history of cinema made it to the so well known TOP 250. Like many people I'm a great fan of the original saga, with super heroes like Luke and Han, and a very evil bad - guy called Darth Vader. As a little boy, there was no greater joy than watching the original films with my friends and peers. Years passed since Darth Vader died in The Return of the Jedi, and it was back in 1999 when we Star Wars fans were introduced with a totally new empire of friends and foes like Jar Jar and the terrible Gungan-king called Boss Nass and we met strange new planets like Naboo and Coruscant. But the most terrible thing about the Phantom Menace was a little boy called Jake Lloyd, who in a way spoiled the entire movie. The prequel, Attack of the Clones was a hell of a lot better with living legend Christopher Lee, but it was still nothing compared to the old saga. Until 2005 when the Force was finally brought in balance with this superb film. The film really sums it all up, like most people say, and the scene of the real birth of Sith - Lord Darth Vader should be considered as one of the greatest moments in motion picture history... The whole scene is just so completely tragic, but also so very beautiful: When the mask comes down, and the heavy breathing starts for the very first time, it really sends so much shivers down my spine. Shivers I also felt watching heroic battles in A New Hope or in The Empire Strikes Back: The saga is now finally complete."
1405,6,An end to the saga,"For someone who has seen all the films in the series, as almost all who have seen but one will ave done by now, it is very obvious that this one uses the most computer graphics. Some easy to spot CGI effects are in such scenes as when Anakin and Obi are on the rocks floating on the lava. It is quite easy to see that there is an over-use of effects. However, it is interesting to see a Lucas film made entirely in Australia. i even recognised music from a old time carnival organ in one scene. The real organ is actually in the powerhouse museum in Sydney. However i would have to say that the main thing the film does is answer questions. It was, as i think, a rather sloppy end to what was a jolly good saga. 6 stars is my vote, since i did enjoy some scenes and the general plot of things."
1406,3,Somewhere in the Middle,Enough time has passed since this movie premiered. By now it made it's producers happy and still is by making money out of merchandise and what not else.
1407,9,May the fun be with you,WARNING TO PARENTS: This not a movie for children under 10. They would most likely be perturbed by the movie.
1408,,"To Quote Darth Vadar ""Noooooooooooooooo""","I am a BIG fan of the original trilogy, all of which are fantastic. You can watch Star Wars for the 100th time and still enjoy it."
1409,7,The Circle is now complete,"This is not Lucas' finest, but after seeing what he had to offer for the first of the prequels, that is still an improvement. George Lucas insisted and insisted that he put nine hours a day into writing this film, and wanted a really great product for Star Wars fans to bid farewell to the saga with. Does it match up to original trilogy? No. Is is still worth seeing? Yes. Is it worth seeing several times? I would say so. It answers the most important questions to lead into episode IV. It definitely has some excellent action sequences, combined with eye-popping visuals. And unlike past Star Wars films, Lucas does not make the visual extraneous. They are all over the place, but still solid. The major downfall of this film is the characters. The truth is that you just need Luke, Han and Leia to truly make Star Wars Star Wars. The characters in all the prequels including this one just go through the motions. Compare Padme to Leia. Leia is strong, and fights for the common good with devotion and love for humanity. An occasional smart-Alec line decorates her still loyal determination to the rebellion. Padme is basically in love with Anakin in this film still, and just naively lets Anakin decay into Darth Vader. She is constantly asking him to be more honest with her about everything, and just sits back and worries. Leai would join thfight. Padme just waits around and worries. I was worried she was gonna get suckered into suffering Anakin's fate. At least she has some sense. Yes, you do feel sad when Anakin becomes Darth Vader. It is is especially sad from the perspective of Obi-Wan, and even more so from the perspective of Padme. But I never really felt a great attachment to their romance entering the film, so there was not enough to feel. Still, Natalie Portman does her most with Padme. Not bad for a girl who admittedly grew up, hating Star Wars. Ewan McGregor is definitely Obi-Wan. Everythng about Obi-Wan you envision is in Ewan McGregor. There is a look of loyalty and devotion. And you know he is a character who is determined to preserving the good for all the galaxy. Hayden Crhistansen has shown he knows how to act. He is better off playing a dark, angry, and nearly insane character than he is at playing a winy teenager. And the ways in which you see Chancellor Palpatine seduce Anakin without him even knowing it is eerily appealing. The weakest character was General Grievous. And then, you have Yoda. He becomes interesting at then when he leaves, realizing that he has failed the Jedi council with Anakin, but he is mainly just a pawn in the film. He was exciting to watch fight, but was bland theatrically. There's no other way of putting it. In short though, all the characters just interact with each other to the minimal use. There is no real rapport you feel with with any of them. The action and visual effects were the best in this film. All the shots on Coruscant, Kashyyk, and in space were fabulous. Just give me some more lightsaber duals. The oh so anticipated dual between Obi-Wan and Anakin may not meet up to everyone's expectations, but how could it with that much hype? I mean the dual was quite intense though. The lava sequence, which ends in Anakin almost melting is truly awesome. And it does not get so ghoury, that they are trying to make this a PG-13 movie. The most disappointing fight was between Cont Dooku and Anakin/ Ob-Wan at the beginning. I won't spoil the film with details, but it lacked energy. That is the most I will say. All the battles in the fighters are solid. Do not expect ti be like those in the original trilogy. The republic has some new surprises to use. All in all, the film works. It is not to be classified alongside the original trilogy. Whatever happens, those were three remarkable pieces of film-making that will never be replicated. The force was stronger than ever with George from 1977-1983. But don't let that say that he can not still make a good movie. And now Lucas, I say bring on Indiana Jones IV."
1410,9,A brilliant end to the Star War legend,"I'm not going to analyze everything that happened in this film -- there are a lot of folk out there who will do that just fine. What I do want to do is point out something that everyone else seems to be missing. Something that takes this film out of the ordinary space opera genre, and should make it immortal."
1411,1,Oh dear,This movie sucks sorry watched it the other day every character is wooden christopher Lee lasts about 10 seconds in it before he is killed the enemy robots sucks as they always get killed there leader has a cough and he looks geriatric and don't see the point him to be honest I'll think I'll just stick to the original 3
1412,1,"Just like Episodes 1 and 2, Utter Garbage","I don't even know what to say. Its hard to believe that the man who brought us Episodes 4, 5, and 6 is the same man who made 1, 2, and 3. He has a lot more technology now to work with and the prequels still fail in comparison. I cant believe I spent my hard earned money on this garbage and wasted over 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. The only positive thing I can say about Revenge of the Sith and the other two prequels was when the end credits began to roll. This movie right here is an example of why piracy is becoming such a problem. If Hollywood didn't spew out this kind of trash, maybe people would be happy to start paying for their movies again."
1413,6,"Should be named The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","The overlapping idea here is that it doesn't suck. I breathed a great sigh of relief when it didn't turn out to be anything like Attack of the Clones (THE WORST STAR WARS FILM), but it also isn't incredible. Its not near on par with the OT which everyone hoped. This movie is unfairly heralded as the return to form for George Lucas which it is not. The script once again is terrible. Sometimes the CG is overboard, and the acting in this movie FROM EVERY ACTOR is far less than perfect. Though Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, and Ian McDiarmid all have strong moments."
1414,10,whats going on???,"Firstly who is master cipher diaz?? and also what a stupid was of naming the babies?? and i also feel that George Lucas is the King of one liner resolutions! millions of fans were so excited about the destruction of the jedi and rise of the empire. I felt it was rushed and no much thought went into it. How do all the droids go and how does he put together the empire, it doesn't just happen, we as fans need to know, this was episode 2 1/2 not 3. When Anakin goes into the Jedi temple, what is right. We don't see the conflict, the pain, the anger, it was a bit rushed and this was one of the most importing themes in the film. Rescuing Palpatine was more thought out than that! So sad, what a waste of 3 years of waiting."
1415,10,a Perfect Mythic Movie.,"A perfect 10! As is ""LOTR,"" a mythic masterpiece."
1416,9,An Epic Tragedy,"Revenge of the Sith is an epic tragedy a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.<br /><br />Anakin Skywalker, who saw nightmares of his mother in pain before she died in his arms, sees nightmares of his wife Padme dying in childbirth and makes a deal with the devil, which destroys the galaxy. Ian Mcdiarmid's portrayal of Palpatine sends shivers down my spine. The battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan on Mustafar is the best choreographed and most emotionally compelling swordfight in cinematic history. John Williams' score is unsurpassed."
1417,4,28 years too finish an excellent original trilogy with poop.. poor Lucas,"First off the 7 is ONLY for the action and the wicked sabre fights. I was looking forward to this, hoping the third would fix it all up, tie up loose ends with what the first two movies screwed up.. But noooooo, the plotz holes are even bigger even a man of my girth could trip thru. Anakin and padme are like two 3rd grade students acting. *Shakes head*They should be expelled, neither are very good actors in any sense. The only actor who was great was Ewan, he was Obi-wan. Grievious is a laugh only in the way he died. What a sad state of affairs. Now as a personal note to Lucas, from an original die hard fan.. What happened to you man, you had this idea for over 30 years, and you can not even fix the plot holes??? I am no writer but I certainly could of fixed it up, instead of bowing to the need of wimping into marketing. Jar jar, Ewoks, Annakin as whiny little kid, Luke and Leia being brother and sister. Horrible shoddy work, you should of let someone else at the controls, and you to sit back and watch the money roll in, I am glad i did not pay for the viewing, I had a movie pass."
1418,8,You Can't Fault ROTS For Continuity Issues (Personal Review),"Allow me to preface this comment with a general opinion of the film--great. Not perfect, but great."
1419,1,Star Wars fans need some perspective,I can only shake my head when I see review after review on IMDb giving this film a 10/10 rating. Did all of you slip into a comma and have a wonderful dream and wake up thinking you watched a spectacular film? I am beside myself to explain how ANYONE could rate this film even 5/10.
1420,10,I am the Senate...................*spoilers*,"If only Lucas didn't cut the scenes where the theme of ""compassion"" leading to eternal consciousness, Yoda telling Luke that the dark side isn't stronger in Empire would have had a whole lot more meaning. Dark all through out save for some comic relief such as Yoda almost being hit by laser fire as he watches the ground battle from above in Kashyyk, Artoo torching the battle droids and what Yoda does to the Red Guards before he confronts Sidious."
1421,7,I'd hug George Lucas tight if I could!!!!!,"IMO After ep# 4 this is the best Star Wars movie I've ever seen. It strikes the perfect balance: action, more coherent politics, gorgeous scenery and Padme's preggo wardrobe. Another observation on Padme fashion: every hairstyle Portman wears in this I was thinking: ""Niiicee, wish I had enough hair to wear that""; ""How did they do it""? She looks way better in the ""iconic"" Leia Organa double bun hairstyle."
1422,1,A Steady Decline in Scriptwriting,"Duelling, dueling, dueling, over a sea of lava? Remember the charm of the first Star Wars movie? The market scenes, the buddy stuff, the rapid-fire conversations with three or more persons exchanging conflicting views or anticipating the next crisis? The long suspension of threat as in the garbage disposal scene in the first movie? And no boring, illogical, laser fights? All gone into history. Now, clichéd dialog and endless battle scenes. The exploration and conflict of ideas is given two or three minutes, and though the actors try their best, fundamental changes happen too fast. More script on talk, and less on action. Please. I say (in many contexts) action is boring, talk is interesting. And Yoda was so out of character that I thought Lucas must have had nothing to do with the film. A great embarrassment, and a candidate for the worst movie ever made, especially against the background of some great ones earlier. Other reviewers who rated this film low have pointed out many more defects. Peter Morgan"
1423,3,It's Paradise Lost-in-Space--And You Won't Care About Any of Them,"If you've seen the documentaries on the three-DVD release of the first three films, then you know that Lucas invested a lot of time researching the works of Joseph Campbell, the great 20th-century folklorist who was responsible for the concept of the monomyth, among other Jungian interpretations of human legend. As such, Lucas' failure to achieve even the most rudimentary tasks of tragedy in this film (which--by all accounts--is staged, presented and deserves to be an epic tragedy--Paradise Lost-in-Space) is utterly confounding, considering the attention he obviously gave in the attempt to make this film conform to those archetypal themes. To begin with, he does not clearly establish Anakin's greatness. There's a big battle at the beginning, and he does some heroic things, but there is no real sense that he is ""bigger than life"" as such a character must be. How can his fall be great unless we see how far he has to fall? Lucas half-heartedly attempts to ""tell"" us that in the brief banter between Obi Wan and Anakin when they arrive back at the Senate, but he fails in the attempt. Also, there is very little to make the audience feel that his love for Padme is so intense that he is willing to do anything to save her--or that his pride is so great that he's willing to use that as an excuse to sell his soul. Sure, we know his mother died, and he killed all of the sandpeople in his anger, but we're left to assume that this is in some way related to his feelings for Padme because Lucas devotes no screen time to showing us this in any tangible way. Furthermore, it is a complete mystery how the senator can actually be Darth Sidious and the Jedi are in such a cloud about that, and perhaps most confounding of all, why Lucas didn't even imply that such a powerful being might have been plotting all along to do so; wouldn't it make sense that he's the one causing Anakin's nightmares? Why not imply that? As a result, Sidious' seduction of Anakin seems like an afterthought--sort of a ""Well, Count Dooku's dead. Who's gonna be my new gopher?"" As such, the audience has no connection with Anakin that allows us to feel his struggle. Why??? Nothing changed when Sidious slaughtered Mace Windu. Why Anakin would keep Windu from killing Sidious because of the Jedi code one minute and kneel and pledge himself to the dark side the next minute is completely unjustified--not to mention the fact that he is then immediately capable of going to the Jedi temple and slaughtering children without a second thought. Because there is no justification for his fall, the ""slaughter of the innocents"" (another archetypal theme) isn't loaded with any emotional force--we don't really care. We don't care that Padme dies of a broken heart, we don't care that Vader screams ""NO!"" when he finds out, we just don't care because Lucas doesn't give us any human facet to the story to grab hold of on an emotional level. The most emotionally-delivered line of the movie comes from Obi Wan who, after cutting off Anakin's legs, says, ""I loved you like a brother."" He has tears in his eyes, but he just watches Anakin slide down close enough to the lava to catch fire--but then doesn't bother to put him out of his misery. Yeh, that's a brother for ya."
1424,9,The best prequel movie!,"Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith It has been three years since the Clone Wars began. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General Grievous, the commander of the droid armies, but Grievous escapes. This is my favourite out of the prequel movies and just like all the prequel movies it has great shots! Everything is colourful and the CGI is so good especially the opening space battle. Tho I think the dialogue falls flat a little and the scenes between Anakin and Padmé are so awkward. The movie has so many rememberable quotes! Hayden Christensen does a better job playing Anakin in this one but there are some scenes he could have done better in. Frank Oz is still amazing as Yoda. Natalie Portman is perfect as Padmé she shows off her emotions perfectly. Ewan McGregor is one of the best parts of the movie playing Obi-Wan to perfection. Ian McDiarmid was the best part of the movie playing Palpatine so menacing and showing off how smart he was though out the hole prequel movie. Overall this has to be the best prequel movie but could have been better."
1425,5,Not a Disaster but also not a Triumph,"I have never been a die hard fan of the original series maybe because I didn't actually see Episodes 5 and 6 at the cinema, the impact might not be as big watching on a TV screen. I did like Ep 6 and it was fun but not some seminal cinematic experience. So, I didn't have such high expectation going into the prequels. I thought Ep 1 and 2 were also fun but nothing spectacular. Like many action movies, they dazzle your senses while watching but the emotions behind it are so insubstantial that they hardly register afterward. I came to see Ep 3 after having read two glowing reviews from New York Times and Roger Ebert and I went in thinking it'd be good. I didn't go in with the heightened expectation that many turn fans have. And so I wasn't as disappointed as many were. Unfortunately, I was still bored through the first two-thirds of the movie. Lucas seems to have a pathological need to saturate every frame of the movie w/ too many visual stimuli. Everything is so busy that left my head spinning. I'm a little surprised that it has 7.9 rating here. Hardly worth that high mark but neither is it a 1 or 2 as many have given it. There seems to be no middle ground here. Either you hate it or love it for fans of the series. I totally concur w/ the other reviewers on the problems that plague this movie: bad acting, stiled dialog, truncated storyline, instant transition of Anakin from good to evil, etc. etc. All valid."
1426,9,Humanising Lord Vader,"Finally a prequel that is effective. Return of the Sith not only makes a satisfying bridge into the A New Hope/The Empire Strikes Back/Return of the Jedi storyline, but in an important way also changes it substantially."
1427,9,A disturbing but refreshing end to the greatest scifi series of all time,"I have seen Revenge of the Sith hundreds of times and have never grown old of the movie. Suprisgnly enough I got tired of watching Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace, but Revenge of The Sith I can't seem to get enough of it's like a good Cd it just get better with each listen or viewing."
1428,5,The Sith hits the fan,I pity Natalie Portman for the inevitable comparisons between her and Princess Leia. Leia had a much more active role and her relationship with Han Solo provided most of the laughs in the original Star Wars trilogy. Apparently Harrison Ford got on her tits (metaphor) and that was why they worked together so well on screen.
1429,8,"Why Ep:III was very very good, and why some don't quite get it.","I give it an 8-of-10, because of a some random moments of weak dialogue and the fact that G.L. could have had Sidious easily given Anakin a new ""ceremonial"" red saber once he became Vader (thus, making his duel with Obi Wan slightly less blurred and frenzied-looking)."
1430,10,"George Lucas ends his prequel trilogy and says farewell to his Star Wars saga with emotion in his heart, and a lightsaber in his hand.","George Lucas is a storyteller, and he has done what few storytellers have accomplished. He has created his own world and mythology and has told an epic tale in his own universe. A few Examples of this are J.R.R. Tolkien with his Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and J.K Rowling with her Harry Potter Saga. In Lucas's last prequel and Star Wars film, ""Revenge of the Sith"" he shows us what has been in his mind for over thirty years, and does it with emotion and brilliant visuals. Lucas has completed and brought us a true space opera, and it's name is Star Wars. When the first Star Wars film (which was actually the fourth chapter of the saga) came out, it showed the audience something they have never seen before. It blew peoples minds away, and gave a boat load of possibilities to the art of film. It was like your average 1950s serial pumped on steroids. "
1431,10,"Possibly the best ""Star Wars"" movie","""The Revenge of the Sith"" is, I believe, the best movie in the entire series, full with fascinating characters, breathtaking visual effects and a complex and interesting plot. Hayden Christensen redeemed himself after mediocre performance in ""Attack of the Clones"" - here is excellent as the falling hero Anakin Skywalker, future Darth Vader. Ewan McCregor is also very good as the coolest Obi-Wan Kenobi in the whole series and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine), the arch-villain of the series is terrific. The fights between Jedi and Sith in the movie are terrific, but what is the best in this movie is the atmosphere - you feel the impending doom and sometimes the sadness of story chokes you like Vader himself! Overall, a great movie, a must for every fan of fantasy and science fiction."
1432,10,Emotional and fantastic,"The final installment for the pre-Luke Skywalker trilogy, this movie DOES NOT FALL OFF MY EXPECTATIONS. I even think this is the best of the series, because of its nice story and great effects."
1433,3,"This Is The Best Of The Trilogy, Huh?","The acting ranges from passable to Neil Breen levels of bad, the dialogue is so cringeworthy to the point where it's almost laughable, the story is stupid and barely makes any sense, the characters are so devoid of personality and emotion most of the time that they all act like robots which makes it hard to relate or care about them, Samuel L. Jackson is miscast, there is absolutely no tension or suspense, the CGI (while some of it still holds up) is overused to the point where the film comes off as lazy and soulless, most of the film consists of mind numbing action sequences, exposition dumps and boring space politics and I'd argue about 90% of the film could be skipped over and you'd probably miss nothing."
1434,6,Not a Major Improvement From The First 2 Movies,"As a young fan and first-time Star Wars movie watcher, I was drawn in through The Mandalorian and my friend who is a major Star Wars geek and raved about the Star Wars lore. He suggested the chronological order: I, II, Clone Wars movie + TV series, III, etc. From what he's told me, there are some canon comics and non-canon TV show that were released before Revenge of the Sith and that this movie was more of a fan service."
1435,1,A predictable waste of time where CGI is the star of the movie!,"Yet another chapter in the Star Wars Trilogy that showcases the CGI, not the story. I did not care one iota about any of the characters, Lucas even managed to make me hate R2D2!! Yoda's inability to speak just becomes truly irritating. The dialogue was predictable and there were absolutely no surprises. (There are enough holes in the story to fly a Star Destroyer through) George Lucas still insists on sticking it to us and putting in Jar Jar, but at least it wasn't a speaking part! I am taking the time to write this to tell you to save your money. He already has my money from Phantom and Attack of the Clones and now he has it for this special effects fest. At least in the original Star Wars Trilogy you felt a connection to the characters,in the latest three the CGI is the star and the characters and story suffers for it. I didn't think he could do a movie worse than Phantom Menace, guess I was wrong."
1436,9,I loved it. It was thoughtful and fun. Vader is a complex villain we sympathize with.,"Vader is a complex villain we sympathize with. I liked almost everything about this movie. From the action packed opening scene to the tortured soul of Ankin as he toils with loyalty to his wife and loyalty to the state. This movie delivers real ethical dilemmas. The weakness of this movie is that there is so much action and plot that the emotional connections are not well explored -- So no acting Oscars, but my rating system gives extra points for ambition and operatic sweep."
1437,5,Way overrated,"I was really surprised to see that the average rating for this film was 8.3 after more than 20,000 votes had been posted. More than half of voters gave it the full 10 stars! I can't believe that 10,000 people thought that there was nothing wrong with this film. The only thing it has got going for it is great special effects, some of the best I've ever seen, but what about dialogue, acting or plot."
1438,5,Mixed Emotions,"Wow. I don't really know quite how to review a film that serves as the ultimate culmination of my childhood fantasies, when I used to run around the backyard with a blue-painted broom handle imagining what it was like when the Jedi ruled the galaxy ""before the dark times,"" wondering what the circumstances were that led a noble Knight of the Republic to become the most feared baddie in the galaxy. Now I know, or at least I know how Goerge Lucas imagined it all going down."
1439,7,"my review of Star Wars III, Revenge of the Sith","I must admit that I am not a die hard Star Wars fan, but I had to go and see the third movie on the day that it came out, because my son who is 13 wanted to see it so badly. I will tell you this much: after seeing the movie, I went and bought the digitally remastered CD set of the first trilogy, and watched it from the beginning to the end. Now the last confrontation between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader becomes so meaningful, while I thought that their fight in episode IV was so primitive compared to their fight in the final moments of episode III, which was very nicely done by the way. The movie had me think so long and hard, and it has been a long time since a movie had me think so much."
1440,4,Why do so many rate this movie 10/10?,"A 10/10 rating means this movie cannot be improved upon. This is the sort of score that should be reserved for the Godfather, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and perhaps Star Wars Episode VI. The majority of reviewers seem to be blinded by the special effects and the reputation of this prequel and do not seem to understand that the acting, particularly of Ewan MacGregor, is hopelessly sub-par. There is no emotion or involvement in any of the principle actors. Whether this is the fault of a poor script or the fault of Christiansen, MacGregor and Portman it is hard to tell. I noticed this especially when MacGregor discovers that Anakin, a man he has devoted most of his recent life to training, is a sith lord. The level of surprise and shock that he must feel is barely discernibleto the audience. And don't get me started on his appalling excuse for a accent. I can only assume that American viewers are unable to hear the ridiculous bastardised Scottish nuances in it. However, Darth Vaders first few breaths were magical (until he says Padme - a name that just cant be said in a deep voice) and Ian McDamuid's performance was powerful and impressive. Samuel L Jackson was also impressive, doing much with the little he had to work with."
1441,8,And so the prequels go out with a bang...,"Man oh man. Lucas and company have done the unexpected, which was pull off a near masterpiece to salvage the prequels and perhaps the entire Star Wars franchise as a whole among its deepest fans, which I consider myself to be."
1442,8,Awesome !!,"You know what ? I agree with all those who dislike this movie. I agree on all the flaws you point out with such care. Yes, there's a considerable amount of cheesy lines. Yes, there's occasional bad (very bad) acting. Yes, the Jedi might have go down too easily. But you know what ? I don't care ! Because if you're willing to let those little glitches slide, you will realize that this movie is simply awesome. I loved Anakin's transformation, I loved the whole idea and execution of Order 66, and most of all, I loved the final duel between Obi-Wan and Ana.. sorry, Darth Vader ! I loved seeing Vader expressing his hatred for his master as he was burning alive, and I loved screaming with tears in his eyes - ""You were my brother Anakin"" ! That was just powerful, just what I've been expecting."
1443,7,"Spectacular closure for the prequels, but it's not perfect.","As a good closure, the film seems to focus all its efforts on being a spectacular story, with visually appealing images and lots of action. Events predictably go where we all know they will happen, so what we are offered here is to know the path of the journey and not the final destination."
1444,10,This is the best Star Wars movie yet!,"I went to see this movie at 6:30 last night, it was the best 2 hours of my life! From the beginning where Annakin and Obi-Wan face people like General Grevious and Count Dooku, to where they face each other. George Lucas obviously listened to his fans and got rid of the boring politics and the infamous Jar Jar Binks. This is the best looking movie out there on the market, you can tell how much we have advanced in technology. My recommendation is to go see this! I promise that it will not disappoint! But if your taking little ones, you might want to cover their eyes on some parts, but those scenes are necessary to really get the mood the way it needs to be. I will at least see this another 4-5 times, and be first in line to get it on DVD!"
1445,10,Best of the Prequels and second only to Episode V,"I've been a Star Wars fan for what seems like an eternity. I absolutely adore Episode IV, V and VI, and I also enjoyed Episode I and II, despite their flaws. So one can guess I was excited when I went to cinema on May 18 this year. First, I was a little undecided on what to think of it, but after the second viewing, I can just say: the saga ends with a bang! I guess everyone knows the story by now, so only a few words about it. The movie takes place 3 years after the end of Episode II and the beginning of the Clone War. We're at the climax of the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists, with a space battle in which Anakin and Obi Wan try to save the abducted Chancellor Palpatine. After his rescue, we witness the conflict between Palpatine and the Jedi as well as Anakin's role in all this. So much for the story. Of course it's getting more complex as the plot thickens, but I take it everyone knows that it ends with the rise of the Empire and the downfall of Anakin Skywalker. What makes Episode III such a great experience, why is it simply the movie of the year and one of the best of all time - in my opinion? There are several reasons, and I'll start with the CGI. Of course, one can expect ILM to create incredible special effects, but with Episode III they have outdone themselves. They're creating whole creatures, soldiers, landscapes and even worlds out of nothing, and everything looks so stunning. The landscape of Mustafar, the different worlds on which the Jedi are murdered during the ""Order 66"" sequence or the opening space battle are so full of beautiful details that it's a joy to watch. Every single frame contains an undeniable beauty, and in fact Episode III is perhaps the visually most stunning movie of all time. This time, ILM also has created some unbelievably realistic CGI-creatures. Yoda looks now much more like his Episode V equivalent, and General Grievous as well as his Magna-Droid bodyguards are not only impressively detailed and textured, but also show how good the interaction between human actors and CGI creatures can be, something you can see in Ewan McGregor's fight scene with Grievous and the magna droids. It looks stunning, and I give a lot of credit to Ewan and the ILM crew for creating such complex fights. The action and lightsaber fights are magnificent and above anything we've seen this year, whether it is the breathtaking opening space battle or the dramatic final duel between Anakin and Obi Wan. In the field of sound and music, Episode III surpasses all expectations. The sound effects are clear and cool as always, no much news here. But John Williams' score is near perfection. Not only does it bridge the gap between the Prequels and the OT in a marvelous way, but it also shows the drama of Anakin Skywalker with sheer beauty. Hearing some pieces really brings tears to my eyes. So in the technical field, Star Wars Episode III fully succeeds. But what about story and characters? They're great, really. I already mentioned that the storyline gets more complex during the running time as the Clone Wars end, the Republic falls and Anakin turns to the Dark Side. You really should have seen the other movies in order to understand everything. What's so great about the story is the fact that it leads into Episode IV almost perfectly, almost every single question a fan could have asked is answered. The story also succeeds because of the actors. Yes, you heard that right. The actors in Star Wars are terribly underrated, and I don't know why. They all get the job done, and some are stealing the show with stellar performances. Ewan McGregor was great in Episode I & II, he was always the perfect Obi Wan, but in this one, he's even better. You can really see the sadness Obi Wan feels because of Anakin's betrayal; McGregor does a great job portraying that. Hayden Christensen was heavily criticized for his acting in Episode II, although he did well back then. In Episode III, he manages to play the complex character of Anakin in a believable way, we can really understand his reasons for his actions. Natalie Portman wasn't that important in this one, and she's not that great, slightly above average. The supporting actors are also quite good, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Jimmy Smits and Frank Oz get the job done with ease. But the real star in this movie is Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine/Darth Sidious. His acting is outrageously brilliant, especially in the scenes where he is trying to lure Anakin to the Dark Side. He obviously enjoys being in the spotlight, and his performance is even better than the one he provided us with in Return of the Jedi. The dialogues are mostly okay, nothing to complain about, except for some exchanges between Anakin and Padmé. Episode III is, as George Lucas mentioned, really a dark film. The atmosphere is sometimes depressing, as the end of the movie is already clear: everything is lost, we can only wait for the new hope in Episode IV. And some scenes portray this mood perfectly: I'll just say Order 66, a masterpiece thanks to Lucas' direction, Williams' music and ILM's work, and it will certainly make you cry. There are also some scenes unfit to be seen by a younger audience, like Anakin's fate on Mustafar. All in all, Lucas has created a worthy final for the Star Wars saga, and thanks to Episode III, Star Wars will go down in cinematic history as the greatest saga ever. Thank you for all the years of fun and excitement, Mr. Lucas!"
1446,8,best movie of the year!!!,I will start off with saying that I'm a huge fan if the two previous prequels although they lacked the flare and greatness of the originals which are some of my favourite movies of all time from the very start of this movie i could see that i was in for a breathtaking adventure and that was even before the first bits of dialogue the cgi just takes your breath away Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen are equally brilliant in this movie all I can say is bravo George Lucas .
1447,2,There needed to be balance...,"""It was you who would bring balance to The Force, not leave it in Darkness!"" -- That line is what I would love to say to George Lucas. There is no balance in this big budget phenomenon and we are left in darkness. Lucas drops the scale and does what he feels like. There is no balance to this installment; so don't seek it. Writing and acting were a few ideas that must have crossed the director's mind at some point, but never quite entered his brain or even the screen for that matter."
1448,6,"Megablasts, Robots and A Chewie Cameo Do Not A Good Finale Make",Boom! Boom! Boom! Blast! Blast! Blast! Repeat a zillion times with lots of robots and spaceships obscuring the audience's view of the main performers seems to have been the formula here! 
1449,10,easily superior to the latest two films and on par with the quality of the originals,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith reviewed by Sam Osborn
1450,3,The force (and the prequels) can have a strong influence on the weak minded,"""A special effect is a tool, a means of telling a story. A special effect without a story is a really boring thing"""
1451,10,One of my favorite movies.,"Well, what can I say about Star Wars other than totally fantastic!!! The plot was amazing and I love the way George Lucas directed the movie. Ehen Anikin Skywalker(Hayden Christinsen) kills the one true love of his life Padme Amedila(Natile Portmen) the movie reaches heights that I don't think can ever be reached by any other movie. Also, the visual effects in the movie are outrageously awesome. But, George Lucas didn't go overboard which was a very good thing."
1452,10,The best of all Episodes !,"I'm a fan of the second trilogy by George Lucas (Episodes I, II, III) more than the first one. And in the second trilogy, the third Episode is the best."
1453,10,"Vader, Raging against Death, unable to accept the loss of those he loves","How could sweet Anakin (Jake LLoyd), that you just want to adopt and make his world better, turn bad, thats what struck me after seeing ""The Phantom Menace""."
1454,9,Return of the Star Wars,"Revenge of the Sith have surpass my expectation and is zillion times better than Episode I & II. (I'm not exaggerating.) I can't deny that the story here are much more solid and refine than I thought, very touching story, yet very powerful in its own ways. The ways and the reason Anakin turn into Darth Vader was beyond imagination."
1455,8,The Crown Jewel of the Prequels,"Far and away the best of the prequel trilogy and a very solid action movie even when viewed outside of the Star Wars franchise. The dialogue is less cheesy than Clone Wars and the acting is better than the previous two, but where Revenge of the Sith really shines is in its almost unceasing action and meaningful scenes. There is lots of fighting in the movie which is a lot of fun, but the scenes between Anakin and Palpatine are among some of the films best, and while Anakin's turn does seem abrupt, the legwork was there to make it feel genuine rather than forced."
1456,10,Best of the prequels,"TPM was a tough watch but not that bad, AOC was a tad better. Outdated CGI and the forced love story kind of put the movies down.<br /><br />Revenge if the Sith however, blew me away. None of the bad was present. Sure it has some flaws, like a slow mid-act but this movie is very solid and somewhat dark."
1457,10,A Rollicking Fun Space Opera,---major spoiler warning---
1458,2,"Almost as good as ""Showgirls""","I just saw Star Wars last night at 12:01am and I wanted to vent about it. It was TERRIBLE! Probably the worst movie ever next to ""Showgirls"" (if you have not seen ""Showgirls"" I'll let you borrow it). The lame love story and the lame plot just made for a totally lame evening for me. The boring exposition (which is the same exposition from the other five movies) took up 3/4 of the film and made me want to jam my head into a garbage disposal. It completely contradicted the original three movies and it was about as ""dark"" as white on rice on a paper plate in a snowstorm. About 30 minutes into this wreck I just wished that they shut the movie off and replaced it with a showing of ""Batman Forever"". So, for all of you Star Wars fiends out there who were awaiting some cosmic ending that will blow your socks off, do yourselves a favor and wear sandals to this one because the only blowing came directly from the movie. In fact, the only foul wind that I got last night, besides the movie of course, is the rotten milk stench from 2 guys who have obviously been bathing in cat urine over the last month. The movie was a complete disappointment and should be shunned by the SiFi community instead of being applauded the way it was last night. The only ""force"" out last night was me forcing back the vomit during the kindergarten love scenes which were obviously written by a sixty year old man who has struck out with every woman that he has ever met. George Lucas has to be stopped! He has taken a classic franchise and turned it into trash. With his overuse of CGI and bad actors, the films have become high budget B movies that make the Toxic Avenger look like Citizen Kane. He should either retire or start making women in prison flicks. Thank you for your time... have a great summer."
1459,6,Exhausting,"When I was a kid, I loved the first two Star Wars movies (well, Episodes I and II), because they came out when I was at the prime age to enjoy them. I saw those entries multiple times in theaters, watched them dozens of times at home, and was obsessive about collecting toys, books, what have you. By the time this third film came out I was growing... exhausted. I saw this film once in theaters, once more when I bought it on DVD, and I watched it for the third time last night, and you know what? I still find this movie exhausting. Rewatching these prequel films has been sort of a reminder of how great special entries in the Star Wars franchise like ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Last Jedi"" really can be. I am a much bigger fantasy fan than I am a sci-fi fan, but I still do enjoy some entries of the Star Wars franchise. The prequels aren't great, but they have inventive moments, a few cool scenes of action, and, though it pains me to admit it, watching them again fills me with a sense of nostalgia. Though I've spent the last week rewatching middling movies, I honestly don't think they are a total waste of time."
1460,9,"Sets up nicely for Episode 4...wait, there's already been one?","As someone else said about this film, there really can't be a spoiler, at least not on the broad plot developments, because it's obvious what has to happen. For me, I'd nearly rather see Jar Jar back again than see Hayden (get a new first name) Christiansen try to convey any feeling more deep than a recognition that Natalie Portman is not unattractive. This guy could not act his way through a prison break if the guards had left and all the doors were unlocked. He is truly dreadful. Forget poor little Jake Lloyd (his forebear as Anakin); kid was John Gielgud compared to the cardboard Christiansen. Anyway....not trying to pile on Christiansen, but he really does stand out (and not in a good way). All the same, the film is very enjoyable. Saw it soon after it was released in the theater and then saw it again on DVD with a friend yesterday. Just a wonderful wonderful film. Ewan McGregor I believe deserves particular kudos, as does the wonderfully evil character given Senator Palpatine by Ian McDiarmid. He is truly astonishing, breathtakingly slimy and devious. Sam Jackson is competent as always and Portman downplays her emotional pain very wisely as it only underscores her love for Anakin (in spite of his bad acting...sorry...) and sadness at his change; really, I'm sure there's not much else to be said about this film that hasn't been said by 2700 other people as of writing other than I must say that it seems that Anakin does flip rather quickly given his initial resistance to the attraction of the dark side. That is partially due to Christiansen, I believe, but also his part could have been better written to reveal his reservations. Other than that, I think Lucas has staged the film excellently and has achieved a near-perfect balance in his use of action and dialogue to propel the film. The variety of creatures are always pleasing to me as one can just see the animators and designers' brains working overtime. The scenery, the music, this really is a triumph for Lucas and his hard-working employees."
1461,9,Much better,Better than the other two prequels? Yes. Good as the holy trilogy? Not quite.
1462,2,"Why do the ""critics"" love this movie??",zzz ..... Oh wait the movie is over and I can wake up. This movie was horrible!! I can't tell you how many times I checked my watch. It is a sad ending to the original Star Wars movies.
1463,1,Steaming pile of Sith ** SPOILERS **,"**SPOILERS** For me the Revenge of the Sith had no heart. Within it, was supposed to be a love story and it was SOOOO weak in trying to show any kind of real feelings between anybody in the movie. Yes, he's going to the dark side to save her . . . but he looks more fascinated by that prospect than anything."
1464,2,"""If you're not with me, then you're my enemy!"" ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes!""","Finally caught this on PPV. As reams have been written about this final chapter, I'll be brief."
1465,8,War .. at last,**Warning! Spoiler Information Inside**
1466,1,Pathetic,"Just as bad as the other two pieces of crap Lucas made in recent years. Not quite as good as Howard the Duck. Turns Darth Vader into a laughable character. Terrible dialog, just as in the previous recent episodes. Attempts to throw in familiar characters and phrases as a means to connect with older movies. It does so by rushing at the end to tie up ""loose ends"". Other continuity problems are simply ignored. The previews for this film are highly misleading. Approximately 5 percent of the movie is good, the rest actually makes you angry that you spent money on this garbage. Lucas has burned fans a third time. I want my nine bucks back."
1467,,The Only Episode In Star Wars Prequel Trilogy That's Tolerable!,"Taking into consideration just how unbelievably insipid, downright detestable & excessively cartoonish both The Phantom Menace & Attack of the Clones were in all possible manners, the sixth instalment in the Star Wars saga & the final chapter of the prequel trilogy is a huge leap that exhibits massive improvements in various filmmaking aspects and is unreservedly the only prequel episode that's enjoyable, entertaining & somewhat satisfying."
1468,10,This rounds it off great - Order 66,"This film rounds the entire series off in a spectacular fashion. The effects - Out of this world The Cast - International and fantastic - look through the cast list above and see how many different nationalities they are. Wow the actor who plays the young Tarkin at the end looks so much like the late Peter Cushin. So many familiar things are here, the super star destroyer, the death star (always loved that but never knew how it worked). Shame though as they could have put the odd character in from Episode 4 to make the links more stronger. "
1469,7,"Not as good as everyone thinks, but better than I and II","I thought this movie deserved a 10 compared to TPM and AOTC, but compared to the original trilogy, it deserves what I gave it (7/10). The special effects are amazing, but the acting, and the script sink the movie. Anakin isn't convincing at all as Darth Vader, and the love story between him and Padme is laughable sometimes. And lines like, ""You are so beautiful"" are so stupid. Also, I thought Yoda got very annoying towards the end of the movie. I think he is a good character, but his lines like ""Not if anything to say about it, I have"" are so unnecessary. Why can't he say a single sentence right!?"
1470,8,"Flawed, But Star Wars found it's soul again",Like everyone else I was both excited and nervous about this film.
1471,8,Who in the world doesn't want a lightsaber? EXACTLY!!,"If a film captures my attention throughout, makes me want it to never end and smile for hours afterwards it has served its purpose tenfold. Even if you watch this as a Star Wars virgin it is an epic sci-fi film with spectacular effects a creditable plot full of emotion and life-altering fight scenes. As a Star Wars fan the film doesn't change for the worse one bit. It ties up looses ends and has a clever plot. It takes away EVERYTHING we hated from The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones adds even better things. Plot balanced with both action and humour in spectacular ways, all annoying characters dealt with, every epic set piece you want to see unfold in a movie. So good it made me go home and re-watch IV, V and VI just to be engrossed in George Lucas' universe. No one in the world can not want to be either a Jedi or a Sith. I'm 18 and I walked home battling my best friend with our lightsabers in broad daylight, the movie was so good! Anyone can enjoy it, young or old, male or female, fan or not you can enjoy this movie with everything a new-age, sci-fi, Star Wars film can possible offer. Put your reservations of episode I & II aside, it'll be worth it. Sure it's not the old Trilogy. But it's a new one for new people in a new age of cinema. And it's spectacular."
1472,5,Anakin's Going to the Other Side is a Joke,"Let me tell you the good parts of the movie. The entire cast of wooden character and robotic script reading is reduced. Lucas clearly did avoided THAT not by asking for the actors to change their bad habits, but by using zoom close ups. Even Yoda got some nice hairy closeups. So we kind of ignored the body language which doesn't exists and look at there facial features talking like Thunderbirds puppets."
1473,10,the perfect end for the perfect saga,"As one of the big star wars fans who saw the movie a little late, l could already figure many things out. Anyway l wasn't disappointed at all. lt has the most impressive beginning and the excitement follows the movie out. lts definitely the most harsh and sad part of the saga and its also a little different than the first two but an even greater followup. Star Wars is well known for its evolutionary effects and so is EPISODE lll but still keeping a grab not to overreact in condition to the old episodes. Acting is amazing, Hayden Christensen and Mcgregor do a nice work but the chansler palpatine is surely the best (youll know why after you see it). Anyway its the best movie of the year so far cause it has everything and makes a fantastic bond between EPS 2 and 4. You will both laugh and cry and first of all enjoy this movie and it surely deserves the top 50. Must see specially in cinema."
1474,10,Revenge of The Sith,Best Star Wars Movie from the prequels and Anakin Vs Obi-Wan fight scene was the Moment for me
1475,4,Highly Disappointed - Vader ruined,"***SPOILERS BELOW*** I had high hopes for this movie, as I favor the ""darker"" movies. However, this movie was not that dark. At times, it was just plain silly."
1476,8,"If I could cut 5 minutes of footage, this film would be flawless!","This is just me pointing out the flaws. There aren't too many, I really like this movie, but it could have been perfect, and it was extremely close. George Lucas has given up on Yoda's original character, his lines don't contain wisdom, because Geoge Lucas is focused on making his dialect seem reasonable. He failed. But also, Yoda says things way out of his character, but mixes it up, so he says his lines, like Yod would say them, if Yoda was the kind of cat who says. ""Hope right, you are."" The biggest word in that line is 5 letters. Yoda is better than that. He is the Jedi of Jedis, and teaches the only other surviving Jedi. That's how wise he is. He would never say to Darth Sidious, ""Not if anything to say about it I have."" That line is a cliché, and it's a cliché in our realm, not a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. It sounds absolutely absurd when he says it. Another thing that I would cut is the dialogue between Chewbacca and Tarfful. When Yoda leaves, he says, ""Miss you I will."" (Stupid line) and then Tarfful and Chewie exchange grunting groan noises at each other for a whole 5 seconds. For what reason? The editor must have fallen asleep or missed his deadline and scrambled for it or something, because he missed a few spots. I do not want to see the sensitive side of Vader in the bloody respirator-suit. I don't want to see an intense, 3 movie epic transformation of a great character shat upon by one cheesy shot of an 8-year old kid (I know it was pr in a Darth Vader Halloween costume howling at the moon. Honestly, ""NOOOOOOO!"" What a joke. What a bastardization of what is possibly the greatest franchise in history. At least there weren't any gungans (I'm aware of the fact that he who shall not be named did appear, but not enough to make a real difference). And, I'm just curious, and probably shouldn't speculate. It's probably in the book, but I've not read it, but when Palpatine pulls the name ""Darth Vader"" out of thin air, did he stop for a while and plan out the fact that ""Vader"" is German for ""Father""? I just wanted to see George Lucas justify renaming Anakin the way he did. I know all the Sith are Darth Whatever, but how does Darth Sidius come up with this stuff? Otherwise, this movie was great. Well, I don' think Yoda should be an action hero. And I don't think R2-D2 should win hand to hand combat between to battle droids. And I think Padme's birth would have been worth the employment of oh... I don't know maybe humans? The birth of the chosen one and his twin sister hardly seems like work for droids. They could have at least picked a droid that was maybe 2 or 3 notches less annoying, but all tiny details aside, this movie was great. I maybe would have liked to not see the security hologram of Anakin killing ""younglings"" (can't they just be called kids? I swear in episode 1, they used the word ""boy"". And no, episode 1 does not deserve capital letters.) I thought Episode III was stupendous though. Hayden Chrstensen actually looked very similar to Mark Hamill. Ewan McGregor is even beginning to look like Alec Guiness. Natalie Portman is very fun to look at. And these people all acted well. The evil gungan (no capitals) who shall remain unnamed stayed out of the script where he belongs, but he popped up on screen a few times with the Naboo senate posse making me very, very nervous. "
1477,6,No attachment.,"It is unsettling viewing all three of the latest Star War series due solely to the monotone acting. There is nothing to learn here and the world would have been better off not seeing the History of the first Star Wars until someone came along that knew how to Direct, cast and write. Lucas appears to be a Vain and egotistical director that has not left his ""cool state"" of being he had in his twenties."
1478,8,I'm a bit disappointed,"I was so excited about this film that I even was reading up on it six months ago. But after this film, I can't believe how let down I was. Yes this movie has a dark undertone, which makes Anakin's choices that much more paramount. This is the focus of this film. "
1479,10,My FAVORITE of ALL the star wars.,"this film was INCREDIBLE. I LOVED every minute of it. the music, the action, the special effects, you name it, I loved it. Music? Once again, an overly exceptional score by John Williams as always..the other two prequels aren't perfect by any means, but the hate for them is absolutely ridiculous. These are the backstory to Lucas original ideas. whether you hate them, that is your opinion, but this was Lucas' original intent, and for better worse, this is what they are. For those who say he raped your childhood, well, I guess that sucks for you, but let those who aren't little babies enjoy these. Another solid addition to the Star Wars franchise that I will cherish for the rest of my life. 100/10"
1480,8,Recaptures the spirit of the Original Trilogy,"Finally, George Lucas has made a prequel film worthy of the name Star Wars. The film has the qualities that made the original trilogy what it is - great music (John Williams really outdid himself overall with the score - the Anakin vs. Obi Wan battle music is made all the more personal and fitting because of his music), great story (this is the episode we wanted to see, not the fillers that were Episodes I and II), great performances for the most part (especially of Ian McDiarmid in a FINALLY outgoing performance as Palpatine - we waited 5 films for this ""unveiling"")."
1481,9,"The circle is complete with a new ""Star Wars"" film worthy of the name, finally","""The Revenge of the Sith"" not only undoes the harm inflicted on the ""Star Wars"" universe that its two predecessors did, it justifies the entire second trilogy. The power and energy of the original films flows through every frame of this latest installment, and fans finally have a new movie that they can fully appreciate."
1482,3,I thought it was...,"Terrible. Just plain terrible. If anyone wants me to elaborate feel free to let me know. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. Worth the money to laugh at and that's about it. Almost no intentional value in the entire film. Every scene even approaching respectability is ruined by Lucas's complete ineptitude. He fails to direct any type of emotion whether it be humor, anger, sadness and especially love. Every shot is over crammed with a ridiculous amount of garish effects that do nothing more than confuse and annoy the viewer. Lucas also seems obsessed with self referencing back to a time when ""he was cool"" as if he has some sort of credibility credit. If he did that account was emptied a long long time ago.... The pinnacle of cinematic lethargy."
1483,6,More Than the Sum of It's Parts!,"At last we come full circle. As I sit writing this, it's tough to think of the idea that there will be no more Star Wars movies. This isn't a reaction to Revenge of the Sith as much as it is a statement of a generation. As long as allot of us have been alive, there's been the wait for a new Star Wars movie. Kind of interesting, perhaps now it is a time to think and dream of other things as opposed to hoping and waiting for the inevitable. Star Wars fits into many of our lives as a type of road marker."
1484,2,Vader Promise a Major Disappointment,"For 3 movies all I wanted was a cool scene again with Darth Vader, after all this story which makes him majorly unlikabke on a human level, we finally get him for a few minutes and what does he do... he screams ""Noooooooooooo"" in one of the most classically bad moments in all of cinematic history. Audiences rejected these movies when it came out & I don't get how people have liked it more as the years went on. Maybe kids saw it in a different light, have lower expectations for movie quality in general or were told they should like it and just found something to like. Not sure."
1485,1,You have to be kidding...,"Episode 3, Revenge Of The Sith, is absolutely the worst Star Wars movie ever made, and one of the least enjoyable watches of my entire movie-going life. There are a lot of very bad movies out of there, but none have ever sucked so much goodness out of this world. Yoda is ruined. The Emperor is ruined. And if you thought Darth Vader was cool before, think again, because it's pretty clear now that he just a big pansy. "
1486,5,Here's a shocker: It sucked,*Probably some spoilers* I just came back from the theater after hearing many positive reviews and frankly I found it to be the same as the other two. Clone Wars is better than this one. The only nice thing I can say about the last SW is that we find out how Anakin becomes Darth Vader and what happens to the twins. Grievous was also pretty original.
1487,8,"Does IMDb *Really* Need Another Review Of This Movie? Well, Here It Is Anyway...","REVENGE OF THE SITH (4 outta 5 stars) Well, the saga is complete! (At least until George Lucas or one of his heirs decides to proceed with another trilogy... oh, you KNOW it is going to happen eventually... make no mistake!) This movie is clearly the most satisfying of the 3 ""prequels"" to the original Star Wars... because this time out there is a clear storyline... a storyline packed with drama and action and tragedy. Annakin Skywalker's slow Macbeth-like descent into evil makes for a very compelling movie. The accent is less on things blowing up and moving really fast and more on the emotional turmoil that the characters have to go through. There is some pretty dark stuff in here... but what can you expect when the cute little boy from Episode 1 has to evolve into the black-wearing villain from Episode 4? The movie does have its weaknesses... the dialogue is particularly poor and some of the special effects are awful. (How is it that impossibly-complex spaceships can look so realistic yet a human being doing a triple flip during a sword fight can still look so utterly fake? And why can't the director see this and do something about it?) Still, the movie does have some fine moments... particularly a viciously cold-blooded final duel that almost makes up for all the stupid Jar Jar Binks comic relief that they felt compelled to cram into the first two episodes."
1488,3,What is wrong with you people?!,"Today I was looking over some random movies on the IMDb and I thought ""why don't I check out the top 250?"". To my horror I found out that a Star Wars prequel had actually made it onto the list! I have just one word for everyone who voted this movie highly."
1489,10,The best Star Wars yet?,"The truly surprising thing about this movie is not just the fact that it could be the best one because it contains both a great story and the effects to back it up convincingly, but because it is moving. That's right: MOVING. It is hard to watch what happens to Anakin Skywalker as he becomes the dark lord. This film is a war movie, but not so video-gamish as Episodes 1 & 2. The characters are real and you worry when they are in danger or dying. Of course, we know the what, but the how and why are fascinating. There are shots of Jar-Jar, but he never speaks and the dialogue at times is campy, but in that fun way the first ones were. Samuel L. Jackson is out of place for the most part. Otherwise, the movie approaches perfection."
1490,1,Only watch if easily amused by bright lights and loud noises.,"This may be technically the worst blockbuster that I have ever seen. the film relies on fairly impressive SFX to the exclusion of plot, characterisation, decent cinematography and lines that don't cause death by laughter. The acting veers from hammy (Ewan MeGregor) to wooden (Hayden Christian). It features some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard e.g. (from anakin and padme) You're so beautiful."
1491,9,Thank You!,"Thank you, George Lucas for NOT making another lame children's film. This film was great! Awesome tie-ins to episode 4! I loved the fight and action scenes. To be blunt, episodes 1 and 2 were fillers. This is what we were all waiting for. And as I've read in one Star Wars geek's review, you really DO find yourself saying ""NO, Anakin! DON'T DO IT!"" There was some horrific yet, in my opinion, necessary stuff in this film! The title for Episode 4 ""A New Hope"" makes a lot more sense after seeing this film. 99.9 percent void of cheesiness! There are references to the real world that I thought were sweet. Some Eastern philosophy / Taoism from Master Yoda."
1492,4,"Lucas missing the mark, and managing to prove himself a shallow and overblown 'artist.'","Although I disliked Christensen's performance as well, and for that matter the entirety of the acting portions of the movie, I think there is far more wrong with Revenge of the Sith than simply a B-level heartthrob's poorly directed performance. The directing in its encompassing touch on the film could be to blame. This will not be only an assault on Mr. Lucas's credibility and integrity as an artist, but I must work to highlight the good parts of this as a film, the best of the prequels (although that is not to say much)."
1493,10,Best Star wars movie of all time so far,"Episode 3 has always been my favorite, the epic duel between The Emperor and Yoda, as well as transformation of Anakin to Darth Vader, the fight in the throne room, all great and epic pinnacles of Star Wars and culmination of the Vader story leading into the OT...Amazing movie"
1494,10,At long last : Episode III is good.,"Finally! Since some years the Star Wars films weren't too great(compare to the oringal trilogy). Nevertheless, everyone were expecting the Clone Wars talked in episode 4. This volume takes audiences into a dark universe where tyranny begins to exterminate courage, love, valor and...light. "
1495,8,Great movie,"I recently saw Star Wars III-The Revenge of the Sith, I found it excellent. Great visual effects, a captivating story and a outstanding cast make this last episode of Star Wars a master piece of the cinema History. This was one of the few movies which touched me so deeply that I still think about it many days after I saw it. Once again (and I just keep saying this) I disagree with the Portuguese critics. They say that the Star Wars' characters don't have any emotional depth nor emotional complexity. Let me just remind what this third episode is all about. If I'm not in a mistake, I think that it's about the emotional troubles of Anakin Skywalker, it's about the struggle between good and evil inside his own soul. The critics of my country also think that the ""love"" scenes (like Padmé telling Anakin that he's going to be a father) are very innocent. I think they must be, because the Anakin and Padmé are almost like adolescents, they've just turned young adults. Anyway, I think that everyone(Star Wars fan or not) should go and see this third episode as fast as they can. For the Star Wars fans like me, I have another message:let's just hope that George Lucas fulfill the original story that he wrote, which included episodes VII, VIII and IX."
1496,7,Not brilliant but better than I expected,I am not a big fan of the star wars saga. I did really enjoy the classic films where there was a great storyline and brilliant action packed sequences but have found frustration watching George Lucas completely destroying it. In the other 2 prequels the films heavily depended on CGI and we're of poor quality yet in this film you can see some of the great moments we saw in the old star wars. The film takes place 3 years from where the {fifth or second its your choice} left off. The clone wars are ending and it is the time where Anikan faces a big choice in his life about who he should trust and who he wants to become. This film basically ties up all the loose ends. Hayden Christenson has improved a great deal since attack of the clones and another great performance by Ewan McGregor help this film end the great saga with dignity. I was going to rate this film a bit lower because everyone expects Star Wars to be a brilliant movie because of its predecessors but the film should be marked on its own merits.
1497,6,Lucas' failure comes to an end,"The last installment of George Lucas' lauded Prequel Trilogy and to be fair, the best. But how much is such praise worth?"
1498,6,painful acting,I think you have to blame George Lucas for the painfully shallow performances by Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen. They've both done reasonable work in other movies with better directors.
1499,1,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith: The crappiest film ever made,"I have been a star wars fan since forever. I simply find the films fun. Therefore, it pains me to say revenge of the sith, like the other prequels are horrible films. Although they have great action, the films are very boring and feature, in a nutshell everything, you would not want in a movie. THE END."
1500,10,Best of the Series!!,"After the much better Episode II, I simply could not wait to see Episode III. Episode III is undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars films ever made, if not comparable to the very first film in fact. The film exceeded my expectations to be honest. I'm well aware there are some die-hard Star Wars fans out there reading this review who will say Episode III was just as horrible as the first two prequels. However, the critics all agree, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is actually a VERY good film. All the performances were top-rate, Hayden Christensen diving even deeper into Anakin's darkness. The character is portrayed perfectly here and Hayden delivers all the emotions that are need to complete this character. To truly get me on its greatness, let's go through this film shall we...."
1501,1,Like Mel Brooks I'm a bit late to the Star Wars saga,"I was never a big fan and didn't see the original until 2 years after it came out. Then i saw the sequels about the same time after they were released. They were somewhat entertaining but I didn't see the big deal then - they were kind of hokey w/o the campy fun of Lost In Space or Star Trek. But these prequels are just downright criminal. They don't even rise to the level of mediocre. I knew these films were crap when I read the names of these characters...DOOKU????? MACE? JAR JAR? This sounds like it is coming from the mind of a 7 year old. I don't know who the hell these characters are and what they represent. You really need to be in some sort of dark, bleak existence to know this info and/or care. Someday I will pay back my son for making me go to these exercises in torture. I hope George Lucas is happy with all the money he has stolen from the viewing public."
1502,6,Not as bad as 1 & 2,"Whilst there are much worse films in the Star Wars series this is still chock full of dire acting, clunky scripting and occasionally sub par FX. There is much better SF out there!"
1503,8,Good,"There are some awfully long and intricate reviews here that concern themselves with the minutae of Anakin's fall into the clutches of the Dark Side (TM), the ramifications of the poor acting and the shortcomings of the script... well, that's all as may be. What you really need to know is that this is a visual treat, an engrossing story and a seamless link into the events of the original film."
1504,6,Meet the new Star Wars....same as the old Star Wars....,"There are times as a critic and as a movie watcher where your expectations are so low that if the movie being seen has ANY redeeming qualities, it is automatically ""great""."
1505,3,mostly disappointing,"Yes, the action is great. Hurrah. Yes, the special effects rock. How unexpected. The storyline, acting, dialog, pacing etc. Why bother griping about it? The only reason these newer Star Wars films get any rave reviews at all is simply because they have the Star Wars name attached to them. Take that away from the film, rename the characters and keep everything else the same and what would you have? May as well be Bad Boys III. Or Rocky part 23. It's empty. It's not even that I had big expectations for this new series. But I do have standards. And all of the fancy computer generated effects and incredible action scenes can't deliver very much satisfaction, cool as they may be. What was lacking was heart, cheesy as that may sound. The films fail to draw you in with any real emotional connections. They become simply the answers to trivia questions."
1506,3,CRAP special FX (+where are the women?),The sad thing about this film is that it gives you a tantalising glimpse of what might have been had George Lucas got his head out from his own rear end and decided to make another trilogy of decent films.
1507,,flashy,"i have to admit, i didn't go into this movie expecting anything great. i really wasn't going to see it until i was invited. so, i tried to keep a somewhat open mind. i think what made the original star wars great was that they did so much with the little that they had. now, it's like they just want to impress the audiences with flashy lights. yes, the special effects were impressive. it was also kind of interesting to see the characters transforming from something good to something evil. however, the acting ability was not something they really got into with this movie. there were some good moments, but overall, the focus was simply on the flashy lights and things that go boom. actors that are usually very good were not in this movie. however, i can't say that i blame them because they probably knew the whole point of the movie was to show off the special effects and computer tricks. for those of you that would like some closure in the series, see it. for those of you who really don't care, don't waste your time."
1508,10,Best Star Wars movie of all time,This movie is the story that George Lucas desperately wanted to tell the whole time. Anakin's fall to the dark side is considered one of the greatest falls from grace a movie character has ever undergone. I found the second act the most intriguing of the story due to it being the beginning of Anakin being seduced by the dark side of the force through Palpatines manipulation. The final light Saber battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan will go down in history as one of the most legendary fights in cinematic history. In the final fight it is stressed that Obi-Wan is the one person who can save Anakin and that he knows that the only way he can save Anakin is to defeat him. His realization of that completes one of my personal favorite character arch's in cinematic history. Thank you George Lucas for making my childhood worthwhile causing me to obsess over Star Wars into my adult years.
1509,2,Strong in Elliot the Force is...,"Brutal. Lucas needs to find someone else to write for him, because I know kids in elementary school who could churn out better dialogue. The love storyline was a complete waste of time, and after Eps I and II there was just too much story left to tell in one movie."
1510,9,Maybe the Best,"I was eleven when Star Wars hit the theaters in 1977. Growing up with Luke, Han, C3PO, R2, and Princess Leah made it hard to get into the new episodes."
1511,10,Unforgettable performance!,"Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen and Ian McDiarmid gave unforgettable and stellar performances! I have no doubt Natalie and Hayden are one day destined each for Academy Awards. As for Ian McDiarmid, what an awesome actor! Ian deserves an academy award for Best Supporting Actor. The ice cold shock I felt from his amazing performance as the Supreme Chancellor was heightened because his personality as Palpatine reminded me of someone dear to me. My late Dad whom I placed on a pedestal as the ultimate of moral integrity and Ian McDiarmid looked and acted so similarly. This made it all the more painful to watch the Supreme Chancellor transform, like a chameleon, from a seemingly moral leader in whom the people placed their total trust and lives. Someone in whom I fear I myself would have been taken in by, if I were in Anakin's shoes, because he would have represented the Dad that I never had! Who could have imagined such a moral icon turning into the face of pure evil as The Emperor! Palpatine's subtle corruption of Anakin symbolized the danger that youth face by those in positions of high authority and trust. Anakin's unexpected obeisance to the Emperor, as his soul fell into the hands of an evil demigod, was an emotional experience to witness. The emaciation of a beautiful Jedi soul into a slave to pure evil and death horrified many I know who went to this movie. The destruction of two lovers who were robbed of happily growing old together with their family added to the chilling reminder of evil's power over even the most innocent of souls. The Darth Vader persona became Anakin's death mask, entombing a reanimated corpse of a dear person prone to succumbing to The Emperor's lie that one can attain immortality. The mass murder of billions on the planet Alderon was the fruit of this lie. This was the most unforgettable performance I have experienced in decades. Truly a credit to the genius of George Lucas."
1512,,This wins the golden toilet award for true awfulness.,"(Contains mild spoilers) I have seen many dreadful movies in my time, but this is the first one that left me laughing as I walked out of the cinema. Bearing in mind that this movie depicts the horrific deaths of many innocent people, (including children) that's saying something. So what's wrong with this movie ? Answer : Mainly, the acting. Watch this movie, dear reader, and prepare yourself for some of the worst performances ever to hit the silver screen."
1513,8,The Force is strong with this one!,"EDIT: It's 10 years later and I'm revisiting this review. It's clear that I was pretty enthusiastic about the movie, having written this just hours after seeing it. Can't believe how I gushed about it! I've revised my rating from a 10 to an 8. Maybe I'm more mature now at 47?"
1514,5,Lot Of Action...Too Much Special Effect...inconsistent storyline,"Strangely enough it seems that this film is either hated or loved. The older viewers who where 20 or so, in 1977, when the first movie came out, do not like it, but the teenage crowd thinks it great. They probably believe it towers over ""A New Hope"" in quality. In 1977, they had to do special effects you could actually see, and I was 18 at the time. I felt this ""Revenge"" had too much computer generated effects and the more it had, the less believable it appeared. As many have indicated the dialog was very weak and the entire first half of the movie seemed to drag on and on. The film did get better in the second half. I would grade the first hour at a one and the second hour at an eight, with an average score over all. I have seen the first three films many times and Phantom more than once. I did not care much for ""Clones"". Over the years there seem to have been several storyline inconsistencies, if my memory serves. In ""New Hope"" OB has no memory of C3PO? Yet they are together much in the last three films. In ""Empire"" OB sends Luke to see Yoda, who he says trained him, but in ""Phantom"" it is clear that Liam Neeson's character trained OB, not Yoda. In ""Jedi"" Luke asked Leia if she remembers her mother, and she indicates that she has a few memories, yet according to ""Revenge"" the mother died in childbirth and they spent all of 10 seconds together, so no memories could be possible. One thing I find utterly amazing about the entire story is that Luke is taken and hidden from his father to protect him. Yet, he is placed in the custody of an uncle, but yet in Phantom, there were no siblings in the household and no spouse or father. If the protection of Luke is the objective, why place him with relatives and allow him to maintain the same last name? I am certain there are many more problems with the storyline, but these stand out."
1515,3,OK but style over substance,"Revenge of the Sith Umm, I went in with low expectations, thinking that if there can be just one or two really decent scenes then I will be happy. Did it succeed? Some bits are good. It's genuinely darker, yoda has one or two good moments, some of the fight scenes are OK and Hayden Christianson does have more presence. In the 'night of the long knives' scenes I felt some connection, things where going wrong and you felt the drama and Darth getting angry at the end was an impressive display but overall I think it's a classic example of style over substance, selling the sizzle rather than the sausage itself."
1516,6,Not a movie that I've been waiting for,"Finally twenty eight years after the first Star Wars movie the legendary saga now is completed. Completed in a different way than all five previous movies, which were about good fight against evil and overtake it. The Revenge of the Syth is much darker and violent and on the contrary to previous movies it supposed to be sad but for some reasons it's not, just emotionally shallow and empty, mainly because the movie is terribly overloaded by endless battle scenes, light saber duels and computer generated special effects. Lots of those action sequences simply have no any sense, except for adding screen time and one more stream of visuals. At first look those planets, star-ships, monsters seem cool but when you look deeper they just look fake. It's more like expensive video game, not a real universe. They can show only modern technical achievements but that's the most important they only emphasize overall weakness of the story. The beginning, where we find our heroes on the middle of battle between numerous spaceships in my opinion is the silliest part of the entire six movies. The separatist forces captured chancellor Palpatine and there are huge space battle at Coruscant, where Anakin and Obi Wan are trying to rescue him. There are no any connection with previous movies, no any sense in there. The key element of the story, the conclusion of the transformation from cute and smart kid Annie to powerful evil Darth Vader is terribly fast, irrational and unconvincing. For showing his first steps on this way in Attack of The Clones teenage Anakin after several years suddenly remembered that he's got a mother, now we go next and in the first half of the movie everything proves that he turns to the Dark Side because of his profound life to Padme, that he could do everything to save her and BANG! Anakin learn that Palpatin is Sith, he saves his only because he believed that with Dark side of the Force he can save Padme but suddenly after a few minutes he forgets all about his love and now, for no reason at all, he is convinced of Jedi's plot against the Republic and kills innocent kids, called younglings. After he did all that for a short time we again return to a love motive of all his acts but finally we hear something about his ""own empire"". What a mess! The same problem is with transformation Republic into Empire. Too fast, too unconvincing. Yhe Jedi, who supposed to be wisest people in the entire world are careless and not pretty smart, because all of them actually are manipulated by Darth Sidius. The connection between two trilogies is not complete because of numerous minor variances with previous movies and questions without clear answer (for example where Rebels from A New Hope came from). Dialogs in the movie are on the same level with modern typical summer blockbusters, they are mostly one-lined and silly. We can hear several well-known classic lines from old trilogy but that's all. Most of the time no glamors and almost no sense. It's really hard to say anything about acting in such a movie because this endless stream of computer-generated visuals leaves not enough place for acting. However in those short moments between action sequences sometimes we can see signs of decent acting. At least Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman finally showed their acting abilities here, while Ian McDiarmid is good as Palpatine/Darth Sidius. "
1517,10,Please come back mr.Lucas,I cant believe that you left the franchise into disney's hands. Please make Star wars as it was till 2005.<br /><br />All episodes 1-6 where so good.. why letting disney do that?
1518,3,Star schlock,"So let me be the naysayer, maybe the only one. This movie has the artistic merit of a poor comic book. But maybe that's what the audience wants. The dialogue is barely two dimensional. The characters, under apparent Gestalt therapy, discover in the end who is good and who is evil, for that is what all these movies are about. Yes, the special effects are special...they are especially good. But it seems that all of the writer's effects were designed to accommodate them. They drive the movie, not the dialogue or the people."
1519,10,My favorite movie of all time,"This film is perfectly crafted by George Lucas. What makes this the best is the lore that it adds, and the fact that it completes the story established in 1977. The darker direction is definitely an improvement over the already legendary Star Wars Saga as well. A great movie if you appreciate lightsaber dueling, but if you don't like it, you may find yourself bored at some points during the movie. If you like Star Wars, or Sci-Fi in general, you will probably like the film."
1520,1,10 out of 10??? What were you watching???,"Saw a screening tonight... RIP Star Wars, George has put the final nails in the coffin w/this abomination. Sure, it'll do a great box, but if it looks like @#$$, and smells like @#$$, well it probably is @#$$."
1521,10,Back to the Force you must!,The initial disappointment from the fanbase due to high expectations probably gave it a low score.
1522,10,One of the best,This movie has with no doubts the best music. Yes maybe the dialogue and the acting is not the best sometimes but the story and the universe of the movie are a masterpiece and it's always a movie that i enjoy to watch
1523,9,This episode makes me sad,"When i popped to the cinema and get a good look at this Episode 3, I believe the story can be very exciting and i was wrong for the first half an hour."
1524,10,An epic ending to the greatest saga of all time,Contains some SPOILERS.
1525,9,Hello There,Revenge of the Sith is an amazing film. Although receiving hate originally when first came out ROTS has been one of few movies where it has gotten better everytime. The best part of the movie is definently the acting by Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid. Both acting in this movie are both Top 5 best Star Wars performances. McDiarmid really showcases his all around talent as a split character. The acting as Palpatine in all scenes truly is flawless. From the Darth Plagueis the Wise to Palpatine versus Yoda all of McDiarmid's acting as one of cinema's greatest villains is the best part of the whole movie and alone makes Revenge of the Sith an amazing movie.
1526,8,"Let's turn to the dark side,,,,,,,,hmmmm, OK!!","Every SAGA has a beginning, now the saga is complete the movie is great, no doubt about that but you see I only rated it as 8 out of 10 So, where are the 2 points here are a quick film review 1) The movie starts with the classical sliding text telling that S. Palpatine has been kidnapped by General Grievous which is really a very good start 2) Then the action begins the battle seen is Good, reminds me with Invaders and Space impact Games, I liked the Graphics and colors of green and Magenta Lasers 3) the battle is designed to tell what a hell of a pilot Anakin has become 4) the on board battle is awesome again what a hell of a Jedi Anakin is and a really nice funny touch from R2D2, only catch is that we have already seen the capabilities of count Dukoo vs. Obi Wan, Anakin and Yoda. but I felt like he was defeated so fast and he lost much of his skills. No points lost so far, No harm done 5) Now comes the brain game between Anakin and Palpatine, it started in very good way and Lucas showed us the methodology of turning to the dark side really good 6) the film goes well till the moment after the fight of Mace Windu and Darth Sidius (no more Palpatine) here we see Anakin betrayed Windu to save Darth Sidius (he needs to know how to fight death to save Padme) then Anaken forgot completely about Jedi and decided to be a Sith how come he forgot a life time in just 20 second or something and he is convinced that every single Jedi is now an enemy I didn't buy that (at least one point lost here if not more) then we see the fight at the Jedi temple and the killing of Jedi as if all Jedi lost their powers same moment Anakin turned to dark side so all of them killed so easily (second point lost) except Yoda and Obi wan of course 7) a great fight between Yoda and Palpatine but Yoda gave up so easily and didn't even think to try again (I wonder why) 8) then the one we waited 30 years to see the fight between Obi wan and Anakin (or say Darth Vader), really great fight but it was the first time a Sith holds a blue light saber 9) Padme gave birth of the 2 children and a new hope is born and RISE LORD VADER and the movie ends 10) it didn't show weather all Wookies except Chobaka turned against Jedi or what a very good movie needed stronger turn to the dark side finally I look forward to see the movie again and till the DVD appears on the market"
1527,10,This is the true spirit of Star wars,"Reading through the comments on this movies by other IMDb members, I'm simply appalled at how so many people have lost faith in Star wars. It seems that many film goers have lost the sense of wonderment, and now so jaded. This film, in my opinion, is the best of all the Star wars, and the best science fiction film I have seen in a long time."
1528,10,My personal favorite!,"This movie has it all; the story, the action, the love, the drama, and last but not least, the epic lightsaber duels. If you watch memes you have probably already seen lots of content from this particular movie, and for good reason. This movie is packed with some of the most memorable quotes in movie history! The actors Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen has a great synergy and their overall acting is phenomenal in this one. And don't forget Ian Mcdiarmid who delivers flawless performance in every single Star Wars movie. This movie is no exception."
1529,6,Far from perfect but easily the best of the prequel-trilogy,"Just like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this movie scores heavily simply for being the darkest one in its trilogy. Here's a film that contains some of those ""legendary"" scenes that SW-geeks like myself have been imagining since the early 80s. The Mustafar-duel, Anakin's and Obi-Wan's final moment together and, of course, the transformation into Darth Vader. Those are absolute key moments of the SW-saga and it's obvious that the creators of ""Revenge"" put a lot of effort into them. Looking at ""Sith"" (and the other two prequels) one can't help but wonder however, if the back-story to IV, V, VI needed filming at all. "
1530,5,so...so...,"I suppose if one went to see the movie with no prior exposure to all the hype, it might receive a higher rating than otherwise. Its a decent enough movie, though, as my peers have noted, the dialog and acting is ridiculously sophomoric."
1531,,Truly superior...the best of the prequels,"This movie turned out to be fantastic. I am one of the fans of the old Star Wars movies who has been skeptical about these new ones, but this movie was extremely enjoyable and definitely the best of the three prequels (and for that matter, maybe better that Return of the Jedi, the weak link in the original three). It ties everything in very well and sets the table almost perfectly for Episodes 4-6. I guess my only complaint is the same I have with the other prequels: overkill with the computer graphics. I know special effect technology has come a long way since ""A New Hope"" but the graphics, especially in the battle scenes, actually seem more realistic in the original versions. They look like real battles...in the prequels, they look like video games. But go see ""Revenge of the Sith."" You will not be disappointed."
1532,5,Good movie overall,"What spoilers can someone write here? We all know how the movie is going to come out!! This movie is nothing special. Actually, the original trilogy is much better than the prequel. It focused more on the story and characters than the prequel does. These seem to focus more on the special effects. Now that Lucas has his 'toys' 30 years later he seems to utilize them more, detracting from his story."
1533,9,A Nice Bridg to Episode Four,"Many secrets are revealed in this movie, the secret of the Sith, the connection between Senator Palpatine and Darth Sidious, and why there are only two Siths, a master and an apprentice. In some ways, this is a nasty movie, and I don't mean this in a negative way. The nastiness is essential to the story, and a very well written story it is. Even George Lucas himself said that he put in some PG-13 material in this movie because the storyline demanded it. Not a thing wrong with that. We see the long duel between Anakin and Obi Wan and see the agony of Anakin as he crawls out of the lava pit. The final agonized scream of the newly anointed Darth Vader at the very end of the movie when he learns of the death of his precious Padme is revealing within itself. I can't help but get the impression that Vader/Anakin lived with the guilt of Padme's death for the rest of his life. A great story beautifully crafted. 9 out of 10."
1534,10,The Dark Side of the Force.,"Going into The Revenge of the Sith I knew what was going to happen in it already. However I did not know exactly how it was all going to happen in it. To be honest though, a lot happened in it that I did not expect and that helped out a lot."
1535,1,wtf,"My votes: part 4 a 10, part 5 a 10, part 6 a 9, part 1 a 6, part 2 a 9, part 3 a 1.. George Lucas has completely lost it. Where a new hope, the empire strikes back and return of the Jedi were my all-time favorites, the prequels are completely boring and in my opinion they absolutely do no judge to the Star Wars universe. Never I've been more disappointed in nae movie then in Revenge of the Sith .. badly edited, terrible soundtrack and even the actors look more like Quake IV CGI's than ever before :( Never have I ever been so disappointed in one single movie..."
1536,10,Saving the best for last.,"I was one of many disappointed with the prequels, to a degree. The Phantom Menace left all of us with a sour taste in our mouths. Attack of the Clones, although aesthetically captivating and immensely entertaining, was brainless and had some sketchy dialogue sequences. Needless to say, despite all the hype, I wasn't expecting much more from Revenge of the Sith than I was from Attack of the Clones."
1537,8,The Mad Hobbit's Review,"I loved it! Let me begin by saying that in my mental order of preference for the films, ""Star Wars"" remains separate and beyond compare. Therefore, I judge the sequels against each other. My order of preference from best to worst goes like this: Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones, Return of the Jedi, and then  way down at the bottom, Phantom Menace. "
1538,9,"Great, but with a few minor rants.","First off, don't let the title of this post fool you, I loved the movie, I'm going back to see it again sometime today, most likely."
1539,10,The Star Wars Saga Ends Gracefully and Tragically With Revenge Of The Sith!!,Some Spoilers Ahead:
1540,10,"Not the best, but very good","First, let me say that I LOVE Star Wars. I first saw A New Hope when I was three years old, and it changed my life. When I heard that the prequels were coming out, I was ecstatic. Now that the movies have come full circle. I can honestly say that I am well pleased with the series. As I said in the title, this movie is not the best by a long shot, but it's still really good. I personally think Episode II: Attack Of The Clones was the best, and this is a close second for the prequels. George Lucas can pull something from American Beauty (film a plastic bag floating on the wind) and I'll watch it. I will be a George Lucas fan to the end."
1541,10,Stunning,Very very very good movie.
1542,6,A good but underachieving film that should have been great,"I suppose that the best word for how I feel about Revenge of the Sith is ""frustrated."" Not that it was a bad film, because it was a good film and I certainly do not regret seeing it in the theater."
1543,9,A Cinematic Tour De Force for Lucas and Company and...,A Fitting End to the Star Wars Saga on the Silver Screen.
1544,10,Amazing,"I went to see this movie yesterday and all I can say is that it was amazing. I loved it! The special effects were awesome, the acting was heartbreaking and the story line was excellent and it answered all the questions I had from the trilogy. It made me so proud to be a Star Wars fan. Also the bonus part of the movie is that Hayden Christensen is so sexy in his role of Anakin Skywalker. I couldn't believe it was the same actor from Attack of the Clones. Ewan McGregor was fantastic as Obi-Wan Kanobi, Natalie Portman was lovely and heartbreaking as Padme and Yoda... well let me just say he kicked some serious but! I really enjoyed this movie and so did everyone else in the movie theater because they laughed at the funny parts, some cried during the sad parts and they all clapped at Yoda's fighting scenes and at the end of the movie there was a standing ovation."
1545,5,Just go see it and then express your frustrations here on IMDb,"SW:III was undoubtedly an improvement over SW:I and SW:II in all aspects. But considering how those two had all the character depth and plot complexity of kid-flicks like Goonies or Honey I Shrunk the Kids, I'm not exactly praising the movie to the high heavens. Without giving away too much of the plot, I'd like to list my impressions after the movie."
1546,10,Seriously lightsaber fight GOLD,"After the last Jedi , this movie is amazing , maybe some bad dialogue but amazing light saber fights and just amazing action love it"
1547,4,Character Appropriate,"Well, it came. It sold. It conquered. Box-office wise, I mean. But what can truly be said for what will likely be the last Star Wars film released? Well, in many ways, Episode 3 is much like Anakin Skywalker himself. It starts off well, with tons of potential, it looks swift, sports some killer moves and has a lot to offer in the sharp-dressed department. But ultimately, bad acting, awful writing and Natalie Portman lead to the dark side."
1548,8,My Favorite Star Wars Movie by far,"Revenge of the Sith I believe is the best Star Wars Movie Period beating the Original Trilogy.The emotions conjured in this film create a strong sensation in the viewer, much more than the original trilogy.Anakin's fall and rise as Darth Vader is almost Shakespearean, with the added twist, that he caused the death of the person he was trying to save (Padme).All the fan boys and critics have complained about Episode I and II, but I believe with this film, George Lucas spells out what he was intending all along, we see the nine year old Anakin, and follow him through adulthood, it is very interesting when you look at Episodes I and II in hindsight.Sure there is cringe-worthy dialogue, but they are not as noticeable this time around because the story really grabs you, This is definitely the film people have been waiting for.I do have to say I got a bit nauseous during the surgery on Anakin, in which he is fitted with prosthetics to transform him into Darth Vader.Anakin is burned all over his body, it doesn't even look like Hayden, and it is painful to watch.Yes, some moments do seem to have been inserted to connect the two trilogies (Padme naming the twins at birth before she dies).I am actually sad the trilogy is over (for now), but I will watch all six films in order on DVD.Yes I saw the unaltered Original trilogy and the Special editions, plus Episodes I and II, so I can say this was my favorite movie in the series, with ESB number two."
1549,6,Brilliant Idea,"My favourite Star Wars movie to date, deep state politics and plenty of lightsaber action, what's not more to love? Well the acting and certain script writing, but a brilliant story line nonetheless."
1550,10,Fabulous conclusion to a wonderful series!!!,"I don't believe that I have EVER given a movie 10 of 10, in my life. I am the pickiest movie goer in the world. Howver, this film has captured my attention, and is fabulously done. Hayden Christensen lights up the screen, and plays a thoroughly dark character spectacularly. Ewan McGregor is wonderful as a wise, thoughtful mentor to the future Darth Vader. And while I have never been a big fan of Natalie Portman, she did surprisingly well!! A lot of expectations were riding on the film, and I think mine might have been every higher still. I was pleasantly surprised to find some very comedic parts in this film. I laughed a lot more than I ever would have expected. I thought it would be a very odd experience, going to a movie and knowing how it ends. Knowing who will live to see the end, and who won't, who will turn evil and all that stuff. But I was very surprised that I still enjoyed the film, and found myself hoping that Anakin wouldn't turn to the dark side, even though i knew he would in the end. It is a wonderful film full of human emotion, turmoil, and the struggle between good and evil! This is one film I will be seeing many times more!!!"
1551,8,Decent Finale for the Greatest Space Saga of All Time!,"Having seen the movie twice and having waited for the dust to settle, I can now make my comments on REVENGE OF THE SITH. The 3rd part of this ""prequel"" trilogy is definitely the best, not because it's darker or more violent, but because the story is plain and simple, superior to its predecessors. Having said this, I must also confess that (as some hardcore fans would come to expect)""REVENGE"" is flawed and the way it resolves some of the plot holes shown in ""MENACE"" and ""CLONES"" is very lame. It's as if George Lucas said, ""Gee, I have to explain this and that, and I don't know how"" and he just dribbled something out on paper and that was it. He resolves some plot inconsistencies with grandeur: How the emperor becomes THE emperor, why Anakin falls to the dark side, why the benevolent Republic becomes the evil Empire. But some of other plot inconsistencies, don't resolve in a satisfactory way. My major complaint for the whole ""prequel"" trilogy was the age casting: I think all the actors were FAR too young. In the case of Anakin and Padme, their ages are somewhat fine (It's a bit perverse that she falls for a boy who is, apparently, 8 years her junior!). Aunt Beru and Uncle Owens look like poster boys in this trilogy and age dramatically by the time we see them again in ""A NEW HOPE"" (Beru looks like she could be Luke's granny!). Obi-Wan also ages severely: Let's assume he was 35 at the time of ""Revenge""; he should be 55 at the time of ""A NEW HOPE"", but looks like this overtly tired and old man that's close to 70 years old!!! This minor details have infuriated many a STAR WARS fan because it shows that LUCAS wasn't paying enough attention. in ""REVENGE"" we never find out WHY Vader wears that ""special"" outfit, why he breathes and talks the way he does. We are left to assume this things as given. We also never find out why Padme names her children Luke and Leia...was it a ""spur of the moment"" thing??? It would have been cool to have Governor Tarkin in some dialog scene, or maybe a young Han Solo. There are so many things left in the air that you don't leave the theater fully satisfied. True, this is the culmination of the greatest space opera EVER and a decent culmination it was: Love, Romance, Action, Violence, Betrayal, Deceit, etc. But it is the way George Lucas rendered his final act that left me wishing for more."
1552,9,Unexpected fun,"This was fun. Everything about the movie was fun. It's what going to the movies is all about. The acting in this film was very flat at points, but George pulls you into a world of power excitement and leaves you breathless by the sheer scope of the world. The story here is brutally simple, but closer to the originals than episodes 1 or 2. This film, I believe, is what George wanted to make when he was thinking about Starwars. The sheer photography will leave you breathless, and the scope of things is absolutely massive. When you think about how this whole movie was shot in digital, you truly have to give George a hand. By far this is the best of the prequels. All-in-all, a fun night at the movies."
1553,10,Utterly Enthralling,"This is what Star Wars will always be to me! The final duel is by far the greatest choreographed piece in cinematic history, despite those that would disagree with me. The majority of the critics and movie-goers that will say the movie is trash are the same people that would bunch all of the prequels together, though this one is vastly seperate from both 'The Phantom Menace', and 'Attack of the Clones'. The poetic arc for Skywalker is unveiled marvellously throughout these golden 2 hours, with classic sci-fi action and the greatest part of it all: the score. The film version of the score is incredible to me, and remains an unmatched and unchalleged piece from Williams that completes this amazing film!"
1554,9,Anakin's Fall,"Episode III show us how Anakin was manipulated to become Darth Vader, he didn't want that, he just wanted to save Padmé from dieing, Sidious made him do that, destroy the temple, kill the kids. Ewan Mcgregor was perfect again, what a good acting on Mustafar, John Williams with ""Battle of the Heroes"", returning the ""Duel of the Fates"". This movie is the perfect example of what Star Wars can be, definetly the best of the 3."
1555,8,Absolutely amazing finale to the saga!,"Waiting for this movie was funny: I had waited for ROTS for so long that the day I was finally going to see it in the theatre, I was waiting the whole day nervously, so nervously I have never been in my whole life when waiting for some MOVIE. Butterflies in my stomach you know. Then finally... "
1556,10,Saga Goes on Forever !!! The Ultimate Action Fantasy !!!,CAUTION:TOTAL Suspension of Disbelief Required when Viewing this film !
1557,10,Excellent movie,"To start with, I am one of the very few who liked the two previous movies, The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones. It did not come as a surprise for me that I liked this movie. I want to see this as soon as possible, for the second, third, fourth..... twenty-seven millionth time! OK, the 27 million times is an exaggeration, excuse me."
1558,10,"Somehow, everything feels like Star Wars again...","Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was once a great 'knight' who stood up from his anonymity, learnt everything he saw and conquered all that were then deemed impossible to reach by many. But like any great legends, he too was scarred by the very bitter past that marred his status as a fighter, forcing him to step down and never to come back. However, his sense of determination and enthusiasm was beginning to mend, and like a little child who begins to learn to pick up a stick, he tries to regain his former self, only to stumble several times along his path to redeem himself. At long last, the struggling 'knight' had achieved his goal to become what he used to be many years ago. If you wonder who this 'knight' is, his name is George Lucas, famed director and creator of the popular sci-fi fantasy epic Star Wars, whose 30-year journey has recently ended with a bang with Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. As a treat to fans of the original, they will be delighted that many of the elements that make the original trilogy a classic have returned to this installment to bring a fitting conclusion to one of the most beloved movie sagas in history. That's right, expect the Wookies to make their appearances here, so do the X-Wing/Tie Fighter-like starfighters, Governor Tarkin, the clone troopers that now bear their resemblance to stormtroopers, the blockade runner, Darth Vader, the Death Star, etc. Wow."
1559,6,The End (?),"Of course it's not really ""The End"", but an End to the ""new"" trilogy, that Lucas shot, to find a closure to the Star Wars phenomenon! But also the birth of a special character. It's quite impossible, that you don't know, whom I'm talking about, but just in case, I won't mention the name! "
1560,10,They saved the best for last. It really was a great end to the saga.,"Now I have to be serious. People, Listen. TO the fans that enjoyed this movie, you have great taste. In my opinion this is the perfect end to the greatest saga - Sci-Fi or not. To the ""Special"" people who gave it one, or two stars, where you really watching the same movie as the rest of us, or did your Brokeback Mountain DVD break from to much ""Enjoyment""? Huh, let's be honest, this movie was Fantastic. To start, the story between the lines has to be understood to truly appreciate this movie. Sideous' manipulation of Anakin. Anakin breaking the Jedi code and impregnating Padme. And finally his fall to the Dark side. This was a movie of all movies. The beginning was a total all out battle that was unreal. After all that goes on, with the war, General Grievous, and Count Dooku. Yes it is all there. However the main part of the story was the total downfall of Anakin and his becoming Darth Vader. Also of importance was the fall of the Jedi and the rise of the Empire. After losing his Mother in Ep II, Anakin would do ANYTHING to save Padme. Yes Sideous was manipulating him, However after Years in battle, Anakin was really in need of Padme and their Love. This movie has everything a Star Wars fan, Excuse me everything a REAL Star Wars fan could ask for. After Anakin was informed that Palpitine was the Dark Lord of the Sith, that was the moment in the saga. Anakin comes in as Sideous was ""being Arrested"" Sideous apparently set it up so he could be ""weak"" at Anakin's time of confusion. Anakin reacted. When he cut off Mace Windu's arm that was all Sideous needed. He disposed of Windu, and made Anakin pledge his allegiance to The way of the Sith. He was lost to the Dark Side.(Until the eventual redemption in Ep VI.) The ultimate battle (After the fall of the Jedi) Anakin vs. Obi-Wan, the best Lightsaber battle in the whole saga. This was mixed Nicely with the battle of Yoda Vs. Darth Sideous. In the end Most people knew how the movie would end. The ride to the end was Spectacular. THe end was all I expected and More. All in all the greatest Star Wars movie ever. This was the greatest Saga in History."
1561,7,The Force is stronger with this one...,"""Star Wars"" is back... and the Force is stronger with this one. Episode III in the saga (and also the final Star Wars film) is a better showing than the previous two prequels (""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones""). The plot is solid, the effects are excellent and the action is real. There's everything a Star Wars fan could want: lightsabers, villains, Darth Vader, Luke and Leia... But the film lacks something: magic. ""Revenge"" fails to recapture the magic of the original ""Star Wars"" films, although it certainly gives a valiant effort, and toward the end of the film it comes very close. But it never really fully grabs on to that mystical quality that was so evident in those original films."
1562,9,Top 10 Reasons to Love It & Hate It,Top Ten Reasons to Love It 
1563,7,Good bridge,"Everybody p*sses and moans about the quality of acting in these prequel films. Hello people! Was there ever a WORSE actor to grace the screen than Mark Hamill?? ""I'm Luke Skywalker, and I'm here to rescue you!"" Hayden Christiansen would not be my choice to play Hamlet, and there are probably a lot of other young actors who could have more serviceably probed the depths of despair to which Anakin Skywalker falls, but he's certainly as good as Hamill was with a much more demanding role. I actually can see why Anakin would have grown disenchanted with the Jedi-they're portrayed as a snobby, elitist bunch of bureaucrats in all three films (the Sith really can't be any more annoying than these guys, they're like a bunch of IRS agents), not to mention incredibly WEAK-they all fall like dominoes the minute they are turned on. Where is all this incredible strength of the Force? What good is it if you can't count on it when the chips are down? The only Jedis really worth their mettle in this respect are Obi-Wan and Yoda. It serves them right that they all get wiped out. It's also hard to believe that emotional high-flying adventure seeker Obi-Wan Kenobi is transformed into the genteel, reclusive Ben Kenobi by the time A New Hope rolls around. Having said all that, I really enjoyed this film. It's of course visually appealing, and Anakin's manipulation from a desperate young man who wants to save his wife and his universe, who believes what he is doing is best for both, is quite powerful. Ian McDiarmid is the perfect Iago, the evil Sith Lord who really steals the show and gives a face and personality to the Emperor that we never saw in the original episodes. Without him, I don't think this film would have held my interest the way it did. Good movie, good bridge to the sequels. Star Wars is back."
1564,10,Much Better Than The First Two,"As I watched ""Revenge of the Sith,"" a few things went through my mind. First off, I was wondering how George Lucas was able to make such a good film after two terrible ones. I wasn't expecting to enjoy Episode III, but I found that I really did."
1565,9,Nevertheless a wonderful movie,"I am really surprised that there are so many comments about how bad the movie is because of cheesy lines or plot holes or too much special effects, or how great the movie is because of the cool battles or the final revelations in the plot-line. What I did not see is what in my opinion is the essence of this movie - the story of betrayal, of a tragic turn-out of a life. I left the theater shaken, because the story so much relates to real life - it's always the best people that suffer the most. That is Anakin's sin - he is the most gifted, the most promising, and may be the Chosen One. So what he gets is hatred, envy, mistreatment. His best friend and mentor betrays him, in such a disgusting sneaky way. The love of his life does not understand him and denies him support. The Jedi council (that probably stands for a bunch of hopelessly senile conscious-operated opportunists) does everything in its powers to turn him to the dark side (including letting his mother die as a slave and not letting him save her). Everything the Jedi council does is a screaming example of injustice and short-sightedness. Is it surprising then that they not only miss Anakin's turning to the dark side, but also actually cause it? And not only that, they later even accuse him of betrayal (!!!), Obi-Wan's arrogance (or maybe bad memory?) reaches the skies - after making Anakin believe that even Padme had betrayed him (by sneaking on the ship), after cutting off his legs, he leaves Anakin all burnt over, as he says - to the will of the force. What a masterpiece of hypocrisy! Fortunately, there is someone that does care for Anakin and he survives. Obi-Wan's arrogance has another dimension too - he spreads the rumor that Darth Vader hunts down and kills all the Jedi, while apart from the quite accidental death of Mace Windu, Anakin does not participate in any murder. Well, apart from the kids, which Anakin would never have done, if Lucas didn't have to put it in the script to justify his being a bad guy, while the Jedi are the good guys. He just had to do something horrible, otherwise the Jedi would have undoubtedly be considered by everyone in the Universe the worst villains ever. At least finally we had the pleasure of their removal from the world for good (except Luke though). Given how these supposedly high-moral-values knights give away centuries of education and training at the first sight of threat (""we should not kill unarmed people, but, damn, it's not that a big deal""), their extinction really brings joy to the heart. All in all, the world's a dark place and Anakin's fate confirms that - not only does he lose his loved ones (wife and unborn children), but is even denied his so-much-earned revenge - most of the Jedi are dead, and only after many years he gets to face Obi-Wan. So despite the plot-holes and cheesy lines: Excellent movie!"
1566,4,In my opinion Star Wars episode 3 was really bad,"i am not much of a film critic i absolutely hated this film, it had many clichés such as when Anikan Skywalker found out that Padamae died, with his cry ""NOOOOOO!!!!!!"" i found this so deeply stupendous, i must admit, it was better that the other 2 recent star wars films but, this is just mildly better. the soundtrack in my opinion was too similar to the rest of the films, and they were just so boring, no offense to George Lucas he should not have bothered making another 3 films, he should of just sat on his billions and watch the money grow in the bank. the fight scene had too many special effects, and were too long. In my opinion the acting was terrible, most of the actors had a lot of talent and George Lucas and his associates gave them such bad lines. For example Samuel L Jackson had such a minor role and his abilities of acting was not put to the test. There were some good scenes such as when R2-D2 fought off the larger and stronger battle droids, and when Yoda fought in his scenes, but as mentioned above the fight scenes were too long and too complex. "
1567,10,My favourite film,"An absolutely perfect final, although it was clear what was going on, I kept wondering how Lucas could make it all right. The truth is that there are a lot of doubts and trifles I liked and dipped in the world of speculation. Nevertheless, to close it, since this is a film for thousands of lines, perfect acting, directing, effects, masks and all Lucas's world, the best film best saga !!!"
1568,5,Star Wars Let Down,"The first 3 Star Wars movies (Episodes 4,5 and 6) were of a different era, and remain great films. The latter episodes (Episodes 1, 2 and 3) seem to have gone steadily downhill, culminating in this last, disappointing installment. Lucas seems to have gone back to the drawing board years later, and just couldn't recapture the magic of his earlier films. I have continuously felt that the choice of Hayden Christensen in the pivotal role of Anarkin Skywalker/Darth Vader was a critical casting mistake. He was just too lightweight to carry that role. His acting is consistently wooden, and he never, ever made me feel he could be larger-than-life, heroic or ... Darth Vader. He seems petulant and immature throughout, and suffered next to better actors, especially Natalie Portman in their unbelievable romance. Almost all of their love affair seemed corny,stiff and embarrassing to me, never natural or magical. Often, the script-writing just seemed to fail the movie ... the dialog often felt flat and meaningless. Somehow, it just didn't 'click'. There were times when I felt that Lucas was trying too hard to cram all the plot elements in, to sew up everything. Most certainly this and the latter movies were overloaded with special effects to a fault. Naturally, there have been great strides in special effects since the earlier moves, but this isn't an issue of using better effects, but rather of over-using them; just overwhelming the plots and actors with too much going on, especially the battles. While some are great to watch, the overall effect is that they dwarf the human conflicts and smaller battles, kind of grinding down everything in their wake. After a while, the light saber duels were just redundant and tedious. I kind of liked Episode 1, although I think too much time was spent on the little boy and his big race. Episodes 2 and this, 3, were serious let-downs, as all of my comments above took serious hold. I'm kind of sorry for this, and almost wish Lucas could do it again better. As it is, we have to live with what he had created. Fact is that sequels rarely live up to the originals. The first three films were really one long one, and this follow-up of the last three films just couldn't maintain. Good eye candy, but they leave one feeling let down, not jubilant or inspired. I suspect that less discriminating viewers will find less fault with the latter films, but I think they are bound to rate second-best to the originals."
1569,8,Darkness descends spectacularly,"After the two previous attempts by George Lucas to tell the Star Wars tale I was a little sceptical about seeing the Revenge of the Sith. And so going into the screening I was consciously looking out for the faults that dogged the other movies on a regular basis. But rest-assured this time Lucas delivers, sure there are clunky moments but the story powers on at such a pace you find yourself caught up in the demise of the republic. By the end, the story has plunged so far into darkness you want to go home and whack A New Hope in the DVD player just to reassure yourself that the good guys win after all. And so unlike any of the other films in the series ""Revenge"" leaves a sadness in the air that even a Frozen Han Solo cannot compare to."
1570,10,a great movie,"I'm one of those people who loved both Episodes I and II. Episode III backed me up with keeping the faith. For me, the series came to its logical conclusion and more importantly came full circle. This episode clearly shows how and why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. It also shows the circumstances surrounding the birth of Luke and Leia and why they were separated. We also saw how the Old Repubic became the Galatic Empire. This movie is the best of the prequels and has several great action scenes. There is a terrific space battle at the beginning. There is not just one great light saber battles but five. There are Anakin vs. Dount Dooku, Obi Wan vs. General Grievous, Mace Windu vs. the Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine, Yoda vs. the Emperor, and best of all Anakin vs. Obi Wan. What more can I say except see this movie as many times as you can."
1571,7,Mixed experience,"This could have been a superb movie, but three things ruins it: Hayden Christensens acting, Obi-Wans silly comments and the cheesy love liners between Padmé and Anakin."
1572,6,Almost everything it needed to be,"The biggest movie franchise of all time deserves the biggest ending, and the Revenge Of The Sith is certainly big, but like many big things, it's also ever-so-slightly clumsy."
1573,,Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith,"There is just too much for me to talk about to be able to write in a single comment. Just see this movie. Better yet, watch them all together. I have, and it works. So Artoo doesn't use his jet rockets in Return of the Jedi, so what? We're talking more than a 20 year span between this and A New Hope. He could be intentionally falling into the sand, he could have had them removed. Who knows. Who cares? Everything else just friggin works. This movie, like Episode I and Episode II, is plot heavy to an extreme. Each sequence has meaning. Every Anakin scene adds extra momentum to the next Anakin scene. Without those lovey dovey scenes with Padme, his turn to the dark side doesn't work. If you don't see those scenes for what they are, his turn will seem forced and too quick. And if you don't include the events in Attack of the Clones, it still won't work. Every time Anakin makes a decision, something happens in another scene to change his mind or cement his decision, and just adds more fuel to the fire for him to make the ultimate choice, and he figures he has no other choice, and that's what adds conflict to his dilemma. It's no wonder his actions and his choice to join the dark side make him cry."
1574,7,"As personally not a fan of ""Star Wars"", I liked it","My dad has always been undoubtedly a bigger Star Wars fan than I was, and when he wanted me to come see this movie with him I showed up for the popcorn. Star Wars has never exactly been my taste, as none of the other movies really caught my interest. But luckily I was convinced to come to this one, and I was pleasantly surprised by its outcome. With expectations of simply sitting through it, I was entertained by its great storyline and amazing movie effects. It's action-packed, with a little bit of comedy, and an awesome final installment to make any Star Wars fan happy. I recommend this to anyone with a taste for action and adventure, and maybe not even that big of a fan of the series to be honest."
1575,8,"""Sith Happens"" (possible spoilers)",I went in to this expecting a pile of Sith. What I got was a tour de Force. Not bad.
1576,4,"""The good one""","This is the best movie in the abysmal prequel trilogy however, that is not saying much. This movie is still bad. Bad dialogue, weird story points, pointless padding the awful prequel trilogy stuff is still here, but the thing is, stuff happens in this movie! Oh my goodness gracious, people actually do stuff! After the absolutely, mind boggling boredom and suffering of the first two prequels, this is a welcome movie. Still not good, but average and that can be considered a masterpiece when compared to the first two."
1577,4,Does not add up,"I am watching this movie right now and can only think how stupid Lucas was to make the trilogy in the way he made it. The movies look much more futuristic than the three original films which were supposed to take place later. There are creatures and robots we have never seen before and one question I would like to know is why are droids like Grievous (who has a cough!!?) wearing clothes like cloaks? Lucas should have at least kept the look of the older movies - just because he could have more spectacular effects he was so wrong to employ them. Far too much green screen has been used and it has affected the actors' performances. They are not convinced they are really there and neither are we. Hayden Christensen would make a tree look animated and even Ewan Macgregor always sounds as though he would rather be somewhere else. Too much money has been lavished on these newer films and they are nowhere near as good as the first three. its 2013 and I am watching this again on TV. My original thoughts have not really changed. Ewan seems to be in another sort of movie from the way he delivers his lines. the screen is filled to bursting with action in the fight scenes but that does not make them as good as the original movies action sequences. Just because they could does not mean that they should have gone well over the top with creatures ,droids, robots and spaceships."
1578,3,Unpopular opinion: worst of the prequels,The story is very disjointed. Anakin turns to the dark side and starts killing children on a dime. The actor playing Palpatine is ridiculously hammy-like B movie bad acting. Just awful. Even The Phantom Menace is better than this garbage. The fight scenes are okay.
1579,7,A half-baked conclusion to the prequels,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith stars Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, and Natalie Portman, and is directed by George Lucas. And this is also the final chapter to the Star Wars prequels and what I enjoyed is that the team balanced Obi Wan taking Anakin under his wing into becoming a Jedi to Anakin becoming Darth Vader. But I do think that this could've been done smoother, instead of having felt rushed and forced to the point where they just want to show you the events leading up to episode four. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, but if I were to describe this, I would call it a guilty pleasure. I will say that I will give everyone credit for creating a half-baked story in which the hero transforms into the villain. It may not be executed correctly, but at least they didn't turn Anakin into the dark side because he didn't get accepted into the Jedi council and wasn't a spoiled brat. He had his moments here and there, but at least unlike some movies involving the hero becoming the villain, he took a step back to reflect on his actions, and then later betrayed everyone. I always feel like the script writers are lazy when it comes to the prequels, but since this is the last one, they gave this a serious makeover to it, and sprinkled in some cheesy dialogue for the good old times. But what it lacks in script writing makes up for it in action and music, as those two go very good together like cookies and cream. Even if this film sucked I still would say that the music and those action scenes make up for it. So in the end, it may not be the final conclusion I was expecting, but at least everyone tried their best to give us a conclusion that ties everything together."
1580,6,Loose ends didn't need to be tidied up,"what a load of rubbish - loose ends don't always need to be tied up - the stupidest moment was when darth is told that wifey is dead - and he yells out 'Noooooooo!' hehehe Really, Anakin was such a stupid character - how could he be dumb enough to believe that the Jedi wanted power in the Senate - how could he be dumb enough to weigh the life of his wife over the lives of countless others - he had a choice and made the wrong one - a criminal choice."
1581,5,I just kept wanting to gouge my eyes out,"OK, we have to set thing straight once and for all. I do not claim to be some sort of Star Wars purist, but I must comment on the visual effects."
1582,5,Lucas came close but not close enough!,"This movie was far better than Ep> 1&2 but we may have Spielberg to thank for that! He quietly helped out his friend. But what Lucas needed was another director, producer, script writer, casting director, etc. As good as the movie was it should have been better. In the 1st 3, we are given the idea the jedi were very powerful but all throughout the 2nd 3 they are not all they were made out to be. Very simple mistakes were made by Lucas which shown that a once great creator had lost his ability to create and his ability to use good judgement in determining what is good and not good entertainment. The 1st signs of his weakness was in the Special Editions of Star Wars. Lucas made so many bad changes to the originals. It clearly shown that he was out of step and off track. We've all heard the gripes over the Greedo scene but one change he made shows that one of Lucas' problems is that he has no respect for the viewer. A scene inserted in S.E. Empire Strikes Back near the end of the movie is an unused camera angle shot of a scene from Return of the Jedi. Vader leaves Cloud City and returns to his ship, a large greeting party is assembled. This was his arrival scene from Return. But another problem is why would Vader receive a grand welcoming for simply returning to his ship? What a stupid idea Lucas had there! In Revenge of the Sith, Lucas, the one time strength is now the big weakness. He doesn't seem able to bring the great story he has written to life. He also is so busy paying homage to Spielberg and the sci fi movies of his childhood he doesn't focus on what he needs to do. He succeeds in making the ships and sound effects and some characters look and sound like the old serials he loved as a child but the end result is unappealing. The greatest sound effect in Star Wars is the lightsabers but he plays music during the fights and no pride was put into the making of the sound as with the 1st 3. Lucas once said Return of the Jedi was about ""Tech fails."" He should have learned that lesson. All through out Ep 1,2,3, Lucas seems to be out to prove the worth of cpu effects! Once again his mind is not on the movie itself but in a personal fascination. In ep 2,3,4 we saw some cool battles with X-wings ties the Falcon but here we have ugly ships that are to be reminiscent of the sci fi of the 1950's, flying in battles so fast you cant see them. A contrast to the great dogfights we saw in the earlier Star Wars! Lucas used his mighty cpu's to do the light sabers and the lightsaber went from spectacular to florescent lightbulbs! The Emperor's battle with Yoda was a huge flop. Palpatine's appearance changed and his intellect did as well. In his fight with Yoda he laughs acts like small time villain from a Spider-man movie. Lucas lost his edge and only he seems to be unaware of it!"
1583,9,Awesome,"Before i start i would like to make clear that i was one of these weird people that ordered their tickets two months in advance to see this film, i even went to a cinema about 10 miles away from my nearest one because the showing was an hour earlier! So you can tell i had very high hopes. I sat down, stomach churning, i was so excited, and when the familiar music blasted through the speakers i could barley hold it in, wow, three years of waiting were about to end, it was here! To be honest the film was over in what seemed like seconds, it was over whelming, the only thing that made me know that i HAD been sitting there for 2 and a half hours, was the numbness in my non facial cheeks! The movie was near perfect, i sat through the film crossing my fingers praying that George Lucas hadn't written in any cheesy lines or embarrassingly weird moments between certain characters, then right at the end i was just beginning to think yes he's done it, there was no cheesiness, he had avoided awkwardness, the dialogue, the action was perfect. But then, as i was just about to say it was perfect, it happened...""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"". NOOOO indeed Darth, disaster, i cringed at the cheesiness and put my head in my hands, wtf was this. I mean i can totally understand why he did it, Anakin had only JUST become Darth and he still had warm fuzzy feelings for Padme, that's fair enough. But i do believe that Mr Lucas could have come up with a slightly less cringe worthy way of saying that Anakin was majorly upset. Any way, I've had my little chew at the movie; i can't condemn it to the pits of Hell for about 7 seconds of footage. The film otherwise as i said was perfect, it was visually pleasing, the computer graphics were phenomenal. The acting of the entire cast was breath taking, Hayden Christenson had lost the unnaturalness in his acting that appeared in the previous film and was portraying emotion and feeling like he meant it. Natalie Portman was even better than she had been in the previous two films, which i find to be nearly impossible as she was perfect in the previous, i guess you can improve on perfection. She also managed to bag the best line in possibly film History, that's my opinion any way ""So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause."" Awesome! Ewan McGregor was amazing, he always is, he is the only person who could ever play the young Ben Kenobi, congrats on that! Ian McDiarmid was an awesomely scary emperor and completely stole the show with his freakish likeness to the original emperor. Samuel L Jackson made his character come to life....and death, wielding a purple light sabour. Only he could pull this off because he is sooo cool!, if any other actor had taken on the role of Mace Windu and started killing storm troupers with a PURPLE light sabour i think we would be wondering if something was going on between him and the little green dude! "
1584,8,A fitting end to a brilliant series????,"I went to see it last night and to be honest i was disappointed. The opening scene was spectacular to say the least, partly down to the big screen no doubt! There were some very good moments that make Star Wars such an event, but ultimately the film seemed very rushed. Anakins change to the dark side almost seemed like an after thought ( i know it wasn't by the way!) and should have been dealt with in more depth. The massacre of all the Jedi also seemed rushed, what was George thinking? ""Damn forgot to kill them all, ah well"" As for the giant lizard riding. As usual though the special effects were spot on."
1585,9,A good ending to the series.,SPOILERS INSIDE... SPOILERS INSIDE...
1586,10,A definite classic! Excellent orchestral music & visual effects,"This is the only one of two Star Wars movies I have seen on first run - the other one is the original Star Wars movie I went to see with my Dad. He was especially excited due to the inclusion of holograms in the film, and holography was the center of his doctoral dissertation."
1587,1,This movie as horrible as any,"If you think this movie is cool, then I have news for you. You are wrong. First, it starts out in the middle of a stupid battle that makes no sense at all. Anakin Skywalker grows more and more towards the dark side of the force, and Obi Wan Kenobi doesn't even tell until the end. Padme Amidala acting in this movie is practically non-existent (I am not sure if this is a bad thing, might be a good thing). Then a stupid clichéd fight on a volcano, and the Anakin is Darth Vader. Thats all about this movie. Special effects? NEWS FLASH: This movie doesn't have any special effects. These kind of effects are found virtually in every sci-fi movie today."
1588,7,"I wish they would make episodes 7,8, and 9!","What am I going to do now I have no Star Wars to look forward to? OK, so I have Harry Potter (the book and the movie) - but Star Wars was my first big movie memory, and now George Lucas says it is over."
1589,9,Awards are for sure for this movie,"If a man can write and direct a super movie like star wars of many episodes and years later he writes again and does a prequel of it is astonishing. It takes a genius man to write and direct the prequel of the mega blockbuster movie of all time. I'm sure he will receive standing ovations at the awards later, you can count on that."
1590,7,"I was a skeptic about all that hype, but it's all true, and worth every dime.","I was a skeptic about all that hype. All those advertisements all the previews. Yecch. The ads are everywhere and, like always, I figured that they were overcompensating for a poorly-written script wrapped in shiny CG graphics and spearheaded by a clever marketing guy looking to pickpocket a handful of singles in exchange for a couple hours of disappointment. This time around, I didn't think it was remotely possible for ANYTHING to live up to this kind of hype."
1591,6,I think the other two jaded me.....,I wanted this movie to rock me. I wanted it to blow me away...... but i just sat there picking holes in it.
1592,4,"Failed with style, again","I mean honestly. If my legs and arm were cut off I think I'd make a little more racket than a silent whimper. I went to this movie expecting more than what I got. Thanks everyone for your great reviews, but I still stand in my opinion than George Lucas can't write and direct worth a damn. I mean this in only what his 7 film ever. Come on. Oh and my favorite line of all. ""Please Aniken hold me like you did by the lake of Nabu."" Who says crap like that!! I do have to admit that it did follow through fairly decent for the next three movies. If only someone else was given the script it could have been an amazing film. "
1593,10,The movie reveals the answers to many of your questions,"The final battle of the Clone Wars is coming to a close. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is haunted by a premonition that Padme (Natalie Portman), his pregnant wife will die during childbirth. Anakin is put on the Jedi council, but he is not made a Master Jedi. Anakin is seduced by the dark side of the Force when he joins the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Anakin, now known as Darth Vader, and Palpatine conspire to eliminate all Jedi Knights and rule the galaxy. The Republic has crumbled, and the evil Galactic Empire is now ruled by Emperor Palpatine."
1594,,Kick ass movie,"Well this is a kick ass movie. Certainly the best of all six star wars movies and the trilogy now makes sense. It also finally explains who the emperor is, and it shows how Anakin converted to the Dark side of the force. But a warning to those who are parents it is actually a bit scary (SPOILER) in a suspenseful way when Anakin is becoming Darth Vader and shouldn't be viewed by the little ones. This will frighten them! Otherwise it was a huge box office success and I highly recommend it to everyone except the younger star wars fans under the age of four. The special effects are certainly brilliant. (SPOILER) And the fight between Anakin and Obi-One is what makes the movie KICK ASS. By however; when Padme' dies it is very sad and how she dies I won't tell you. I Recommend this movie to all people."
1595,7,At last The Circle is now complete,Review: The Long-awaited Star Wars story we've all been waiting for is here. In the final movie of the infamous prequel trilogy we finally see Anakin skywalker become Darth Vader and his former friend Obi-Wan is forced to fight him.. I love how everything just went full circle and set the stage is for the classic trilogy.
1596,6,George Lucas has failed to deliver the excitement and enjoyment craved by millions.,"I saw this when it was out at the cinema, and despite some poor acting, cheesy dialogue and the over-use of CG, I quite enjoyed it. I'm a fan of the original films and it was interesting to see how Lucas had written himself out of a sticky situation! However, having watched it again on DVD a few nights ago, I have to say that I found the film to be very disappointing. "
1597,,Otherworldly,"Star Wars: Episode III--Revenge of the Sith Grade: A Director: George Lucas Screenplay: Lucas Cast: Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge), Natalie Portman (Closer), Hayden Christensen (Shattered Glass) Rating: PG John DeSando, WCBE's ""It's Movie Time"""
1598,10,The Best Prequel Out of All The Prequels,"I thought this one was better than the previous prequels. I felt this one had the best special effects and storyline. I was not disappointed at this one at all. George Lucas still hasn't lost his touch with this movie. In this one, Star Wars fans get a better perspective on how Darth Vader orginated. At first he's just a Jedi who turns to the darkside. Of course, all Star Wars fans know that. But the not so serious ones like me get a better perspective on how Anakin Skywalker turns to the darkside. "
1599,8,And so the saga is now complete...,Star Wars: Episode III  Revenge of the Sith 
1600,2,"Graphically spectacular, a few good moments, but this film brings only closure, not insight or even entertainment","To see the original Star Wars as a child was to step into a science fantasy world of white knights, black baddies, strange creatures, androids & robots, heroes, princesses who are also heroes, cool spaceships, lots of fire-fights, and not least, a kind of magic. However Revenge of the Sith might more accurately be named Return of the Sh-it."
1601,5,They Finally Got the Revenge Title!,"And FINALLY, he got it (mostly) right."
1602,8,"Lucas, you have done well... sort of.","I'm sorry, I just can't give this movie a perfect score. That being said, 'Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith' is an explosive finale to the beloved saga that all of us grew up with."
1603,6,Arse-faced Emperor,"Minor spoiler included: I share the disappointment of many of the reviewers over the speed of Anakin's descent and the inhumane obstetric practices (an audience for childbirth? Please...). I also wondered how it is that when the large spaceship started its nosedive into the planet, everything inside it started falling. Either (a) the ship has artificial gravity of some kind, which must pull everything to the floor regardless of orientation, or (b) the artificial gravity stopped working, in which cast the contents of the ship would fall at the same rate as the ship itself, effectively making the ship's passengers and contents weightless."
1604,5,The best of the prequels (but not by much),"The saga is now complete with ""Revenge of the Sith"" which ties up most of the loose ends and leads into the original trilogy nicely but the results are still a mixed bag."
1605,4,"An awful script, screenplay, dialogue and everything","I have two recos: 1. If you are a fan of star wars, then watch this film just for the satisfaction of having completed the circle of 6. That's all. 2. If you are not a fan of star wars, do not watch this film. At least that will save us the fans of the series some embarrassment. It will also prevent you from thinking that all star wars movies are like this one. My reasons: 1. All sequels degenerate and this is a natural law. ""Revenge"" sadly enough is the worst. Somehow, empire strikes back was an exception coz it was almost as good as the first one. From return of jedi onwards, lucas has been on the downhill path with the sentimental foolishness getting the better of him. The series reaches its nadir with ""revenge"". Along with his hero, Lucas has degenerated from Good Storyteller to Darth Megabore. 2.In short, you will not be impressed by the gadgetry and special effects. Nothing special there. The light saber battles were already getting tiresome but the man does not give up. He had gotten into the bad habit of dragging them on. The dignified encounter between Obie Won and Vader in Star wars has degenerated into a special effects bonanza in the climactic fight between obie won and anakin (obviously all of you know this from Alec Guiness telling so in the first one). The sequence dragged on without any point. It is almost like the film makers were desperate to find special effects that have not been used. So new animals, new space craft, new planets of molten lava/ metal are introduced. Some new machines too used by that new creature General Grievous. It is very clear that the entire team is bankrupt of ideas and they were trying to fill 140 minutes with gimmickry. In star wars too there was all this gadgetry but it was much more elegantly and consistently done. For instance, the stormtroopers had one type of craft and the rebels, another. Over the years, there seem to be so many designs, that it will defy and boggle the minds of any galactic federation if there is ever going to be one. 3. Many noted that Christensen is not the best choice for the adult anakin at the time of ""clones"". This movie proves that. The transformation to Darth Vader is very clumsily done. And Christensen just cannot give the evil look. He does not have it in him. No one is looking for logic in this kind of fantasy. But lucas sets out to tell a ""heart-wrenching"" tale. If so, he should have paid a little more attention to detail such as the human mind (ok, jedi mind). The jedi know that anakin is under bad influence; but they do not tell him he should take care. It is almost like a bad boss who knows you are making mistakes but does not tell you how to avoid them. Do you think such bosses should survive? Anyway, if they are so stupid, how did they become the wise council? Moreover, the number of jedi shown since the infamous episode 1 and their forms reek of Star Trek anthropomorphism. Starwars, empire and return had grotesque creatures, and they were just that. They had effect. The jedi here on the other hand look like stupid can-can dancers. 4.If you grew up on star wars like i did (and have the same frame of mind), you will hate this nuisance intrusion of padme amidala- it sounds like a south Indian name: padma aamudala- she is a waste of precious screen time, and I do not feel that lucas achieved his objective of capturing the fears and greed of anakin with those scenes. Let us face it. Lucas has forgotten how to make drama after graffiti. And star wars does not lend itself to drama anyway. 5. Finally, I will not reveal the entire plot, but suffice it to say when you finally see who Darth Sideous is, and you step back a couple of episodes, you will start asking very awkward questions. Like I said, this is a team that is bankrupt of ideas but saddled with a lot of technology, and they put it to use without imagination. It is really sad to see that the series ended this way."
1606,4,disappointing,"I can't write anything new that hasn't been written many times over. The trailer looked awesome and that's as good as it got. ""Phantom Menace"" (and I'm not sure what that refers to) was weak. ""Clones"" was much better (not great, but at least up to ""Jedi"" standards). I was really hoping for a blow-out, in the ballgame sense, not the tire sense. What a letdown."
1607,10,Best stars wars movie ever!,"When I first saw that movie back when it came out to the cinemas I had low hopes of seeing something good especially because the first movie was OK and the second awful. To my surprise all of that lead to such an epic finale to the trilogy with on the most badass villains we have ever witnessed. It felt like watching Tommy Oliver in ""Green with Evil"" but in a star wars universe. Being a huge power rangers fan myself it gave me the exact same feeling."
1608,1,"Utter, utter crap.","I just wanted to write 'crap' as a comment, but IMDb requires a ten-line summary. Writing 'crap' ten times would suffice my loathing of this film, but that would be churlish."
1609,7,"Not saying much, but still the best in the first trilogy","Despite the pretty disappointing Episode 1. This third installment is my favorite in the first trilogy. This is the movie that most of the fans was waiting for. How the Jedi Anakin joins the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader. Sure the romance elements is corny once again and the manipulation elements in the story could have been executed better. But this was a fun action packed thrill ride from start to finish. The whole plot is basically about politics once again, backstabbing and manipulation. Again the flow of it and development of the story could have been more in-depth, but it's passable. The special effects even got a major upgrade and really makes watching the galactic battles much more appealing. I really didn't like Hayden Christensen playing Anakin the future Darth Vader. His expression was just so wooden and his portrayal was just more annoying than intimidating. And his character was more of a prick than an actual badass villain. The main redeeming quality of this movie is of course the lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. Although the finishing didn't make much sense, like bunch of other parts in this Trilogy. However it still has the best lightsaber fight when it comes to Episode 1 through Episode 6. Not the most emotional or story driven but the most entertaining lightsaber fight when it comes to the execution. Although it ain't saying much this is the best Star Wars movie in the first Trilogy."
1610,6,Script writers gone dumb... ?,"I can't say how disappointed I am with Episode III. Its been quite a while since I've seen such weak plot devices, bad script and awful acting. Sure its better than Episodes I and II but that isn't exactly praise worthy."
1611,5,I'm not very excited about this.....,The good thing about this movie is that it tied the two trilogies together and explained Darth Vader's fall from grace.
1612,3,Biggest Hollywood sham since Cleopatra,"I'll admit it. I was never a big fan of the Star Wars series. The films were OK, but I never thought they that bad. The first three were OK for entertainment purposes. Episode 1 was average, Attack of the Clones was poor. I should have seen what was coming next. The pattern was there:"
1613,2,Sith is an anagram of...,"Well, at least it's slightly less awful than the previous two films, but that doesn't make it good. Many seem to think that Sith somehow finally delivers a ""real"" Star Wars movie - to me it's pretty much just more of the same. The plot sets out to explain the rise of Darth Vader and the evil empire, but the three prequels barely amounts to one film of actual new and/or valuable information."
1614,6,Best one of the prequels,"Revenge of the Sith is the best one of the prequels. There is emotion and power in this episode far beyond Episode I and II. Plus, there are a lot of lightsabers in this one. More lightsabers = better, in my opinion."
1615,9,A ling time ago..we would have never thought it would be this good,"Star Wars 3 is without the whole ""kiddy"" look of Star Wars. All of the other SW films are rated PG, with a little violence. But.. Revenage of the Sith is the only one rated PG-13. And it should have that rating too. It is the darkest of all the SW films. Mixed with great acting and special effects, ROTS shows us how Ankian SkyWalker really became Darth Vader. On paper, it sounds kind of stupid. But, somehow George Lucus creates an unbelievable film, from start to finish. The music is great and the plot is even better. It's a ""new"" age love story. The kind that nerds will like. The relationship between Ankain and Panmde is such a hard thing to watch. You know Ankain is going to the dark side and is leaving behind a wife and a child. In the end, Esipode 3 is a movie you have to see. The final 15 minutes of this film is unbelievable. The transformation between good and evil is at it's finest in this film."
1616,9,Someone has put the fun back into Star Wars!,"And who would have thought, it would be George himself. Finally we got some of the wisecracks back, the things Han Solo provided us in the OT, and were severely missed in the other prequels."
1617,9,"An excellent, if flawed, finale!","There are some surprises in Episode III, the first of which is most likely that it is actually coherent and gripping to watch. Unlike Ep.I which drug on and on in the middle, encumbered by an unexciting pod race to which the conclusion was a no-brainer (and is painfully longer on DVD) and barely resurrected by the excellent duel at the end with the mediocre space battle and silly-as-hell ground war; or Ep.II which held no plot and had an ending so muddled it barely makes sense and leaves you scratching your head; Ep.III has a tight plot and an emotional center."
1618,10,Saving the best until last,"An amazing technical feat, but also an incredibly well scripted prelude to the story to come. Sure, there may be a minor few holes and some awkward acting, but this is the definitive prequel we've been waiting for. "
1619,6,"Over-hyped, poorly written","Matrix III was bad, this is worse. Thanks for wasting my time Lucas. I feel like a sucker for giving that idiot my money. I've heard better dialog on Teletubbies. IMDb requires that I write 10 lines, but I don't have much else to say. Don't reward Lucas for this crappy movie. Borrow the DVD from your Star Wars nerd buddy when it comes out. Still trying to decide who's worse, Christian Haydensen (sp?) or Keano Reeves. At least Christian can blame Lucas' writing. Even Sam L. Jackson couldn't bring life to that poorly written mess. All the Lame commercials, all the years of hype....and we end up with this turd of a movie. Only the most dedicated nerds would like this one... too much money wrapped up in silly toys and such to admit they've wasted their life on this half baked mess. Thats all I got. Again, wait for the DVD. Don't be a sucker like me."
1620,3,Painful... but at least the jedi fights are good,"Obviously, a film of this kind is going to use a ton of special effects. Actually, it's safe to say that were it not for CGI, this film could never even have been made, but somebody please justify how the performances are as soulless as the graphics, with the cast stumbling on woeful dialogue that any first-time screenwriter would have earned the notes of, ""Give up... now"" were he to have written."
1621,5,"Best one of the new trilogy, but still not a patch on the originals","This is one movie that a lot of people have been waiting for for a long time, mainly because we get to see Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader. In this final episode of the new trilogy we find out that Padme is pregnant but Anakin has been having nightmares that she will die giving birth. Anakin finds out that there might be a way to save her from this possible fate. Emperor Palptaine has been discovered to be the last of the Sith Lords and has been learning the dark side of the Force which has given him greater powers than the Jedi. As Palpatine and Anakin have become close friends, Palpatine takes Skywalker under his wing and turns him to the dark side and into Darth Vader."
1622,8,The Best Star Wars Film,"This movie is outstanding. It is by far the most well-acted movie of the prequels. It is also the darkest and most emotional movie of the saga. Featuring 5 lightsaber battles, it is definitely the most action-packed of the movies. From the opening scene with the space battle on Coruscant to the closing scene with the sunset on Tatooine, the movie never loses the attention of the viewer. Sir Ian McDiarmid (Chancellor Palpatine) did an AMAZING job with his acting, as did Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi). The end duels were brilliantly choreographed and the longest in cinematic history. The best part: No Jar-Jar Binks. Well done George Lucas. And thank you for nearly 30 years of cinematic history."
1623,7,A Strong if Not Perfect Beginning,"28 May 2005. What goes around, comes around. Getting to the start of the Star Wars in the last movie (episode III) almost didn't make it. The first half of the movie was too cloying cute, with almost forced jokes, side humor that seemed out of place and not too original. The entire first half was uneventful, a typical shoot'em up movie with as predictability as any television episode. The cityscapes, however, were awesome and lent a sci-fi background that never overwhelmed the scenes. The second half of the movie redeems itself in most regards and becomes the dramatic space opera that it represents as good and evil bitterly fight almost to the death. Yet, the setting, the plot is so unbelievable for the classic that it is, the special effects and the fighting sometimes become more for sheer show and titillation that the opportunity to substantive drama, acting is almost overlooked. Yet this movie is a sober conclusion to the beginning of Star Wars and wraps around to a satisfying conclusion, if not spectacularly. Seven out of Ten Stars."
1624,8,The Force Is Strong With This One,The conclusion of the rather disappointing prequel trilogy is actually pretty epic. The movie is full of great action sequences and exiting duels. George Lucas definitely redeemed himself after the disappointment of the first two movies.
1625,7,"""So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.""","Jedi are unbelievably irritating. Jedi sucks, Sith are evil, chick dies,... there's no one to root for."
1626,8,"At last, Lucas pulls one out of the hat","And so, after all the hype and two flatulent films, George Lucas had one chance to gain relief from the hounds on his back. After watching his final effort, only one word sprung to mind, redemption. For the first time Lucas has managed to get a compelling plot. Even though we now what has to happen, Lucas' how and why is actually interesting. However, the dialogue is appalling, but more of that later. Lucas' direction is also much improved. He has created a complete world and manages to get away with the highly political opening in a way that he didn't even get close to in his previous two efforts. He manages to carry a very heavy and filled storyline very well and he has reached new heights of technical achievement. But, above all, he has actually created sequences that are highly emotive, moving and wondrous pieces of cinema. These are mainly in three places. Firstly, the murder of all of the Jedi throughout the galaxy is superbly well done. Secondly, the inter-cutting of Yoda's duel with the Emperor and the fabled duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan is fantastically well made. Finally, the inter-cutting of the creation of Darth Vader, suit and all, and the birthing of Luke and Leia and the imminent death of their mother is beautiful. But it is mostly the tying up of the loose ends that gives this films its charm. But, these sequences wouldn't be half as effective if was not for John Williams' superb score, David Tattersall's awe-inspiring cinematography and ILM's spectacular special effects. However, there are pieces in the film when the editing is hard to follow, but apart from this minor slip-up, the films beautiful feel and look is unquestionably a wondrous technical achievement. Even the acting is improved. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are all markedly improved, especially McGregor whose performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi is nearing brilliance, but unfortunately it remains sadly short of Alec Guiness. Ian McDiarmid is wonderful in his slightly eccentric performance of his crucial character, whilst the supporting cast is brilliant, in particular Jimmy Smits. However not even James Earl Jones, in his fleeting appearance as Darth Vader, could deal with the woeful dialogue, at times. Words such as ""Younglings"" make far too much of an appearance and the final ""Nooooooooo!"" of the series almost destroys the scene it is in. For the disillusioned, this film could save their faith in the series. It is the darkest of the six and possibly my second favourite, and it is pulled of with great panache and style."
1627,10,How far would you go for the one you love,"This film is everything that the Episodes I and II should've been. Yes, there is a slight cheese factor in this movie with some of the dialogue, although I would say that Lucas has significantly improved in that area. I watched in complete agony as Anakin Skywalker completed his transformation into Darth Vader; I knew it was inevitable, but I had no idea that the transformation would be so emotionally powerful. Another improvement is Christiansen (Anakin). While I had no problem with his performance in Episode II (some critics called it ""wooden"", I say it was perfect for the nature of his character), he shows a wider array of emotions in this. He's lost and confused, and the Dark Side is an emotional comfort, especially when he learns that it can save Padme from death."
1628,1,Really bad,"This film was much better than the other 2 ""prequels"". But that isn't enough to raise 'Revenge' above a 1 in the rating books. There were 2 things I liked about this film: the sweeping technological background animations, and the comparison of the emperor to George Bush. I have to give Lucas kudos on the Bush comparison especially. None of the other aspects of the film were interesting at all. The characters were dull, Obi Wan was a caricature of his future self, as was Yoda. The very fact of using computer animation in this film - in spite of the great backgrounds - was a betrayal of the original film. One of the things that made 'A New Hope' great was the delicate and subtle use of gesture to give character to creatures that essentially had no faces, like Vader, R2D2, and the rest. The use of true animation was pretty much restricted to ships in space in the original, while life forms were primarily puppets or humans. The subtlety and beauty displayed there were simply incredible. All that is gone in 'Revenge'. It's a hollow film that, like the previous 2, should never have been made, just as the original 3 should never have been butchered as they were."
1629,1,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005),"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) TERRIABLE this was suppose to be the most anticipated movie of 2005. BAD ACTING. Scenes that were SPEAD UP ( this is what old Disney films use to do). FAKE looking jumps upwards. Best line in the movie ""I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE"" delivered in a bad acting form. I saw the original movie in 1977 and fell asleep and have fallen asleep in every other Star Wars movie, did not, this time but was think I want to sleep through this DULL, Boring movie. Now to reach the 10 line minuter what I had to say is above. I see in the future many people watching Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith yelling out words like Rocky Horror Picture show. I saw a ET moment and many times sound effect would fit well into the bad acting.(2005 May 24 ) 1-Star."
1630,8,"Intense, emotional and action packed","Revenge of the Sith is the final prequel. First of all I want to say how this has the best action sequences out of any other Star Wars movie. By far the most intense, this movie illustrates Anakins transformation into Darth Vader cleverly, showing how manipulative palpatine is. It shows Anakins struggles and his anger, and gives two sides to the story, and ultimately you feel bad. After all that's happened to him, it's easy for him to turn and that is shown well. The script and acting has moderately improved since attack of the clones, although certain parts are still awful, however it doesn't really bring the movie down I'm a huge way. The final battle between obi-wan and Anakin is personally my favourite lightsaber duel of the saga. Although Star Wars is aimed towards kids as well, this movie will frighten them, especially from midway on. This movie connects the prequels and the original trilogy well, tieing up almost all loose ends. Although the movie as a whole does feel a bit uneven and edgy, the transformation was cleverly done and the action sequences are fantastic. Overall i rate this movie 8/10 for major improvements from AOTC, great battles and a intense and well directed story, although as a whole is slightly uneven."
1631,10,"Good, But Not Perfect","Well, I definitely felt ""Episode 3"" was better than the second. However, I found it slightly disappointing. The effects were mesmerizing and the light saber battles did not disappoint me, but I wound up expecting more from this movie because of the awesome trailer. The ending, I feel, could have definitely been better. I also feel James Earl Jones should have had more to say. He should have had a line or two at the very end when he's staring at the Death Star being built. Ewan McGregor was a perfect choice for Obi Wan Kenobi and certainly enriched the spirit of the film. Overall: decent but it unfortunately did not live up to the standards left by the saga's predecessors."
1632,8,Gap between the 2 trilogies !,"Is it just me or has anyone noticed the fact that, Obi-wan gets to know the droids (specially R2 in ST3) and in the 4th episode, obi-wan clearly states that he doesn't know them !!!!!!!! I think george has made this slight error...of course it doesn't do that much of harm to the story line....Also looking at the whole series now, its clear that the story is based upon Anakin and not on Luke. I personally believe that someone older should have played Anakin in ST3. He looks just too young ! Also i still don't understand why Lucas didn't start off from the very first episode instead of starting with the fourth ????"
1633,1,George Lucas can now be crowned The Legend Slayer,"Why the movie sucked: 1. Natalie Portman did a horrible acting job. 2. Hayden Christianwhatever was worse than a bad actor in a high school play. 3. The dialogue was so bad that I found myself as well as other moviegoers in the theater laughing my @ss off. 4. Lucas (The Legend Slayer) used way too much special effects. Was I watching the last installment of a classic or a 2 hour resume for Lucas's special effects people. 5. Anakin's fall to the darkside was like flipping a switch. 6. This movie was loaded with inconsistencies: a) R2D2 can fly? b) I thought the jedi were bad @ss warriors. Why were they dispatched so easily. c) Padme seemed awfully small for someone with twins. d) In the first Star Wars princess Leia says something to the effect of knowing her mother a little when she was very young - I guess she was not talking about Padme either that or her memory is so good she can remember things when she was 3 seconds old. e) General Grievious's was beaten way to easily by Obi Wan. 7. Is Lucas, The Legend Slayer, fixated on people hanging from very tall heights. How many times in all 3 prequels was Obi Wan hanging off of something during a big fight scene (Darth Maul, Jango Fett, General Grievious). How many times was Anakin? This got old very quick. Is George Lucas capable of originality, after all he did create the Star Wars universe. 8. Yoda's facial expressions were laughable. I liked yoda better in the original series, when he was a puppet. 9. The scene where Papaltine is using the darkside on Samuel Jackson and trying to talk in an evil voice was completely hysterical. 10. There still was no chemistry between Hayden and Natalie."
1634,5,a sad end,"I enjoyed being immersed in the star wars universe by this film, but beyond that I was disappointed for a variety of reasons: This was the pinnacle of the tragedy of the 6 films save perhaps Darth Vader's death at the end of episode 6. The film had the biggest opportunity for powerful characters and acting, which we finally got in episode 2, but instead it hardly once got you to properly engage with them. This was because the dialogue wasn't great, the film tried to cram too much in instead of leaving some of the more predictable parts to the imagination. Unfortunately what emerged was an unbelievable story, which actually made me laugh at points where I wasn't supposed to, like where the Emperor is being 'evil' he just looks like an idiot, and where darth vader gets his suit on and breaths could have been more subtle. At some points I even thought I was watching a cartoon there was so much cgi, i.e. at the beginning, the whole scene had no impact it was just eye candy and terrible dialogue. I got the impression that Lucas either made too much for this film and had to cut it down and in so doing it lost its stand-alone essence, or he's had enough of it all. Or both."
1635,8,Lucas hits the game winning shot!,"My goodness! I was not impressed with Episode I with the performances and it's lack of threat. I was more impressed with Episode II, although I thought Hayden Christiansan was wooden to the core. But everyone comes wonderfully together in Episode III. I compare it to a Michael Jordan championship game winning shot at the buzzer. Hayden is much much improve so much so that his internal struggles seem genuine. The execution of the story, from the scrolling beginning credits to the end credits is worthwhile to the point that this movie makes Episode I and II BETTER! You have lots of Stromtroopers, who are a welcome site after the first one. I wanted to see more Jedi battles, but I understand why Lucas made it the way that he did. I was impressed with the Jedi fight between Anakin (now Darth) and Obi-Wan, and even though you know the outcome, it still nice to SEE it. After all, all three stories are about how Darth became Darth. Sure this movie is the darkest of all six film, but that is what sets it apart. For me, although Episode IV: A New Hope has a special place in my heart, this one, Revenge of the Sith is the second best, just behind Empire Strikes Back (funny, the best 2 star wars film is when evil is at its most wicked). And the cool thing is that this film answers all questions on why the characters in Episode IV, A New Hope behave and interact with each other they way they do. Bravo to all the performances in this film, to the well film and well scripted story and to the dazzling CGI effects that dwarfs my imagination. Thanks George for taking us on that journey, long ago, in a galaxy far far away."
1636,6,Absurd,"Why is this movie currently in the top 250? My six stars go entirely to special effects, musical score (which is superb), swordplay, and Ewan McGregor's performance in the final minutes of the film. As for the story, there were significant problems listed below. The script is a blatant nightmare. Lines exchanged between Anakin and Padme are actually quite painful to experience. I mean I had to cover my ears."
1637,10,Truly Awesome and Action Packed,"This movie really redeems the whole prequel trilogy. A great divergence from the last two movies, Anakin is grown up now! He's no longer a young boy or a rebellious teenager complaining about his parents or that weird tiny blue flying guy from Tattooine! Also, Jar Jar only appears once in the film and has one line. ""Excuse me."" I know some people will be rejoicing now, though I didn't think he was all that annoying. The film has a few twists and turns even though all of us who've seen four through six already know the outcome. I think already knowing the conclusion lends a feeling of desperation, a sort of wishful thinking that maybe this time the Jedi will pull it together. But it will not be so. I gave it a rating of ten stars, it was a great film with some awesome action sequences and a good plot. The trilogy, I mean, sixology, can now end with a bang."
1638,1,Oh......Mercy,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Here are some reasons why:
1639,8,The only good prequel,"While Rise of Skywalker nearly ruined its own trilogy, Revenge of the Sith nearly save its own. Lucas still doesn't have a real good grasp on story tone or plot tempo (two fairly important things for a director to control), he manages to create a finale that is not only far-and-away the most inventive and fun of the prequels, it's actually just good old-fashioned escapism. Performances are better (even Christensen), & the political thematics are gripping (""So this is how liberty dies...with thunderous applause."")"
1640,9,The best of the new.,"After the fairly good but terribly received film that was Attack of the clones fans was skeptical about the overall quality of the third and final chapter in the star wars saga. But alas I found Revenge of the sith an action packed, fast paced tragedy and the best of the new trilogy. The SFX were incredible as always, the fight sequences amazing but Hayden as Anakin was utterly crap and with Ewan Mcgreggor as Obi-Wan and even the king of cool Sam JAckson as Jedi master MAce WIndu in the cast, he seemed out of place and odd. "
1641,8,The return of Star Wars,"Finally, the time has come to truly love the Star Wars saga once more. The Phantom Menace was without a doubt a huge disappointment (thanks to Jar-Jar) and Attack of the Clones wasn't really that great as well (thanks to the unconvincing love story), but now Episode III is here and it kicks ass! Revenge of the Sith makes up for the other two episodes and has it's moments where it gets really close to the greatness of episodes 4, 5 and 6. The dramatic story of Anakin's downfall is both believable as emotional, especially when he turns over to the dark side completely and by doing so ruins his life completely. When Anakin marches towards the Jedi temple with his army of clones it send shivers down my spine. His last conversation with Padmé did the same, as did the confrontation with Obi-Wan - you can almost feel the pain that burns inside the heartbroken Jedi Master."
1642,8,"Finally, it feels like Star Wars.","After seeing this movie, my mind has been blown. For the past six years, I have been denouncing Lucas and the prequel trilogy along with every other fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy, but after seeing this movie I'm confused, but at peace. So much happens in this movie it's hard to wrap your mind around it all, but it's all enjoyable. During the fall of Anakin and his transformation into Vader, I had my mouth hanging open for minutes at a time. The thing that this movie did that the previous two failed at was making it FEEL like a Star Wars movie."
1643,10,A Fitting Finale,I have read a lot of feedback on this movie recently and felt the need to put in my own two cents.
1644,8,Almost felt like old times...,"I was 7 years old when i saw the ""original"" Star Wars (New Hope) at a drive-in. Seeing that on a HUGE screen with a starry background, entrenched the whole Star Wars phenomenon into my psyche. I have been an on and off fan my whole life. I said that to say I did enjoy Episode III quite a bit. At 35, I figured I would never feel an inkling of what I felt on that starry night in 1977 when I saw Episode III. Well, I felt something. It wasn't perfect, but I could tell George Lucas did put an admirable effort into this film. Mr. Lucas still has a ""kid with the best toys on the block"" syndrome with all of the special effects, but at least the story tends to keep up with all the glitz and glash. "
1645,9,The best of this series,"After Anakin saved kidnapped supreme chancellor Palpatine, their relationship became close. Due to help from Palpatine, Anakin joined the Jedi council. But he was not satisfied for not being given the rank of Master. In fact the Jedi council did not trust Palpatine at all. Even they required Anakin to keep watch on Palpatine for them. At the same time Anakin was worrying about his secret wife because of his nightmare. Sly Palpatine made good use of the thing that agonized Anakin. A big conspiracy was forming."
1646,10,Even if you're not a Star Wars fan,"You MUST leap, run, skip, hitchhike... whatever it takes... to see this movie! I can't even begin to stress just how AWESOME this movie was! STOP reading here to avoid spoiler! It even made me cry(OK maybe not... but I almost did...when Padme tells Anakin he's breaking her heart I teared up a little...Natalie was great and her costumes were gorgeous, especially her death garb) I LOVED IT! Mace Windu's death scene with the Chancellor was pretty spectacular although not as amazing as Obi-wan's fight scene with Anakin aka Darth Vader. Really though... even ignoring the special effects, this was a beautifully shot movie. The first 2 episodes were just ehhh but this one definitely gets some oohs and ahhhs."
1647,6,"""Best in The Prequel Trilogy!""","Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel J. Jackson and Ian McDiarmid star in this 2005 sci-fi prequel sequel. This final chapter of the prequel trilogy begins with Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) rescuing Chancellor Palpatine aka Darth Sidious (McDiarmid) from Count Dooku (Lee) and General Grevious. Dooku is killed by Anakin, but Grevious escapes for now. Soon, Anakin is reunited with his wife, Padme (Portman) who becomes pregnant and Anakin is having nightmares about her dying in childbirth. Soon, Anakin discovers that Palpatine is the Sith Lord they've been looking for and gets seduced by his power. He becomes his new apprentice, Darth Vader and helps wipe out Jedi knights across the galaxy. Obi-wan destroys Grevious and soon faces Anakin who is now an agent of evil. Padme dies giving birth to Luke and Leia who are protected and hidden. It's too bad Lee isn't in this long, but at least we see Anakin become Darth Vader. We also get to see Anakin and Obi-Wan duke it out as well as Yoda and Palpatine. This is the best in the prequel trilogy I recommend."
1648,1,A Total Disappointment,"For those hardcore fans out there who just want to see the story lines come to a gentle close, this movie will satisfy you. You may even like it. But, for those of us who wanted a movie that was up to the hype and standard of the other films, you will demand your money back."
1649,5,"Finally in a video store far, far away: an end in sight to the excessive space saga","An IMDb rating of 8? Please! As the grand finale of the most popular movie series of all time, there's a tendency to be sentimental but let's be cinematically honest--this is a piece of crap. Oh, there are the special effects and the wondrous images, There's Christopher Lee, still vibrant and menacing in his 80s, able to claim the honor of starring in both ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" sagas. There's that Shakespeare in space feel to some of it that producer/writer/director George Lucas might have been going for but with one huge deficiency--there's no story other than to grind along to the inevitable set-up for that first Star Wars film (may the power of the fourth be with you). Not only is the Sith film nothing more than a disjointed collection of scenes preceded by space ships sweeping into orbit or landing on some nifty space station but the dialog is wooden and hollow. With every line, there's a flashing light going off blaring, ""Acting, acting."" How can you have a successful sci-fi film without suspending reality? Jar Jar Binks might have been a real pick-me-up in this one but all who fall under the Lucas script are lost. Natalie Portman is a wonderful actress but you'd never know it from her Padme role. She's reduced to some the most insipid exchanges on film. Haydyn Christensen (Annikin), on the other hand, may be the worst actor this side of Tatooine. He summons up about as much feeling in his conversion to the dark side as Jerry Mathers might have if they'd ever made Beaver go evil. ""Evil Beaver"" might actually have been a more interesting movie. (""Wally, I don't know know what's happening to me!"" ""Gee, Beaver, you got dark circles under your eyes. You just stabbed Dad. Mom's gonna not going to like this."") One could go on and on citing the deficiencies of latest piece of Star Wars slop but it's really not necessary. If you're so entranced with the series and the technical accomplishments, you probably don't care about things like plot or direction. I actually liked the earlier Star Wars films. They were special effects masterpieces that managed to have some lighthearted and human qualities. But try as he might--despite reaping millions in receipts and promotional knickknacks--Lucas can't do it anymore. It just may be that he's caught up in his own formula. Ewan McGregor riding around on the lizard--please! It's just so contrived (there's no truth to the rumor that a sequel--Return of the Lizard--is in the works) The last three Star Wars films failed and this one completely. Thank God it's over. Now go back and watch Mark Hammill and the gang and have some fun."
1650,9,"First Viewing, early impressions","'Revenge' is the film that justifies the existence of the first two mediocre episodes because without them you can't fully appreciate this tragedy on the grandest scale. I don't think its a spoiler to say that the whole thing ends pretty badly but it is infinitely more entertaining then watching a little kid race pods and so forth. It also has incredible visuals that really dwarf the first two installments much like ROTK did with LOTR (lots of acronyms!) Based on my first impression, I rate this as the second best installment of the six films, slightly behind EMPIRE but this is so much darker and heavier than even that film that I may be inclined to change my mind and call this one the centerpiece of the whole spectacle. Then again I'm still in a daze from seeing it so I could be wrong..."
1651,1,George Lucas is now the Michael Jackson of delusional film-making,"Now that the great star wars age is over, and all the pieces fall into place.....i cant determine what is more delusional ,George Lucas, or the fans that rate this movie a 10. George Lucas should not be allowed near a pencil or a movie set. He made the same mistake that the MAtrix Sequels made. To much CGI effects, Green screen, - to busy showing all the fancy new special effects. The original despite it being older will always surpass these latest simply because their sets, and things were real, watching revenge of the sith, is like being stuck at a friend of a friends house forced to watch them play video games. MAking the4 prequels and not the final 3, turns star wars into a sick love story gone wrong. Taratino , Spielberg anyone else but lucas. He is paranoid schizophrenic, he hears voices, hes in la la land. He mustered together the best actors and manged to effortlessly make us forget they ever had talent. George Lucas seems to have reached the delusional state of false god head that Michael Jackson reached when he released the flop Invincible. George Lucas lacks any distinct directorial style that can bring life to his ideas. He had the money. the built in audience the bet actors around, and he still failed to produce a decent FILM, not CGI slide show. REvenge of the Sith, buy itself with out concluding the final trilogy transcends bad film-making and actually taints an entire generations icon."
1652,10,Star Wars Episode 3: Fall of The Prequel-Haters,"This movie is so darn good I had to post my review here, but two things bother me ,is some of the negative reviews have been reading here and the unusual lack of attention to details by the so-called Star Wars purists. Either they're just going through the same ""Episode 1 is crap"" mumbo-jumbo since 1999 in a very childish manner or they must be talking about some other movie. Anyways here's my lowdown: This movie is that good! The Phantom Menace was a decent Sci-fi/action movie, but pales in comparison to Attack of The Clones, Revenge of The Sith is one giant leap above these first two movies. Revenge of the Sith takes place 3 years after the events of Attack of The Clones. If you read Labirynth of Evil and if you watched season 3 of Clone Wars you can place yourself right in the middle of the action. The story begins during the final campaigns of The Clone Wars which have left the Republic and most of the Galaxy devastated, in a surprise assault the Separatists attack Coruscant and abduct Chancelor Palpatine. Enter Jedi Master Obi-wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to lead a daring rescue which, although vital, will have consequences in the fate of the Republic and young Skywalker. That's how much I want to tell about the story, trust me if you already spoiled yourself with vital spoilers you will still love this movie. Where can I start? The story is exceptionally well-told managing to create a bridge between two worlds in one movie in what I might add as being the darkest prequel of the saga. Some questions are still left in the dark, but come to think of it they were never that important to begin with. The acting is one big step forward, the force is strong with Mr. Christensen as he has truly become the great Anakin Skywalker and the true face of evil as Darth Vader. If you didn't like the Teen movie quality-romantic scenes in Attack of The Clones, you'll feel surprised how much better this is. Natalie Portam, although with less screen presence, manages to work with Hayden, to which again I say that he's more confident and acts far more natural then in the previous movie. Ewan Mcgregor is Obi-wan in the movie that places him as a mentor and a father to the hero, his chemistry with Hayden is also excellent. Ian Mcdiarmid, tells us that there is one far more evil then Darth Vader. Where can I go really? Nothing seems forced, the editing is good, because no scene is way too long nor too short. After watching a third screening, the movie never gets boring. You're probably thinking where's the fun in watching a movie where you know what happens at the end, but like Hayden said: ""It's like the Titanic sinking..."". Everybody knows Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader, and by watching The Phantom Menace,Attack of The Clones and Revenge of the Sith we know how did he become such a monster. GL tries to tell a story that there was a man before he became a machine. Star Wars Republic comic book fans got a taste of things to come. Music is one of the highlights of the film, the new Battle of The Heroes is a welcome addition and most of the music gives the film a more distinct personality, rather then TPM which had a somewhat generic Hollywood score feel to it(counting out Duel of Fates, of course). Special Effect are spot on, they don't get in the way of the story and are actually very appealing. General Grevious, although sporting a shorter role then his Clone Wars role, feels like a living breathing eco of Darth Vader, fearsome although obviously incapacitated due to a few late-Clone Wars events. The battles have a greater scope then those found in AOTC, the space battles are awesome, truly feels like a war in the stars. My only nitpicks regarding the movie are definitely the occasional music missing from key scenes would could make them more dramatic, still nothing to be worried about."
1653,9,A Time To Celebrate Star Wars!,"Ignore the cynics. Forget about the nit-picky fan boys. If you LOVE Star Wars, this is your movie. It is reason to celebrate. When I say love Star Wars, I mean if you love what Star Wars is really about- The Force, tragedy, hope, the Jedi, family, revenge, redemption- then this is your movie. If you like Star Wars because you got a kick out of Han Solo's bad ass attitude, then this may not be your glass of blue milk. You're not so much a Star Wars fan, as you are a fan of Harrison Ford. But, for the rest of us, this is our movie. It's epic. It's tragic. It's thrilling. It's even terrifying at times. It's also not perfect. But, to be honest, none of the Star Wars films have been. However, as a whole, all six films create a perfect saga. It can be argued that the Star Wars series has been the most ambitious film project ever undertaken. Spanning six films and thirty years, does anything else even come close? George Lucas should be praised for his vision. He has given us a cinematic saga that will stand the test of time. Celebrate Star Wars because it's over, folks. But, in a way, Star Wars will never be over; its legacy is just beginning."
1654,6,The real villain is someone else,"Seeing this movie and episode 1 & 2 I think the real reason for the Jedi orders fall is Mace Windu. He is such an asshole and hypocrite. He is the reason everything goes bad. He is such an asshole to Anikin. Lets him be in the council but do not get full membership, says the line ""If what you say is true you will have regained my trust"". No other council member seems to really do anything about this. The Jedi deserved it."
1655,10,A Very New Hope,"I literally just got home from seeing this film, a film in which I have been waiting six years to see. When episode one came out, I knew episode three would be my favorite, seeing as episode six is my favorite. It gives a lot of insight to the history (which I absolutely love about movies) and answers a lot of questions that may have arose from the original trilogy."
1656,7,It was OK,"I wasn't blown away by this last film by Lucas. I seen it a while back, and now I am finally getting around to post my thoughts about it. I was listening to all the hype like ""Oh, it explains everything, and that everything will come full circle and you'll understand it all."" Well, yeah it summed up everything. But, I personally think that Lucas is far more imaginative than having Vader burned up in a lava flow. It could have been better. Lucas is a genius, and I expected SO much more. So much more of the love between anakin and padme, more examples of what lured anakin to the dark side, and more problematic incidences tearing him and padme apart. Anyway, I'm bummed, I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. :0| Neutral :0|"
1657,10,Better than episodes I and II,"George Lucas originally created Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977, which was originally intended to stand alone, and when he later created the two sequels ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the Jedi,"" the theme of the saga was that of an intergalactic war. With the creation of episodes I (The Phantom Menace) and II(the Attack of the Clones), the central theme for this expanded saga changed to the rise, fall, and redemption of Annakin Skywalker. Walking into the theater, I was dearly hoping that this film would be better than the previous two episodes. I was pleasantly surprised. No, I was AMAZED. I had originally hated the new change in theme, but Episode III did a fantastic job linking together the films. The cinematography was amazing. However, there is one point I feel I must make. Annakin Skywalker is supposed to be ""the one,"" so to speak. How come he was undercut by Obi-Wan in their duel, when he attacked from a lower elevation? Elevation had proved to be unimportant to Obi-Wan when Obi-Wan had slaughtered Darth Maul. Surely, Obi-Wan should be the one then. In any case, the films I think still must be viewed episode 4,5,6,1,2,3 to any people new to Star Wars. George Lucas revealed some information that wouldn't be beneficial to those watching the episodes in straight order. Most people have watched all the episodes already preceding this (chronologically), so I do not think this poses to much of a problem. ****/**** or 10/10"
1658,8,Wow,"Now this might be one of my favorites of the Star Wars movies (not including Episode IV, the original, that was awesome), and might be tied with Episode V. Well done! I was pleased with this episode of the sage, it was a pleasant departure from the last two (Episodes I and II). They were such disappointments. It was nice and dark (which is good considering the title). Man, it was really surprising to see how just cruel and destructive Anakin Skywalker becomes, as well as how he comes to be Darth Vader and how he ends up in the life support suit. Wow. I really liked this. The only thing that I was a little confused by was how Anakin was able to take out so many other Jedi, but had such a hard time with Obi-Wan. Oh well, every great movie still has a flaw or two."
1659,1,It looked fake to me,"Nothing in this movie rang true. Most of all, the effects. To me they looked animated and I think technology has reached a point where we're actually regressing. I just watched EMPIRE STRIKES BACK again and I was amazed at how real it looked compared to SITH. Not to mention how superior every other element was in the old Star Wars. This new stuff SUCKS BAD. Audiences have got to start demanding more! If something looks poor just don't go see it. Hopefully this summers poor box-office receipts mixed with the fact there's so much poor material out there will send a message to the studios, but I think it will have to get a lot worse before they start putting out better stuff."
1660,1,I was embarrassed to be in the theater,"I had really hoped and actually believed that this was going to be the best of the prequels, after all it was going to be the climax of the prequel trilogy and contain arguably the most dramatic event in the entire Star Wars Saga - the fall of Anakin and the rise of Darth Vader."
1661,8,Very Good,Plot: 8/10<br /><br />Acting: 7/10<br /><br />Cinematography: 5.6/7<br /><br />Score: 5/5<br /><br />Enjoyable: 1/1<br /><br />= 81/100
1662,6,Better than the other prequels...but is that good enough?,"Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith It's a big name, and when it came out in theaters Summer 2005, it carried a huge weight on its shoulders. Its creator, George Lucas, had spent (though most say ""wasted"") two films setting up an overly-complex, yet still incredibly vague, world of conspiracies and duplicitous characters with hidden agendas."
1663,1,Is anybody freakin' home?,"I won't get into the same points the other user's tried to make about this movie. Yes the acting was bad. The dialog was terrible. Blah, blah, and so on. Maybe I've missed reading it on here, but no one seems to notice or maybe they just don't care about the lack of continuity in this whole story line. This was my biggest gripe with this film. The events we watch in ""Sith"" are laid out completely different in ""Return of the Jedi"". In ""Jedi"" Obi-wan tells Luke that Vader(Anikin) didn't know that his wife was pregnant. He also says, his mother took Leah to Aldaraan, and that Ben took Luke to live with his brother Owen on Tatooine. There is no mention at all in any of the new movies about Uncle Owen being Obi-wan's brother. For those of you who haven't seen the new movie, I won't go into detail why this story conflicts ""Sith"" but those of you who have seen it, you know what I mean. There is also a part in ""Jedi"" when Leah tells Luke that she remembers her mother. This might seem picky to some of you who read this, but I hate when history is rewritten just because it becomes convenient. If you don't believe me, Just watch the original version of ""Jedi"". Not the one that was revamped and repackaged, but the original VHS release before it was tampered with. I don't know if they're on there because I can't watch the new version. You can also look at the shooting script for ""Jedi"" on-line. Yes, I know that not all the dialog in it was used for the final cut, but compare it with the final cut and you'll see what I mean. Awful. George, buddy, your messing with your own back-story."
1664,10,Stellar,"Awesome movie! Lucas does not disappoint like always. A must watch! Love all the quotable content. If you're on the fence about this, watch it!!!!"
1665,10,Maybe the best Star Wars of them all!!!,"WARNING!! SPOILERS!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!! Anakin's slide to the dark side is actually extremely well handled and is very interesting. In a way, there are several parties responsible for what happens. Anakin, of course, is to blame because he makes poor choices (choosing fears over losing his wife vs. the good of the republic and the jedi, his lust for power, his ambition and jealously)."
1666,1,Why? Why? Why?,"Why doesn't R2D2 fly in episodes 4, 5, and 6? Why doesn't he use his flamethrower to kill the stormtroopers in these original episodes? There were many times he could have done this to save the day. Why doesn't Uncle Owen remember C3PO? Why doesn't Aunt Beru remember him? How on earth does Aunt Beru go from a cute twenty year old girl to a fifty-five year old sun-baked woman in sixteen years? Why did Yoda, who is supposed to be the most brilliant in the galaxy, decide to send the baby Luke to Anikan's family, i.e., his family, this supposedly being ""The last place they'd look for him?"" Duh! Why does it take two and a half films for Anikan to become Darth Vadar, when in fact this is the reason for all of the prequels? How how Anikan go from a thin lipped blonde boy in episode 1 to a curly red haired guy with immense lips? How does Vadar go from being five foot nine to seven feet tall... does the dark side have growth pills? Where are all those insane spaceships in sixteen years? Why wouldn't they use all the buzz droids and those horse droids and those other killer droids instead of stormtroopers? And don't give me: ""Well in this film the Emperor said to shut down the droids"", because that one sentence didn't explain why the evil empire wouldn't bring these things back... after all, they are in deep space trying to kill off the rebellion and not in front of the senate. And why would George Lucas have Anikan turn bad because of a dream? Why? Why? Why? Does anyone know? And why would Anikan's entire purpose for killing all those people be to save his wife because of this vague dream? Why? Why? And why was this movie given the prop of ""Ties it all together"", when it ties nothing together. It is a horrible, horrible film. Oh, and why does Chewbecca have gray hair when he's supposed to be younger? And how does Obi Wan not remember C3PO or R2D2 in episode 4? Was his memory erased too? Did a brilliant Jedi forget these things after spending sixteen years in the desert? Why? Why? Why? Oh my!!!"
1667,10,Absolutely a masterpiece,"After having watched all Star Wars movies, I have to say that Star Wars III - The revenge of the Sith, is absolutely the best. Not only the effects are fabulous, but this last part has made the puzzle complete."
1668,5,Not Impressed,"Because I work at a movie theatre, and have seen an extensive amount of movies, and of my background in acting, i have come to realize i have to look at movies both critically and objectively. Critically, the acting in E3 was mediocre, objectively it was OK. Critically the dialog in E3 was terrible, objectively it was bad. Critically the visuals in the movie were great, objectively I nearly crapped my pants. As far as completing the series, filling in the holes, and overall just explaining things, E3 did a good job regardless of how you look at it. I think Yoda's excessive talking has ruined the mystique he used to have in the days of E4,5,6. And I have never liked Hayden Christensen's casting as Anakin....worst death award goes to Natalie Portman. THE END!"
1669,10,The Circle Is Now Complete...,"So here we are at the end of it all. To those who haven't seen it yet, I swear you will not be disappointed. Unlike the last two, you will NOT find yourselves fighting to defending this film, backs against the wall, muttering lame excuses about Star Wars being kids films, about Lucas having a grand vision, about us all just having grown up Revenge Of The Sith needs no defence. It's just great."
1670,9,Best of the entire saga,Hands down.
1671,10,"Great movie, perfect story","Star Wars fans will simply love it! Perfect script, every single detail of movie is very well tailored to the other movies."
1672,10,blockbuster end to the series,"Saw it last night. First of all it is by far the most outstanding and cutting edge sci-fi digital film to date. The visual effects are so enjoyable that the megabucks Lucas must have spent to produce it was well spent. Just stay long enough to watch the credits roll at the end of the film and try and count how many animators he used! Wow. The acting is good, not great. The draw is the visual drama, the fact that we know the plot and where it's going. By the end of the film your heart is a lump in your throat as the curtain comes down. There are a few things that linger in my mind. At the end Yoda mentions something very odd about how he needs Obi-wan to go into training while he stays for years in deep cover. What training? To learn how to contact his lately lamented Jedi Master trainer. That's the way I understood it and I'll certainly be seeing the movie again to make sure I heard correctly. Talking to dead teachers is something that Lucas covered in the first few films but no one made much of a fuss about it. When I heard it this time I was really surprised. The implications.....remind me of the now famous line ""...I see dead people"" and you can figure out the rest of the spooky factor. Another thing I am mystified at is what Padme mumbles just as she is dying. I could not for the life of me hear what she was saying....something about the Sith perhaps."
1673,10,MASTERPIECE!,"This is by far the best Star Wars movie, all<br /><br />I can say is it's jaw dropping and a delight to the eyes and ears."
1674,10,Perfect cast selection,"Hayden Christensen Is brilliant as Anakin Skywalker! Loved the young anakin (Jake Lloyd) he was a little genius and this seems a great transition into the young man Anakin becomes! After watching all the movies and stories on Disney + in order I'm more and more appreciative of Hayden's performance. Padme is so sweetly done by Natalie Portman. Seeing how these dark politicians do everything in their power to corrupt this young man into the Darth Vader he becomes and how Obi Wan and Yoda are no help whatsoever in being a true friend and trying to help him, I feel for Anakin so glad Luke helps him in his end."
1675,8,"Thank you, Lucas!! Thank you so very much!!","After much disappointment from me pertaining to Episodes I and II, I was so relieved that I was able to thoroughly enjoy this movie, and for the better too. This film completed it, and it did so."
1676,1,The ruining of Star Wars is complete.,"This is quite possibly the worst film ever made in the history of film making. I have seen all six Star Wars films, I have fond memories of Star Wars as a child and now they are all ruined completely. I wonder if George Lucas even watched the first three films, because the number of plot contradictions is unbelievable."
1677,8,Finally.,"The trumpets blare for the last time as Star Wars lights up the screen for the last time in the final installment to the Star Wars legacy. Stormtroopers and Jedi Masters alike gathered opening weekend to bid their final farewells to George Lucas' staple to pop culture and world history, camping for even an months... But was it worth it?"
1678,4,Fast forward,"What can I tell about Episode III? Since I and II didn't explain too much, they need to do a FAST FORWARD in this one to make the bridge to IV."
1679,9,Highly underrated movie,"This movie has great, emotional moments, and is only held back by some cheesy dialogue and poor CGI. The CGI is forgivable because of when the movie was released, and the dialogue is actually pretty funny and makes for great memes. The battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is a very emotionally powerful scene, as is Order 66. It really gets a bad rap just because it wasn't as good as the original Star Wars movies. I would rather watch this than The Force Awakens."
1680,6,"Better than 1 and 2, but still disappointing.",Visual effects alone do not make a movie. George Lucas should've learned this after Jar-Jar Binks bombed in Episode 1.
1681,8,"The Last of Lucus, goes out with an almighty bang!","Firstly i'm not so qualified to review a Star Wars film, as I'm not such a big fan (especially the latter ones). 'Star Wars' is now thrilling an entire new generation, with some actually following the franchise as a religion. You can't be blase about a movie that cost a telephone number amount of dollars and thousands of man hours, just to produce a few seconds of screen time. It's so technically perfect it's in danger of becoming over polished. I really miss the risk taking of the original and the jokey but memorable dialog, delivered by the first set of (mega) fantastic characters. Perfection but at a price; as it always opts for the safe, middle ground (Spielberg was typically employed for some directive). George Lucus, has made the dumbing down of sci-fi into a fine art and in his very own words (whilst consulting his crew) ""This is what Steven wants!"". To end on a high note though, the scene when Anakin changes into Darth Vader, was truly a masterful stroke. Apart from 'Rogue One', it was all down hill, from the moment Lucus, left the building."
1682,10,bravo... well done,"this film sets into the motion the original Star Wars saga we all grew up with and love. Knowing the story behind the story makes Revenge of the Sith a film that puts into motion all that we know in the original Star Wars trilogy. Anakin was a man before donning the mask Darth Vader. Not just the eerie black mask but the mask that Vader truly hides behind; himself. The choices that Anakin makes have such dire consequences for himself but also the ones that he love. One mistake that he spends the rest of his life in regret of his actions. If you skip the other two new SW movies, don't skip this one as the emotions of all that is yet to come (Episode 4,5,6) is set into motion and now you know why"
1683,4,Very very poor,Special effects can't save this story. The convolutions that he had to contrive to get back to the original story where too much and far too unbelievable. The 'transition' effects between the scenes verged on the amateurish to add to a film without a story. Ewen McGregor accent was obviously put on to sound like a young Alec Guiness but sounded more like a world war II RAF squadron leader complete with handle bar moustache. As the film went on I was siding more with the guys on the dark side so lacking was this film for a hero character that you could actually take a liking to. How believable is Yodo all of 11 inches tall taking on the dark lord with a light sabre? The scene on the volcanic planet was another beauty - aren't these guys affected by temperature?? How this film is scoring so high beats me.
1684,4,One Sentence Reviews,"They should have stopped with Return, but then we wouldn't have gotten a lightsaber fight over lava."
1685,9,Makes you want to go home and watch the Original,"Watching this movie, was awesome. I didn't rate it a 10, because i reserve the 10 rating for the original Star Wars Episode 4. Which Amazingly, i would love to see remade with todays technology. Who knows maybe someday they will. Hayden was awesome in his transformation to the dark side, although i think it was a little too accelerated. I would like to have seen some other acts leading up to him killing kids. I mean you go from being a caring Jedi to a Kid killer in a few frames?? But being 33 yrs old and having seen the originals all those years back, and not having watched them again when the re-issue came out with bonus features, i now want to go rent them and watch them all. then maybe go see episode 3 again. Visually it was stunning. The lava world scenes awesome, but was a little unrealistic that they are hovering over boiling molten rock and don't even break a sweat let alone have their skin turn into welts and boils, yet the minute anakins stubs get within 2 inches of it, he bursts into flames??? OK, i know its a movie, check the mind at the door. All in all, i went with two people that aren't even star wars fans and they liked it. This movie stood on its own and was a perfect finale to an awesome Epic. Way to go George Lucas, you have redeemed yourself for episode 1 and Jar jar and Watto!"
1686,6,Best of the Newer Ones - puts this 4th,"This final episode stands pretty well on its own. Palpatine is definitely stand-out as the villain which creates for a evil disturbing atmosphere. McDirmand (sp?) brings back his old familiar character as really the true survivor from the original series. Problems from the prior 2 are still evident here - although they've been masked over with significantly better editing - those being stilted hollow dialogue here and there, and poor direction; in most cases one seems to cause the other. The scenes with Anakin and the Queen are often this way. The fast paced story helps to let forget these stilted scenes. Also in some cases the full creation of outworldly creatures and settings remind of ""Hercules"" cheese effects in television, but only here and there. You'll have to be willing to forgive the smaller inconsistencies. Otherwise this is a decent movie, one that I wouldn't buy probably just like the first 2 new ones - but one that at least gets closer to the adventure of the originals, but again hollow of the spirit and character of those for the most part."
1687,9,Anakin Gives In Too Easily,"I've been disappointed over the years with many of the Star Wars films especially the secondary characters, Ewoks for example. Silly stuff that did not help me suspend my disbelief. The Revenge of the Sith does not stoop to silliness. Thank you, Mr. Lucas. And, because of that I liked it. Ewan McGregor does a little acting at the end. Natalie Portman is radiant but has seriously outgrown the role. It's always a pleasure to see Jimmy Smitz but anyone could have do his role. The one reason that kept me from completely liking this film is the lead character, Hayden Christensen, as Anakin Skywalker. He is very weak, two dimensional and comes off as an inexperienced actor rather than naive Jedi. He has two facial expressions: See-me-smile-because-I-love-Padme and See-me-stare-through-the-top-of-my-eye sockets-because-I'm-moving-to-the-dark-side. He is predictable and boring even though the audience knows what will happen. I would have liked to have seen him put up a much bigger fight before he was taken over to the dark side."
1688,10,"when the credits started to roll, I felt a tingle...","man... what a satisfying movie. I couldn't have been more pleased with how Lucas got his act together and did things right. The dialogue was vastly improved, which was the one thing that I cringe at when I watch Episodes 1 and 2. The emotion level was also a big part of this movie. Obviously it was going to be emotional, just based on all the things that surround the story, but the main thing is that it was done right. The action was amazing, and even though it dominated much of the movie, it didn't feel forced. Many people might say that there could have been more acting scenes and less action ones... but I think the flow of the film was good. The special effects were just incredible, and so much better than episode 1."
1689,7,Revenge.. it is ..,"Waiting to watch the truth that lies beneath the events is a real treat to our imaginations. The expectations were very high since the movie had to say anything and everything that has been left behind. In this hurry, Lucas has forced himself in a situation where little of everything has been said..instead, I thought explaining the transformation of anakin to vader was very important and i should say, that he has not been very successful. The reasoning behind the events has been very diffusing, at one point anakin talks all about the dreams and yet there he is at the end, not taking too much care about Padme. instead, its abt the breathtaking fighting sequences..watch the return of jedi and the empire strikes back..feel, one could, the very reason of the clash between the space titans. I would at this point appreciate the intricate details that has been pointed out by lucas such as in the emperor's introduction about the dark side to anakin..where he talks about who anakin is ..in sense..what he really was !! It was a puzzle to which not many would be enticed towards. The role of Padme was less inspiring, why dint we see more interaction between the two if she was the main reason for his change from a jedi to vader ?? Further, killing of the powerful jedis at the mere hands of army was not that easy to absorb..If the movie won my hearts it was due to the fantastic stunt display..the fight between grievus n obi-wan was awesome..and the final clash between the master n student took people by real surprise due to its marvel. Sure, the movie is a bet for being nominated for visual effects. Summarizing, a pleasure watch movie, it is."
1690,8,Not bad.,"*Some things mentioned may be considered spoilers, but probably not*"
1691,10,Critics Hate Star Wars,"For whatever reason, critics appear to approach Star Wars movies with a different mentality. Granted, many were justifiably jaded through the first two movies, but one has only to read The New Yorker review of Revenge of the Sith to see that many people just don't get Star Wars. It's something that's meant to be fun and exciting in the truest sense of the phrase. The characters themselves are reminiscent of the gods in an epic Greek poem, and their struggles are exaggerated to a level where they are almost primal, and relatable to all. Star Wars tells stories about good and evil, moral reasoning, failure and triumph. If the first two prequels faltered, it was because they missed these big themes (and a lot sucked in them too, I have to be honest). Revenge of the Sith is a booming canon shot success compared to them though, and compared to a couple of the original trilogy films. It is terrific, it is fun, it is just a simply enjoyable movie. Critics who snub this film have their pompous opinions running rampant- perhaps they should just watch a movie for enjoyment once, instead of looking for anything and everything to critique."
1692,9,Sith redeems the series; I can resume liking Star Wars!,Thats more like it! No cute kids. No JarJar dialog. No 20 minutes ToysRUs scenes. In this movie they seemed to have remembered that story matters...gravity exists...and the audience isn't stupid.
1693,9,The Best Of The New Trilogy. It Ranks Up With The Originals.,"George Lucas finally got this one right. After the schlock fest that were Episode I: The Phantom Menace & Episode II: Attack Of The Clones Episode III : Revenge Of The Sith (Or ROTS as I refer to it as) arrives like a superhero out of nowhere and saves the day. Sure the dialog is still cheesy as hell at times (Padme : ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart"") and giving R2-D2 a fight scene the movie is still great. Unlike the last 2 films the light saber battles are long. And by long I mean Empire strikes back long. Plus unlike the last 2 films this one has a space battle dog fight that ranks up there with Return Of The Jedi's Death Star battle. The origin of Darth Vader is dark and almost painful to watch Anakin Skywalker go through the change. He resists and actually feels bad for carrying out his duties. Plus you feel bad for him because he's getting tricked by the Emperor to turn to the dark side as well as getting dogged by the Jedi council. The one scene that is actually a slight disappointment is actually when Darth Vader first appears on screen. It's a scene so right out of Frankenstien that i almost expected the Emperor to start screaming ""It's alive, It's alive""! However I went into ROTS expecting to be disappointed. instead ROTS has done the one thing that I never thought possible again...It made me fall back in love with Star Wars. Well done George, Welcome back."
1694,1,Worst Movie EVER made....,"I watched this ""film"" last night on cable and I can honestly say it is the worst movie ever made."
1695,8,Best of the prequel trilogy but still doesn't come near the original three,Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and some intense images.
1696,9,It was all worth it,After watching the first two prequel films to Star Wars it felt like you were waiting for something good to come out of the whole prequel trilogy and lucky we did.
1697,5,Polished Garbage,"No amount of slick CG visuals can overcome laughable dialogue, inconsistent and unemotional acting, misdirected tone and annoying contrivances."
1698,6,Yay! It's Over,"What can be said that hasn't been said already?.. Plenty!. OK, firstoff, you must see this film. You can't get around it. Just go see it. Don't put it off. Otherwise, you'll find that people will slowly and surely, through no fault of their own, only assume you have seen episode 3 and bit by bit reveal spoilers will make you want to turn to the dark side. This happened to me with episode 2. So take my advice. Go now. Oh, and avoid the digital screens, you will only run into crowds and sold out seats (digital makes no difference, really)."
1699,9,Revenge of the Sith vs The Rest,"I went to the midnight screening of Revenge of the Sith with unusually high hopes (positive reviews, but Episodes I and II brooding in my mind)."
1700,7,"""Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith""- A solid and entertaining cap on the infamous prequel trilogy.","After three years of hope and of hesitance, George Lucas followed-up his hugely flawed but mildly entertaining second chapter in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy with what at the time thought to be the final main-series entry in the entire saga. 2005's ""Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith."" It was a long time coming, and at that point, the hardcore fanbase had become shockingly divided due to the lukewarm reception the prior two films had attained. Would this be another forgettable entry? Another nail in the coffin for the beloved franchise? Another potential failure? Or would it rise above what came before? Would it finally pay off on the story that the past two films so struggled to establish? Would it redeem what had become one of the most debated and divisive trilogies of all time?"
1701,6,Very disappointed fan,"As with all three of the prequels I came out very disappointed. Once again Lucas has proved he has spent too much time focusing on Industrial Light and Magic and not on his Star Wars universe. The movie is a visual masterpiece, but once again falls very short as for storyline."
1702,10,Star Wars at it's full potential,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith brings the series to a justified close. From the opening star fighting scenes all the way up to the battle between Ani and Obi this movie just feels different than the other prequels.
1703,10,"Incredible, absolutely incredible!","I'm not a big Star Wars person, I've seen them all, but I've never really taken anything in from the plots. But this one, it was incredible."
1704,3,"Not as bad as I and II, but not good either",The first 45 minutes of this video went by painfully slow. The wife and I kept looking at each other in disbelief. Neither of us could believe how bad the acting and dialog was.
1705,10,A great end to the prequals,"It goes out with a bang as star wars revenge of the sith gets started, anakin is now showing his true self as he gets consumed by the darkness, whilst palpatine has a plan of his own to disrupt the balence. This movie also sees a curveball in how the movies overall tone feels and it becomes dark and moody. Its also pretty sad as many of our favourite characters meet their end, the music is once again great and we are not introduced to many new characters only jedi that we see but they leave a lasting impression. This movie also serves as a backdoor to the clone wars series and I really liked the plot of this one as it was something you would not expect. Overall revenge of the sith is a great conclusion and brings it full around to what we see in the original trilogy."
1706,10,"The Best Of The Prequels, But Still, Dialogue and SOME Acting Was Crap","Something told me inside that I was really going to love this movie and that it would be the best of the prequels, and it wasn't the reviews or the critics that said so, just from what I saw on the trailers and TV spots made it look absolutely amazing. "
1707,7,I don't know what to think.,I really love and cherish all the Star Wars movies even the prequels which a lot of people had a hard time accepting but this one is just a let down. Every film in the series served an important purpose to further the story. 
1708,7,Star Wars Takes an Exceedingly Emotional Turn in Very Moody Trilogy End,"Revenge of the Sith is the star of the prequel-trilogy, in which we're able to witness the dark, moody and disturbing background of the iconic Star Wars villain, Darth Vader. The previous chapters, Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace, began to form an understanding of the events before the original trilogy. And although they were mostly quite bland, they cautiously lead up to Revenge of the Sith, which was actually the perfect connection to A New Hope."
1709,3,Too bad Hayden ruins everything,"Of course, like everyone else, I wanted this movie to be good. I really, really tried to convince myself. But, alas, Lucas let us down once more. My biggest problem with this movie is actor Hayden Christensen. He has no talent, no charisma, not an ounce of skill that make him come across as believable. Sigh. How Lucas could screw this up is beyond my comprehension. And what's up with all the robots for Gods' sake?? Robots delivering babies? Robots using light sabers? Granted, R2-D2 and C3PO has a certain kind of charm, but it seems Lucas couldn't resist the temptation to use robots and CGI wherever he can. Maybe Lucas don't like real people? Or real actors....."
1710,,George Lucas saves the best for last in the final installment of the trilogy,"In the summer of 1977,a little known movie named ""Star Wars"",about characters who reside in a galaxy far,far,away became a mixture of sorts with very little fanfare when it was first released. The movie was a grand throwback to the Saturday matinée serials of the 1930's and 1940's,with different elements that resulted in science fiction,movie Westerns,Greek and Japanese mythologies,comic books and other stuff combine would basically find an audience,and from its opening sequence the rest of the story is Hollywood history. From the day the first installment of the original ""Star Wars"" film roared into theatres on May 25,1977,it became an instant classic in cinematic history,and one of the most influential films of the late 20th Century,which began the crystallization between its young viewers and special effects. It was the roadside attraction of the summer of 1977 and what ""Star Wars"" did was not only saved 20th Century-Fox from sudden bankruptcy but in a sense saved Hollywood thanks to George Lucas. From this,it spawned two sequels to the original trilogy,""The Empire Strikes Back""(1980),and the final installment,""Return Of The Jedi""(1983),and its prequels to the trilogies ""The Phantom Menace""(1999),and ""Attack Of The Clones""(2002). and now the final installment to his six-part chapter to the ""Star Wars"" trilogy-""Episode III:The Revenge Of The Sith""(2005)bring the thrilling conclusion to one of the most beloved and most spectacular science-fiction sagas of all time."
1711,8,Incredible Looking Movie !,"After reading reviews from professional critics, I was prepared for a massively disappointing experience but for the most part ROTS delivered and in a couple of instances exceeded my expectations. Yes the dialogue is clunky and has little of the energy and wit that Episodes 4,5 & 6 enjoy but I suspect this may have more to do with the actors ability to deliver in these episodes compared to their later predecessors (huh ?). Instead, visual gags abound and I particularly liked R2D2s newly acquired dismount skills that defy continuity for Eps 4,5 & 6 as we see him leave his seat in the fighter like a cork out of a well shaken bottle of Moet. The film does look stunning with flawless CGI and at times breathtaking city vistas. The opening battle sequence has a a depth of movement lacking in the previous movies and gets you reaching for the slow-mo button to take in all the fabulous detail. The story holds absolutely no surprises thanks to the 100% saturation the marketing of this movie has achieved but that does not spoil the experience and it still does enough to hold your attention as Anakins life makes a date with destiny and a natty black rubber and pvc ensemble. This is a far from perfect film and personally I think Ep 1,2 & 3 took far too long to get to what was for me the strongest and most interesting part of the story. Even in this final piece of the jigsaw, the really interesting stuff happens in the last 15 minutes of the movie and I could have done with one less location at the front of the movie to make way for more screen time for Anakin in his new found role. Despite all this, the film is a blast and I'm sorry that it's all over. Anyone for Episodes 7, 8 & 9 ??"
1712,10,Way to Go George!!!,"This movie will be heralded as the best Star Wars Prequel ever!! This was better than the first two. I thought that Anikan delivered a good performance and that he was not wooden at ALL!! Of course, General Greivous stole the SHOW!! He coughed a little too much, but THAT IS OK. Also, Yoda had very interesting EYE EXPRESSIONS. That one scene where he approaches the Sith Lord was INTENSE!! He fought so hard that his ROBE FELL OFF!! That reminded me of when I would take of the ROBE OF THE ACTION FIGURE when I was a KID. He had the SAME KIND OF FRAIL BODY!!! Also, what about MACE WINDU!? That is one mean JEDI!! The worst part of the movie was that that DARTH VADER SHOULD HAVE TALKED MORE. The Death Star and the green uniforms that were being worn toward the end were a great transition to ""A NEW HOPE."" I loved this movie and I saw it ALONE at the SCOTTSDALE MALL!!! I even ate a TACO BEFORE HAND!!!"
1713,,does anyone know how?,"I enjoy this movie..better than episode I and episode II, on this new trilogy! I'm not a great fan of science-fiction movies but always liked star wars , and i have a great respect for George Lucas work.I would like to see more star wars movies...but, all the great things have a end...they just can't last forever! And this saga ends in glory!"
1714,1,Worst Script III,"One of the last lines of the film speaks for itself: ""OK, we need to hide Luke, lets see...how about in Anakin's/Vader HOME PLANET with HIS FAMILY?"" ""Oh, and yes, I'm just one of the two only Jedi's alive, but I'll hide in the same place and change my name to Ben Kenobi, surely nobody will notice!"" "
1715,10,the ONEon a six sided die(SPOILER),"awesome. a real movie. you knew what was going to happen but it still had you on the end of your seat. tragic, funny, fun of comraderie between the characters like the old film...the best...i loved it."
1716,9,Empire Strikes For the First Time,"Okay, it was good, and if your a Star Wars devotee, there are parts that are great. Some of the acting was no better than before, like Natalie Portman, some was really well done to the point of admiration, like Ian McDarmid and Ewan McGregor, and some acting was sort of in between, ie Hayden Christensen, whose acting ability increases with the evilness of his character. Yoda is the best actor here, and his performance makes you understand or appreciate his appearance in the original trilogy better. The special effects are without equal. There are enough references and in-jokes for fans to warrant the price of a ticket. If you have kids who are easily scared, then wait for the DVD so you can skip over parts, but if your kids are into gross stuff and explosions and well choreographed violence, then they may enjoy it without harm. Overall, I'd say that if you've seen all of the other Star Wars movies, then you must see it. Personally, I've been waiting 25 years or so for a scene near hot lava, and I wasn't disappointed."
1717,10,The most emotional roller coaster ride ever!,"I have never been so many emotions in a movie before. From the laughs at Yoda doing some serious fighting, to the horrified,tear filled moment when Anakin kills the young-lings, I have never been so torn. In a rather tearful goodbye delivered by Obi-Wan, he tells Anakin of how much he meant to him. Anakin's reply is a demonic growl of ""I hate you!"" and Anakin's reaction to the death of Padme was heartbreaking. The plot felt a little loose when it came to the relationship between Padme and Anakin. But other than that, and what I think was an evil character being portrayed as two steps from the ultimate evil, it was the most tear-jerking,wonderful,heartwarming (at the end), and visually stunning movie I've ever seen."
1718,10,Saved the best for last,"I have to disagree on some of the comments that other IMDb users made.Did they see the same movie that everyone else saw. At the peoples choice award show this year George Lucas got the award for having the best movie of 2005.I guess all the people that enjoyed Star Wars Episode III-Revenge of the sith were nuts for picking this movie to win. However,everyone is entitled to there own opinion no matter how wrong they may be,that being said this is what I thought of Revenge of the Sith. Hayden Christensen gave a great performance as Anakin Skywalker,By the way he was in fact nominated for two different awards for Shattered Glass,He didn't win but that doesn't mean he can not act because he very much can act.You can really see how he starts to turn to the dark side,his turn to the dark-side did start in Attack of the Clones after the death of his mother.In Revenge of the Sith Senator Palpatine easily manipulates Anakin's thoughts on the Jedi,he is also afraid that he will lose his beloved Padme. Senator Palpatine basically tells him that he can help him save Padme's life.After some key scenes in the movie some of Anakin's actions do haunt him.He knows after one scene in particular that he has done the wrong thing.Senator Palpatine uses this to his advantage and Anakin is basically lost to the Jedi at this point. I thought the lightsaber battles in the movie were exceptional.The last couple of scenes in Revenge of the Sith were in my opinion very strong and emotional especially the scenes with Obi-Wan and Anakin and also the Scenes with Obi-Wan and Padme.The scenes with Anakin and Padme was also very strong.Samuel L.Jackson's role as Mace Windu was fantastic. His scenes with Anakin,Obi-Wan and (darth sidious) Senator Palpatine were exceptional.The lightsaber duel was heart-stopping.Natalie Portman is an exceptional actress George Lucas really hit the mark by casting her in this role. He also did really good by casting the rest of the actors that he did for this movie.I really do think that he saved the best for last.One can only hope that some where down the line he will think of doing episodes 7,8,and 9 which would have Han Solo and Princess Leia's children in the main plot line.I mean does anyone really think that a ""new Sith Lord"" would not be born just because Darth Vader died and the emperor was destroyed.I for one do not,I also say that the Jedi live on through Han Solo and princess Leia's children.I thought the plot of the movie was great.The acting was right on,the action never really stopped for a second and the story really was well put together.I just really liked the movie everything about it was great.George Lucas really hit the jackpot with this series.I hope it really didn't end with the last movie."
1719,1,George Lucas Dropped the Ball,"The number of ways in which this movie fails all expectations are too numerous to count. The discontinuity of story as alluded to in original trilogy is one, the overall poor acting, the awful special effects and gratuitous usage of CGI, the plot, the cinematography, the place names, the character names, the overall impact of the movie are all contributors to a film that ends one of the worst continuations of a movie series ever created. The only aspect of these movies (Episodes I, II and III) that is more distressing than the poor quality of the films themselves is the number of people that have somehow been duped into believing they are worth watching. I grew up adoring all things Star Wars, reading the literature etc. and really enjoyed the original three movies, Episodes IV, V and VI. That is until Lucas got his hands on those movies for their horrible remakes touted as ""Special Editions"" in which he began his heart wrenching trend of replacing any notion of quality acting with CGI buffoons."
1720,1,kevin smith's butt boy does it again,"ARRRRGGGGHHHH. This movie has generated more division between people than any that I can think of in recent memory. I am amazed that people love this movie. Lucas must be using some Jedi mind trick for people to go yeah, the dialogue is bad, the plot is bad, and the cgi is everywhere but I loved it. Huh? The only thing I can think of is that people wanted to like this one so bad that they almost hypnotized themselves into loving it. I'm starting to think the only reason the first three were good was due to the performances of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. Lucas writes like a fat 6th grade boy who plays too many video games. How can you trust someone who goes I need to redo the originals because they just were not what I wanted adds 30 seconds of fairly worthless eye candy and remarkets his movies every 5 years. I sometimes think that these are just big commercials for all the many toys that these movies generate cuz every single extra has an action figure based on them. Not only did this movie stick a stake in Lucas for me but I am perplexed that Kevin Smith wet himself over the likes of Daredevil and this. A man who made Clerks and Chasing Amy should know better. But than again he also made the horrible dirty joke disguised as a film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."
1721,10,Loved It - Contains Spoilers!!,"I can't believe the amount of work that was put in to this movie. I've never seen so many special effects, especially of this high calibre."
1722,8,Nothing short of great,"You can't beat the Star Wars saga; it's grossed up to a billion dollars in filming & merchandise, a big director is behind it, and all of the films have been successful, even the painful two prequels to a certain extent."
1723,,The end of the saga- and what an ending it was.,"Well Star Wars fans, it's all come down to this. Ever since that day in May 1977, when fans first flocked to see this amazing movie, it's all been leading up to this. It is over, but at least we can say that it ended with flying colors."
1724,10,An Incredible Ending... and Beginning,"This film has it all: story, action, conflict, resolution and despair. Anakin's fall is similar to Michael Corleone's in ""The Godfather,"" in which a basically good man turns bad during the process of helping someone he loves (his father, Don Corleone). During the process, in which Michael commits vengeful murder, he gets a taste of the power that is offered through destroying one's enemies. By ""Godfather II,"" Michael is enveloped in evil, seeking to destroy anyone -- including his own brother -- whom he considers a threat. And in the end, he loses everything. ROTS follows the same arc, and is, in my own opinion, the best of the six; it's definitely better than the first two, and probably ""Jedi,"" which only leaves ""Empire"" and ""New Hope."" While I think those two are greater classics, I found myself more entertained in the pure sense with ""Sith,"" a beautiful, sad, desperate movie. The scene with Anakin burning alive was almost too much. My only problems come not from the movie but from the overall plot. Wouldn't Obi-Wan and Yoda have begun training Luke and Leia early? And how about this: ""Hey, let's take the boy and send him to live with Darth Vader's brother-in-law, AND keep the ""Skywalker"" last name!"" Highly secretive, right? My guess is that Vader, knowing that Obi Wan walked away, would have devoted most of his time in the next few years to hunting him down and destroying him. And surely at some point this search would have taken him to Tatooine to ask questions of Lars and Beru. Oh well -- it doesn't affect the overall excellent quality of this superb picture. Enjoy!"
1725,9,A return for Lucas,"Simply wonderful. I felt emotionally beat up walking out of the theater. The ups and downs without all the cute winks to the crowd (which dramatically lowered the tension and the reality of the danger in episodes I and II. This time, what was at stake was enough to keep me riveted throughout. "
1726,9,They finally got it,"I'm just old enough to have watched the last 5 movies in the theater. I feel like I saw the first one as well but that seems unlikely as I'd have been about 4 at the time but who knows in 1973. At any rate, I have to say that they finally got it with the new cast. I think everyone has really matured and it came through in this movie. I was floored by the special effects and quite moved by the drama, though I wouldn't say I was surprised by anything. The movie unfolded more or less exactly as any real Star Wars fan would have surmised:"
1727,10,"The missing piece in the STAR WARS saga has finally arrived, special effects and good story all included.","My Take: The darkest, boldest and possibly the deepest STAR WARS chapter since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. "
1728,6,One of the best in the saga,The worst part of the film is definitely the dialogues which always makes you cringe. There are moments that are visually stunning while John Williams fantastic soundtrack complimenting it and giving a sense of the grandeur of the tale unfolding. The engaging action sequences and the character arc of Anakin and the birth of Darth Vader itself make this a very entertaining film.
1729,3,"Good pieces, but poorly assembled","I went into this movie really hoping for the movie that would save the entire prequel trilogy. Instead it was the worst of the three. The acting has only gotten worse on all counts, the mood is confused, and the plot disjointed, barreling along ungracefully and without reason."
1730,10,Great,"This movie was the best movie all year!!! Everyone should go see it even if they did not like the other two. This one does not have those stupid characters, Jar Jar, of bad scenes, It is packed with everything every great movie should have. Even those who are not Star Wars fans should watch it. it might make you want to see the other films and if not you can say at least you see one great movie. I for one hope Star Wars win Best Film this year. you can really feel the emotion that goes along with the movie and feel the pain each character feels. it ties all the movie together, like it should and in a great way. I say thank you to Goege Lucas for keeping that dumb character Jar Jar from speaking or even having much of a roll. I also think it was a great Idea to go PG-13 instead of Pg. I for one will be trying to help Star Wars win best film of the year who is with me."
1731,10,Pretty cool,It's pretty good. I first saw this movie about 6 years ago. I really enjoyed it and how it goes right into ep 4.
1732,9,I always shed a tear!,"This film is now a 16 year old (2021 at the time of me writing this review). And every time I watch it, I always feel myself tearing up! It's so emotional! From the tragic death of Mace Windu, Anakin's true fall from grace, the death of the Jedi and the climatic lightsaber duel between him and Obi-Wan (especially Obi-Wan's speech to him on the volcano side)...I never cease to shed at least a tear. When I saw it in theaters for the first time in 2005, I was a blubbering mess! This is, without doubt, the most emotional Star Wars you will find up to now. But, it is a fantastic experience all the way through!"
1733,6,Missed It By That Much,"Although I have always had misgivings about the ""Star Wars"" prequels, and felt vindicated by the wretched ""Phantom Menace"" and insipid ""Attack of the Clones,"" I'd hoped all the hype about ""Revenge of the Sith"" was true. Alas, while Lucas succeeded in breaking his slump, ""Sith"" is still not in a league with the first three films. The irony is that ""Sith"" fails primarily due to John Williams' obtrusive score. There's WAY too much music. It drowns out dialog essential to following the convoluted plot. This is ironical because Williams' original music was a big part of the driving force behind the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy."
1734,8,great film,"i found this film to be greatly enjoyable, the action is there from the start and comes thick and fast. The special effects are outstanding as we have come to expect from Lucas, however i cant shift the feeling that the scenes between Padme and Anakin lack the chemistry to make you care what happens to them and these scenes could have greatly been reduced and made a little more intense. All in all considering the standards set by episodes 4,5 & 6.... episode 3 gets us back to those same heights possibly as it is a lot darker film along the lines of Empire Strikes Back with Anakins reversal of fortunes and passage to the Dark side. To end with i would like to say i am disappointed for future generations who come to watch the films, as episode 3 basically gives you all the information that shocked us in episodes 5 & 6, Darth Vader being Lukes father and Leia his sister. This could have been easily avoided by only showing the birth of the children without Padme giving them their names, maybe a reference to the gender of the children would have been enough, but then that may just be me."
1735,10,The saga is now complete.,I was able to enjoy one of the few charity premieres of this film here in Denver.
1736,8,Video game: Plan 66 from Outer Space,"I guess I have to agree with everybody; lots of great visuals, no heart or soul. Also... no fun. If you like war movies, you might enjoy watching this, though. I get a kick out of the spacecraft that look and sound like idealized WWII fighters, but that's just me. Which reminds me, when will they make up their mind whether there is air in outer space or not? If you can hear the battle going on outside the ship, you don't have to worry about being sucked out the broken window. Of course, when the window did get broken, the getting sucked out part suddenly stopped like ten seconds later and everything was fine again. ?? I had to laugh when Padme tells Anakin he's been under a lot of stress lately. I was waiting for her to offer him a Valium. And most unfortunately, central to the movie and the entire Star Wars saga, Anakin's turn to the dark side; sheesh. In fairness, that's a real hard transition to make; it's not easy to have a likable character show his transition to a villain, but still seem like the same character. The combination of Hayden, the dialog, and the script didn't come near to doing it. Not enough buildup, not enough foreshadowing and inner torment, not enough external motivation. It wasn't a great tragedy, just a plot gimmick, and part of a whole tissue of plot holes that seemed to be tacked on to make the story mesh with Episode IV. Gotta kill off Padme? OK, let's just have her ""lose the will to live"". I expect Tom DeLay and Bush to pass a Congressional bill to save her life. Here are in the future, and the poor kid doesn't even get any resuscitation. Not even a doctor to thump her on the chest and scream ""Don't you die on me!"" like every guest actor on a TV hospital show gets. But Anakin threw everything over because he wanted to save her! Well, maybe he changed his mind, who knows. We'll have him yell 'Nooooooooooooooooooooo' to show he's upset, that oughta do it. This movie would have been a real hot item back when people were expanding their consciousnesses and reducing their logical skills before heading out to the movies. I did kind of like General Grievous, though, and the scenes with him were... fun! Kind of like Star wars used to be. I'll give the movie another point just for sentimental reasons."
1737,9,The most entertaining Star Wars movie ever!,"I am not saying Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars, it's not. The first 2 movies, Episodes IV and V, are the best, and Return of the Jedi is even better too, but no other Star Wars movie is more fun to watch than RotS. The reason why? The special effects. It just looks better. The lightsaber battles are drastically more dynamic than in any of the original 3, and are much more visually appealing. The starship battles obviously look a lot better and are equipped with a much more detailed backdrop than ever before. Revenge of the Sith is all about action and special effects. The characters are obviously great but that's just because of Star Wars lore. The story of RotS is not that strong. The character development and interactions are not that strong. It actually does have it's share of good lines, but the overall quality of the writing is not that great. Basically, Revenge of the Sith strives on its visual effects, and strives very well might I add. It was a good movie, with some of the best special effects ever seen. It's not exactly grade-A storyline or dialogue, but it's just so dang, freagin' cool! I loved this movie! 9 outta 10!"
1738,10,The story I have waited my whole life.,Is Hayden and Portman acting like they are sleep walking through it? Maybe. Hayden gets better when he turns to the darkside and Natalie is barely in this thing. The rest of the cast is awesome from Ewan to Sam to a very underrated performance by Ian McDermott. Even CGI Yoda is awesome.
1739,5,Same Star Wars galaxy but not the same quality,"As a big Star Wars fan since it's inception in the late 70s, I was very disappointed by the first half. From the start,I was lost in the vast Star Wars galaxy, being overwhelmed by the incredible graphics but very slim plot. The special effects were out of this world for sure but they grabbed my attention more than the plot did. What was the plot for the first half? I gave the film five out of ten because of the lucid plot. However, on the positive side, the film picked up quit a bit as it progressed and comes to an appropriate end. I was pleased with the obvious plot in the second half and was not in the dark regarding the sinister plans of Darth Sidious. The contrast between the good and the bad was obvious and so kept my attention. I walked away though with a big question in my mind as to why did Lucas involve the volcano planet? I know that it gives meaning as to what happens to one of the key characters in the film but aside from that why such a backdrop? Too much of this film came across to me as contrived and not as fluid as the originals and the previous two installments."
1740,7,Nicely sets up for 'A New Hope',Third movie in the prequel trilogy. This movie's main purpose was to ensure continuity with the following Star Wars trilogy. Dearth Vader is born.
1741,4,"Huge effort, big production values, weird design decisions, cringe-worthy dialog.","Having just re-visited Star Wars Episode III on DVD, i'm left wondering at a few weird scenes and the general stupidity of the movie. Half of the characters' motivation to do something must've happened off screen, the worst by far being Anakin's fall to the ""dark side"". Over what, exactly? He's seen the damage the Sith have done, he's had the emperor reveal himself IN PERSON, and yet ... ah, i'm not willing to go there. Too soap-opera like..."
1742,5,The end of the beginning,"I was a teenager when the original Star Wars movies were released, and like a lot of people from that generation have been disappointed with the first 2 prequels. This film gave Lucas a final chance to recapture the magic."
1743,9,What a Star Wars movie fan needed.,"I saw ROTS last night and I am still trying to process everything I saw. It will probably take at least one more viewing to fully appreciate it, but here is my initial-reaction review."
1744,7,the Sith hits the fan,"The dialog is VIVID VIDEO. Jenna Jameson has the right to laugh at a lot of the dramatic performances. So it sucks,then? Is it really that bad? Nope. It delivers, overall. Lucas has taken ques from many of his hard-core critics; toughening the prequels up with pain, violence(PG-13. Hello!?!)and and the strongest downer-vibe since ""Empire"". Most of the action is beautiful. Lucas figured out what the geeks want: Lightsabers , Lightsabers, and Lightsabers. Episode 4 was based on a samurai flick, and that base helped make it mythological. In the name of bridging 3 and 4, Lucas has thousands of those suckers buzzing round-and-round. It works pretty nicely, giving the prequels a physical danger that was noticeably absent from 1 and 2. This one is still like 90% cgi-cartoon, but I'm kind of used to the loony-tune epic landscapes. The sense of ""this is it,folks"" provides the most stirring moments. Live it up, people. We all know how this hub bub is going to end up;Bravo to Lucas for trying his best to make the build-up to a 30-year-old-holy-film interesting for the sneering adults as well as the wide-eyed kids. This one is too-close to great to be dismissed. This is it."
1745,6,"best of new three, still not up to par.","As a fan, I wanted to suspend disbelief for this movie, but it just wasn't possible. I had to shake my head at several scenes in the movie, especially Anakins turn to the dark side. And what was up with the lava surfing scene? I am disappointed in IMDb users who give this a ten. You are wearing your ""fan"" goggles too much, or you were drunk from all of the alcohol you imbibed while waiting days in line. There are maybe only 20 or so movies that deserve a ten. Mr Lucas was involved in none of them."
1746,7,Now this looks more like a Lucas' film...,"The most expected chapter of the new trilogy. The only one which really contributes interesting answers. Or should I say THE ANSWER? I mean, how and why Anakin Skywalker went over the dark side and became Lord Vader. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is by far the best movie of the new generation of SW episodes. Christensen looks like he's matured (even though I still think that this character is too much for him)."
1747,5,Still doesn't top the originals,"One of the most eagerly anticipated movies of my life, Revenge of the Sith in some ways cashes the check that was promised but bounced with The Phantom Menace (1999). Certainly the superior film of the prequels, Episode III offers mind-blowing digital effects and an incredibly dark tone as we see Anakin Skywalker make the transformation into Darth Vader. Among the highlights include the opening space battle and Anakin's betrayal of the Jedi council (boy is that dark...). Lucas has also attempted to make the visual transition between this film and Episode IV by re-using similar sets and costumes (even Anakin is sporting a 70s style mullet), so that the jump from CGI smoothness to cheap plastic and matte-work seems less congruent."
1748,10,Back to form for George Lucas,"It's a huge improvement over the previous two films. I doubt there'll be a single person who sees them who doesn't agree with that statement. I also doubt that very many people will rate it higher than Empire Strikes Back. ESB remains the best in the series, IMO. Likely the most disagreement will arise from whether or not it's better than Return of the Jedi. I thought it was. Quite a bit better, in fact. My wife, however, thought it wasn't quite as good, although she likes ROTJ a lot more than I do. I rate ANH a little bit higher than ROTS, but not by too much. The majority of ROTS is every bit as good as anything in ANH, but although both movies have their flaws, ROTS has quite a few more of them, I think. But I'll get to that later. Let me start by talking about what I loved. But be warned that there are some major *SPOILERS* ahead."
1749,5,"Good, but not great","Star Wars III, Revenge of the Sith, the long-awaited grand finale to the prequel of the Star Wars trilogy, is a good movie, but not the best in the series. When it was announced that this movie would be the darkest of the three prequel-movies, I had thought they were referring to the story rather than the actual lighting of the movie."
1750,7,Should be renamed to The Rise of Vader,"""Revenge of the Sith"" opens with more politics in the scrolling exposition, ugh, and in our opening space battle we find that Obi-Wan is now a military general, really?! But still dressed in humble robes while flying a battle mission, ugh. And he seems too well groomed to be a Jedi knight and general with his feathered hair style from our time. Could the designers not give him a more time and environment appropriate style? He's just so out of sync. Weak. Anakin is still Obi's padawan but continues in his backtalking arrogance. When Obi tosses off his overcoat to confront Dooku his Jedi fashion looks more like medieval apprentice-wear than state-of-the-art Jedi protective-wear which is closer to what Anakin sports in black leather. Weak. And the fact that Dooku - the grand leader of the successful galactic separatist movement - chooses to confront two Jedi by himself (with a couple of token droids) is just poor storytelling again George Lucas. In any other story Dooku would've been surrounded by legions of Sith warriors, and never have been vulnerable. So weak. And I am so tired of Obi/Anakin being able to lightsaber their way out of captivity every single time. Again, it's just lazy/weak storybuilding when you deus ex machina every challenging situation, it just wastes our time. And we learn that though Anakin and Padme are married (from ""Attack..."") they're still hiding that fact from everyone as unlikely as that can be. Seriously, a senator like Padme would have a close circle of friends and advisors, any of which she would've confided in at some point, or been found out. Again, any other veteran storyteller would've given us a more mature, complex/realistic treatment of this and other story elements. And surely it's a dire violation of the Jedi Code for him to be married yet somehow he's hidden that from ALL the Jedi who are supposed to be able to sense such things. So very weak. Oh, and she's pregnant, so that's going to be fun. BTW, ever notice it's never raining, anywhere, any planet, ever. Must be too hard for LucasFilms to CGI it. But I do have to admit the events leading up to Anakin's conversion to Darth Vader were well crafted. However, that praise quickly falls when you realize that not once during the massacre of the Jedi did Obi ever inquire of Anakin's safety or whereabouts. Even the VFX misfire occasionally, like when Anakin and Obi face off near the end, Obi draws his lightsaber from his waist but it doesn't activate when he swings it out and you can tell he meant it to. The VFX techs fumbled that one. Anyway it was genuinely fascinating to see that as Luke and Leia were born as offspring of Anakin and Padme that Anakin was being resuscitated as the dark-clad Darth Vader - two very interesting and very different types of birth. But at the end when Senator Organa instructs that C3PO's mind be wiped, that comes off as another lazy, cover-the-plot-hole way of force-fitting him into the next trilogy where he had no prior knowledge of all these events, ugh. Again, much of these failings can be laid right at the feet of George Lucas who wrote, directed, edited, and generally managed everything by himself. You HAVE to permit others to critique and collaborate otherwise you get subpar stories like this."
1751,7,Moments of Brilliance...,"While this film is likely the best (certainly the most entertaining) of the ""new"" trilogy it's far from perfect. The love scenes in particular are perhaps the most painful to watch, with childlike, storybook-style dialogue that simply doesn't work. I get the distinct impression even the actors themselves don't even half believe the things they're saying. In addition, the motivation for Anakin's rather sudden turn to the dark side is weak as he goes from virtuous defender of republican democracy to blindly obedient toady of the evil emperor in about twelve seconds. Thus, it seemed to me a more jarring transition rather than an inevitable one and so the audience feels skepticism (""the chosen one"" turned to the dark side because he had a vague dream and was naive enough to think a sketchy old dark sorcerer could save his girlfriend's life just because he told him some story about a jedi named Darth never-heard-of-him-before?) not acceptance."
1752,8,Star Wars Is Back To The Way It Used To Be!,"***may contain spoilers*** The New Star Wars Movie is a mirror image of the way the Old Star Wars used to be. This movie is very well paced. There are great action scenes, with the space fights, and the light sabers, they were all done astoundingly well. The movie has a great balance of action, romance, sorrow, everything the old star wars movies pack in so well."
1753,7,Age Dependent Reaction,"Star Wars groupies, of whom there appear to be millions, will no doubt love this movie since it has more (and better) things they've loved in prior films in this series. Those of us who are not afflicted by Star Wars mania will find this movie somewhat better than most, if not all, of its predecessors. The action scenes are extremely well executed and, from a technical standpoint, there are few if any movies that can approach this one. If you can invest any belief at all in the plot, the suspense and tension are incredible. The acting, however, is atrocious. Christensen and Portman are especially bad. McDiarmid is the only one with any flair. I went to this (as I have to a couple of others) because I have Star Wars fanatics in my family. The most I can say is that I regretted being there less this time than I have on other occasions."
1754,7,The Best of the New Trilogy,"Revenge of the Sith is the long awaited conclusion the Star Wars saga that began all those years ago. Of course, it doesn't seem like it was that long ago that the first Star Wars film was made and yet here we are almost thirty years later. Many things have changed, some things for the better and some not, but we still have that same heart that Lucas put into the original when we look at this film."
1755,9,The best of the prequels,It's outstanding with great performances and a breathtaking visual effects and has the best lightsaber dual in the entire Star Wars saga making it not only one of the best star Wars movie but also a great science fiction movie in general
1756,2,Acting makes Movies: not Action,"Episode III of the incredible Star Wars series is best summed up as a ""bad film with dazzling special effects""."
1757,5,major plot holes....,"Yes this is the best of the three prequels. The special effects are as dazzling as ever and this time there is more story. The problem however, is the major plot holes. If you are not a big star wars fan, you may not notice but Luke and Leia's mother died instantly after she gave birth. In Return of the Jedi, Princess Leia talks to Luke about the memory of her mother, her ""real"" mother. I've heard other people say that in the new DVD versions of Star Wars, Lucas edited out this dialog. I don't know if that's true but if it is, its a lazy attempt to tie the original story together. After dwelling on this, I realized that this plot hole is not nearly as bad as the one in the original trilogy. Luke and Leia have a passionate kiss in Empire Strikes back and then we learn that they are brother and sister. Leia confronts this fact by saying ""somehow....I've always known."" Well maybe long ago in a galaxy far far away, people were not ashamed to have deep kisses with their siblings but that strikes me as a little odd. Also, what's the deal with R2D2's flying capability? This did not happen in IV, V or VI. Did he forget he could fly when Captain Antilles wiped away their memories? Well, I guess for the average popcorn-blockbuster-movie-fanatic this does not make much difference. it would not surprise me if one day, Lucas decided to re release all the movies in theaters with added scenes and all new plot twists that will continue to distort our imaginations of the story."
1758,10,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,What can i say? I like the other prequels but i just... this movie makes me wet.. I understand its not perfect objectively but i just dont care it is for me.. I think episode 5 is better than this as a movie but this is just my favourite of them all and not just star wars.
1759,3,"Bubbles, forever blowing","I would just like to point one thing out to all the apologists who are salivating all over this movie (the worst of the 6, in my opinion) -- there is a scene at the concert hall where Palpatine and Skywalker muse over the nature of the Dark Side while watching what appears to be a giant bubble. If anyone can explain this without sounding like an idiot, I will change my tune. This really changes the nature of the entire Star Wars sextet: when Lucas spliced in digitized shots of cheering crowds in the new edition of ""Return of the Jedi"", we now know that they were cheering not the demise of the Empire but a return of the bubble shows that were a hallmark of the Republic. Add to this the fact that the entire new trilogy seems to be built on the notion that Queen Padme is the freaknastiest lady in the entire galaxy -- to wit, she is the ""elected Queen"" of a planet populated by Rastafarian rabbit-men so annoying they are forced to live underwater; she takes a 6 year-old boy from his mother and ends up bedding him, even after (or because?) he is fitted with a robot hand; and she wills herself to die after giving birth to TWINS because the father, who just destroyed her beloved Republic, and attempted to kill her and all her friends, did not show up for the delivery. Yes, that Padme is one sick spacefreak."
1760,10,Please no more whining about acting,The star wars prequels have had fine acting in them. I am sick and tired of hearing about the dialog and acting problems with these movies. They all have been great movies that have lived up to their names. Also what is up with all the Jar jar hating amongst Star Wars fans. Actually had people get upset in the move theater when they saw him alive at the very end of the movie at Padme's funeral.
1761,5,"Wait A Minute, So What Is So Good About This Movie","this is a terrible movie and most definitely does not deserve a high rating or to be on the top 250 it has a lot of action and effects, but everything else is flawed, the acting is terrible, probably the worst of that year that I've seen, with a bunch of other flaws, this movie totally ruins, the whole trilogy, and is a huge huge huge disappointment to me, and i can not see what is so good about it............................................"
1762,9,My favourite Star Wars film,"I don't understand why the prequels get so much hate. This really is one of the most definitive star wars films to date. Maybe the CGI is a bit dated, but in terms of story and pure emotion, it makes it my favourite film. I have such an emotional connection with the characters"
1763,8,best of the first three,"*May Contain Spoilers* This was in my opinion (and I'm sure people will likely disagree), the best of the first three films and deserves it's rating. i really enjoyed the effects they had, the acting was great, little to no Jar Jar (he had two lines which were ""Excuse Me"") and the story that we knew would have to happen came together like it should. Firstly, Chancellor Palpatine was gold here. The actor did a great job in his role as he came off as such a wormy, sleazy politician who knew how to talk to someone or get someone on his side. He did this slowly and methodically and eventually (with a little help of bad dreams that predicted the future), he got his way. The love story was better and they clearly acted better and the best moment of the movie (besides of course Order 66) was the epic battle of Obi-Wan and Anakin, that was the best light saber fight in all the movies, including the originals. "
1764,8,A breath of fresh air!,This last addition to the Star Wars franchise is a breath of fresh air.
1765,10,The Force is Very Strong with this one...,"For the first time since Return of the Jedi you actually feel like you are watching a space opera. Even though Attack of the Clones was a good movie and The Phantom Menace did have some good qualities,they didn't have the feel that made the originals feel so great.For the first time in these prequels you feel for the characters.Walking in you all know what is going to happen because of the original trilogy but this makes the story all the more tragic.By the beginning of Revenge of the Sith,Anakin Skywalker is now a Jedi Knight,and the Clone Wars have been raging on for 3 years.The winner of this war will be decided over Courscant,the capital of the Old Republic.Chancellor Palpatine(better known as Darth Sidious the evil Dark Lord of the Sith) has been kidnapped by General Greivous and Count Dooku,leaders of the Sepratist party.After an amazing space battle,Anakin,and his former mentor Obi-Wan battle the Sith Lord Count Dooku.Anakin beheads the Count in front of the smiling Palpatine.Anakin feels uneasy about his act.Palpatine assures him revenge is natural and reminds him of the Tusken Raiders in Attack of the Clones.You know Anakin wouldn't tell that to hardly anyone,you know that the evil Palpatine is someone he trusts. Greivous escapes and heads to Utapu.Anakin is named a Jedi Council member by Palpatine,and the role of the skeptical Jedi is now filled by Mace Windu.Mace says Palaptine is a part of a plot to destroy the Jedi.Obi-Wan's relationship with Anakin is much much better than the one he had with him in Attack of the Clones,you know for sure that they love each other in a father/son relationship.Anakin is Palpatine's close friend,and he is interested in what the sly man has to say.Palpatine tells Anakin the Sith Legend of Darth Plagueis,who used his evil power towards immortality.This story interests Anakin because he is afraid he will lose Padme like he lost his mother.He has had horrible nightmares of Padme dying since Padme told him she was pregnant with Luke and Leia.He is afraid he these nightmares will become reality,and when Palpatine tells Anakin his true identity he gives in and embraces the Dark Lord.He helps him kill the Jedi,and Palpatine's separatist enemies.The finale of the film shows us why Vader must be put behind the dark helmet in a battle to the death between Obi-Wan and Vader on the Volcanic Planet called Mustafar."
1766,10,we have a winner,"Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. One of the most under-appreciated movies of this decade. Why? Because people forget that many of the ""problems"" in it...actually are = or > in episode 4-6."
1767,6,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!","Well done George Lucas. The first movie I ever saw as a child was Star Wars, and after not being very thrilled with Attack of the Clones, this saga has now been put to rest beautifully. I know there are people who comment on the acting being soft at times but thats what its all about. The acting in A New Hope wasn't anything to give awards to either. What ever the acting may be, what about the transformation of this weak young man into an evil lord. This doesn't happen because of power, it happens because of weakness. Brilliant! This movie is a must see for everyone. Even if you are not a big Star Wars fan, the production and effects in this movie are unlike anything you've seen before. The operatic climax was wonderful. Bravo! 10 out of 10!"
1768,1,"The saga is complete, and not a moment too soon.","Yes, I've heard it all before. ""Nobody goes to see Star Wars for the story or the acting, yadda-yadda-yadda . . ."" However, there are limits. When a movie is so bad that you start to do a Rocky Horror in the theatre, there is a problem. And that's exactly what I started doing (key word: ""Pants!"")."
1769,7,Good,"As the Clone Wars near an end, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious steps out of the shadows, at which time Anakin succumbs to his emotions, becoming Darth Vader and putting his relationships with Obi-Wan and Padme at risk. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. My only problem with the series was the supporting cast, but it's still okay. This is one of those movies that the star isn't only in for the paycheck. I give it 7/10."
1770,8,Amazing,"This movie opens with one of the most exciting scrolls yet.Followed by that is an even more exciting space battle which puts you into a starship.Its very colorful!The lightsaber battles were rather short but there were about 5 or 6 different battles,Instead of the usual 1 or 2.When the clones turned on the Jedi it was very emotional and you felt their pain!The Most disappointing things were the deaths of the Jedi Masters on the Council.They were WAY to easy deaths for a ""jedi master"" to even be considered real.Also,General Grievous death by a blaster was awfully disappointing.Anakin's transition into Darth Vader is very terrifying,especially for the younger fans.Definitely the best one yet.If I had to describe this movie in one word,I would say:Spectacular."
1771,4,Pretty Poor Indeed,"Should Lucas be allowed to mess with his own films? Well that certainly went far enough when he meddled with 4-6 , quite glad I've still got each of them on original VHS from before 1997 even if they're a little tired , But even that doesn't compare to the dross that is Episodes 1-3 and Revenge of the Sith merely finishes this insult off , and finally gives me the closure to disregard and forget all these prequels and be left with just the memory of the original 3 films even if it involves fuzzy lines and fiddling with the tracking . Altogether what lets this film down is not terrible acting or a bad storyline , it just simply is rushed and poorly executed by someone who is clearly not a good director , remember the best Star Wars Film by far was not directed by Lucas , and I agree with one other user that the turn to the dark side was more like an instantaneous flip to the dark side with no real progression or thought for actions , indeed another user points to the Godfather where Michael gradually becomes involved to protect his father but this is done with some consideration for the steps involved in such a transformation ."
1772,1,The revenge of the Lucas,"For three years have I waited to see a story get together, three years entering the official ""STARWARS"" site which I paid money for and he let me feel like I waisted my time..."
1773,7,The Best of the Prequels by far,"StarWars: Revenge of the Sith is one of the best StarWars movies. When I saw Attack of the Clones I thought that was the best next to The Empire Strikes Back. I thought that was Lucas showing he can still do StarWars. No though, Revenge of the Sith is a real StarWars movie. It still has George Lucas' bad dialogue of course. There's more action than there is talking though thank god. When you think of it though, A New Hope didn't have the best dialogue either. Although the late great Alec Guinness was nominated for playing Obi-Wan, it's said that he hated the lines he had to say. Hey at least he had better lines than Natalie Portman does. "
1774,8,"I am big now, but I still love the Star Wars!","Now I am not 10 years old any more, when Episode IV came out. It is amazing how much technology in the film making improved over many years."
1775,10,The greatest movie of all time.,Cinematic masterpiece is an understatement. Literally perfect in every way.
1776,5,An unsatisfying conclusion,"I saw Episode 3 last night and must say I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high, based on generally favorable reviews and the comments of those who had already seen the movie. "
1777,10,A Victory for Great Story,"This is not some profound film of ideas, but simply a rattling good yarn, told at pace."
1778,9,The Saga is finally complete.,"The movie just keeps you glued to your seat for 140minutes of pure star wars action. I couldn't have dreamed of a better episode III. This time Lucas went all the way... you'll see it all, all the fights, the planets, the dazzling special effects and foremost - continuous action, no bull-crap, the way it should be done, FINALLY!!!!"
1779,1,"Piece of s**t , walk away!!!!!","My god! Who let the dogs out? It must have been George Lucas. All my fantastic memories of going to the movies as a child and dreaming of a galaxy far far away have been wiped out. This movie is simply awful!!! It seems people just see the title Star Wars and automatically accept anything that's done in its name. Did you not notice the dreadfully hammy overacting in this film? Did you not notice the extremely poor scriptwriting that shoves clichés down your throat at EVERY turn?? The worst on screen romance i think i have ever seen. I wouldn't waste puke on it! OK, George, maybe having 4000 cgi FX in every shot will cover up the fact that you haven't directed a decent movie in 30 years, huh? NOT!!!!! This film is simply inept, has no soul and should be taken out in the backyard and burnt! Ewan Mcgregor and Natalie Portman used to be decent actors. Here they are simply inept. I used to be a Star Wars fan. Not anymore. Seems i'm a minority though. People just open up and swallow this crap like there's no tomorrow. Well well, i'll go watch something good like the Lord of the rings movies instead, now that's what I call great movies. I'll leave you with the immortal words of Mr.Bill Hicks: "
1780,8,wow,"Visually stunning, this is a story that wraps up the saga in a nice, neat package and answers all questions. George Lukas has outdone himself with this one. Hayden Christenson has gone from a whiny teenager to an angry, twisted man with a deep weakness. This weakness allows evil to twist and destroy all semblance of humanity in Anikan and turn him into the Dark Sith Lord. One thing I really enjoyed was that Darth Vader has been glamorized by the public, turning him into this really cool, evil character worthy of costumes worn by children wanting to be Darth at Halloween. Everyone knows Darth Vader is one of the most enigmatic evil figures in all of cinema history. However, this movie really illuminates the lonely, ugly decline of this husband and father and what he had to do and sacrifice to be the dark lord we all glamorize. The only issue I had with this movie was a few lines of Republican bashing, which I think had no place in this movie. Whatever your political leanings are, we could all use a break from socio-economic commentary. I understand the connections Lucas was trying to make, and they were blatantly obvious in this movie. Other than that this movie was darn near perfect in my opinion."
1781,1,"If you like this movie, I hate you","wow this was the biggest waste of my time ever I don't even know why I paid $9 to go see it in the movies I guess when you see the others you just have to, oh wait now I remember, I was 6 when I saw the others. where to begin..."
1782,,Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith (2005),Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)
1783,1,All your favorite's bad bits,"OK, I've grown tired of the bitching about fidelity to the original trilogy, loss of artistic integrity, and Lucas' visionary rights to this ""world of his creation"". This is a thread for those who agree that, such questions aside, the new film is spectacularly awful, and simply want to have fun at its expense. Please, what do people think were the most terrible parts of the film? I thought that the dialogue in general was laughable, but a favorite's stinker was the love talk ""You're so beautiful."" ""That's because I'm so in love."" ""No, it's because I'm so in love with you."" It takes a special talent to make Natalie Portman anything but breathtakingly beautiful, but Lucas delivers again. And Hayden Christiansen? Man was he well-directed. Can you imagine the instructions? ""Ok Hayden, for this shot I want you to frown. And the next one. And after that. In fact, you can pretty much spend the whole movie looking like a pouty 7 year old."" What do you guys think? Which parts made you laugh out loud?"
1784,8,The end...err..the middle of the Star Wars saga,"SW3 was released in France on 18.05, one day prior to the US. That's payback from MrLucas as he had us French waiting until October 1999 to see Episode 1(released in may1999 in the US). I guess people's appreciation of SW in general depends on whether they discovered the original trilogy when it was released (which means you remember it as a social phenomenon, especially if, like me, you were a kid back then). Then you have those who only love SW and who wish they were jedis and you have those with more perspective, who love cinema in general and just fail to be critical enough when it comes to SW(some of you reading this must think 'what about those who love cinema and believe that Lucas is poor at directing and is making entertainment for kids?' I know you are there guys, but having just seen the last SW movie ever, I just don't want to hear any cynicism or sarcasm about Lucas and his saga.) Since Episode1, I have found the fans very critical with SW and Lucas. Not that SW are perfect movies but why don't the fans accept Lucas' vision and style. After all, HE is the producer/writer/director. I simply love the new trilogy because it brings a new light (darkness?) to the original one. It's no black&white stuff. Episode3 tells a lot about politics, democracy, dictatorship and is more closely related to the real world than the 5 other chapters. A lot is said and done during the two hours of film (or should I say hard-drive since the movie was in digital?) I heard that fans(humorous note: they sometimes are like the Jedi to the Republic: trying to serve the cause but because of too much conservatism, they eventually lead to sedition...)complain that Revenge does not give all the answers to the questions raised in the other episodes. I can understand this can puzzle the non-fan moviegoers but I am happy that some questions remain unanswered as this is what will keep me watching 1,2 and 3 with more and more pleasure in the years to come. Also, there are really great scenes in this final installment. I noted that in terms of editing and shooting, Lucas broke some SW rules here: 1/ there is a dream scene whereas all the scenes in SW have so far been edited in a linear style(no flashback for example) 2/ there is one shot (seen in the trailer) where Annakin kind of turn toward the camera to give a bad-guy look. That's not the kind of things we were used to in SW 3/ there are a few moments where Lucas leaves time for atmosphere, which was not done in Ep1 and 2, due to the density of the stories that had to be told in a pretty tight time frame. And I must say those 3 elements (but there are more) make the movie more organic and visceral than any other SW. so yes, Episode 3 is the achievement I was raving about when I was 7 in 1983!"
1785,1,Disappointed 8 year old,"My eight year old son is totally obsessed with Star Wars, and has bought in to all the hype surrounding this last film. He has all the other films on DVD and has watched them over and over. So, how can I now explain to him that we cannot go and see Revenge of the Sith because it is rated 12A in the UK (13, I believe, in the US)? Surely Mr Lucas could have given some thought to his most loyal fans? My eight year old son is totally obsessed with Star Wars, and has bought in to all the hype surrounding this last film.

1786,8,"Begins like another toy commercial, ends like a real movie!","*** This review does contain one small spoiler, but it's flagged so it can be easily skipped over. ***"
1787,1,Definitely one of Lucas best 18 movies,**Warning some spoilers ahead**
1788,6,"A good effort, but doesn't quite measure up","George Lucas' new movie, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is far better than ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Attack of the Clones."" However, the Anakin's transformation is not believable and the acting on the part of Hayden Christianson and Natalie Portman is absolutely horrid. Unfortunately, this film doesn't measure up to the original trilogy. In fact, the extensive use of computer graphics is so different than the traditional stop-motion animation used in the past that ""Revenge of the Sith"" doesn't even seem like it is from the same galaxy as the original films. This film, like the other prequels, lacks the character depth seen in the old movies. Overall, a good effort that doesn't quite measure up."
1789,10,A swashbuckling end to the beginning of Star Wars...,"This movie was simply outstanding. Despite some occasionally wooden dialogue, everything came together to set up the next 3 movies..."
1790,8,The final solid entry to the franchise,This film was an amalgamation of everything great about the Star Wars franchise.
1791,8,"Was good, could have been great.","After watching this film several times now and having let enough time go by to really let the film sink in, I feel I can now write a well-rounded, as objective as possible review of the film. So here it goes..."
1792,7,Star Wars a Major Let Down,"Star Wars has become embedded within today's culture. Everyone has seen at least one of the movies or knows about them. Since the release of Star Wars in 1977 (re-named Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope in 1981 after it was re-released), the once believed failure became a phenomenon, defining a new generation of geeks. Following the release of the original was The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983. Since then, they have been re-released in theaters in 1997 and the prequels Star Wars: Episode I - Phantom Menace and Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones have been released. On May 19, 2005 that last and final episode Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was released and much to my horror did not live up to expectations."
1793,10,A Science Fiction Masterpiece !!,"The final instalment of the Star Wars saga has been probably the most emotional of all six movies. Episode III offers the audience much more than just lightsabers, warp drives and special effects."
1794,8,A great finale.,"Just as the other 2 in the prequel trilogy this movie had its fair share of shortcomings, the directing isn't amazing, the writing falls completely flat sometimes and the saber duels and combat have gotten more and more ridiculous. But that doesn't mean the story doesn't wrap up nicely. Even though I do think Anakin makes the decision to go full evil a tiny bit to quickly he is still very well built up through the prequels."
1795,8,The obvious best and strongest of the prequel trilogy!,"Revenge of the Sith were the Star Wars movie we were waiting for! After two watchable movies, one badder than the other, Sith concludes the prequel trilogy on a very satisfactory and epic note! The movie doesn't waist too much time on political dialog, there is more action, the characters are both better and stronger, the acting is much better, the story is obviously stronger than in the previous two prequel flicks and Sith brings back the excitement and entertainment, that all we Star Wars fans missed so desperately! Lucas wrapped the prequel trilogy up nicely, so the best thing to be said about the prequel trilogy is: it ended on a high! "
1796,3,Episode 3 is not worth the $,"There were some saving grace moments in this installment of the saga. Many of the things that went wrong were the acting was horrible and the script was written by a 6 year old. Everything came so easy to all of the characters it was mind numbingly boring. Luke and Lea's names seemed to be just plucked out of Padme's rear end. I may see it again in a few weeks, but at this moment I am very disappointed in Gearge Lucas. "
1797,10,"Finest Star Wars episode, and Greek tragedy","Everybody knows, this is the downfall of Anakin Skywalker. But George Lucas has really reached his goal of making Anakin a very human character. Only Padmé and Luke (on Episode VI) feel that there's still good in him. Obi-Wan fails to see it, and one wonders what would have happened if Qui-Gon Jinn had trained him instead. Those who have read the excellent Episode I novelization, are aware that a Jedi can be atuned to two different ways of sensing the Force. One, the Living Force, that makes you a compassionate, empathic person, always attuned to the needs of those around you. The other, the Unifying Force, makes you aware of something greater than individual forms of life, and makes you serve this greater-than-the-universe Force even sacrificing individual beings in the process. As you know from Episode I, Obi-Wan was more atuned to this way of seeing the Force, in opposition to his Master, who was specially ""mindful of the Living Force"", as undoubtedly, Anakin is. A sensitive person is more easy to succumb to the evils that constantly ail us, by the same thing that Anakin calls ""compassion"". That is the key to Anakin's character, and Darth Sidious knows it. Everyone would recall Yoda telling Luke in Episode V that, to honor what they friends fight for, maybe he has to sacrifice their lives. That is something that, like his father, he cannot do. But what is the little thing that catapults Anakin into the dark? A vision. Like Oedipus, by trying to avoid what is in his vision, he ends up provoking it himself, losing his identity in the process. Being ""blind"". ""Revenge of the Sith"" is also an interesting study on how politics really work and how a democracy can turn into something horrible when leaders only care for ""unlimited power""... A heart-shattering tragedy not only for one man, but for an entire galaxy."
1798,8,The best of the wars!,"I walked into the theater knowing that Lucas wouldn't let me down in this final chapter, but by god he did more than a good movie. The acting in this one is quite impressive compared to that of the previous prequels. Hayden does a much better job at Anakin in this installment and all the others do just as well. The visuals in this movie are utterly amazing and will not be beat. Like all the SW films the movie is visually beautiful. Yet not only is this finale visually beautiful, but it is a amazingly beautiful film emotionally. Like such that my favorite scene has to be the bit where the Jedi are off to arrest Palpatine and they tell Anakin to wait in the council chambers. And the small scene of him sitting in the chambers is an eerily beautiful scene, which you'd have to see because I cannot describe why. This one is extremely dark.It begins with a big opening sequence and has that cartoony star wars humor often included in the others, but the more we slip into the story the more we see anakin slip into darkness.This is a film in which I cried like 5 times!Cried in a Star Wars movie!Star Wars!The scene in which Obi-wan tells Anakin how much he had meant to him and how he could not believe what Anakin had done was truly sad. In short there is violence, dismemberment, sadness anger and hatred. All a good movie needs! 10/10"
1799,7,A Major Improvement Over The Last Two Movies,"I was raised watching and loving Star Wars, and this was always my favorite one. I don't know why, maybe because it was the darkest. But I don't think that that was what I was thinking about when I was a kid. Either way, it lives up pretty well after watching it again years later. "
1800,6,Execute order 66 ... arghhhhh :( (possible spoilers),"When I saw on IMDb that ep3 had a higher rank than the last 2 and that most of the comments were favorable I thought...wow, finally Lucas does something to remind us that he was the same one who created the first series(ep. 4-5-6)"
1801,4,"Necessary, but not good","This movie fills in the gaps - as a matter of fact, a LOT of time is spent talking as they try to take care of these 'housekeeping' matters. The visuals are outstanding, and most of the acting is good...except for Hayden Christensen. What a flat performance! He only has one expression, and his character is written so badly that I found it impossible to sympathize with (or even care about) him. Anniken/Vader just doesn't makes sense. "
1802,10,"Awesome, but probably a film mostly for the fans","I went to opening night of this film and saw it in a theater packed full of more than 700 screaming fans. Revenge of the Sith is a very good action and adventure film, although the story is a bit convoluted since it has to tie up a lot of knots left over from the two first films. Because of this, I'm afraid this one is very much a film for Star Wars fans, alternatively fans of Science-Fiction in general, not so much a blockbuster that ""anyone"" can enjoy, like for instance the Lord of the Rings-films. This is not necessarily a bad thing though, George Lucas has clearly made this one with the fans in mind and as a fan I couldn't be more happy. I can remember six years ago when Episode I was released, and I was convinced that it would beat Titanic as the highest grossing film ever at the box office. Today I'm not that naive, and I can even say that if you didn't like Episodes I-II, then stay away from this film because it has more in common with those films than it differs from them. There's just a small portion of the running time in which the film starts to feel and look like the original trilogy (which, by the way, is awesome and sent shivers down my spine when it finally happens)."
1803,,"Okay, but still an almighty mess","This goes some way to redeem the gigantic steaming piles of CGI overload of the first two chapters. Not that this isn't another gigantic steaming (make that molten) pile of CGI overload but at least a semi-coherent plot kicks in at some point (about halfway through, unfortunately)."
1804,8,The rise of evil,"Most people consider the first trilogy(ep. IV-VI) to be the best of the two, and I can't blame them. As a whole, it indeed is. But if I have to pick out the best Star Wars movie, it is without doubt this one. "
1805,6,Ooh-Surprise--Episode III too predictable,"Six given for visual effects. How about George Lucas for Rummy's replacement--now there's a guy who can ""fight with the army he has."" What is amazing is how the movie is put together. Lucas and his troops should be planning our military strategy."
1806,4,Lucas: a toymaker who sometimes makes movies to sell his toys,"Stunning visuals, breathtaking CGI sequences, hardcore light-sabre battling, but ultimately unimaginative, unsatisfying and - worst of all - boring."
1807,,Star Wars saga ends with a loser,Worse than the previous two films.
1808,8,So we've finally made it to the middle of the movie!,Episode III is hands down the best of the episode series. This movie actually felt like Star Wars. The other two felt kinda kiddish. But this one had all of the fights and in space flying sequences that you have grown to expect from all of the other Star Wars movies.
1809,7,"Okay, but not great.","Well, here it is. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is here and many would argue it lives up to the hype. Why shouldn't it? It has all the things a typical summer blockbuster should have; great action, big explosions, special effects, heroes and villains, and a climactic final battle. So why the low score? Because this is a flawed movie and it is getting the score it deserves."
1810,9,The Best of the Star Wars Films!!!,"The force is with Episode III, the final installment of the Star Wars saga. After the two prequels, Lucas has created a perfect bridge for a new hope( I couldn't resist watching A New Hope right after I got back from the cinema), and not only that - he gave us the best star wars film... Now this statement will make a LOT of people rage on while mentioning their favourite films from the original trilogy - well let's recap on that, shall we... Well I think we can all agree it's much better than the other prequels (it has a weak dialogue at times, and there still are one or two bad love scenes, but those are George's weaknesses, and they were there throughout the entire saga), and as for the original trilogy, well, we have the return of the Jedi, the film that ends the saga, and what a stupid ending. it seems as if Lucas didn't have something good to show us except the confrontation between Luke and Vader, so he recycled the death star and inserted a bunch of annoying teddy bears, that somehow, in the stupidest battle in cinema history, defeated the empire's best legions. jar jar binks is no match for those idiotic teddy bears. And give me a break - Leia is Luke's sister?! such an unnecessary decision, so many plot holes created... A New Hope Is a great movie, no doubt there, but despite its innovativeness, revenge of the sith climbs to a much greater emotional depth, plus if anything it makes A New Hope much more enjoyable, and increases the impact of the original trilogy. Our most serious competitor is Empire strikes back, The best of the original trilogy... too bad it has the silliest title in the saga. a lot of advantages - a new director, the terrible truth about the skywalker legacy, a Jedi master named Yoda, and a more mature tone to the entire film... but Yoda is a puppet on empire strikes back, and it fights with R2 over a biscuit, even though it is supposed to be a Jedi master, even though it has a major role on the film. But in revenge of the sith there is a digital Yoda, with an amazing variety of facial expressions, which allows him to act, and to fight - show the true power of a Jedi master. the scenes with Luke and Darth Vader are pretty good, and the revelation is without doubt an instant classic, (! ! ! !spoiler! ! ! !)the scene in revenge of the sith, where anakin burns and obi wan watches him, completely heart-broken(""you were my brother anakin!!! I loved you...""), is to me by far the most emotional, intense, sad, despairational, and heart breaking scene in the whole star wars saga( no spoilers from now on ). Revenge of the Sith is by far the darkest episode, since it contains the most tragic and sad events in the history of the galaxy far far away. There is never a dull moment in this one - this has amazing visual effects, great action scenes, exhilarating lightsaber duels, wonderful tributes to the original trilogy, and beautiful shots. The original trilogy is obviously better than the prequels, but Revenge of the Sith is the best film of the Star Wars saga."
1811,10,about time,i went to the opening show in order to see the movie. and i have to say it was awesome. Lucas finally got the right combination on graphics and story line together and made his best film yet. i believe that this one lived up to what everyone expected and even surpassed in some areas. great job Lucas
1812,8,The closing to the greatest saga in movie history couldn't have been better!,"Let me just say that George Lucas did a fantastic job! Considering, that they only had 11 days to shoot it. Probably the most atmospheric and darkest of the Star Wars films, parents should think twice about letting little kids to see it. Good thing that one particularly gruesome scene is all left to the imagination..."
1813,10,Easily the best of the Star Wars Prequels!,"Revenge of the Sith was an excellent movie which I saw in the cinema last night. In this chapter of the Star Wars stories the director Geogre Lucas tells us the part of the tale to which the evil Sith villain Darth Vader had first came into being. Hayden Christensen takes the main roll in the film as the confused young Jedi warrior Anakin sky-walker who due to fear for the well fare of his loved ones but particularly his girl the beautiful Padme(Natalie Portman), becomes rapped up into a strange series of events which leads him to realise just what sort of part he will play toward the future of the democratic republic. This movie also stars Ewan McGregor as Skywalker's brave Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi who tries very hard to stop him from turning to the dark side throughout the movie. These two do a great job working together. However they are both completely over shadowed by the great Ian McDiarmid who is simply outstanding as the evil Chancellor Palpatine. He is a very experienced actor and understands his role well due to already staring in some films of the classic original Star Wars trilogy namely the Return of the Jedi. I also loved the Yoda Vs Palpatine/Darth Sidious light sabre battle I thought it was breathtaking. However even though this episode of Star Wars is still not quite as spectacular as the three original episodes from the 1980's which along with The Lord of the Rings are two of the greatest fantasy trilogy's ever to be made, this is still a extremely worthy addition to the series by the talented writer and director George Lucas and has still became one of my favourite films. Revenge of the Sith is a very Superior film compared to the other two previous Star Wars prequels. This one brought back the dark fell to the movies atmosphere of all the older ones which was needed. Although I must admit that I did really enjoy episode one The Phantom Menace quite a lot, I now it was a little light hearted compared to normal Star Wars but Liam Nesson was excellent in his role as Obi-wan's Jedi master(I thought so) and Darth Maul was a pretty cool character. I thought episode two Attack of the Clones wasn't the best or as gripping when you compare it to all the other Star Wars films. However I still found episode two very much watchable and it certainly wasn't all pointless. Overall I think the prequel's were still very much necessary to the series and I'm glad Lucas made them in order to reveal to us what caused the future events in the older episodes. If Darth Vader had have featured more in the newer ones maybe they could have been as stunning as their originals. Revenge of the Sith was without doubt the strongest of the new Star Wars movies and I think it will always be remembered for that reason. The Empire Strikes Back shall always be my favourite Star Wars film though. I overall give Revenge of the Sith a very well deserved 10/10 stars."
1814,6,"Pretty movie, bad plotting, bad acting","I guess I'll start this off by saying one nice thing about the movie, which is that the effects are good. However bad the actors are, and however boring the plot is, at the very least, it's got pretty pictures."
1815,10,Revenge of the Prequel!,"""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith"" is shockingly entertaining for the whole Star Wars fans to watch, it has shocking twists the same as the Empire Strikes Back, in the different way of putting all together, and all the action. It is now surprisingly fun to enjoy, the story of the final prequel, to the Star Wars Saga."
1816,,Brings meaning to Episode 1 and 2,"yes, many people don't like Episodes 1 and 2, I quite enjoyed Episode 1, but I was disappointed with parts of episode 2, but it was still enjoyable...yes Jar Jar was a bit much, but he was more to keep young children entertained. But Episode 3 ties both trilogies together, and also improves the quality of episodes 1 and 2 Many people fail to realize that these films are based on George Lucas's unique vision. They are what he wanted them to be. People say he relies too much on special effects...well the original star wars trilogy had the state of the art jaw dropping special effects for its time, yet nobody said he relied too much on special effects. And i'm sure the only reason the originals don't have as much special effects is because the technology was too limited."
1817,5,"Quite Boring, Plot Doesn't Make Sense","This is named ""Revenge of the Sith"". I presume they took their revenge on the viewers. The plot makes absolutely no sense. One cannot understand any of the decisions that lead Anakin on his path towards the dark side - every half-witted person would never make these decisions, and Anakin, being a bright Jedi, should not have made these decisions."
1818,3,Very Disappointed,When i found out that the new Star Wars film was coming out i was very excited but at this was the last one very sad that it had to end. I went to the cinema and heard it had a Original cast which seemed like away to end one of the best films of all time. As the Movie went on it seemed to tire and the same thing happened again again. I was very disappointed by this and the ending was the worse possible ending leaving no imagination to the plot and to the movie buffs. I feel a good point of this film was the great graphics which are well done and ill give star wars that they have done them very well. In Summary very disappointed but still go and see it as its the last one ever but don't give up your hopes the the first trilogy always wins hands down
1819,6,Too fast too furious Star Wars,"Well so it came at last. The film we all have been waiting for. And was it worth it? Well both yes and no. Some things in the movie tied in good with the three prequels, others seemed to have been put in just to justify certain things that otherwise would have left more than a few question marks. For instance: Why did Bail Organa tell one of his men that the protocol droid (C3P0) had to have his memory wiped, I could find no good reason for this. Other than explaining why C3P0 in A new hope doesn't remember being on Tatooine and a few other things that he should have remembered. another thing is the extreme speed everything happened in the film. From Anakins initial walk on the dark path until he went right over didn't take all too long. Something so sinister should take a little longer time in the making, he should have had more conflict with his own conscious before turning over to the dark side. Oh well never mind, it is done and there isn't a thing no one can do about it. Except George Lucas himself..."
1820,7,A final prequel that I believe does it well,"Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith is the final Star Wars prequel and one that in my opinion, brings around a fine end to the modern films too. Some may disagree but compared to the first two which I actually didn't dislike, Episode III is a good tip top movie and we really delve into the franchise at a heightened emotional level. With things such as improved acting, effects and even writing(well possibly), I couldn't take my eyes off and found the film to be solidly a good one, and here below is why so."
1821,10,The Best and Most sad of all six.,"How do I describe the best Star Wars Movie Ever? That's right the best. Best then Star Wars IV, Better Them Empire, More Feeling then any movie I have seen in a long time. This is Lucas' greatest work. Its shows the beginning and the ending of so much. It shows the End of Anakin and the beginning of Darth Vader, The end of the senate and the beginning of the empire. It shows the death of so many and the birth of two. I never could believe how much Anakin could hate Obi Won, How Obi won could love Anakin. I am really sad this is the last one. It is so good; it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The most amazing this is how the Chancellor shows Anakin that he is Darth Sideous. How the Chancellor becomes the Emperor. How Anakin gives himself over to Dark Side. How Darth Vader feels the pain of his decisions. How, I ask you can I describe the best movie, that I have seen in a long time. I give it a 10 or more if I could."
1822,3,Noooooooo!,"""Nothing important happened today."""
1823,4,One more chance,"OK, so the first two episodes were completely out of step with the original story and heart. I was on the bandwagon with the world in bashing Lucas. I was also on the bandwagon when everyone claimed that Lucas redeemed himself with this final episode. All of it was a sham! It took everything I had to sit through this 2+ hour debacle. It was the worst $5+ I have spent in weeks. Yes, it was better than the first two episodes, but it was far from worthy of 4-6. I may be an old fart, but this was ridiculous. New ships at every turn, ridiculous characters that were shallower than a $3 plastic swimming pool, and a story line that had less flesh than Darth Vader did at the end! The ONLY thing that Lucas kept in tact for this ending was the freaking 1970s scene transitions! I am so saddened by how this series ended. It turned into a money machine, pure and simple, and nothing more. The story has been gutted, and the heart ripped out. Even if you take this film on its own merit, without the others, it still warrants a horrid rating. I wish that I was wrong, but this childhood memory is tarnished."
1824,6,A slog to get through but does have some pretty good highlights,Compared to episodes 1 and 2 I like this one the most but thats not to say I like it very much. If this wasn't a Star Wars movie I would never watch it again. As it is I rewatch the universe of movies every so often.
1825,9,My passion is back,Episodes III restored my passion for this series.
1826,7,Still not an Epic....,"History has not been kind to the Star Wars prequels. After viewing Episodes I and II, I had become more than disappointed in George Lucas, wondering why, after the tremendous impact that the original trilogy had on pop culture, he would feel the need to no longer base special effects around story elements, but story elements around the video game style effects he feels are oh so real. It was with this thought that I walked into Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. And, I must tell you, I was neither disappointed nor was I completely surprised by what I saw."
1827,9,The Best Lucas Directed Episode (Possible Spoilers),"Up until now it has been easy, and some might say even hip to criticise the Star Wars prequels. Great expectations garner harsh reviews usually, but in the case of Revenge of the Sith, all expectations are well founded."
1828,,Revenge of the Sh*t,"Where do i begin? I feel profoundly disappointed by this piece of crap. All the people that thinks that this movie is awful said that it can't be worse than episodes I and II; but I think it is. Only the visuals save it from be the worst movie ever; still, the freaking visuals weren't good enough.The light-saber fights were mediocre.Dooku, who managed to escape from Yoda(the best Jedi) in episode II is easily killed by Anakin. The Jedi die at the hands of the Clone troopers;I can't believe the ewoks defended themselves better.General Grievous, who fights (and kills) Jedi in an spectacular way in Cartoon Network's Clone Wars, is in this movie only a pathetic coward mouse that runs away from Obi-Wan the cat.Kenobi kills him even more easily than he killed Maul in episode I.It seems not even ILM can do what good traditional animation has done for years. About Chewbacca, at the beginning of 2005 I thought: ""This year EpisodeIII premieres,it seems that George Lucas can definitely ruin Star Wars,so I better don't build up expectation"" Then,when I learned that Chewbacca would appear I thought: ""If Chewbacca appears the movie can't be so bad"". But what really happened is that the fact that everybody's favorite wookie only appears like 1 f--king minute in a 2 1/2 hour movie, only made me angrier! (That's right I'm a, I mean I was, a Chewbacca fan). And Darth Vader's appearance was even worse with that pathetic NOOO!! scream and the subsequent stupid bodyguard's stand aside the stupid emperor. I've criticized the visuals cause the story and acting are just hideous, there's nothing good about it. I agree with one of my country-men's review:""Dialogues are soap opera level"". I can't believe one friend of mine that aspires to be a writer really liked that crappy script. My English isn't good enough to express what I feel about this ""revenge of the sh*t"". I guess I can only say that once i believed in the Force, but, not anymore."
1829,10,Absolutely Amazing and for me could just about be the best Star Wars Movie,"Just saw this tonight on its opening day and let me just say it is absolutely amazing. As stated in my summary it possibly just edges it as the best Star Wars film for me past Episode IV. It is definitely the darkest Star Wars film by miles surpassing The Empire Strikes Back enormously in my opinion. Everything about the film is perfect- the Acting, Writing, Direction, but most of all the Special Effects. Every single actor does a brilliant job in this movie, but the one that I'm surprised to say impressed me the most has to be Yoda voiced by Frank Oz who is particularly outstanding. However he is almost matched especially by Ian Mcdiarmid who is brilliant as the evil Emperor. Ewan Mcgregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson and the rest of the cast though are also terrific."
1830,4,Mediocre compared to the originals,My overall view of this film is that George was milking this for all it's worth.
1831,5,STAR WARS on steroids,"Despite all the mixed reviews and arguments that surround STAR WARS: EPISODE III  REVENGE OF THE SITH, there is one thing we all can agree on, it's finally over. No more speculation or hype, the final piece of the puzzle has been placed, ending what I would dub as one of the worst trilogies of all time. In my mind, REVENGE OF THE SITH had no chance of pulling this prequel trilogy out of the black hole the first two films buried it in; so, even if this final installment was the best of the three, George Lucas messed this thing up a long time ago when he first sat down with the idea. With all the data and information at his disposal, you would think Lucas would have made a ""second coming"" to the originals, but that obviously didn't happen. Instead we got STAR WARS on steroids and if you ask me, maybe Lucas should be testifying to Congress these days as well, because what he did should result in some kind of fine or ban from Hollywood."
1832,8,The End Is Here,"Wow. All I can say is ""Wow."" When I went to go see Revenge of the Sith yesterday, I was expecting another dud like Attack of the Clones. Boy was I wrong."
1833,10,The Force Is With Episode III,"22 years ago, in June of 1983, I camped out for 12 hours to watch the premier of ""Return of the Jedi"". I was 18 years old. I only had to wait in line for 10 minutes for ""Revenge of the Sith"", but I would have waited a dozen hours to see it. I absolutely loved this movie. In my opinion it answered all the questions I had and perfectly set up episodes IV, V and VI. In fact, immediately after seeing the movie I wanted to watch the original Star Wars again. I got many insights into why certain things happened. ""Oh, so that's why this happened, or that happened, etc., etc."" Aside from a little campy acting and the typically stiff Hayden Christensen performance which I never liked in the first two prequels, everything about this movie is terrific. My only disappointment is I would have enjoyed hearing a little of Han Solo's history like how he lost his Millennium Falcon to Lando, or how he became a smuggler, stuff like that, but for the most part everyone's stories were resolved to perfection."
1834,6,The best of the recent Star Wars films but.......,"Not nearly as good as the first three released films, ""Star Wars"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and ""Return of the Jedi."" Episodes I thru III suffer from terrible dialog and wooden acting. While the older movies aren't exactly top-notch scripting, they are at least exciting and move at a quick pace, unlike the newer films which come to a complete halt whenever most of the characters speak. C3PO and Yoda have the best lines and are the most interesting characters here."
1835,10,George Lucas Strikes Back...And Delivers A Masterpiece!,"Let me first say that I am a huge Star Wars fan, but like many others I was a tad disappointed with PM, but AOTC was pretty darn cool. Now, now we see it all come together in this dark, very dark installment. During some parts of the movie I felt a knot in my stomach, as in ""oh my gosh, I can't believe this is happening."" After three long, painful years of waiting, I can safely say the movie was well worth the wait! I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I promise that if you like action, you'll love this movie. If you like R2-D2, you will love this movie. Yes, R2-D2 kicks butt, puny it may be but strong it is."
1836,3,I've seen better,"So like everyone else, this weekend I went to the movies to see Episode III: Return of the Sith. I was optimistic that, perhaps, George could redeem the attempts at what he calls his prequels with this one. Really it's was, or at least I was thinking the plot was fool proof, Darth Vader is born, disarray and upheaval comes to the galaxy, and the empire is born but Lucas seemed to, or at least I feel he, just let an amazing story go the way of the fishes. I was raised on Star Wars. Episodes 4, 5, and 6 are some of the first movies that I have recollection of and as a fan of those three I have to ask two things. First, where's the character development, George? I walked into the theater each time to see one of these movies and I walked out feeling that I had wasted my time, you know sort of the feeling that you get when you watch one of those bad straight to video Disney sequels, something that just shouldn't have been made. And no offense meant to the actors, you can't exactly point the finger and say the bad acting is they're fault, I mean really if the script is bad the acting will be horrific as well. Really, myself and more than half of the people in the theater found ourselves laughing at parts that really just shouldn't have been funny. But seeing big, bad, cold, 'Luke, I am you father' Darth Vader done up just right with that nice wax coat on his helmet brought a tingle to my heart, until he has an emotional breakdown moment (in the voice of James Earl Jones) and the moment becomes relatively laughable. And Padme, mother of Luke and Leia, all I can say on that note is after watching this movie I had the distinct feeling that George couldn't wait to knock her up and then knock her off. Of course I know that's how the story goes but if I'm paying 10 bucks to see this I want it feel my heart strings being pulled instead of thinking that my butt is sore. With Padme though, I think there was a serious injustice done to her character, well actually all the characters except for Yoda(I'll touch on that in a moment). But returning to Padme, she goes from Queen of Naboo with attempts on her life and leading a rebellion to retake her planet, to a Senator but yet once again escaping assassination attempts to pregnant wife and lap dog. Though I have to give Lucas credit in the fact that she's killed by the one person she always thought would have protected her. The movie did contain some decent moments, and I return to my mention of Yoda. Yoda makes the movie! Anyone who can't love the proverbial Yoda is missing out when they see episode III simply because the rest will either bore you to tears or flash you to death with flips and light sabers. And touching on that note I have one other major question to pose, what's with the light saber fighting, George? Where's the honor in the flips and twirls of a light saber? Don't get me wrong, it looks cool but it creates an issue. I won't hit on the inconsistencies between the first and second trilogies; they're pretty apparent to those who've seen them. I really think we're being blinded by the flips and lights and the ""oooo's"" and ""ahhh's"" of the graphics that we've lost the integral part of the story. Lucas sold his artistic child, his first creation for a light show and some special effects. Just think about it though, you watch episodes 4, 5, and 6 and you run the gambit of emotions and yet with episodes 1, 2 and 3, which are supposed to be more dramatic and more tear jerking, I left the theaters thinking "" wow, that sucked and I didn't even get to see Jar Jar Binks get wasted."" So what am I trying to say with this, simply two things: one you can go to the theater to see the movie, spend the twenty bucks on tickets and popcorn if you want. Just don't expect to be blown away. My recommendation is to wait on it, cause guaranteed it won't take to long for Lucas to want to further this financial venture with DVD's and such, but if that's too long for you, get the bootleg version for cheap and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. At least that way when you get up your butt won't be sore and you can skip ahead or just turn the movie off when you feel you've had enough."
1837,8,A clash between memes and a touching tragedy,"Whether you're in for it because of the memes, lightsaber duels, the drama or the soundtrack this movie certainly has a lot to offer. These are the reasons why it is such a great movie to watch with a group of friends. Even if your friends don't care about Star Wars that much they can still find something to appreciate about it and then like it for some different reasons than you."
1838,10,I LOOOOOVED this movie!,"I am a young girl who didn't grow up with the original Star Wars. And I admit, the only reason I got into it was because I saw trailers for the new Episode III movie and it looked cool and Hayden Christensen looked so hott that I just had to see this movie. So I watched Episode I, then II, then skipped to episodes IV-VI. Then I finally got to see this movie when it came out on May 19. It was so cool! I could see how everything fit into place, bridging the gap between the newer prequels to the original trilogy. The acting was good, the special effects were amazing and it wasn't a cute-and-cuddly version of how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vadar. It was sad and twisted and me and my friends were crying because it was so sad to see such a hott guy turn so evil to where he actually killed little kids! It was upsetting though that I knew what had to happen, all the Jedi had to be killed, Anakin had to become dark and evil, and he had to betray his master, Obi-Wan."
1839,6,The Mustafar Battle And Some Special Effects Saved This Flim.,"I am a huge Star Wars fan been one since I was 5 back in 77, but for some reason the Prequels were disappointing. The problem I had with Revenge of the Sith was the acting. I was shocked by how Natale Portman( Padme) went from being somewhat tough in ATOC to some, wilted flower in ROTS. Anakin ( Hayden Christensen) acting ability was awful. It was awkward seeing him with Portman, no chemistry at all. This is worthy of a 6.5 rating but that is it. The movie begins with a battle over Coruscant, Anakin and Obi-wan are on a mission to save Chancellor Palpatine(Ian Mc Dermitt). Upon their mission both will confront Anakin begins to show more aggression when he is ordered to kill Count Dooku(Christopher Lee). After the return to Coruscant he reunites with Padme. She tells him she is pregnant, he looks surprised/ upset in away, then brushes it off. Anakin starts to have visions like he had of his mother, in ATOC. He explains to Padme about his visions that she dies in childbirth. He says he will do anything to prevent this from coming true. When the Jedi Council does not let him on the Council he throws a fix; and Obi wan sees his unstable behavior. He starts to get too close to Chancellor Palpatine and the Council sees this especially Mace Windu ( Samuel L. Jackson). Mace doesn't trust him at all. Meanwhile At the opera Palpatine explains the story of Darth Plagugeus. This gets Anakin, he will do anything to save Padme, he becomes Palpatine's new Apprentice Darth Vader. Anakin now belongs to the Dark Side, he kills young Jedi's in training, and neglects Padme. Obi Wan is now an enemy, who he will duel with on Mustafar. The Jedi are in one of the biggest battles, and Obi-Wai has to battle Anakin, and save Padme. During the duel of Mustafar, the Jedi are betrayed by The Clones turn on them, with Order 66 come through. We know Anakin turns to the DarkSide, Padme dies in Childbirth, and The beginning of construction on The Deathstar begins. This movie was saved by some veteran actors, McDiarmid, McGregor, and Jackson. The big plus is some special effects, and the Battle of Mustafar. It's the prequels, Lucas got them done, but it doesn't come close to the Orginals. "
1840,10,Awesome,One of the greatest movies of all time At the end Anikin get his legs and another arm cut off. But before that the clones kill almost every Jedi Mace Windi Dies and at the very end Darth Vader gets really mad because he killed his wife Palaptin and destroy all the droids that where working on him. Yes you must see It All the Wookies die but two Chewbacca and his Father Anikin is appointed to the council Anikin kills Count Doku.................. ............... ......... ........... ............. ........ ............. ...... .............. ............... ........... ......... ................. ......... ............. ........ ...... ..... ...... .... . Go see it least once maybe even 5 times
1841,10,Now that's more like it...,"I have been huge Star Wars fans since I was a child and did not expect the new films to measure up. Good, but not great is what I expected. With ""Revenge of the Sith"" Lucas has given us a film that really dose measure up to the original. This is what we wanted to see when we heard the first rumors of Episode 1."
1842,9,Life in the Franchise Again,I was very skeptical going into this film. Episodes 1 and 2 were so disappointing that I wasn't holding out much hope for Revenge of the Sith. I can honestly say now that I am so glad I went to the theatre to see this.
1843,9,"Thank you, George Lucas, thank you!","Miraculously, most of the bad aspects of ""Attack of the Clones"" are gone. Except digital Yoda and horrid performances from Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and even Ewan McGregor this time."
1844,6,"It is a little better than the episodes 1 and 2, but to little to late.","The Revenge of the Sith is the last of the prequel trilogy and it is a bit better from its predecessors. To its pros the opening start fight is nice, although I wise we could see more from what is happening, Palpatine's seems are OK, but lets be honest when he talks about how good is the Sith, it is like you say that the Nazis are not as bad as you think! My favorite part is the battle at the Wookie home planet of Kashyk and it is awesome to see clones and Wookies team up to break the droid attack and the final fight between Obi-one Kenobi and Gneral Grevous is fine. Also ,dispute its over stylized moves his duel with Anakin at Mustafa was fine and I enjoyed Anakin's slaughter of the Separatist leaders before the duel. But those are the only redeeming facts of that flick, because it suffers from the same problem as the previous installments ,like the stupid romance of Anakin and Padme, the inaction of the Jedi, who act only at the end when they are decimated almost to a man and truth to be tooled if they could not defend themselves even now, they had it coming. Continuing the CGI though better, the fact that you can see when the environment, means of transport or a character is real or not its a hint that they are still weak. All in all this is a fight which could be categorized as a guilty pleasure and if you see it with friend at a Friday night, it is going to be a fun experience ,but afterwords nothing is going to stick with you like with the Original Trilogy. So 6/10, but in truth, I would give a 6.5/10."
1845,9,Great!,"Having seen Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith at midnight I can only say: Wow! I might be a Star Wars Fan and therefore a bit too positive, but I can assure you, that Lucas perfectly manages to make Anakin's turn to the dark side credible. Hayden Christensen has grown to be a much better actor than we all thought after seeing Episode II and Natalie Portman is a lot better too. Actually Ewan McGregor, whom we all knew as the best actor from the previous movies, is now a little less convincing...But the best performance was shown by Ian McDiarmid, who is wonderfully evil and tricky. There is one big thing, that I really didn't like and that made me give the movie only 9 out of 10: General Grievous! How can anyone possibly like such a character? He is so much different from any other Star Wars character! Unelegant, stupid and getting on people's nerves. (from my point of view even much more than Jar Jar Binks or Boss Nass) But apart from that I can only say: Run into the next theater and see it! The connection between the new trilogy and the old one is now perfectly balanced and credible! George, you made it! And I believe I speak for all the fans: What you can do, can no one else! The film is really not to be seen by the very little ones, because it is very gloomy and sad. The atmosphere is a bit different from the other movies. I would say it is a better atmosphere, a bit similar to The Empire strikes back! Now, leave your house and get ready to queue, because Lucas strikes back! May the force be with you. Always"
1846,3,George Lucas couldn't write dialog if his life depended on it.,"If I hadn't been with friends when I saw this movie I would have left with-in the first few minutes. The forced story line and it's gaping plot holes, illogical character actions, inconsistent use of the ""Force"" as only a convenient plot device, and regular violation of the laws of physics require the typical action film's suspension of disbelief and I was willing to buy into it  especially given the gorgeous visuals. But then one of the characters would speak and the illusion would collapse. The dialog was so god-awful and stilted that I wanted to cringe and scream at the same time. This has got to be one of the top contenders for the most talent ever wasted in a film (followed closely by Star Wars I & II)."
1847,7,Duel of the Fates,Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**
1848,8,Good but not that good,"Just like all Star Wars fans I waited in anticipation for the release of this, the final instalment of the Star Wars Saga."
1849,,Darth Vader strikes back again!,"Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith Director: George Lucas Starring: Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson and Jimmy Smits"
1850,9,The Force is With This One,"This Star Wars movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in a long time. After being disappointed in the way Episode II turned out, I was uncertain of what to think when going to see Episode III. I mean, if you've seen the original trilogy, as most people have, then you are going to see a movie in which you already know the ending, since it leads up to what many of us have come to know as the story of Star Wars. I particularly enjoyed the battle sequences in this film. They did a great job in choreographing all the fights. Yoda kicks royal butt, the Emperor is a royal pain in the rear, but a good fighter anyway. If you enjoy classic light saber battles, you most certainly will not be disappointed in the battles found in this movie. Though some of the dialogue is a little lame, the action more than makes up for it. My favorite part of the entire film had to be the fight between Obi Wan and Anakin Skywalker. Even though I knew the outcome from having seen all previous Star Wars movies, I still was on the edge of my seat the entire time. If you've enjoyed the other Star Wars movies, this one will not disappoint you in the least."
1851,3,Disappointed!!!,"Being the big Star Wars fan that I am, I have always defended Episodes 1 and 2 despite the fact there are things about them I don't like. I walked away from both of those movies being happy. I was very excited to see The Revenge of the Sith and had no doubt in my mind I would love this one as well but on the car ride home I couldn't believe that I was about to tell every one how disappointed I was."
1852,6,It's not *that* good!,"Come on, 8.2/10? That's the current running average on IMDb. The movie is *not* that good! The acting was bad, again, and special effects were too much, again, and the whole thing felt very contrived. The opening sequence with Palpatine's rescue was the worst opening sequence of *any* of the Star Wars movies to date. Of the three ""new"" movies, I'd give my nod to Phantom Menace as the best, Revenge of the Sith second, and Attack of the clones third. My favorite is ultimately still the 1977 original, although there were elements of Empire and Jedi that I'd rate higher. The best light saber duel is hands down the battle with Darth Maul. The worst is probably this latest effort, with them battling it out on the lava flow. That was even funnier than the Yoda/Dooku battle in Attack of the Clones."
1853,10,Incredible Bow for a great story string,"This movie not only ties together the events of the first two, but manages to lead us into A New Hope with a fuller understanding of the forces that drive the events in the initial three films. I cannot remember how old I was when I first saw Star Wars, but I was 2 when it came out, and I do remember faithfully seeing ESB and RotJ in the theaters when I was growing up. I had a large collection of the toys, and have resisted the urge, for the most part, to read any of the multitudes of fiction out there based in this universe until I knew the whole story. Now I know, and what a great series Lucas has made. The thing that shocked me was that parents had their sub-13 children in this movie, despite having heard personally from a number of places that this was the most violent of the series and that it was a ""bloodbath"" as well. The movie definitely played into that, but how else can you eliminate the large Jedi population without it. I think personally the darkest part of the entire series was always ESB, which made it the best for me, but it might have just been replaced by Revenge of the Sith. This movie is sure to affect anyone who's a fan of the series, and perhaps might even cause those are not fans of the series to take a second glance. The critics who cite stilted dialogue might have a point, but points to consider in that realm are the situations involved. Who hasn't felt after a particular conversation that some of what they said was awkward and stilted?"
1854,1,concluding an awful exposition of the original trilogy.,"In my opinion this film is the worst of all three prequel trilogies, everything wrong with the first two is in abundance here. Every line of spoken dialogue in the original trilogy has suffered an exposition in the prequel trilogy which only serves to sully enjoyment of the original films. There are incestuous and needless relationships between characters and far too many self-referential moments which seem to serve no other purpose than remind viewers of a really good film a long, long time ago. The CGI is distracting and not necessary to tell the story, and despite advances, does not look real. The acting is terrible and emotionless. The film is too long."
1855,5,Meh...,"Sadly, I saw this movie 6 times in theatre, because I was in love with Hayden Christensen. Looking back, I don't see why I liked it at all. The acting is 100% bad bad bad terribly bad, the script is pathetically lame, and...Yeah. I mean, sure the story line is good like all Star Wars movies...but, come on. George Lucas, you could've been a little more professional when you were writing the script, and had some sense to pick good actors to play the main characters. And I hate hate hate the fact that he started with 4,5, and then 6, coming back to 1,2, and 3. That's what makes me detest them so much. It just doesn't suit me anymore focusing on the acting and dialogue. Terrible. Just Terrible."
1856,1,Mental Shipwreck,Revenge of the Sith.
1857,10,Absolutely the Best of the Series!!!,"This movie single-handedly saved the Star Warsfranchise!! I've heard it repeated several times over,I'm happy/proud to be a Star Wars fan again!!! I must reiterate those sentiments."
1858,10,"Sith Happens, but this movie was awesome",Wow!!! What a way to tie both stories together into one big space opera. The first time I watched the movie my heart broke to hear Anakin yell that he hated Obi-Wan and I still wipe away a tear when the last 45 minutes begin.
1859,7,The best of the prequels,"I'll be honest, I actually really do like this film as it does seem to make some semblance of sense, and removes a lot of the problems that hampered the previous two movies. There's no stupid comedy, there's no unbelievable love story, there's no convoluted plot that tries to make out like it's telling us more than it actually is but is in fact telling us less, I dare say this one's plot is very A > B in that respect."
1860,2,What the hell happened?,"Finally, I get to put in my two cents about SW3. I'll probably buy the DVD anyway just because, but after reading some of these comments, I've got to speak my mind, at least plot-wise. First off, the best villains are the ones who believe that what they are doing is right, like religious fanatics. Some people will commit horrible crimes because they believe that what they are doing is for the greater good. Anakin (Christensen), as Doctor Evil would put it, just wasn't evil enough, he was quasi-evil. He just didn't fit the part and he had all the wrong reasons to be. It would have been more believable if maybe Anakin was a bad seed from the get go, but he wasn't. Yeah, sure he was a brat and immature, but that doesn't make somebody evil. In my mind, Darth Vader was up there with Hilter, Saddam Hussein, in those big boy leagues. Now, I see Darth Vader as just a cry baby, punk b***h. For instance, I thought for sure that Tom Cruise was going to make a terrible vampire but he pulled it off nicely and proved everybody wrong. Sad to say Christensen didn't with his part. Secondly, the Jedi Council deserved what they got for being so militarily and politically incompetent. They couldn't even put two and two together that Anakin and Padme got married or they simply looked the other way with those two living in sin. Jedi can't marry (the equivalent of a monk) but it's okay to have pre-martial sex it seems. Also, where were the Jedi women? It's hard to believe the Jedi Council didn't have more female warriors. At least the movie could have given us some sexy Jedi women jumping and spinning around. Third, why would Obi Won leave Anakin to burn like that. Even Anakin gave Dooku a merciful death, but good ole Obi Won just let his ""brother"" catch on fire and watched as he burned. Very un-Jedi like don't you think? Finally, the Emperor deserved his victory. He forged his own empire, hide from the Jedi in plain sight, converted Anakin, and destroyed the Jedi pretty much single-handedly. Bravo, job well done. What did the the Jedi have...let me see, an army of Jedi Masters full of wisdom and knowledge and they still managed to screw it all up."
1861,7,"Lucas should have asked himself before making all these prequels: ""What would this movie look like with original 1977 special effects?""","I love the original Star Wars trilogy and I'm even enough of a goober that I'll read some of the Star Wars books that continue the story of Luke, Han and Leia. So, honestly, I think I'm your typical American. Star Wars is right up there with apple pie and baseball, and if you've never ever had an incredible urge to pick up a lightsaber and go at it after watching the Star Wars movies, then you should have your head examined, or grow an imagination, whichever one is easier."
1862,10,Thank you George Lucas,"Better than Empire? No. But one of the best! It has everything you've been waiting for and then some. Connects the Original Trilogy and the prequels perfectly. Lucas couldn't have done it better in a million years. Lucas listened to the fans on this one. I was just in awe with Anakin and Obi-wan's battle at the end. Hell I was in awe when I first seen, ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."" to the very end! Yoda kicks major ass. There were a lot of funny parts. A lot of sad, brilliant parts. Its just all overwhelming. I for one am going to see it again and again, YES its worth it. Depressing that its over but now all the questions are answered. Order 66."
1863,9,"WOW!, Easily one of my favorite films EVER!!",Last night I went to see the Revenge of the Sith midnight showing and all I can say is... well you know that feeling you get when you can only describe something by cursing thats how amazed I am.
1864,7,"The birth of Vader,Luke & Lea in one hell of a classic sci-fi series.","What can I say but stunning really bridged the gap between the original 77's Episode IV A New Hope to the new Episodes I & II so well,and boy is this outing dark from killing Jedi young-lings to a limbless burning Vader you know this ones gonna roll and roll on into cinema history,sure many will claim the new episodes are lesser films and maybe even a loyal star wars fan like me could almost agree with 'em,even though I thought episode II was good solid family fun.But this one tops even the originals for pure subject alone,from now on I doubt anyone could watch epIV,epV or epVI without 1st watching epIII."
1865,5,Not Even the Best of the Prequels - Although the Darkest,"When one goes to see a Star Wars film it is not to watch excellent acting or excellent dialogue. As expected, both of those categories are pretty awful. It is expected, however, to have lots of action, excellent special effects, neat characters and aliens, and an interesting story. Unfortunately, Revenge of the Sith fails."
1866,8,It ties it all together - Can watch 4 - 6 now with different feel,"In short, this movie ties up a lot of loose ends in the saga. After seeing this, it is well worth seeing episode 4 to 6 again because it will have a totally different feel to it."
1867,1,Moderately more tolerable than the other two. Awful otherwise.,Since so many users seem to have their heads elsewhere during the watching of this movie I thought I'd provide my own thoughts on this piece of mediocre garbage that's thankfully less rotten than it's predecessors.
1868,9,"Easily the Best Newer Star Wars Movie, Third Best Overall",SPOILERS
1869,9,"One of the best yet, a strong ending.","Fresh from my cinema-going experience I am full of nothing but admiration for the folks who made George Lucas' vision come to life on film. As a hobbyist CGI model maker and animator I was unceasingly amazed by the work the ILM people must have done, the sheer man-hours and talent that must have gone into this movie must boggle the mind."
1870,10,just like the originals,if you didn't like this movie then your f*cked up. This movie was the best i've seen in a while. it had a perfect plot and it was screened and acted perfectly. This movie got a lot of criticism because of the past two. But it is way better than them. I don't know a person who likes star wars who doesn't like this movie. This movie was at the top of the charts up close to spiderman. Now that's saying something. And nothing gets better than the lights fight at the end of the movie. It was great. My friends who don't like star wars that much. Liked this movie. I just wish they showed a little more at the end after Obi-wan dropped Luke off at his aunt and uncles house on Tatooine rather than leaving a 20 year gap between episode 3 and 4. But it's fine the way it is. SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE. SEE IT
1871,8,Overrated but fun end to the saga,I saw Revenge of the Sith the other night with huge expectations and in most accounts it delivered. However there were a number of area's that were so poorly done that it really did take a lot away from the movie.
1872,6,Better than I thought it would be,"Somehow, I managed to skip watching Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones before I got around to watching Revenge of the Sith. Immediately, while watching it, I wasn't entirely certain as to what was going on. Little tiny Anakin Skywalker grew up to be taller and hairier and somehow married to Amidala, who was about twice his size the last time I saw the movie. Something about that seems a little weird."
1873,7,"You MUST ""Get"" this on Blu-Ray","Let me start by simply saying WOW. I think you'll remember in my Attack of the clones review I stated that it was the best film ever and now I stand corrected Revenge of the sith is by far the most tantalising experience I have ever had in a cinema, I mean right from the start you're thrown right in the shite with an epic space battle and you're given some brilliant lines such as ""We're coming in too hot"" these lines immediately make you think what a true genius Master George Lucas is.Words cannot describe how much of an emotional roller coaster ride this was as you watched a sweet loving kind young man turn to the darkside and fight with his old master.Now lets have a little convo about the writing in this movie.Its quite simply astonishing I didn't think it could get any better than attack of the clones but once again we've been proved wrong by George's wisdom.I even started to shed a few tears as the father-son relationship blossomed between Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker...lines such as ""I need your help son"" really struck a chord with me.I mean imagine the actors as they first saw this script that George had written with lines such as ""Get"" and ""You're so beautiful"" they must have know that they were about to participate in the GREATEST blockbuster in all of cinematic history. There is however one problem Where was Jar Jar? Not in the film enough. However apart from that it was truly flawless....A perfect end to a perfect Trilogy"
1874,7,Good but not great,I really don't follow the whole STARWARS thing to a T but I guess I expected more from the movie. Not really in the way of special effects but the acting was horrible... through the 1st half of the film it almost seemed that the characters were reading there lines from a TelePrompter. Also going into the movie I kept reading that Hayden Christiansen did't come off as a whiny little Jedi like in Episode II... but I have to disagree. I have a 2 year old who puts on the same face when she doesn't get her way.
1875,10,What a send off into the Dark Side!,"This is the one I was waiting for. My sister took me to see the original ""Star Wars"" (before it was ""Episode IV"") in 1977 when I was 11 and I've been hooked ever since. My wife and I saw ""ROTS"" at a thunderously loud floor-to-ceiling sound system multiplex in Canada which made this film an experience to say the least. Some may be critical of the acting, but Hayden Christensen does well on his dark slide downward, the luminously beautiful Natalie Portman is excellent as the heartbroken wife watching the man she loves slip away from her, and Ewan McGregor's pain at watching his best friend turn against him is very evident. But the ""Best Actor"" kudos should go to Ian McDiarmid, hands down. His alternating portrayal as the seemingly-concerned Chancellor Palpatine and the seductively evil Darth Sidious corrupting Anakin into Darth Vader through Anakin's love for his wife is compelling. It is not a children's movie (and I was unsettled to see so many young children there), but it is a fine piece of work."
1876,5,All (first) three episodes in one and more!,"So, what did we get from Mr. Lucas here? For starters, this is by no means SF (it has fiction, although no science). It is just a soap kitschy opera consisting of bad writing, even worse directing, questionable casting and terrible acting. If you watch the Bluray version, this is even more obvious (should have stayed VHS-blurred, just to hide sloppy sfx). Expensive in making, cheap in perceiving. On the other hand, it's a fairy tale (with no moral whatsoever) for people who never grew up and would swallow anything with even a slightest SF-odor. They would never even notice (or object to) sound and smoke in open space, instantaneous audio-visual communication across parsecs, thrusters that behave like warp drive and other ""scientific"" nonsense. They would just pack up with beer and popcorn, sit back, relax and enjoy. Faced with the possibility (danger?) of watching these three movies (one after another for about 6 hours), that's also what you should do. And remember to switch off all higher brain functions if you don't want to get hurt."
1877,10,All questions answered!,"In a year that seems to be dedicated to the washed out remake, George Lucas delivers the final installment to the Star Wars prequel, Return of The Sith. ""What is a Sith?"", you ask. I'm still not sure. But like jedi ,wookie, and lightsaber , it will soon become an American colloquialism. Please note: if someone refers to you as a Sith...it's a bad thing."
1878,9,A Strong Conclusion To The Star Wars Saga,"""Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of The Sith,"" while not exactly as epic as some of its predecessors, is still a very fine conclusion to the greatest science-fiction saga of all time. Although it lacks the pioneering feel of the original, the power of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and the sheer all-around perfection of ""The Phantom Menace,"" it still holds up better than ""Return Of The Jedi"" and certainly more than ""Attack of The Clones."" "
1879,2,Episode III: Revenge of the Merchandise,"This movie depressed me because I realized that once again, marketing hype convinced me to pay, for an expensive movie ticket for a movie that really wasn't good."
1880,10,"Henceforth, you shall be known as, Darth Vader!","In defence of Hayden Christensen. Revenge of the Sith is not only the best prequel movie, but one of the greatest and most underrated kiddie movies of all time."
1881,10,One of the greatest Greek Tragedies of all time,"At 12.01 a.m on the 25th of May, 2005, I witnessed what could arguably be the greatest movie experience of my life. Being a child of the ""new"" Star Wars, the special editions as a child followed by being 13 years old by THE PHANTOM MENACE and 16 by ATTACK OF THE CLONES and now 19, my entire teenage years had been marked with Star Wars. And I will never stop defending the new films. Never. It is a shame beyond words to endure the critique of narrow-minded ""fans"" with warped minds, obsessed with an utterly impossible idea of Star Wars and angry at Lucas for the very same reasons spoiled kids hate their parents. I still to this day have no clue as to why people hated THE PHANTOM MENACE. I will always be amazed over Episode I, it is a rich and wide story with eye-popping action and deep emotional resonance. ATTACK OF THE CLONES is nothing but a war movie, thunderous and heart-stopping, not spoiled by the so called bad acting. Corny is Star Wars middle name. People have always been looking for things that aren't supposed to be there, when it comes to Lucas and Episodes I-III."
1882,9,An exclamation point on the end of the saga.,"I personally have always been a fan of the prequels much more than others, but this movie put a nice exclamation point on the saga. The acting was considerably better than the first two prequels, and what acting and dialogue problems there were were more than made up for by superbly coordinated CGI sequences. The five different lightsaber duels were better than any duels ever shown, though the duels with Dooku and Grievous were shorter than I expected. There were also some discrepancies between what is written about the Mustafar duel versus what actually happens, such as the fact that in the movie, Anakin does not actually fall into the lava, while the books say he does. As a suggestion to everyone, I would not recommend watching the saga in chronological order. The disappointing lack of special effects and CGI in the Original Trilogy would only be more obvious. To sum things up, anyone interested in laying back and seeing some intense action should see this movie."
1883,10,The memes,This movie is so good that most people I know communaly say every line like a sing along.
1884,9,"A magnificently spectacular, visually enthralling conclusion to the most fantastic sci-fi saga of all time...",Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith (2005)
1885,7,My comments are more about critics than this flawed but worthy film,"1. Really, are there any spoilers? You should know most of this film going into it. I respected that Lucas knew that and still gave the audience an entertaining and sometimes surprising movie. That is to his credit."
1886,1,Another worthless piece of trash,"So this is supposed to be the ""best"" of the prequel saga, a movie that can be held in the same regard as the original trilogy if not even better. No. Absolutely not. This movie is just as dull, uninspired, nonsensical and boring as the other two. Nothing has improved since Attack of the Clones, if this is what passes for a good movie lately then it's no wonder people like Michael Bay are still allowed to make movies. This movie has the same exact flaws as the other two prequel movies because they are made by the same person with the same goal: selling action figures, make tons of money. So we meet again our heroes Anakin and Obi-Wan in a bizarre and confusing opening action scene that leads to the death of the previous movie's villain (Count Dooku) and the rescue of the Chancellor from the clutches of the evil General Grevious (a villain so important no one cared to introduce, a trademark of this franchise). Then we get to the dull and lifeless exposition scenes where we are reminded that Anakin and Padme are supposedly in love (why would a queen/senator marry an annoying teenager with rage control issues is beyond me, ask George Lucas) and that the Jedi Council does not trust the Chancellor because it's obvious he is the Sith Lord they have been searching for 10 years but somehow the wise and all- knowing Jedi masters are still unable to connect the dots. Then we get to the action, and as usual Anakin and Obi-Wan need to be separated just like in the previous movie (so there is no chance to establish any sort of friendship between the two), Obi-Wan has been given a filler content mission to justify his presence in this movie, while Anakin has to spend time with someone even more boring than Padme : the Chancellor. This was supposed to be an intriguing part of the story and I must admit that the actor playing the Chancellor did the best he could with the horrible material given to him by George Lucas, but as everything in the prequels this scene is ultimately a letdown. We have a vague speech about the dark side and that's about it. Now get ready for the main part of the plot : the reason Anakin ""turns to the dark side"" (what it actually means we are never told or shown) is because he had one vague dream of Padme dying (it's very vague, we don't even see her dying so we can't be sure, but apparently Anakin is). So at this point I was done with the movie, I'm not even gonna stick around to tell you that after a overly self indulgent 30 minutes long light-sabre battle they stick Anakin in a robot suit so he can yell ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" and Lucas can sell Darth Vader merchandise. What a piece of garbage."
1887,9,Star Wars is officially back...too bad it's a little late.,"'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' will go down in history as the rebirth of a franchise, finally bringing the fans of the classic series what they wanted in the second trilogy: the charm and brilliant storytelling of the originals. It is not even close to any of the originals, but it is in a galaxy far, far away from the first and second episodes. From its phenomenal special effects, to intriguing storytelling, 'Revenge of the Sith' is what Star Wars is all about."
1888,9,"Grand finale of the trilogy, epic.","Lots more action scenes, i never had a problem with christian hadensons acting (which seems to be one of the main reasons people hate it), solid movie and as the finale to the trilogy it didn't disappoint."
1889,10,Die-hard fan thrilled with final film,"Now, considering that Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw and that I am a die-hard Star Wars fan, it would be hard for this movie to fail in my eyes. To see Anakin Skywalker finally turn fully to the dark side and to witness the births of Luke and Leia was a long time in the making. An hour and a half into the movie I was pleased, but getting nervous, there were so many loose-ends. But the last 45 minutes of the movie was SO good, it left nothing unturned! I got out of the movie late and all I wanted to do was go watch episodes 4-6. Can't wait for the DVD so I can have a rainy weekend film festival. For those of you who didn't like episodes 1 and 2, I would recommend that you watch them again prior to seeing this final chapter, because it really does build on those two movies."
1890,9,An outstanding work of art with an enthusiastic and creative vision,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is arguably renowned as one of the best films in the Prequel Trilogy of Star Wars, with some others insisting that it is the best film in the entire Star Wars."
1891,1,Rubbish,Terrible An absolute disgrace of a movie Good actors and actresses not using their talents Many of the fight scenes were too long and the plot was way to 'kiddy'.
1892,10,Star wars rules. no spoilers,"Finally the space saga is over. This movie rocks. this episode is one of the best.It is flawless.Perfect.True. It is the link to episode 4. My opinion is that the new trilogy is equally intriguing - addictive as the previous. Master Lucas has done it, has created a masterpiece. i saw episode iii in the opening day and i will see it again. Whoever gives this movie a score lower than 8 needs a doctor (shrink). This trilogy along with l.o.r smashed matrix (systemic anomaly) Do not listen to stupid critics. Thank God (Lucas). My ranking is: ep5-ep3-ep4-ep2-ep6-ep1. may the force be with you , forever Lucas. you showed us the true meaning of life and filming. I give a ten."
1893,7,"Not everything I hoped for, but a decent conclusion of the prequel trilogy nonetheless","After almost thirty years, George Lucas has finally finished (at least, for now), the Star Wars saga. And while the first trilogy will likely go down in history like a timeless classic, the second trilogy, concluded by ""Revenge of the Sith"" quite probably won't. The good news, however, is that it does at least end in a fairly worthwhile way."
1894,6,Disappointing Finale to an Epic Legend...,"Bah...Humbug! I went into the theater full of eager anticipation...and I left feeling as if I should have written the script! I had no exhilaration like I felt when I left after the previous two in this trilogy. I thought back to what I liked, or didn't like, about the original trilogy  Episodes 4, 5 & 6. I remember seeing Episode 4 - A New Hope, when it debuted in 1977 and I was disappointed in that one too. I thought it was boring. I ended up loving Star Wars by Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi. I was quite pleased with Episodes 1 and 2. The storyline, casting, writing, direction and special effects were totally amazing. I fully expected George Lucas to do the ULTIMATE with this last movie - to 'Bring it all Home'...but he failed to do that. In scenes that could have been real tear-jerker's, the dialog was lame and the acting was pitiful! I read somewhere that Francis Ford Coppola offered assistance to Lucas in writing dialog  but ego inflated George refused the offer. Now how dumb was that? He is great with creating special effects, but lacks any forethought and skills in writing the dialog for his characters. No depth at all. So did most of the actors just lose their interest in entertaining the audience due to poor script writing? I expected so much more PASSION from Hayden Christensen as Anakin when he was giving in to Darth Sidious and crossing over to the Dark Side! He came across like Eeyore having another bad day! (You know, the sad little donkey from Winnie the Pooh) 'Whoa is me...I guess I give in to you Master...OK, you win...whoa is me'. His inner 'anger' just wasn't there  he seemed more like a punk, spoiled rotten kid than someone whose misery had gotten the better of his good side."
1895,10,"Wow, just wow.","I was re-watching the entire saga before the release of Clone Wars' final season. This movie is by far the best Star Wars movie and one of the best movies ever, in my opinion."
1896,8,Best of the new trilogy,"Finally he got one right! Where especially Episode 1 (and arguably Episode 2 also) failed, this one delivered. OK, it has it's weak points like the intimate scenes between Christensen (who just didn't impress me in any of the movies, despite being given one of the biggest roles in movie history) and Portman, where the cheesy dialogue makes for a little toe-quenching, but remember that this kind of dialogue was also used in the old trilogy. The great action scenes make up for it though, and there's plenty of them with lots of new creatures and droids (merchandise) to keep you captivated for the full 140 minutes. All the loose ends get wrapped up, (like why the only thing 3-PO remembers is working for captain Antilles) and even R2-D2 gets to show that he can kick some butt. I'd say it finishes the series on a high, even though the ""old feeling"" was never really recreated. One thing is though, should you watch all six in a row following the episode numbers? All the major surprises would be gone! Vader being Luke's dad, Luke and Leia being siblings so what! We already know!"
1897,5,Crappy completion to the Star Wars legacy,"George Lucas's new Star Wars movie was hyped up to be this summer's BEST movie(heck, some even thought it was the best movie of the series) Sadly, it was no more than a large-budget steaming pile of crap. "
1898,5,Really sucked - SITH is an anagram for SH!T,"The acting and dialogue are so bad in this movie, most of the people in my theater were actually LAUGHING during the most ""intimate"" scenes. There is SO MUCH dialogue in this movie, I actually fell asleep -- FIVE TIMES!! Luckily someone else paid for me to see it a second time and it sucked even worse when I was awake! Star Wars fans are going to love it because they have no other choice. They're Lucas sheep and they'd praise him if he took a dump on their lawn."
1899,10,"Sorry, I liked it....","I realize it's hard not to be nostalgic for Episodes 4-6 but I saw this movie this evening and enjoyed it. It was a lot better than episodes 1 & 2 and dovetails nicely into episode 4. In fact, when my wife and I got home from the theater we popped in Episode 4 and watched it again with Episode 3 fresh in our minds."
1900,7,A dramatically cogent and highly satisfying finale to the Star Wars saga.,"The best out of the prequels by far, A nice easy plot this time not full of council meetings although they're not scrapped completly, The effects were top class but it seems George Lucas can't make a film without making just about everything with them, For me it was the worst acted as I thought some of the performances felt very forced (No pun intended) It's full of action from the word go and all was good fun, It's the darkest Star Wars film ever and it worked well what with little to no humour and Jar Jar Binks being reduced to a cameo so you got to love that, A fantastic final few scenes, Very emotional too, Revenge of the Sith can be proud of becoming a true Star Wars film even if it does have its flaws."
1901,8,'Sith' Happens,"Revenge of the Sith, is the binding tie. Its the movie that has been long awaited by Star Wars fans around the globe as the movie to link the six chapters together, and as a scene setter for the original three movies, George Lucus could not have done better."
1902,10,Well thought-out!,"This comment may seem a tad biased. Probably because it is; I am a firm believer that StarWars started the whole Sci-fi movement. StarWars completes the prequel series with a bang. Now, it's not the best Star Wars, but it's far better then that awful ""Phantom Menace"". It leaves no holes, no unanswered questions. Personally, I found it splendid. If you're watching all StarWars' sub-sequentially, ""A New Hope"" follows (in story) without any problems. I am thoroughly impressed by Lucas's ability to stay so far ahead of his time. Without StarWars there would be no good Sci-fi today. I commend him for his efforts and achievements. He took the time to fill all holes and complete this revolutionary saga."
1903,1,The Force is no longer with us,"I finally saw this movie last night, and I regret to say I wish I hadn't. I cannot fathom how anyone could find this movie enjoyable. I'd even go so far as to say I've never seen a worse movie in my life, and this distresses me, as I am an avid fan of the original trilogy."
1904,6,Lucas ends his saga as only he can,"Revenge of the Sith carries a heavy burden as the pivotal film in the new trilogy, in much the same way as The Empire Strikes Back carried the central conflict of the original. It is under this weight that Lucas produces his best work of the original trilogy, but one still plagued by many of his shortcomings."
1905,1,"A Heaping, Steaming, Pile of Crap",After reviewing some of the other the reviews I'll include some of the points I most agree with (I thought the exact same thing).
1906,1,The worst film since... episode II....,"Even though it is considered the ""darkest"" star wars film yet it doesn't evoke any sort of emotional connection with the audience. There is no real main character in any of the prequels. All the dialogue scenes are extremely dry. Back and forth cuts from one character to the responding character.. Such as Anakin and Padme going on about how they love each other in the least believable dialogue ever written. Or the ever boring scene when anakin tells Mace Windu that he knows who the dark lord of the sith is, it's just a bunch of cuts back and forth as they're walking slowly and not looking like they even care or are ready to take action."
1907,1,Why Lucas? Why?,"Remember the scene where Darth Vader, fresh out from surgery, asks Palpatine where Padme is, and Palps said ""You killed her"". Now WHY didn't Vader give Palps a Sith-choke hold right then and there? I mean COME ON!!! That's the main reason why he joined the dark side in the first place!!! And now Palpy couldn't prevent her from dying and bring her back? Breaks my heart... And Dada.. And Dada.. And Dada.. Now that's 10 lines of text no is it? And Dada.. Birds in the sky. Blue is the sky. The sky is clear. The dog that wagged his tail is not the same villain seen beneath the refrigirator with a lightsaber while playing with himself and a hot cup of coco asking for more like a kid on a hot summer's day."
1908,8,"The best of the final 3 films, but Stars Wars and Empire still rule","Revenge of the Sith was the best of the final three movies, but when I compare it to Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, it doesn't quite match those two films. I believe most people will agree with me on that assessment, but Revenge still delivers some goodies."
1909,10,"If Yoda is so smart, why can't he form a proper sentence?","I had heard that this movie was the best of the latter chunk of the Lucas saga, and so decided to sit down and watch it. I retained my 11 year old to advise me on the more complex plot issues, but he got bored about half way through and left and I had to try to figure things out on my own. I think I figured out most of it."
1910,,Redeemed...,"You speed through backroads toward the highway, heart beating in your ears, pores pumping sweat, and eyes alight with childish excitement. You jerk into the parking lot, spring to the front door, tear it open, buy your ticket stub, and smile wide as you pass under a banner that reads STAR WARS: EPISODE III: THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. The day you've been waiting for has finally come. Three long years of eager, sometimes heartbreaking anticipation and finally, the yellow words blast upon the screen for what may be the last time. STAR WARS."
1911,9,Did the critics watch the same movie?,"My first Star Wars experience was in the first week of the original (now Episode 4). It was in a grand theatre in San Francisco on a Saturday afternoon with a charged crowd. It was marvelous. Last night/this morning, I saw Episode 3. It was marvelous. But different. Had this one appeared at the same time as Episode 4 so that the impacts were equivalent, then Episode 3 would have won hands down for both technical finesse AND depth, but not fun. Episode 4 was for fun. So Lucas wasn't shooting for fun this time. He told anyone who was listening. He was telling his myth, as he has said for 20 years. Go see the movie to see THIS movie. If you want to see the original Star Wars, rent it or buy it. This episode is crafted to explore how a sweet and earnest boy can become Darth Vader. This is the story teller's job and Lucas has acquitted himself well. Sweet earnest boys (and girls) do become Darth Vaders. That's what episode 3 is about. Lucas has competently woven the threads of the origin myth contained in Episodes 1 and 2 into Episode 4. It was not cheesily done. Go see Episode 3 because it is a well-crafted movie which is part of a myth worth retelling until we internalize it."
1912,9,The Force is still with it,"This is the movie for which ""Star Wars"" fans have waited at least eight years (since George Lucas announced that he was making a ""prequel"" series) or maybe 20-plus years (since the similarly titled ""Return of the Jedi,"" after which Lucas said he was through with the ""Star Wars"" universe). After the dull ""Phantom Menace"" and nearly unwatchable ""Attack of the Clones,"" ""Revenge of the Sith"" wraps up the prequel series and sets up the ""original"" trilogy with finesse and not a little emotional resonance."
1913,2,Unbearably terrible movie,"This is an unbearably terrible movie. It gets everything wrong about Star Wars. (For reference, I would say Rogue One is the best star wars movie, to date.)"
1914,3,Absolute Pants,I wasn't expecting much but what I saw was less.
1915,1,not at all,"Thsi movie was a huge let down for me. though it did tie up all those loose ends the acting was horrible and it seemed more like a mid day soap opera between Padme and Ani. there was such a hype about the movie i couldn't wait to see it for my self and by the time i actually did get to see it i found myself staring at the theater walls waiting for it to be over. true that the special effects were good and the it pulled perfectly for the next ones made over 20 years ago but still, the other movies were so believable while this one seemed like a cheap pull off of the internet. Others may like it but personally i won't be wasting my money to see it again or buy it when it comes out on DVD."
1916,10,"As Master Yoda would say: The one we've been waiting for, this is.","Just as Anakin Skywalker is ultimately redeemed at the end of Return of the Jedi, so too has George Lucas been redeemed at the end of his prequel trilogy. Following two much-hyped installments that turned out to be (to put it mildly) less than satisfying, fans finally get what they'd been craving -- a true space opera. The audiences that fell in love with Star Wars as children, went to see the first two prequels as adults, and found a movie aimed squarely at... children. This one -- FINALLY -- is for the big kids. "
1917,7,I give it less credit than most people do.,"Even though this is the best of the sequels, it can never top anything off the original trilogy, which surprises me when I hear some people say this is the best."
1918,1,Not total trash - but close!,"Come On, we know that Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman and Christopher Lee can do something called ""acting"" which you would not believe from watching this film. All the lines are delivered in a monotone deadpan that even cut rate actors could deliver better."
1919,5,Half a movie,"I'm incredibly surprised at the rating this movie is getting from IMDb users...as I write this, it's 8.3, which is WAY too high. This is a mediocre movie, at best (I give it a five). Is it superior to the first two of the ""new"" trilogy? Absolutely. But those were both total garbage, so making a better movie wasn't that hard. At least this one was watchable. The acting is still atrocious, and some of the events that happened later in the film are handled so poorly by Lucas and company that I almost groaned out loud. Oh, btw, I wanted to like/love this movie as much as the rest of you. It just didn't happen. Heck, the music isn't even that good."
1920,10,Better than I hoped,"This is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. This movie not only makes The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones better, it makes Return of the Jedi make a little more sense as well."
1921,7,"Lucas improved on episodes 1 and 2 in the newer trilogy by making ""Star Wars: Episode 3- Revenge of the Sith"" stylish, but a bit too stylish","Lucas is a fantastic film maker. He started with the original Star Wars trilogy, and continued with the high-flying adventures of Indiana Jones. The Star Wars movies were probably the more popular of his two series, and they're still up and running. The storyline is finally complete, and with a solid ending."
1922,7,"An above average climax to the ultimately disappointing Star Wars Prequel trilogy, this is the most enjoyable of the three films.","Revenge of the Sith could be argued as somewhat of a return to form for the Star Wars franchise, but is still a pale imitation of the original trilogy's final film. The plot, predictable as it may be is also very practical, and for the most part the pace is fairly continuous bar several tedious scenes. George Lucas' dialogue is once again very robotic, but is vastly better than in Attack of the Clones, and in terms of direction, things do get ridiculous at times, but for the most part is generally well done. What I'm saying is that the film nails everything it needs to, from visual effects to engaging action sequences. I also have to applaud how Lucas altered the tone of the trilogy in Episode three; it is much darker than in the first two films. But Revenge of the Sith is miles away from being perfect. I do feel for genuinely fantastic actors like Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan Kenobi, the prequel's best character) and Ian Mcdiarmid (who sees his character Palpatine's arc completed adequately if predictably), who have to perform opposite lifeless characters like Hayden Christensen's miserably overreacted Anakin Skywalker, and Natalie Portman's senator Padme Armidala, who's character feels drained of any depth languishing in the depths of George Lucas' spreadsheet. The climax of the film is poorly thought out, and quite rushed, although all loose ends are tied in preparation for the far Superior original Star Wars. In conclusion, Revenge of the Sith feels very devoid of anything unique, or truly shocking, and this makes it distinctively unimpressive, but it is still a decent attempt at a thrilling final chapter, and character development in most cases is generally a lot better than in the previous two installments. Overall, an adequate Episode of Star Wars."
1923,6,"Far from a redemption, but a serviceable flick.","I never saw The Phantom Menace, but I did see The Attack of the Clones. The plots in the latter and The Return of the Sith were tortuous, to say the least, and some of the action that moves the characters along is absurdly unbelievable. This movie, like the Star Wars movie before it, suffers from problems of too many special effects, too many ancillary characters and settings taking up the screen time, and motivations by the main characters that do not seem credible."
1924,8,Who gives a sith?.....I DO...I HAD A BLAST...SPOILERs,"Overall, I enjoyed myself. The movie was the first or second best in the series of 6. The FX were flawless. The habitats, and cavedwellings, and new planets and world were very interesting to look at throughout the movie. I have to go again just to look closer at the art rather than the actors. I think some of the name actors were lame this time around. Seeing this movie and its resolved plots makes me want to rent the series ""in order"". The final results of the fight with Vader were well done, I just wished Lucas would have added more time to the process of the rebuilding of Darth Vader. They could have made the funeral a bit longer too, and shorten some of the light saber fighting. How were they able to fight in that volcanic planet anyway...should have explained how the heat didn't effect the humans. I think the voice of Vader was a computer controlled voice of Hayden not that of James Earl Jones (or just an impersonator of Jones). Yoda had the most laffs with his abilities, especially regarding guards. There was applause at the sight of George Lucas' name at the beginning and the end. Unlike other episodes, no applause during the movie. For the most part a very quiet, tentative audience. (A few of my ""shhh's"" helped at the beginning...at least I hope I contributed to that...to many under 10 year olds in our show....SO MUCH FOR PARENTAL Guidance.)....Have fun...I did...and will see it again to look closer at the backgrounds."
1925,10,Rejuvenation In the Star Wars Experience,"To Most Star Wars fans, Episode I and II felt like somewhat of a disappointment however Episode III is anything but! This chapter in the story perfectly sums up exactly how episode I and II fit into the scene. As soon as I saw those famous blue letters light up "" A long time ago in a galaxy far,far away..."" I knew I was in for Quite the ride."
1926,10,the best,"this is the greatest movie i have seen. every second i was hooked. from when it said a long time ago in a galaxy far far away to the end of the credits. i loved it and the critics say so to. every line was brilliant, the music was excellent, the digital effects were the best i have ever seen in a film and the story fits in perfect to the legendary story line. Gorge Lucus, you are a legend. I've seen it 3 times at the movies and am seeing it again. i cant get enough of it. i can't wait for the series and maybe episodes 7, 8, and 9. it is very different to the other movies because it is darker and more emotional.with lots of humour. not a good film for little kids but good for teens and adults. Best movie ever. 10 out of 10"
1927,10,star wars lives! vote for me!,"VOTE USCWANNABE My name is Tom Costabile and I am currently the lead runner up in the Presidency contest at Hyperspace.com, known on that site as USCWANNABE. I have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that I can't win this with just friends and family...I'm going to need the help of the millions of fans Star Wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so I've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency. "
1928,8,A Suitably Darker Entry That Creates For Satisfying Conclusion To The Prequel Trilogy,"Even though most Star Wars fans will admit the Prequel Trilogy as a whole was a big disappointment, many will argue that it's last instalment, Revenge of The Sith was the best of them and I believe this to be a fantastic movie despite some flaws still remaining over from the past two films. For one the opening of this movie was fantastic, it immediately set the stage for how the universe is since Attack of The Clones and was what ultimately largely what most of the previous two films failed to be, entertaining. The Back and forth between Obi Wan and Anakin was fantastic, they now feel like life long friends and true brothers. For the most part the special effects have improved in this film to the point of looking life like in certain places. The lightsaber duel between Obi Wan, Anakin and Count Dooku was done just right, not only was it extremely well choreographed but it had a more personal touch it that the past duels in the trilogy failed to acquire and made it more satisfying. Now after this opening the film slows down quite a bit and in the last films the painfully slow pace was working against it the film but here it actually works, it helps the narrative flow more freely particularly when it comes to the manipulation of Anakin by the chancellor as it gives the audience a better chance to see the subtle moves he takes in order to mould Anakins mind. But easily the greatest scene of not only this arc but the entire trilogy was the story of Darth Plagueis, the score and performances came together perfectly to create for a scene that gives us insight into the Chancellors mind which gives him more backstory. While it wasn't quite fleshed out enough the eventual confrontation between Obi Wan and General Grievous was very well done, Grievous was a threatening villain and their fight was amazing. The entire sequence of Order 66 is one of the most chilling and effective moments in this entire franchise to see how all the Jedi were assassinated was truly devastating. The final Lightsaber duels are incredible, the choreography is stunning and you can tell the anger that goes into each strike and the pain that they both feel. The last scene of this film is very good the score is stunning and I liked how it mirrored that of the one in a new hope. This is far from a perfect movie however. For one when it comes to Green Screens the special effects are not at all convincing, they look completely fake and maker you realise that they are being filmed in a set. I also think that the love story of this film is not a good motivator for Anakin to turn into Darth Vader and made his Origin less effective than the original trilogy would imply. While it is stunning to look at the final fight between Obi Wan and Anakin goes in for far to long to ridiculous degrees. "
1929,10,better than empire!(possible small spoiler),"Episodes 1 and 2 were average to say the least, but I was one of those people who was certain that Lucas was saving his best for last, and I'm pleased to say I was right. This movie was breathtaking, it was everything I expected it to be and more. It had everything. It was obvious to see that Lucas put a lot of care and love into this film."
1930,7,"The Best of the Prequels, but could be better.","Better than Phantom, and way better than Attack of the Clones(Drones), Revenge delivers on quite a few levels, and ties the ends of the story leading up to A New Hope, but is still plagued by the same atrocious script/actors in places as the other prequels, and relies too much on CGI and clumsy catastrophe."
1931,9,Lucas isn't an idiot after all,"In case you didn't get it from the title, I was disappointed in Episodes 1 & 2. I grew up with 4,5, and 6(Empire being my Favorite, Still is) I felt the the acting was off, and the writing bad. I'm just setting the mood. I looked forward to this movie with a mix of dread and excitement. I can gladly say the dread has gone. I know that every nerd, dork, and geek is gonna post something about this movie. Well, this dork wanted to say his piece. "
1932,7,"Uneven, but good","This movie probably had the hardest job of any Star Wars film ever: making the viewers care about the turning point of the series. From the beginning this film carried the deep and heavy burden of the stigmata of all the prequels: bad dialogue, bad acting, and unsympathetic characters and plot. Now it had to suddenly make the dramatic events meaningful for the audience, but would be hindered because it involved characters nobody really cared about. Dealing with this problem would be the biggest obstacle of the production."
1933,7,"A Good Star Wars Addition, Falls Short Of A Great Movie","Sometime between Clones and Sith, I've gained a critical eye. To me, Sith was a minor let-down. It simply did not have the artistic elements I look for in movies now. As with the other prequels, holes can be shot in this story, and many of the characters' actions are not believable. The story had GREAT potential, and REALLY utilized most parts of this, however only after the viewer had read between the lines and patched up most of the holes themselves. (A long-time Star Wars fan will have no problem justifying almost any part of the movie, but typical movie fans will have some problems.) Furthermore, the scenes were over-exaggerated, a trend which has struck Hollywood recently much to my disliking. I go to the movies to watch movies, not to simulate rollercoasters as we whip the camera around a battlefield."
1934,8,Revengers Tragedy,"Well no doubt in the flood of user reviews here on IMDb much has been said along the lines of ""Lucas finally gets back on track and erases the painful memory of the first two prequels with a coup de grace that leaves you breathless/fulfilled/back in the world of the original Star Wars etc"""
1935,7,This is the most emotional Star War and This is war!!,"May 19, 2005 was not a simple day for fans and fans of the ""Star Wars"". It was a day when all pieces of history fell into place, finally opening a riddle that lasted more than 28 years. People imagined and thought out, wrote books and stories, collected facts and made legends, and everything for the sake of one saga, which will forever remain in the hearts of its admirers. Probably, almost every person, leaving the hall, could not convey or describe in words, what happened during these several hours in the cinema. Joyful, sad, tearful, shocked faces, slowly headed for the exit, promising to come back and see this episode again."
1936,8,Very good ending of the series but problems with the characters,"I am probably one of the very few Star Wars enthusiasts that prefer Phantom Menace to Clones. Why, well I never could put my finger on the issue. Now comes Revenge. Now let me say from the start I thought it was good. Better than Clones, but again Phantom Menace somehow had more of an effect on me. Again why? Revenge had all the elements that I would say to anyone go see this movie, but hey, you will need to see it a couple of times, as it has so much going on."
1937,9,Tatooine Sunset,"Of course everybody know what happened. Naturally no one is surprised by the facts. But the ways are surprising, amazing, and a masterpiece for any cinema lover. How to tell a known story and get all people sticked to their seats? Lucas did it! "
1938,10,Heartbreaking,"I have been dying to see this film since I heard Lucas was making Episode I. I've always been a big fan of the Star Wars series. Not a true fan, for I'm not really obsessed like most fans, but I've a moderate Star Wars collection and a knowledge of the Star Wars universe that won me first place in 'Who wants to be a Jedi Master' at a Con called Fanfair. LOL! Anyway, the first two films. The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones were not the best Lucas could have done, and didn't really top the original films. They held their own to me, but Revenge Of The Sith falls right into place with Episodes 4, 5, and 6. We all knew that this film was to be very serious with the rise of the empire and Anakin's decent to the dark side. However, I was worried it would be watered down for younger viewers. However, Lucas didn't pull any punches. I was almost crying and I only held it in because I didn't want to get teased by my friends. Huge Spoiler if you haven't seen it yet. If you don't mind Spoilers ... keep reading."
1939,8,Totally overrated,"How the h*ll can this movie be on the top 250? It is, according to my opinion, the second worst Star Wars ever (Episode 2 is slightly worse). This movie makes you realize that Episode 1 was totally wasted. I mean, the story in Episode 1 don't have a lot to do with the other movies. So they had to compress every single detail and put it in this movie. Every single character had to die at once. No room between the killings. So this is a complete downfall. The entire republic had to fall in two and a half hour. Too fast."
1940,7,"Better than 1 and 2, a decent bridge to the first trilogy","I saw this film on opening day, and have now watched it several times on DVD. I have also read a lot of reviews, both good and bad, and now feel compelled to voice my thoughts."
1941,6,middle of the road,"I'll be the first to say that I'm relieved that the epic Star Wars is complete. Visually, the film looked fantastic. One can always count on LucasArts to deliver when it comes to the sound and visual aspects of a film. The duels were more imaginative and impressive than any of the previous films. Ewan McGregor turned in a fabulous performance as usual. However, there is quite a large list of flaws. Of course, the script stands out as a major blemish. If there was as much care given to the visual and sound departments as to the actual script and acting, the film would have no problem being on the top ten list of greatest films. The dialogue is forced and corny at times. Plus, the plot holes can be rationalized only for so long. Facts established in other films don't compliment facts established in the newest chapter."
1942,8,Good movie...until the end,Well first let me brag about the good stuff in the recent Star Wars: Episode III.
1943,6,Outstanding work with one glairing exception.,"As with the earlier works, the need to follow up Sir Alec Guinness with another actor with a British accent sets a very high bar and much is asked of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi to pull this off. His performance is again adequate, if not inspiring, and serves the film well. Visually stunning, this episode really does an excellent job of bringing everything full-circle. Ms. Portman's work is truly wonderful, but in contrast to Christensen's as the adult Anakin Skywalker serves only to point up how lacking his performance is, particularly in his ability (or lack thereof) to sell his turn to the Dark Side - though, in fairness, the script holds some responsibility for this as well. As Anakin's conversion into Darth Vader is the central thrust of the film, to see it handled in such an awkward manner is nothing short of shocking. Still, entirely worth seeing - in fact, not to be missed - it will ""bring you home."""
1944,8,"Good, Not great","Everyone loves ROTS, and don't get me wrong I love it too, but it's still a prequel with hokey acting, dated visuals and some bland characters. McGregor, Oz, and Jackson make the prequels worth watching, and as I said before this is a good film, but to say it's the best Star Wars film is a long shot for me. The prequels took focus from the stories away in favor of world building, but this film focuses back on the story and puts things on track to stick the landing. (albeit a little bumpy) This definently has some of the best sequences and scenes in any SW film. The Mustafar fight, Order 66, General Grevious vs Obi-Wan. As I said before the visuals for this film have become SOOOO dated it's not even funny, normally I wouldn't complain, but The Lord of the Rings came out around the same time, and this is Star Wars they are known for there Visual Effects. Hayden Christiansen's acting is bad, but I blame that on Lucas' direction, and Portman clearly just isn't into it (feeling more like a daytime SOAP actor, and yeah I know Star Wars is like a soap opera, but it's also a big budget blockbuster movie, so come on.) I prefer The Original Trilogy and The Sequel Trilogy over this film, but it's well made and I still get goosebumps when I see that mask draped over Vader's face."
1945,9,Almost as good as the original trilogy,"While this movie doesn't quite capture the charm of the original trilogy, and while the characters still aren't as good as the original trilogy, this movie makes up for these sins with enough action and emotional intensity to nearly put it in the class of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. Lucas did a pretty good job with continuity between the two trilogies, considering that he had already painted himself into a corner with such fan pleasing moves as deciding to include the droids in this trilogy. Of course, the special effects were excellent, but this film did offer more than just that, as we finally get to see Anakin Skywalker transform into Darth Vader, and we get insight as to how this happened."
1946,1,Just plain embarrassing and inexplicable.,"Wow, give any two people who liked Star Wars and Empire two minutes to muse and they could have come up with better movies for all three prequels. One of many: how about showing a wonderful world in order and happiness when the Jedi ruled, so a tragedy could unfold? Instead the force is an infection and the Jedi are clueless mopes in a bad urban bureaucracy. A trilogy focusing on Vader (as Darth Vader) and the rise of the Empire would have worked too."
1947,7,Best of the prequels,"So on to Episode III, which is clearly the best of the prequels, but still an overall disappointment. The CGI is again utterly bonkers, the dialogue even worse and the plot overlong and uninteresting. McDiarmid owns every frame, but the three leads are again saddled with George's lazy script. The last third of the film is the strongest, and ticks off all the necessary boxes for everything to make sense in Episode IV. 7/10."
1948,8,"Much much better, and surprisingly a satisfying conclusion","OK, I've given this a lot of thought. I haven't watched this in awhile, so I popped in my DVD copy and wondered if it would be better, just as good or worse than I remembered. After watching, I can say that it's actually pretty good. Is it perfect? No. There are times when the dialogue falls flat, and some of the acting is still generic. But the actors in this film have improved very much, which I'll get to in a minute, the dialogue while not perfect has also improved, and the story is actually more interesting than it was in ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"". "
1949,10,The best since Empire,"Yeah, it's better than Jedi. It's even arguably better than A New Hope. It beats the living daylights out of Phantom Menace and Clones. But of course, certainly not Empire..."
1950,9,All I have to say is YES!!!!,"The original Star Wars trilogy revolutionized cinema, and is one of the best trilogies ever. Years later George Lucas created the abomination of a prequel ""The Phantom Menace"". Everything was done wrong in the film, and many Star wars fans like myself felt insulted. Then there was ""Attack of the Clones"" which was amazingly worse than the first prequel. After Lucas failed miserably with the first two Star Wars prequels we got this. This is what the other two films should have been. The writing is much stronger, the acting is way better, and the emotion is more powerful. How George managed to improve so much from such bad movies as the first two prequels amazes me. I wish that this kind of effort was put into the first two. Yes it does still have some terrible romantic dialogue, but it is in the movie way less than ""Attack of the Clones"" making it durable. The action feels like it has actual strength behind it from the film's writing. The dialogue is improved upon a lot. Acting is better from flat out everyone in the cast. Even Hayden Christensen has improved a lot. He doesn't deliver a great performance, but you can tell he took a few more acting classes. Then there is the powerful emotion in the film. This is the darkest in the Star Wars franchise. The atmosphere is very strong, and I actually do sorta care about the characters. Unlike the first two prequels. There is so many improvements, but the best by far is how entertaining it is. This film manages to capture the same kind of entertainment we got out of the original trilogy. It's a very entertaining film. It isn't as good as any of the original trilogy, but it is good enough to earn the name Star Wars."
1951,10,"Great, but not the best","I went to see this movie today with some of my friends. I must say that it was refreshingly better than Episodes I and II. Bits of it confused me, especially the close-up of General Grievous's eyes. The movie did not really explain that. It did, however, explain many things. It showed how the Jedi were wiped out, how someone like Yoda did not manage to defeat Darth Sidious and why exactly Anakin became Darth Vader. There was a lot of irony laced into the movie. It was especially ironic how Anakin risked everything to try and save Padme, but by doing so, killed her. Anakin's transformation into the masked Darth Vader really disturbed me, though. Everything up to that point had been PG. I could understand why that caused it to have a PG-13 rating. It was a break from the childness of JarJar Binks as well. It still cannot compare to the original, though, but it still deserves 9 out of 10."
1952,9,"Addictive, but still clumsy (Some spoilers)","Lots to be said about the movie. Better or worse than the previous, none can really say, unless you watch it a couple of times. As previous people here, on IMDb, said, Welcome Back, Mr. Lucas! Glad to see the starships, battlecruisers, light sabers, the unique sound of the engines and so on. However, I want to criticize the forced manner they made the script about Anakin's conversion. Not that we didn't expect, but Palpatine shows himself suddenly, and just asks: Join the Dark Side! I think it was obviously because the script writers had to overcome the lack of complexity with another lack of complexity. I was uneasy to see some events that have a pace and that others have a different one. I don't know, I am not a writer, but it felt a bit childish, the same error as the Attack of the Clones movie, which made me think I was watching a kid playing computer games rather than watching a SW movie. And then, the same Anakin does things (I repeat, not that we didn't expected to) in such a hurry. Now he is the same restless padawan, then, suddenly, the vengeful and naïve frustrated padawan and the, just like that, Darth Vader himself. The authors wanted to link the stories in such a way that they forced the SW logic, at least the one I expected. Or it is the first time I watched it. I don't know. Still a bit too ""juvenile"", even for an old fan (the movies of my childhood were ""A new Hope"" and ""Empires strikes back""). But for the sake of all what SW means, it is a wonderful movie. 9 of 10"
1953,5,Can't see the forest for the trees.,"One feature which characterised the original trilogy of Star Wars films was it's economy. They were all made on relatively low-budgets and, in episode four's case, a short space of time. This economy is also part of the action of the films themselves: They are marked by their constant action and a refusal to get mixed up in anything they don't need. The wealth of mythology that has since been created for the Star Wars universe is minimal, making the films easily accessible to non-nerds and very easy and a great pleasure to watch. At some point, George Lucas began to lose his spark. The shadow of this is seen in Return of the Jedi. From the no-frills adventure of New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas starts indulging - particularly in pointless, cutsey teddy bears. It is at this point we hesitate to suspend our disbelief. This brings me to Revenge of the Sith. My biggest problem with RotS is Lucas' sense of humour. It is horrible. He can extend himself no further than ridiculous banter between cartoonish robots. This is a jarring and incongruous element prevalent in the prequel trilogy that ruins the experience. This could have quite easily been removed, and I cringe to imagine what HAS been left on the cutting room floor. In the original trilogy, the characterisation is reduced to a few simple archetypes - which Lucas can do. In the new films, however, his biggest mistake in these terms is trying to show the human side of his characters. the shaky dialogue and awful acting is indicative of his limitations as a director. Ah, yes, the acting. I feel I must blame the director for this. Respected stars of serious films such as Ewan McGregor are simply awful. An action film does not demand humans. Sci-Fi is all about escapism, and we want full-on heroes, not normal folks in films. Star Wars gets a very generous rating from me thanks to it's excellent special effects and graphics."
1954,8,Episode III does what I and II could not,"I own every Star Wars movie, and have seen them all a lot. After enjoying the original trilogy so much growing up, I was, as most, disappointed with the first 2. I thought the use of special effects replaced the weak plot of the first one, and the so so plot of the second one. But finally, Lucas awakes. Almost everything he wrote into this 3rd movie makes sense. I loved how it explains the questions we all had. I loved how it has intense battle scenes that weren't too long and didn't take away from the plot. And best of all, it makes sense. Lucas concludes the first 3 episodes with an opening (from a plots standpoint) to the original 3 without being thrown off. You can watch the 3rd one then watch ""A New Hope"" and not be lost, confused, or left wanting. You are right where you need to be from a plot standpoint, somethine the other 2 episodes did not. I hope this movie lets those super intense star wars fans finally leave Lucas alone. I guess now it depends on whether he does the finally 3 (there are 9 chapters to the star wars concept...)."
1955,2,"Cheap, Trite, Atrocious","I must say, George Lucas has disappointed me beyond any level I was expecting. Going into this (as it turns out) total piece of trash, I was guardedly optimistic. I mean, 80+ on the tomato meter? Friends saying ""Hey, it's better than I and II"". (Well that should've been a warning)."
1956,6,"Revenge of the ""Sixth""","There's so much to get in this film that its shockingly relentless, but if you can bear with it, its extremely rewarding and Lucas even manages to ADD to the saga's story at one or two points (inc a suggested and tantalising back story to Darth Sidious)."
1957,5,better than episodes 1 & 2 but still a disappointment,"I saw the movie today and, much as I really wanted to love it, I just left feeling flat. I'm a big fan of Ewan McGregor, but his acting in this, as well as the rest of the cast, was terrible, if not entirely their fault. From what I've heard of George Lucas's style they got very little direction from him, and with the shocking dialog they were given, there was little they could do. The stuff between Padme and Annakin was particularly cringe-inducing. And that scream by James Earl Jones at the end, everyone in the theater laughed. Also, with basically the whole movie being shot against green screen the actors had nothing to relate to. I remember hearing the actors from LOTR saying how much it helped them that they had carefully crafted sets and amazing locations to help get them into the atmosphere of the place, and their characters. Gee George, just build some @#$% sets why don't you, use some in camera effects. Yes today you can do amazing things with computers, that doesn't mean they're always the best way to go, IMO CGI is much better adding to what's there, making slight changes, not taking over the show. CGI has it's place, it was jut used badly in this film, every scene just screamed, look at what my computers can do. Apart from all that, there was just something missing from this film, a spark. The whole thing seemed kind of hurried, and rushed from one set-piece to another. There was actually too much fighting, to the point where it became boring. This movie did dispense with some of the things that ruined Ep 1 & 2, but one thing that still irritated me, was the jokey nature of the enemy droids, it still just seems out of place. Plus, what happened to R2D2, a lot of his capabilities seem to have gotten broken somewhere between Ep's 3 & 4. O.K, with computers you can make him do all kinds of things now, but as he wasn't doing them (i.e. flying round, springing up out of position on a ship) in Ep's 4 - 6, it's a bit silly to have him able to in these movies. Some of the light saber duels I liked, but the one between Mace Windu and Palpatine was terrible, it was obvious neither actor was comfortable with fencing. Neither of the actors they used for Annakin in the prequels suited the role and there was just no chemistry between the actors, that was one of the many things that made the original trilogy great. However, I'll try to end on a high note, what did I like about the film? The final light saber battle between Hayden and Ewan looked great, they both obviously took a lot of time training and it really paid off, makes the duels in Ep IV - VI look a bit tame, but then again, their characters had been training with light sabers for a lot longer than Luke did. Also, the effects they put on annakin from being burnt etc looked great too. My favourite scene in the movie would have to be the clones turning on the Jedi, it was just brutal. Anyway, that's my rant. In the end, if people haven't seen Ep's 1 - 3, I'd probably tell them not to bother, just watch Ep's 4 - 6 again, watching this movie has certainly inspired me to."
1958,2,George Does It Again!,"With exponentially clunkier dialogue and run time which gives a greater impression of eternity than eternity itself, this has so little jeapardy it's hard to care."
1959,8,The best star wars film (of the first 3 episodes of course),Its a far better movie than episode 1 and 2 
1960,9,My personal thoughts on Episode III,"I went to see the movie @ the midnight showing in Kansas City. The theaters were packed. First off the movies didn't start until almost 20 after midnight which was a rip off. But once it started the whole place was quiet. No one made a sound throughout the entire time it was playing. I was really impressed how everything ties together with episode IV. I love the fight scenes,very well put together. You could tell which fights were real & digital. The movie is a combination of tragic love story gone awfully wrong. I had a tear towards the end of the movie. I was very impressed with the special effects & overall look of the movie . Well done. I am going to see it again. My hat off to mister Lucas."
1961,10,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.","Not only the best Star Wars movie ever, but the greatest movie of all time. I need not say more. If you haven't seen the movie go watch it, if you have seen it then rewatch. I implore you."
1962,1,10/10?,Don't get me wrong this isn't a 1/10 movie more like a 5/10 but most voters have been submitting 10/10 and making a mockery of the whole rating system.
1963,8,One for the SITH,"Long time ago, in a Galaxy far far away George Lucas said let there be Wookies, and there were Wookies and they were good Wookies. Some 28 years ago Mr. Lucas started his mythic 6 part movie epic; the problem is that he started in the middle. So over the last 6 or so years he has been finishing the epic with the beginning. Revenge of the Sith is the last movie in the series but the third in the epic and continues the story from episode I and II while leading into the stories of episode IV, V and VI. The story follows Jedi knights Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor of Mounlan Rouge and Big Fish), Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen of of Star Wars episode II: Attack of the clones) Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson of Pulp Fiction and S.W.A.T) and Jedi Master Joda as they fight for galactic peace. The Galaxy is at war and it's up to the Jedi and the Republic to end the war before all is lost. But nothing is as it seems as the shadow of evil lurks in the heart of democracy and the dark side clouds the minds of men. With the evil Sith Lord, Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid of Sleepy Hollow) gaining power and the mighty Droid army of the wicked General Grievous spreads through the systems of the republic; the idea of peace is too far gone to be reached by diplomacy and now must be won at the tip of a Light-saber. The fate of the entire galaxy teeters uneasily on the edge of chaos. How far will young Skywalker go to protect all that he loves, what is the dark secret at the center of the galactic war, why in God's name is Jar-jar still alive and how bad ass can a 3 foot tall green Muppet really be? All these question and more will be answered in the final installment of Sci-Fi's biggest epic seriesStar Wars."
1964,10,The best of the 6,"I never expected to say that (and mean it), since I am a very big fan of the first 3 movies, and was not very happy with episodes 1 and 2, but Revenge Of The Sith is, for me at least (and many of my friends, also fans) the best of the 6 Star Wars movies."
1965,,Starwars or cheap science-fiction for the masses?,"If i had to describe this movie in one single line without being offensive is: ""the complete joke of Darth Vader"""
1966,10,"Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth plagueis the wise? I thought not, it's not a story a Jedi would tell you.","Hello there! This is the best movie of all time, seven samurai pales in comparison to the Titan of imagination the George Lucas created."
1967,6,Finally Lucas abandons the Dark Side,"Let's face it: When ""Star Wars"" first came out it was like nothing ever seen before. Decades after and with trilogies like ""The Matrix"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" people has lost that sense of discovering an adventure out of this world. So how do we make up for that in ""Revenge of the Sith""? The answer is, cram as many CGI effects as humanly possible. The eye-candy is delivered nonstop through this movie and your senses get overloaded."
1968,7,25 Years too late,"Yes, the film (taken in context) is brilliant but I cannot help but feel it was made 25 years too late... The major problem for me is, that I was 7 years old when I watched the first film (A New Hope), I'm now 36 and my grasp of plot, good acting and my ability to suspend disbelief are a lot different now to what they were then... Hayden Christensens acting isn't terrible... physically he is able to convey emotions such as anger and hatred very well. It all falls down when he delivers his lines in a mechanical (pre Vader suit), monotone voice. This alone, throws you right out of the fantasy. You think to yourself, ""Hey, I'm actually sitting in a Movie Theatre watching a film here, I'm not is some Galaxy far, far away"". Then of course, there are the inconsistencies in the storyline from Ep I and II that never quite explained... a good example of this is C3PO... Anakin built him and Anakin lived on Tatooine, therefore C3PO comes from Tatooine, why in the hell doesn't C3PO recognise the planet in A NEW HOPE when he and R2D2 jettison there in the escape pod????? Okay, a minor detail I know which I'm sure someone on this site will be able to come up with an explanation for but still, for me, an irritating detail."
1969,8,The bets of the preqels,OK so let's talk about how this is the best of the preqels. It had a great intro and ENDING. honestly it ties to the original Trilogy well and has good acting. It has an amazing score And it has an amazing final few scenes. The battle between Obiwan and Anikan is brilliant and well executed. People complain about the acting but I blame the writer because The actors did their best to act out what was written. It ends the clone wars well but the one thing I hate is Count Dookus Death and The terrible battle between Obi Wan and General Grevious That could have been so much better. Mace window and palpatines battle was terrible because 3 Jedi die really easily.
1970,9,The Darkest Star Wars Movie And Also One Of The Best.,"Basically the movie is about a very powerful jedi master who eventually falls to the dark side out of anger and wanting to save his wife whom he loves. The movie tries to show how powerful Anakin is. He is the chosen one who is said to bring balance to the force. However he is mad at the Jedi because he cannot attain the rank of Master despite being on the Jedi Council. Meanwhile he has a vision of which his wife Padme dies. He befriends Palpatine who is secretly the sith lord Darth Sideous. Palpatine talks to Anakin and tells him that the Dark Side can save his wife Padme from death. Later on, he witnesses Windu trying to kill Palpatine which Anakin intervenes and allows Palpatine to kill Windu. After this, the good anakin dies and Darth Vader is born who heads to the Jedi Temple and kills many Jedi including younglings. He later meets reunites with his wife again but she is heartbroken after finding out what he has done which ultimately kills her. Anakin battles his master Obi-Wan-Kenobi which ends up Anakin being severely burned and left to die. Palpatine comes to the rescue and saves him and makes him wear a suit. "
1971,10,Excellent Movie! I loved it so much,"This is the best Star Wars movie yet, ever since The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Revenge of the Sith is now the end of the series and it ended successfully as I can see it. I watched it last night on my DVD because I rented it near the blockbuster store."
1972,5,...doesn't quite fit the hype.... didn't really expect it to either....,"As an avid Star Wars fan, I am inclined more to the original Trilogy than the prequels, but I decided I would try and set aside any cast I set for it, and attempt to watch this film as it is and to be fair to it, I wasn't as disappointed with it as I thought I would be. At first, I was expecting something as bad as Episode II (which in my opinion was over 2 hours of complete rubbish), but overall, I found that this was by far the best of the prequels, which admittedly isn't really that much of an achievement, but it's a start."
1973,4,7.5?,"I am shocked by the high rating for this movie. I consider a 7 to be ""good"" and an 8 as ""very good."" This movie was neither. This movie, like the other two prequels, is a failure. The dialogue is painful and the acting is abysmal. Above all, the excessive CGI special effects are so bad, they distract from the movie rather than add to it. I give this movie a 4, aka ""a failure."""
1974,1,Definitely for fans,"I don't know what was thinking the producer at the time of the making of revenge of the s, this was really a poor badly adaptation in contrast with the predecessors movies, only really fans like that movie, even special effects has errors (e.g: when the s lord makes fall a platform over obi-wan at the beginning of the movie ) sincerely bad movie. I was really waiting a movie with a quality like lord of the rings return of the king, but well nothing can be perfect."
1975,7,The story takes a turn,This episode largely revolves around Anikan being of a part of the trap set up by the Lord Chancellor. The biggest reveal was that the Chancellor himself was the Lord Sith. The Jedi make efforts for ending the dark forces but the Chancellor manages to poison the mind of Anikan who turns towards dark forces with the bait of protection of Padme's life using his powers later. <br /><br />This part was a sharp turn from the earlier ones where are story seemed predictable but now Anikan makes the wrong choice and transforms into invincible Lord Darth Vader. The Jedi forces are largely killed at the hands of a treachery planned leaving only few like Master Yoda. <br /><br />The fighting sequence between Anikan and Obi Wan was breathtaking with unprecedented results. Interested to see how the Jedi reassemble to fight the dark forces.
1976,8,The end of the saga...or so we all thought!,"May 2005, was a very exciting time! You see, new Star Wars fans, we all thought this was the end; this was the one we had all waited for!"
1977,6,A Missed Opportunity,"As everyone no doubt already knows, Star Wars Ep 3 is the one where we see Anakin Skywalker's descent to becoming Darth Vader (cue evil music), and the Republic's change into the empire. The movie is fitfully successful in tracking these changes, but it is hampered by two main flaws. The first of these is longstanding, but did not prevent the first movie becoming a classic - George Lucas often has a tin ear for dialogue. This leads to some really dire moments (especially in the Jedi Council), but does not, of itself, stop the movie from working."
1978,10,Excellent,"For starters, I must say I'm a big fan of Star Wars, and unlike most of the fans I really enjoyed Episodes I and II and I was very much looking forward to seeing the third one."
1979,10,Revenge Of The Lucas,"A stunning movie, which only goes to show the unbelievers that Lucas was indeed heading in the right direction with the previous parts and has always kept the first trilogy tightly tied into the story, although one might consider he was more into the special effects now than the story itself."
1980,10,The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen and it's great!,"Firstly, just like to say that I've been here from the beginning. Star Wars (EP IV) was the very 2nd film I ever saw at the age of five way back in 77 and I've been captivated ever since. Empire is my favourite but I love all the other films in equal measure, even Jar Jar (hey give me the Gungans over the Ewoks anyday!) Now to Episode 3. I stayed away from all major spoilers for this final film after reading too much about AOTC and ruining most of that film for myself when I saw it. The review will have spoilers so please do not read if you've not already seen the film."
1981,10,Fantastic,"I'm not going to bore you with what Star Wars has meant to me and all that bull*t. The fact is that the first two episodes in the prequels have been lack luster attempts, almost as if, with each one Lucas was feeling his way, trying to regain his footing. TPM played a lot like a Star Wars text book with some cool actions scenes. While it was enjoyable (how could ANY Star Wars movie not be enjoyable) it just seemed like characters were introduced and thrown away for no particular reason. AOTC was better but still lacked some of the elements that would have made it a classic. Anankin was too whiny and too much like a petulant teenager to every really warm up to and Padme (Natalie Portman) was so bad acting wise she jump roped from amazingly wooden to overacting one on one. This is what the other movies should have been."
1982,4,Mediocre film with great special effects and score,"I went to see Revenge of the Sith today, I was not impressed by the film, expect for the score and special effects. Overall it is better than Episodes I and II, however sucks in comparison to the original Trilogy. "
1983,9,A Fitting End,"I find it funny so many people judge these prequels by the standard of the first trilogy. Why would you want to compare this movie to the first three. You wouldn't do it to any other movie. It would make no sense. You wouldn't walk out of Madagascar or Monster-In-Law and say ""well that just wasn't as good as the first Star Wars trilogy."" This is,no matter what anyone says, a very good film, better than most that have come out in the last few years. Yes, the dialog was somewhat old fashioned, but one of the inspirations for the Star Wars films was the old movie serials, so if you fault the movie for that, you've pretty much missed the point. And I'm tired of all these people referring to Star Wars fans as geeks or whatever. I've seen seen people of all kinds at these films. When I saw this one on Memorial Day, there were people ranging in age from newborns to their late sixties. A lady in front of me was there with a couple of friends and they were all in at least their mid-fifties, and she had a blast watching the movie. There was a drop dead gorgeous girl coming out right behind me and one of her friends asked her what she thought about it and she said, ""that was amazing!"", and she was definitely not a geek or nerd. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that you haughty non-Star Wars fans would chew your right arm off just for the right to date her. To sum up, not a perfect movie. I would argue over a few plot points, and there are some minor inconsistencies, but overall a good job."
1984,1,Who gave this 10 points??,"I really really really can't see how a movie like that would get an 8.1 voting! How can people give a 10-point voting to a movie this obviously flawed? I could understand giving it up to 6 or 7 points if CGI is more important to you than anything else, but 10? With acting that wooden and dialogues that make you cringe throughout the entire movie, no CGI in the world could save this. Search your feelings, everybody! I went to see it and boy was I disappointed even though I had no expectations at all. I adore the original movies, didn't like Episode 1 & 2, but Episode 3... there was almost nothing I liked."
1985,10,Best of the prequels,"I don't think I have much to say that hasn't already been said about this movie. I found it to be the best, by far, of the Star Wars prequels (even though I did like Episodes 1 and 2). I think one thing that ""hurt"" the prequel trilogy was the fact that today's audience is not the same audience that was in the theaters in 1977. Many people were expecting to be blown away by the films, but since the CGI and special effects are now commonplace, people were disappointed. Fact is, a lot has progressed in that area, you just have to know where to look for it. What really made the prequels work for me is being able to see how the whole story came full circle, and in Episode 3, it held nothing back. I was very moved and satisfied. Can't wait for the DVD to come out!"
1986,9,"""So this is how freedom is lost, with thunderous applause..""","Making sense of what has been before, regaining the honor of the franchise, Lucas has."
1987,10,George Lucas ends the Star Wars saga on a very high note with Revenge of the Sith!,"""WOW"" If I could sum up Revenge of the Sith, the final episode in George Lucas' six-episode science fiction fairy tale of good vs. evil Star Wars saga in just one word, that's how I would describe it!"
1988,8,excellent one of the best star wars films,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith/2005/****
1989,9,Pretty good but ending was lacking,Overall I was impressed with the entire montage of action and sequences in the movie. 
1990,10,Awesome (No Spoiler),"User ""Masona"" has his/her head in the sand. B movie my foot. Great directing, fantastic acting, awesome special effects. Quality. Not even a single remotely cheesy line or sequence. He/she is just one of those run-of-the-mill goofs that we all have come across at least once that is so set on the 1977, '80, and '83 films that anything else is treason to the saga. Can you say.....""accept change"". Incredible 2.5 hours of non stop action and fun. An emotional movie too and perfectly sets up for Episode 4 ""A New Hope"". Go see. And remember..............It's people like Masona that you don't want behind the red button of life deciding the fate of the world as their judgment and integrity and ability to rationalize through situations are severely crippled.......no doubt like his mentality. Poor guy, life must be tough."
1991,1,Contains Spoilers Star Wars Hits A Thud!,SPOILERS After seeing the original star wars and seeing hundreds of movies in my short life i feel that i have finally be ripped off enough by this series. No answers are given for anything other than anakin skywalker. The wookie are thrown in to get wookie fans to got see the movie don't waste your time they are in the movie for about 1 or 2 minutes and do nothing! Lucas treats his adult fans to three dumb kids movies. To make money of his stupid toys! This movie is awful we find out the Darth Vader Looks Like Jason From Jason X. And we now no why it took song for this final prequel to come out. Mr Lucas didn't have anymore ideas left so he decided to use the same plot as Return of the Jedi in reverse. The CGI is great but ruins the star wars franchise now why wasn't the other two prequels filled with great CGI did you not have enough money for the first two. If you want to envision star wars episode three like it should be read the hardback novel. Now to get back to the movie it self Lucas throws away his greatness in attack of the clones he shows us how many jedi that there were but in revenge of the sith they are dead they were just in episode 2 for the toy money and are in episode three briefly. YOU SUCK LUCAS!
1992,5,Embracing the Dark Side never felt so good!,"After the somewhat disappointing first two entries of Lucas's new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, I was worried that ""Star Wars: Episode III  Revenge of the Sith"" would follow the same path and prove to be a letdown. I tried to remain optimistic since this was the final entry in the saga and the very nature of the events which would inevitably transpire on screen might allow for an exceptional film. On the evening of May 18th, as I impatiently waited for the eminent midnight screening, my enthusiasm and excitement matched that of a small child on Christmas Eve. A few hours later, I had finally seen ""Revenge of the Sith"". I can thankfully say that it was, in fact, very much like revisiting my childhood. There were moments during the screening where I could not help but stare in wide-eyed amazement at the screen, raise up my hands and clap, or murmur excitedly to my friend seated next to me."
1993,7,"Good, but not great...","After just seeing it 25 minutes ago, I was actually left feeling kind of cold. This is similar to how I felt after seeing Ep's I and II. Ep III is by far the most action packed of the series, was visually beautiful, but it just missed the mark. I am an unabashed fan of Star Wars, but at the same time not a raid fan-boy type either. I have seen the entire series in the theater, being fortunate enough to have seen the original 27 times in its initial run. This isn't to bash the prequels as a lot find fashionable, but they just don't stack up to the originals. The dialog in the last two movies (II and III) in particular is painful to endure at time. Did Lucas ""save Star Wars""? That's truly a loaded question, and from my perspective, it was a nice attempt, but..."
1994,1,Very sad and wasted episode,"I had only seen this episode once, long ago.. it left me with a bad feeling inside. So I decided to watch it again and I now know why I had these feelings."
1995,8,"Not the best, but not the worst","I waited over a month after the movie came out to see it. I love the music for the saga, and I think John Williams did a super job with it."
1996,6,The best of the trilogy but still not a good film!,"Look I get it this movie is bad, the pacing is awful, the acting at parts is shocking, the boring exposition scenes are dull and the dialogue is terrible and I'm general it's just too long and full of crap filler. What it does have though are some of the best lightsaber fights in any star wars movie. I love the duel fights scenes at the end of the movie with Anakin and Obi Wan and Yoda and Darth Sideous, it's super fun and exciting to get to see the fights that have been building over the trilogy finally happen, the choreography is amazing and the effects are really good, to be fair the effects are pretty good throughout this entire film which is a massive improvement on the last two. The opening 20 minutes of the movie is really exciting and entertaining, I love the chemistry between Anakin and Obi Wan and I love how they work together in that scene it's so cool. The score as always is amazing and fits the movie so well. Ewan Mcgregor is obviously the best part of this movie as he is in all of his Star Wars movies, he's just brilliant. This movie is definitely over loved purely on nostalgia but really it's not that great. It's an okay Star Wars movie that could have been made a lot better with some scenes cut out!"
1997,10,Yes!!,I love revenge of the sith. Nothing else to say. Now I'm just wasting words because I need at least 150 characters. I just love anakin vs obi-wan and also the battle of coruscant.
1998,7,In short,"Opening - spectacular, alternates between silly and bloomin' fantastic. Christopher Lee - wasted. Grievous - underdeveloped. Ian McDiarmid - marvellous. Love story - less embarrassing than feared. Acting - see Love story. Chewbacca's appearance - welcome but wasted. Dialogue - dire-logue. Windu vs Palpatine - tense; climax superb but horrible. Anakin's acceptance of the Dark Side - weak. Order 66 - well realised. Yoda vs Palpatine - better than expected. Obi-Wan vs Anakin - starts incredibly well, loses it, regains it at the end. Birth scenes - touching. Vader's noooooo! and rest of ending - criminally rushed. I'm off to watch the Eurovision Song Contest, where I expect to experience similar highs and lows to those I felt watching ROTS."
1999,4,disappointing...,"The expectations being so high, it is only too normal to be disappointed watching Episode III and yet, I am convinced this movie could have turned out much better with only a little more effort put into the dialogs and the characters. Ewan McGregor proves far less irritating and dull than in the two previous episodes, but he just fails to deliver emotional content, as is the case with much of the dramatic material. With a plot revolving around treason, identity, guilt, scheming, an almost Shakespearian plot, there was more than enough to write something riveting, but - and here are maybe the limits of such a film - the director has visibly so much designed his film to suit an all-age, international audience, that the result only brushes the many issues, each time avoiding to delve into any of them, and so remaining superficial at best. The scene when Anakin surrenders to the dark side, a supposed climactic scene, is surprisingly devoid of any depth and pathos, as is Vador's confrontation with his master. Similarly, the attack of the Jedi temple by Anakin could have been a heart-tearing sequence, especially since we know Anakin will have to slay innocent and pure kids that simply trust and revere him, but no, the scene is left for the audience to imagine. What about the love story? Can't it be something else than this pre-teen infatuation, especially since it is one of the defining element in the course of the action? One of the things that have certainly appealed to early fans and enthusiasts is the bestiary and the variety of planets and stars where the action is set, but here again, most of of them are reduced to a simple glimpse. OK, Lucas is no Shakespeare and no Herbert (whose ""Dune"" has suffered from its successive on screen adaptations accordingly), but a deeper look into the material would have brought the film the credibility it definitely lacks. I believe the success of a tale depends on the person who tells it, not on the raw material. That is why I found this flick hardly satisfying as a space-opera (not enough of the ""opera"" thing), and as the self-proclaimed ""darker"" episode of the series, which is just in my opinion light gray at best."
2000,7,Best of the new trilogy but still flawed,"At long last we have the third and final part of the new Star Wars trilogy  Revenge of the Sith. Critics have widely cited this to the best of the three parts, and I couldn't wait to see if it matched up to the original films and managed to improve over the decidedly average Episode II."
2001,10,The Circle Is Now Complete!,"Darkness and danger overshadow everything and make the truth harder to see. This can cause great fear within us. Some would say that's both the world we live in and the world Anakin Sywalker lives in. A world of fear and political maneuvering. A world of disguised treachery. Boy, I miss the days of The Music Makers Theaters of Bricktown, New Jersey. In 1977 that was where I first saw STAR WARS in Dolby Stereo. That was the first film that really filled me with wonder and a sense of awe."
2002,8,ROTS - Quest for Immortality,"I think that many people miss the point of Return of the Sith. OK after 28 years we felt a bit let down that the film wasn't meatier, but the underlying story is very powerful. Anakin turns dark in his quest for the secret to immortality. He wants to save Padme from dying. He wants to cure the world from death and cant see him doing this through the light side of the force. He is tricked and Palpatine plays on his raw and immature emotions, stemming from his mothers death, Very Freudian in my opinion."
2003,5,Democracy? No one's bothered...,"Revenge of the Sith could well qualify as the longest advertisement for merchandise and spin-offs in the whole galaxy. Few people would have gone to see this being unaware of how things shape up in the next episode, and all those complaints about poor acting, banal dialogue and an unbelievably swift change of heart (and personality) by Anakin to embrace the dark side are all correct. Sith isn't a hopeless movie, though it certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked in the 250 greatest films of all times. Thanks to the generous special effects ROTS is spectacular though lacking any kind of heart or faith (and don't count the Jedi, who are so senseless, so unfeeling they can't grasp what's going on around them). Video games fans will be thrilled, while those who like me recall the thrill of George Lucas's original Episode IV in the seventies will understand that there was a time he could build tension and tell a story. Still, Episode III could have been a lot worse and in the last half-hour the film finally focuses on what we all went for: to see how Darth turned out to be so disfigured. I'm not fully convinced by it all but the easily-amused will be happy. But the point I want to make is that all the talk about democracy and empires in the movie is in fact junk. In the city scenes you see lots of craft flying sedately in orderly fashion. Neat, patient, almost mechanical. Indeed, when war threatens, buildings burn, people fall out of windows the traffic never slows, never notices. You see, here we have a film where twenty people or so passionately care about democracy (or not) yet the ordinary people in all these places go about their lives serenely and untroubled by such matters. Perhaps, innocently, this movie is the metaphor for our times. For all the talk and all the hot air and passions no one really cares about who rules."
2004,,A whimper rather than a bang.,"The best of the three prequels, the story reaches a satisfactory conclusion without too much of the uneven storytelling and abortive attempts at humour of the previous chapters."
2005,6,Buddhist propaganda,"OK, OK..."
2006,4,"While it delivers in a way, that the first two didn't, Episode 3 fails at the most important and substantial parts.","Let's start with a good thing: The incredible embarrassing ""cheesy-lines-quota"" of Episode 1 and 2 has been cut down to a factor of 1/2. But Lucas again utterly fails at portraying believable (let alone subtle) character-development that should have been the focus of this final installment. As Anakins progression to the dark side was hardly hinted at in the previous Episodes Lucas had a hard time of picturing this Jedis demise in a heartfelt and credible way. It just didn't work out."
2007,9,The STAR WARS we know and love is BACK!,"That was amazing. I am still in shock. I cannot believe how great that film was. I went to a special screening for the employees at a local theater (I don't work at that one). I was decked out in my Jedi Robes, and my lightsabers ready for a kick ass movie, but boy was I in for one hell of a treat..."
2008,10,A solid 'Star Wars' movie,"I don't want to compare 'Sith' with its predecessors and go through the inevitable ranking of all the Star Wars movies. This film stands up very well on its own. Even, for the Star Wars novice who doesn't know the back story well, he/she could follow the plot easily."
2009,8,A Worthy Grand Finale,"The epic Star Wars saga has been 27 years in the making. Finally, Episode III ties everything together seamlessly. I must admit I was optimistically cautious before I watched it. I had heard many mixed reviews from fans and critics which is usual for such a blockbuster title. I do feel that initially George Lucas focused too much on CGI technology over story telling for the first two films. This time around he finally found the perfect balance. The story line is just as rich as the multi-million dollar eye candy that encompasses it. All the questions from episodes 1-2 and 4-6 are finally answered in full. You get to witness all the pieces of the puzzle come together that creates the Star Wars universe we grew up with over the years. Everything fits together seamlessly. It certainly is a must see for any Star Wars fan no matter how big or small. This is easily the darkest Star Wars film ever created and for that I give it credit as being the best Star Wars film. It easily surpasses the other two prequels combined. Looking beyond the nostalgic factors that influence opinions on the original trilogy I would say Episode III is just as good as The Empire Strikes Back if not better. The transformation to Vader is complete and you see it all unfold before your eyes. What more could you ask for?"
2010,9,So long and thanks for all the Sith,"Pleany to love and plenty to hate, plenty to annoy the hell out of you. So hard to be objective when scoring Star Wars out of ten so maybe 9 is wrong I just couldn't decide. Damm it where do I start. I expected nothing from this movie, I hated ATOC with a vengeance and thought this would be more of the same but still was dying to see it and surprise surprise, its pretty good, pretty damm amazing in parts. It starts off pants, terrible, uncomfortable dialogue (Surprisingly Ewan more than Hayden Christianson, oh the shame) and them ridiculous little droids eating away at Obi Wan's ship, a few awful Anakin and Padme scenes and then Bang a whole other movie appears from nowhere, from the moment Mace Windu faces Siduis its great, give or take the occasional dodgy line and dodgy effect (what the hell was that thing Obi Wan was riding about on). I was suitably moved by Obi Wan's emotion when defeating Anakin, it was great to see Chewie and most importantly Hayden Christianson was OK. Also don't question too closely the continuity to the original trilogy, I mean in Empire, Obi Wan is surprised to learn that ""There is another"" but here he see's with his own eyes and knows exactly who Leia is and in Jedi Liea says she remembers her mother, yeah right, how many people remember the first 30 seconds of their life. I suppose that doesn't really matter too much. so yeah its really good for the last hour or so, cool moody music for the Jedi slaying's adds atmosphere, Yoda is very good, Vader looks beautiful(tho could have done without his Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo) and Tatooine's 2 suns never looked better, anyway to summarise:- Mostly sunny outlook with plenty of cloudy patches, wear a T-Shirt but take an umbrella just in case."
2011,9,It's What I've Been Waiting For,"My wife and I were the two oldest people at the midnight showing of Revenge of the Sith; just us and about 500 college kids spread through 5 of the 16 theaters at our local multiplex. The crowd was enthusiastic. I generally don't like to see movies in theaters because of crowd behavior, but these kids were well behaved and their positive response and standing ovation when the final credits rolled echoed my own feelings."
2012,7,Episode III just showed how good EP IV-VI was,"Yes, basically I have endured all 3 movies (ep I-III) just because the classic trilogy was THAT good. We all hoped for the genius to come back to Star Wars and when I have read the remarkable comments on EP III, I had hopes for the new trilogy."
2013,10,This is the best of Star Wars prequel trilogy........,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith can prove to you that it's really very good. We can know how Anakin become Darth Vader, How Luke and Leia separated and who died in this episode. Not only that, this episode absolutely connects to Episode IV and we can see the wonderful special effects in this episode especially Mustafar's scene.Well done, thank you George Lucas for creating the Star Wars saga for us and it's the best of Star Wars prequel trilogy after we see the disappointments from episode I&II. I think Episode III is behind A New Hope or Episode IV but it's also behind The Empire Strikes Back or Episode V. I give 10/10 for Episode III. Lucas successfully redeemed himself again from Episode III."
2014,10,"Visuals 10, Plot 2","SW3 Revenge of the Sith is the most visually stunning and graphically satisfying movie I've ever seen. It was an immense cinematic achievement to get all those incredible scenes on the screen. Yet, the plot bothers me no end. Yes, I understand that George had to connect all the dots, fill in the storyline gaps, and portray how the arch-villain Darth Vader came to be. Still, what a great movie it COULD have been - if George's hands hadn't been tied to that downer of a plot."
2015,9,thank you George Lucas!!!,"George Lucas has done it. he has finally made a good prequel. i don't see how people can not like this one. phantom menace just sucked, with the exception of Darth maul. attack of the clones was better, but the love scenes were terrible, they make me sick to watch them. finally, revenge of the sith, is the 3rd and by far the best of the prequels. obi wan vs anakin is an unbelievable and emotional battle. you think back to all the time these 2 spent together, as master and apprentice. Ewen McGregor has matured so much in this movie, both the actor, and the character he plays. McGregor plays the role well, leading up to the Alec Guinness of ""A new hope"" very well. obi wan has also matured as a Jedi knight. if you rank all the movies, this one would definitely be 2nd, only behind ""return of the Jedi"" which plane kicked ass. the only downsides of the entire movie:"
2016,10,Best of the six (and best of the Sith),"It really couldn't have been much better. The childishness, and jar-jar annoyances of episode I are gone. The wooden acting and occasionally poor animation from ep II are absent. Lucas has obviously listened to his detractors here, and pulled out all the stops."
2017,10,Totally Satisfying,"I went to the film PRAYING that I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't! What I loved about this episode is the focus it puts on the psychological torment that Annikan experiences--propelling him to the dark side. I totally bought it. And the acting in this episode? Not half bad! "
2018,9,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,"overall this movie was pretty well done. visually it was stunning and John Williams score was nearly as good as the original trilogy (OT). however there were parts that i wanted to fast forward through. either because the acting was horrible, or it did not have a lot of importance to the plot. The first scene that has Padme and Anakin together in Padme's apartment was one of these. The acting was horrible. plan and simple. the relationship had no feeling behind it and the delivery of the lines made it seem like a high school play. almost all of the Padme/Anakin scenes were like this...the only one that wasn't was the little talk before the final fight."
2019,7,Better than Episode I and II,"I had some reservations about seeing the third installment, but being a Star Wars fan and standing in line for the original (that's in 1977) this was of course a ""must see"", even if it was going to be a pile of dog droppings like Episode I."
2020,,the saga ends,"I was 11 years old when I saw the first Star Wars. After almost thirty years I have come to see the end of the saga. My eyes were filled with tears when the end credits start rolling. I grew up imagining how it would be each and every chapter and now the dream is over. George Lucas ended his saga with a seal of gold. Episode 3 is everything the fans were waiting for: no stopping action, lots and lots of light saber duels and the final showdown between Obiwan and Anakin. You know the facts but you've got to see the images. This Star Wars beats all previous films but The Empire Strikes Back. To me, Empire continues to be the best of all. I won't tell more because I'm sure every fan will go to see for themselves and have their opinions. All I can say is thanks to George Lucas for Star Wars. He made me love the movies."
2021,2,So Sad,"I was enthralled with the first movie......its not me....the film making has fallen ever since. I've studied film. This one stunk. The special effect were nothing special. The actors.....OK actress should have been replaced by her stand in like her original appearance. I guess you can get bored with a script because the actors all seems to have lost interest. A love story where the ""hero"" kills everyone in sight to save his not-wife? Their love was as strong as a limp piece of thread. I mean the story line. Opps. Did I spoil anything for you? Hope not. Lots of new creatures, but most couldn't think up any lines to say. Too bad, because the main characters said way to much anyway. I love her....blah..blah...so I'm going to kill everybody. There is a great scene where Darth Vader gets new limbs attached to his still smoldering stumps. OW that's gotta smart."
2022,9,The Best in the Star Wars series,"With all six movies of the Star Wars Saga, Revenge of the Sith (ROTS) has been an excellent piece of work filled with a whole load of action, drama and that sort of sci-fi feeling to it. I think the special effects are just well....special, and they bring a deep enjoyment to all the scenes you see with the Jedi in combat and fleets of starships battling in space. This a pretty well-made film which, I think deserves a lot of credit. The actors played their part well, and LucasArts really outdid themselves with designs of new characters, like General Grievious."
2023,2,"Bad Acting + Bad Writing+ Gorgeous Scenery= Deja Vu of Episodes 6, 1, and 2.","Fell asleep halfway through. This was a piece of junk just like episodes 6, 1, and 2. Hayden and Natalie prove that they should star in a modern update of Pinochio. Talk about wooden performances, they make Kevin Costner seem like Jack Nicholson. That said, the special effects were cool. That said, George Lucas couldn't light a flame to Peter Jackson's farts. But this diatribe is worthless because everyone and their dead mom will be at this crap storm on opening day, where as I got to see it for free in Cannes and catch up on much needed sleep. By the way, what happens at the end, let me guess...At least we were saved from lessons on intergalactic diplomacy and trade embargoes, but seriously the love story, the love story. It's better than prune juice to ease the constipation, and the end result stinks just as bad."
2024,9,This is what you've been waiting for,"Revenge of the Sith is different to the 'Original Trilogy', it's darker, scarier and there's absolutely no happy ending. It's also a lot more affecting and emotional that any previous Star Wars film. In fact, it's more potent than all the previous movies put together! Don't look for funny lines, amusing moments and a happy-go-lucky atmosphere, it's simply not here. What is here is possibly the best piece of the Star Wars universe ever made (yes, I mean it might even be better than The Empire Strikes Back!). But saying that, Episode III is different than all of the other Star Wars films, especially the 'Original Trilogy', and this might not be what some fans want."
2025,8,The Darkest of the Saga. . .,"For the past 30 years, Star Wars has graced our silver screens across the world and given us moments of joy, heartbreak, excitement, and yes, awkwardness unfortunately. Hailed as classics for all time, the Star Wars movies will be engraved in our memories until the day we die. Setting the bar quite high, the original trilogy stands as a gold-encased film memorabilia. And then Lucas announced that a prequel trilogy would be filmed. I thought, ""Great, yes! More Star Wars!"". Sadly, the episodes I and II were lacking that which whisked me so happily away from reality; a quality the original trilogy possessed in abundance. From then on, Star Wars became somewhat lowered in my regard. I wasn't even really looking forward to Revenge of the Sith. Despite its acclaiming reviews, my expectations of what I thought this film would be were still not swayed. But then I actually saw the movie. . ."
2026,7,A movie for the fans,"As a star wars fan this is one of the best, most action packed Star Wars movies there is. The world building is amazing and the action is some of the best the series has to off. As a movie fan this film could use improvements, the pacing can be off, the dialogue and acting aren't always the best, and it gets bogged down on details that the casual movie goer won't care about. But if your A Star Wars fan, it's a true delight."
2027,7,Maybe I expect too much?,I break it down like this...
2028,2,Oh dear oh dear oh dear. What have you gone and done,"Firstly, can i state that the three original star wars films are three of my favorite films of all time. I was five when return of the Jedi came out."
2029,,Cue the John Williams music...,"In 1974, Goerge Lucas began writing the story of a saga that, unbeknownst to anyone, would evolve into a mainstay of modern mythology for generations past, present, and future. Now, that timeless tale is completed with ""Episode III - Revenge of the Sith""."
2030,8,"On its own merits, a very exciting, dramatic film.","I am a huge Star Wars fan, based on the original trilogy. I thought that Episode I was nearly unwatchable, and Episode II a bit better but still not up to snuff. So I do not approve of everything that says ""Star Wars"" on it. However, in spite of some occasional hiccups, I genuinely, tremendously enjoyed Episode III - Revenge of the Sith."
2031,10,Greatest Star Wars movie ever made!,"OMG i think that this truly is the best Star Wars movie ever made...even better than....EMPIRE!! WOW so i saw it today (MAY 19) and i thought that the acting was awesome, the lightsaber fights were masterful and that the story itself was incredible. i loved how Lucas showed Anakin's descent into the dark side and into Darth Vader and the transition almost made me feel sorry for him and sympathize his position. Lucas was brilliant in writing and directing this movie and the special effects were top-notch as always. I highly recommend that whoever reads this goes and watches the movie immediately because it is literally the greatest movie of all time...any doubts of sour feelings towards the prequels that you may feel will be quelled and you thirst for a completely original Star Wars movie will be quenched."
2032,9,"Revenge of Sith, Best of the Prequels by Far","Revenge of the Sith is the second best Star Wars movie, in my opinion, behind the Empire Strikes Back. The prequels have received a lot of heat by fans and critics, but this one has the best entertainment value of them all. The dialogue might make you cringe at times, but watching Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader is a fascinating story to watch unfold. I found it convincing and even somewhat relatable. Would you be tempted by the dark side if you thought it was the only way to save the one you love? Ewan McGregor does a fantastic job portraying Obi Wan Kenobi. The ""Battle of the Heroes"" at the movie's conclusion ranks #1 on my list as far as light saber battles go. And of course, there's the brilliance of John Williams, who provides a soundtrack that will move you from beginning to end."
2033,9,"Finally!! It took three tries, but Lucas finally gets it right with ""Sith"". This is a grand entertainment and the best film of the prequel trilogy. Grade: A Minus.","""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" IS the ""Star Wars"" movie every fan has been clamoring for since the original trilogy ended. With one swift stroke (sorry General Tarkin), Lucas redeems the ""Star Wars"" legacy by concluding the series on a very high and special note. This is a glorious swan song for the ""Star Wars"" saga and I applaud Mr. Lucas for finally being able to come through with an installment which will most likely be adored by all fans. In a way, I feel the movie is really a ""rebirth"" for the series since it will probably reinvigorate longtime fans. Demands for more of these films to be made will not come unheard of. In fact, wouldn't it be a great if ""Star Wars"" reclaimed it's crown of popularity by surpassing ""The Matrix Reloaded""'s current record-breaking gross over the same weekend from two years ago?"
2034,9,a must see - even if you don't like it,"This movie tends to have audience reactions that are either very good or very bad, as does any movie that brings with it hype and high public attention. My personal response? I loved it! The negative reviews I hear about the movie are usually centered around ""bad dialog"" or ""bad acting"" or ""too much special effects"". Obviously Star Wars isn't the type of movie that is made with winning an Oscar in mind. It simply isn't that type of movie. It is a world of its own, a very particular world. It therefore cannot be compared to other movies. All Star Wars movies at times lack in dialog and acting and have lots of special effects. That's what they do. So negative comments made about these things are simply repetitive and not useful."
2035,10,Greatest of the saga,"This movie has to be the greatest episode in the series. i am an extreme Star Wars fan. Love the movie. really cool. Watch it if you have not. Yoda looks better than the ones in the previous movies. The fight scene between Obi-Wan and Anakin was really epic. It was kinda sad to watch Anakin turn to the dark side. But considering what he was going through, it is understandable. However, still it was sad. George Lucas is a genius. Its a pity he did not continuing the saga. The end of the movie was dramatic. Darth Vader rises from the table and breathes for the first time. His mechanical breathing adds a certain eeriness to his form. This movie is still the best episode of the entire Star Wars series."
2036,8,A great film for the sake of escapism,"My comments late in coming (the film has been out for over a month), and so I doubt I will be saying much that hasn't already been said before in countless other user reviews. Notheless, I would still like to comment."
2037,10,"The end of the saga, or is it?","Ah at last we have a decent prequel movie, probably the only one of the three prequel films you could actually label as good. "
2038,8,Wow!,"This installment of the Star Wars prequels is by far the best. I thought the acting was great overall, and I thought Hayden Christensen did a great job. There were a couple of questionable scenes, but his acting was dead-on portraying how Anakin turns to the Dark Side. Obi-wan seemed friendlier in this movie, not so hard on Anakin. And of course, Samuel L. Jackson was outstanding. The light-saber scenes were very exciting, especially on Mustafar. It equaled the scene in The Phantom Menace with Qui-Gonn Jinn and Darth Maul, and then Obi-wan and Maul. We took our 8 year old son to see it, and he was okay with it. He just expressed concern about the final scene after the battle on Mustafar. See it before you take your young kids, just in case. A must-see movie!!!!"
2039,10,We will never forget it!,"The third part was the best movie I have ever watched. I've been waiting it for years, then for months, for weeks and the last two hours until the film-show I was truly excited. When i get into the auditorium and when the introductory ad of 20-th Century Fox started almost everyone in the hall begun applauding the movie the thrill became unnatural. And that wasn't all, the opening scenes was much more exciting as movies get. That was the best day of my life!"
2040,10,"The movie is awesome, people think too much.","Episode III really made me a fan of the whole Star Wars saga. I've seen all the movies before but after seeing this one, it made me feel for the characters especially Anakin/Darth Vader. George Lucas did a superb job of helping me understand the man behind the black mask and mechanic voice. The actors played a huge part in making this movie work. I will agree that sometimes the lines are a bit cheesy but the actors do great with what they have. Hayden Christensen floored me during the whole ""you turned her against me"" dialogue with Ewan McGregor. Ewan was awesome too with the ""You were the chosen one!"" line. Chills. The camera shots were great too. From the lowering of the mask onto Vader to the sunset at the end with baby Luke and hope for the future. I just loved this movie. It provided me with lots of entertainment in the summer and it still does on DVD."
2041,10,Marvelous,"Well, I don't usually like to take the time to comment on movies. But I must for a Star Wars film. Let's just say, Episode III gets it right, finally. As close to the originals as I think we can ever get. Although filled with some cheesy moments, like Vader's Noooo! and such, it was terrific."
2042,8,The Franchise Strikes Back,Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith
2043,8,The best 'prequel' without a doubt,"There's much more villainy and action in Revenge Of The Sith than what has gone before, but still there are boring parts where you are strumming your fingers, and the 'love' dialogue between Anakin and Padme is a random irritation throughout."
2044,7,Lucas finds form...finally.,"After two average prequels George Lucas finally finds his form with Revenge of the Sith delivering probably the third best episode of the saga behind A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Gone is the embarrassing and dim-witted Jar Jar Binks as well as the kiddie play, this is the darkest, most action packed episode of all, and at long last Anakin Skywalker discovers his destiny."
2045,5,Oh dear...,"Now I'm a big fan of Phantom Menace and although I'm in the minority, I actually preferred it to the old movies. Attack of the Clones was good but not as memorable for me. I went to see Revenge of the Sith with a couple of friends just after midnight, the night it came out, so I was suitably hyped up for it. Unfortunately, myself and all of my friends (except one) was disappointed with it."
2046,8,Star Wars goes to Hell,"It not only went to Hell, it went with gusto! "
2047,,A half-hearted attempt at the big finale.,"I will admit I had set my hopes extremely high after reading all those reviews by professional critics, and maybe I set them too high. The finished product disappointed me. I was even disappointed by the opening notes, thinking they were short and non-descriptive. Granted it was better than the first two prequels, it came nowhere close to measuring up to the originals."
2048,6,The soul of star wars returns!!!,"after the hugely disappointing episode 1 and the slightly better episode 2 here comes a film with soul that the original films had. This epic though not great is far better than the last 2 films. If you thought Star Wars was meant to be fun all round family entertainment, think again... this film follows in the vein of Graphic Manga comics and seizes to be a larger than life space movie, Instead we get bogged down with the complexities of the good & the dark side. What leads one to the dark side, there is certainly a macabre undertone to this movie hence the 12a(Uk)rating which in some cases makes you think if it isn't a tad bit low for this film. ****Possible Spoiler**** Anakin's near death scene with the molten lava is quite chilling if not highly unnerving but at least it answers the question to how Anakin ends up as the crusty powder complexioned man at the end of ROTJ... Yoda is simply stunning in this film... the facial expressions created and movements are very real. we actually get to see real emotion in an animated character. though the film does have its pitfalls.. the technology in the film far surpassed the technology in the original trilogy which makes you think what happens to all that technology? even though sets similar to the originals are slowly blended in with the effects in this movie as a transition to the original ""Star Wars A New Hope"" The dialogue is not the best in places. and thats where it goes into bad quality kid movie territory. Mace Windu's death is one of the highlights of this film as we get to see how the emperor came into being... Sadly C3-PO does not have much of a role in this movie and is just there to let you know this is a Star Wars film. Well R2-D2 does have some role in this film. all in all not a bad film not great either. (if you like special effects you will like this one!)"
2049,3,"Spectacular and very impressive, but also very sad and troubling","The action and special effects in this movie are incredible, (but also quite repetitive). It's impressive that it was written and filmed nearly 30 years after the next chapter. They did a good job at connecting them and setting the stage for the story that follows. A person unfamiliar with the series would have no idea that this is a prequel (except that its special effects are far more advanced)."
2050,10,My favourite movie,"I love the fact that this movie is interesting during all its development, and that has lots of action, battles, strategy, politics, and of course lightsaber combats. The best star wars without a doubt."
2051,9,Awesome!,From looking at the trailers I had a good idea that this film was going to be good. I had a distinct feeling that it would be better than the previous two movies but was not sure whether it could be in the same league as the original trilogy. However this instalment makes the cut.
2052,10,"The Force Will Be with Us All, Forever.","I'm a diligent StarWars fan since having watched ""Return of the Jedi"" for the first time ever, along with my family. I was barely three-years-old at that time, but the myths behind the saga utterly mesmerized me to indoctrinate myself with it: from watching the previous two episodes I went missing before I was born to buying all merchandise toys spawned by the unprecedented franchise that rocked the American Continent nearly 30 years ago, with such titanic proportions."
2053,7,Revenge of the Sith,Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequel Star Wars trilogy. The CGI is better in this film and so is the plot. The action is the best in this trilogy. The acting and chemistry is still a mixed bag. The film at times drags a bit and there are still times were the CGI is still not that great. Also I found Anakin's turn to the dark side very sudden and the reasons weren't the best in my opinion. Still it is enjoyable.
2054,10,"More than the sum of it's parts, the last film in an amazing saga!","OK so the acting and script is the ""sat morn matinee/50's melodrama"" style - it's meant to be, George admits that he isn't the best dialogue writer, and he had some help. But the style is one of his choosing. Let's get over it! This film rocks! The prequels aren't as high on the 'surface value' entertainment as the sequels, and Empire is the master film in the saga, but this does come so close for me."
2055,8,Anakin Eats the Cookies,Anakin officially takes to the Dark Side in this last movie of the prequel trilogy. This one had more emotional depth and story compared to Phantom Menace and Clones. A bit more violent with some truly horrible things happening as Anakin takes the final plunge and becomes Darth Vader.
2056,10,A must see movie,"After a poor start, Lucas seems to be back on track and at his finest. The attack of the clones was a well scripted and fine instalment for the star wars saga, however nothing had prepared me for the finale."
2057,1,"I wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't (Spoilers)",I have several complaints:
2058,9,"An Excellent Star Wars Movie, but..","This is an excellent conclusion to our experience of the Star Wars saga. It excels at everything that is expected of Star Wars, but unfortunately, the weaknesses remain. I'll go through my likes and dislikes The special effects are excellent (need we say), my only criticism is that at times they tend to be static, i.e. the effects are the background, rather than something the characters are a part of. Something that I think is not done enough is thinking how the effects can be made to feel a apart of the action, rather than background. The story itself is excellent, I have never had a problem with the plots, and I think this one really gives us a feeling for what went wrong with AS/DV. The Action is also really exciting, and an improvement on the last 2 where the powers displayed by the jedi left me feeling underwhelmed (that droid army on geonosis should have been turned into scrap metal by such a large collection of jedi in Ep2). "
2059,6,Decent Movie,"Saw it 7:50pm May 19, 2005"
2060,6,Explains a lot,Fun to watch. Very satisfyingly sets up a New Hope. Exciting to watch Anakin lose his damn mind.
2061,7,Disappointed,"Lucas had several different ways he could have gone with this story. What he chose, for me, was extremely disappointing and contradicting to his characters. For instance; Padme a very strong, independent, self reliant women from the moment we first met her in Episode 1. She was the leader of her planet and she was only a teenager for starters. In Attack of the Clones she fought along side all the Jedi's in the ""Arena"" and not only survived when some Jedi did not, but she was the one who freed herself, Obi-Wan and Anakin from the chains in the beginning of the ""Arena"" scene. Yet in Return of the Sith she dies but NOT due to medical problems during the birth of the twins, but as the medical bot states ""We are losing her, we don't know why. She has lost the will to live."" What?!? So basically she gives birth to 2 children and because her heart is broken she loses the will to live?!? Doesn't make any sense. Seems to me that the Padme we became to know and love would never abandon her children nor give up so easily in regards to Anakin. She would have had to be murdered/killed to tear her away from fighting for both her children and for Anakin. A better choice for Lucas as well as being much more believable is if she died either by accident and then Anakin blames Obi-Wan OR Sidious kills her and tells Anakin that it was Obi-Wan. It would have also given Anakin's fall to the Dark Side more credence."
2062,7,You can't HELP but be disappointed.,"I want to start off by saying that this is a GOOD movie. It's good, but it's not nearly as good as it could have/should have been."
2063,7,Is it good? Yes. Is it bad? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"The first time I saw this flick, I came out of the cinema with the same disappointment I felt after seeing Menace for the first time. But on the second viewing, I realised I had gone in to it with my expectations too high. Why, after the last two films that I think are basically Universally accepted as poo? Watch Sith with no expectations, as millions did with Hope all those years ago, and you'll love it as I now do. Of course it has its unforgivable moments, such as the now infamous Vader 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!', which sounds like a spoof from the Simpsons, and plot holes bigger than Lucas's neck, but who cares? I expect the 'NOOOOOOOOOOOO' will be altered for the DVD anyway. It has its big dramatic scenes that match any of those from the original trilogy, e.g Yoda fighting the Emperor, Palpatine telling Anakin about the Sith, Mace Windu being killed, Anakin VS Obi Wan (if a little shorter than promised), the Jedi purge, Anakin becoming Vader (except 'NOOOOOOOOO' of course); and it has its nice little moments such as R2 setting two battle droids on fire, Yoda nearly being shot and dropping his cane, The Emperor grinning sadistically as Vader struggles to come to terms with Padme's apparent death - just before going 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!' It also does something unusual for a Lucas directed film, it allows time in emotional scenes for you to feel those emotions, rather than quickly cutting away. For example, where Anakin stands alone, torn between doing what he's been told, or rescuing Palpatine from Windu in order to save Padme."
2064,10,My absolute favorite movie,The battle scenes are the greatest I've seen in any movie. The acting is great. And the storyline is incredible. The the scenes connect beautifully with all of the series and movies. Padme's final scene was a little weird.
2065,5,"Well, there's hope: Lucas might die and leave behind others able to do better.","""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" goes a long way toward proving two very important facts. The first is that creative genius, like lightning, seldom strikes twice in the same venue. The second is that inspiration, while certainly bettered with age in some, turns to rancid vinegar in others. In short: a sad and disappointing end to a sad and disappointing set of prequels. 1977's George Lucas once brought to us the finest that science fiction had to offer: a highly original and embracing tale loved by thousands if not millions from two generations, followed nicely in the next four years. Yet today's Lucas has managed to introduce the current generation to a malaise of theatrical regurgitation. Visual overstimulation worthy of a bad anime is weighed down by a tonnage-level dungheap of weak comedy and bad voiceovers, and enough CG to send anyone remembering the realism of actual sets and stop-motion photography into a coma. Its only saving graces are parts of its cast {whom Lucas still somehow manages to direct into sounding flat and hollow, lacking in chemistry, and occasionally being very badly-lit}, and the fact that its plot is somewhat better than its two prequel-cessors."
2066,10,The best movie of all time.,"It has excellent pacing, visual effects, character development, story evolution, acting, and choreography. Hayden Christensen's acting in this film os some of the best I have ever seen. The emotional final duel is amazing and always gets to you. You can almost see this downhill progression of Anakin's trust in the Jedi. That is always really cool to see play out on screen. The soundtrack is incredible, John Williams really did extra amazing this time. George Lucas' writing is as amazing, the dialogue, climax, and emotions of the characters were made so well. At the end of the film when Anakin gets put into Vader's armor for the first time is one of my favorite moments in cinema history. He then learns he was a pawn of Palpatine's game the whole time. It's just a perfect scene. From ""hello there"" to ""I have the high ground"" the countless amounts of iconic quotes are unmatched. Thanks George, Rick McCallum, Hayden Christiansen, Nick Gillard, and everyone else who made this spectacular film. May the force be with you, always."
2067,2,terrible,"I am a great fan of Star Wars, but Episode III is the worst movie of the whole series. Even if one considers, that Darth Vader must come into existence during this movie I never expected the story will be so ridiculous. I saw the move last year and since it was so bad, I stayed away of the movies up to today (May 2006). I just do not like to spent a lot of money for this kind of Hollywood trash. I disliked the killing of the jedi kids very much, even a bad guy should not be allowed to do such things in movies allowed for children aged 12+. Star Wars was a fairy tale before this episode, now it belongs more to the horror movie genre."
2068,10,the darkest and most intense in the series,"Everybody was curious about this ""key"" episode in the most famous S.F. series of all time. The big question was: ""How is Anakin turning into Vader ?"". After all, the whole ""saga"" was about a ""boy-genius"" that becomes fascinated by Darkness, and then returns into the Light. The final installment - ""Return of the Jedi"", is more about the return of Vader, than about his son - Luke, who was never really attracted by evil. So, as Francis Ford Coppola said when he visited the Film University in Bucharest, ""Episode III"" is like a Shakespearean tragedy"". The darkest and most intense film in the series can't top ""Jedi"", but comes second best. For some minutes I really had the impression that I was traveling back in the eighties, when big-time adventure films looked like this. Great acting in supporting roles, such as the formidable Ian McDiarmid, back in the scary make-up of the Emperor (which should of had that Oscar for make-up), Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu and Christopher Lee as Dooku (a count that sounds a lot like Dracula). Yoda is a great actor, as usual. As they were in the previous two episodes, the leading roles are poorly handled by the such of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen. These two are striving to keep up the appearances, but they are kind of ridiculous vis-a-vis the cast of the initial trilogy. It seems that Lucas couldn't get out of the young cast the performances that he got from the elder British masters - Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing, now joined by Lee. Anyway, Ewan and Hayden make a decent couple, as master and apprentice. The quarrels between the two are artificial, the same as the relationship between Anakin and Amidala. "
2069,8,A Huge step up from episodes 1 and 2,"After the annoying catastrophe that was Jar Jar Binks in episode 1 and the wooden acting and cheesy love story that was episode 2, I can honestly say that George Lucas has given what the original fans of the series have waited for all these years."
2070,7,Check your baggage at the door - this ain't Shakespeare,"I get the feeling that people's expectations of this movie are such that if Lucas didn't deliver anything short of ""Hamlet"" they were going to resentfully dig a very deep hole in the ground and toss him in. Personally, I think I finally realized something about these Star Wars movies: they are the cinematic equivalent of comic books. I don't mean this as an insult. It's just that it's hard for me to take some of the negative reviews I've read seriously - harder to take in fact than Anakin's ridiculous reasons for turning to the dark side, or the much-derided love scenes between Anakin and Padme, or, well, Anakin as a character in general. However, Anakin as comic book hero-come-villain? Post it on Ebay and I'll bid."
2071,8,"Enjoyable, fun, but not the best","*Light Spoilers* ROTS has the best title, action, and ""story"" of the new trilogy that the first two lacked. i must say, i really gave into this hype big time and even dressed up for opening night. afterwords, well, i was satisfied, confused, and a bit sad."
2072,,"Finally,this is what people want !","This is a masterpiece, better than episode 1:The Phantom Menace and episode 2:Attack Of The Clones. both movies quite lames,nothing special accepted Master Yoda scene,having a light-saber fight with Count Dooku(some people called him Count Dookie)."
2073,8,"A Competent and Visually Stunning Conclusion to the Star Wars Saga, but Still Flawed.","""A pile of CG-intensive scenes loosely tied together does not a great movie make"", as Yoda would say :) Sadly Lucas still hasn't learned this basic lesson. Many fans may have overlooked the shortcomings of this third installment of the prequel trilogy, simply because there are so much action and story elements packed into 2.5 hours that it's almost overwhelming. But I came away from the theater feeling flat, not being excited and invigorated like I felt when I saw the first trilogy. I think the problem is that Lucas has chosen to present the story in this movie (and the others in the prequel) in a matter-of-fact manner, without taking the time to set up the mood of a scene, or to streamline the transition between scenes. Lucas would do well to learn from his mentor Irvin Kershner (who directed Empire), who understands that sometimes little touches here and there can make huge differences in the impact of a scene. In fact one would have thought that such things should be elementary for every film school student, but perhaps Lucas dropped out or skipped class :) This movie suffers from the same basic flaws as the previous two installments: Flat story telling, wooden dialog, cringe-inducing ""romantic"" scenes, and to a lesser degree, a lack of tightness in binding the story elements together. This movie seems better than the other two only because there are so much going on on the screen that we don't have time to think about its flaws, but you'll realize it as you search your feelings after the movie ended :)"
2074,8,"Thought the movie was OK, and now some cons *spoiler*","One of my thoughts on the movie after watching it was why was it seemingly so easy to kill those jedi, at least one of whom I saw was on the jedi council with several clone troopers armed with rifles? The jedi we're obviously taken by surprise and from behind every time it seemed yet from what I know of Star Wars and after playing KOTOR I thought jedi we're trained for many years how would they all have not sensed the danger and reacted no matter the circumstance(s)?"
2075,6,The prequels in one movie,"This was it was all about. It helped if you saw Episode I, but really you could skip past the previous episodes and just watch this."
2076,9,Saving the best for last,"Firstly I've got to say the first two were disappointing, but that view is tainted by the imagery and larger than life characters of the originals (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi) I geared myself up for the sixth episode by going back and watching Phantom Menace & Attack of the Clone. The second time through was a much better experience. These two films stand alone and do a great job of foreshadowing Darth Vaders birth."
2077,10,Very Satisfying.,"(Minor Spoilers) The story behind Episode III is a story about a film with a ton of weight on it's shoulders. Fan's waited in suspense to see if the climactic prequel could effectively tell the most dramatic story in Star Wars, bring the excitement and wonder back in the series, have the best lightsaber fights ever, and ultimately save the entire Star Wars series. Did Episode III deliver? Could it overcome this burden? Yeah, pretty much."
2078,9,This film Rocks!,"George Lucas redeemed himself with this film, Although I have to admit as much as I didn't care for the first two films in the prequel trilogy, I liked the set ups that led to Episode 3."
2079,7,From a previous hardcore Star Wars fan,This is a showcase for effect makers. Bigtime. If I were to vote on the special effects alone it would be an easy 10.
2080,9,Execution so perfect it overcomes some unbelievable storyline.,"In a number of areas this is by far the best of the six films. Action: 10 out of 10. Non-stop, story moving, jaw dropping action. Special effects: 11 out of 10. The light-saber fights are perfectly executed, epic, stand up and clap awesome. The sets/scenes are gorgeous works of art with elegant, well thought out detail. These details that add to the realism are found throughout the movie. The character generations are a step above previous films. Yoda gets a 10, I think Yoda is as well done as Gollum in LOTR if not better. Variety: 10 out of 10. Numerous types of weapons, ships, life forms, robots, and even heroes and villains raise this film to a new level. General Vicious (spelling?): is as impressive and convincing as Darth Vader, except maybe his death after Obi discovers that all you have to do to kill him is shoot under the protective flap covering his vital organs (a serious design flaw for a killing machine)."
2081,10,Good Job George (Insert Applause Here),"First of all I am Really Happy with the way this movie turned out. Because after the first two which weren't as bad as some people claim them to be, not that they weren't without their flaws don't get me wrong .But I know their were a few parts that I would have changed but hey all in all I was reasonably satisfied with them , but I have to say that George pulled this one off entirely to my liking. As far as I'm concerned every aspect of the film from start to finish was masterfully crafted. All of the images, sounds, and characters were extremely capturing and brought me back to why I enjoyed Star Wars so much to begin with. As for the story, it really starts to bring allot of different pieces of the older movies together. Especially when you realize (for those of us who didn't read the books) how the entire republic became the empire. And in the midst of experiencing the film I couldn't help to see how well this Episode lays everything I already knew into place. Before I was looking at the republic commandos as friends to the Jedi and honorable warriors, but now I see them as I used to being Storm Troopers. This is why it was such a great experience all around bringing so many old things to light. So if you have ever been a fan, or have seen some of the older movies and liked them, then I urge you to get to your local theater as soon as you can and start to enjoy all that is Star Wars again and remember always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU"
2082,8,Trust can change one's side,"When i learned that Darth Vader was Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight, i asked my self why he had chosen the dark side? This third episode tells this story, tells why Anakin, the chosen one, turned to a Sith Lord. But i'm not convinced with the cause about Padme. The Jedi Council had never trusted Anakin and this situation had pushed Anakin to the dark side. If the Jedi Council had trusted Anakin may be he wouldn't have chosen the dark side. This episode was absolutely weaker than the other ones. Just telling why Anakin had changed and what happens him. The tragic point was death of Padme despite Anakin's tries to protect her from death she dies because of Anakin's side changing. This was a desperate chain, he knows Padme will die, changes his side to prevent her death but she dies because of this swap."
2083,7,the saga is complete,"Having lived with Star Wars all my life and loved virtually every minute of it, I was thrilled with Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith. It is a great Star Wars film. Absolutely great. The best of the prequels, though Episode 1 is still very close in my heart. Episode 3 is certainly the most emotional of the three prequels, very dark and tragic. My praise is high, the effects are superb, the music is great and the performances range from good to serviceable. My only tiff is with the DVD release, why were certain scenes omitted? I remember the film running over 2 and 1/2 hours in the theatre and suddenly on DVD its only 140 minutes long. Why George? Also the reaction shot of Anakin getting the mask laid on him has been changed. His initial reaction of fear, burned in my mind when I saw it on May 19th, is now more one of acceptance and want. Why does George feel the constant need to tinker? He even changed shots from the original trilogy, replacing the original actors with ian Macdiarmid and Hayden Christensen. Uncessecary. at Least with 4,5, and 6 we have the original verisons, but the DVD release of ""Sith"" is somewhat disappointingly different. Other than that its a fantastic movie and a great completion to the Star Wars saga."
2084,10,Powerful It Is,I couldn't speak for ages after the film due to the lump in my throat. What a POWERFUL film - knowing what happens just made the experience more incredible. There are not enough words to describe the feeling this film gives you. George Lucas did a fantastic job and I feel I have experienced cinema history.
2085,10,Best of the six if you ask me,"Lucas pulled it off pretty well I think. Considering he never thought he would make any movies after Episode IV, I think he tied this movie into the others the best way anyone could expect. The naysayers who are condemning him for the movie being PG-13 should just be quiet and go watch their favorite Disney movie. This is a dark story and I'm sure if Mr. Lucas wanted to he could have easily made it get an ""R"" rating. I think if the movie was written any other way it wouldn't have been believable. Although some of R2's heroics approach the fine line of believability, I enjoyed his moments nonetheless. I feel that if Lucas never does make another Star Wars movie we should be contented in how he completed his journey. Any Star Wars fan knows what happens in this movie, but it's the how and why that makes this chapter the best in my view."
2086,9,"One of the Better Ones, and Best Storytelling","I too was critical of Lucas' prequels, after all, how could you improve upon the originals; but after watching them again and taking my time with ""understanding"" what Lucas was trying to lay out as the foundation, I grew to enjoy ""some"" of the prequels (still can't stomach Jar Jar or young Anakin), and thoroughly enjoyed Revenge of the Sith. For much of the same reasons that TESB is my favorite of the original movies (seriousness, tragedy, and directing), ROTS is by far my favorite of the prequels, and sadly, includes The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens, which in my opinion didn't do anything for the franchise. The storytelling and direction in ROTS is top-notch and although people, I know, hate Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin, I feel he redeemed himself and brilliantly portrayed a flawed character who went selflessly down the wrong path for a noble reason, his love for Padme. That path, told throughout the three movies, is evident and painful through his transformation because of the unknown, to fear, and ultimately ending in anger and madness in ROTS. Could it have been a better movie, possibly, but as movie afficionados, don't we all wish our favorite movies had been better in some ways?<br /><br />I think ""fans"" have wrongly, unmercifully and unapologetically trashed this movie unnecessarily, IMHO, of course. Again, the best of the prequels and infinitely better than VII and VIII."
2087,9,Exaltingly dark,"The final star wars episode ""Revenge of the sith"" is mighty dark & undoubtedly the best of the prequels. We see how palpatine is successful on pulling anakin to his side away from the Jedi's, using anakin's rising fear of losing amidala. Of course Yoda's advice to anakin not to hold on to those he cares about isn't heeded as he slowly but surely slips into the force's dark side with flabbergasting consequences. We also get to see at last Darth sidious at work & there's a fantastic duel with Yoda near the end to show their skills matched against each other. The film tries to tie all the loose ends together, anakin's light saber which Luke gets a hold of in ""a new hope"", why was obi wan close to Luke, how were the Jedi's wiped out,which i hoped wouldve been more darker than it really was, how anakin is transformed into Darth Vader & why he wheezes all the time. I found that one question still mystified me,why or how did obi wan's body disappear when he was struck down by Vader in star wars 77 & how was he able to communicate later with Luke in episodes 5 & 6...qui gonn is mentioned by Yoda but how or what is never mentioned, nonetheless, i found this final ending of the saga to be quite dark, entertaining & beautifully made by Lucas considering Phantom Menace. Don't forget that star wars isn't a film for adults, its mainly a film for kids where adults can enjoy, Godfather it isn't!"
2088,8,Star Wars review (spoiler),"I had high expectations, and i was thus disappointed, but it wasn't too bad. My main gripe is that EVERYTHING WAS DIGITAL... well almost... Queen Amadala's chamber was all digital, most of the interior of the buildings were, all the exterior worlds were, etc. Same for C3PO, R2D2, and all the aliens and ships! Call me crazy, but I am in favor seeing real actors playing stormtroopers as opposed to some digital representation that looks awful when they show a human head! I loved the lightsaber fights, and the music was great as always. They have some memorable lines, but the main spaceship battle (the opening) didn't have the same engaging feeling as those of previous movies, and they used lines that are from the other movies as well. Every movie it seems Lucas made it more digital, starting with the Special Editions of the original three. They barely even need a director, considering most of the work was done via computer... It feels fake, and i don't feel like i'm part of the star wars universe like i did in the others. This movie is saved by the amazing lightsaber battles, the great visuals (when needed), and the superb acting by the few human actors (and yoda). If this wasn't a Star Wars movie, i'd give it a much lower rating. Another thing that i liked was the portrayal of the good vs evil, light vs dark side- Anakin's conversion was very engaging, and even though i knew what would happen, i found myself on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens. This movie and it's plot are a great adventure, and even though the digital approach hurts the movie, it is still a good movie that i will see again.. i recommend it, despite certain reasons, and i believe that the series went out on a high note, b/c this one was better than 1 and 2. 8/10"
2089,10,the best star wars movie,"loved start wars episodes I, II, and now III. But not the old ones. Episode III is best of star wars movies. My review is divide into these categories:"
2090,10,Awesome! Best of the last 3 for sure!,"It is impossible to rank all of the Star Wars stories.....so, don't even try! They all tell their own stories. However, I must say, that the 1st 3 movies (in order of release, not story line) were classically the best.....and the 1st 2 of the more recent release SUCKED ASS! I was embarrassed to say that I even liked Star Wars after those were released."
2091,10,It's wonderful,I just saw Revenge of the Sith and it's simply wonderful.
2092,10,I have no idea why people don't like this!,"See, I loved this movie. I thought that it was the best out of all of them...much better than episode 6 (only my opinion). I must say that I wasn't a fan until recently. My brother showed me the movies on Christmas one year and since then, I have LOVED all of them, so maybe my opinion is not worth more than a ""true"" fan-aka one who saw the originals in the theater and all. But let me say-this movie ROCKED!!! First off, those action scenes were fabulous. Lucas tops any director in the area of special effects-no doubt. Always has, always will. But it's not just that. True, once in a while, there was a moment of bad acting or cheesy dialogue, but the movie wouldn't be a Star Wars movie without that. And the wipes, as ""annoying"" as they were, also made the style of the Star Wars movie. It made a tie between the old and the new. And speaking of ties, everything in ROTS made perfect sense to go into A New Hope. *SEMI-SPOILER* When Obi-Wan picks up Anakin's lightsaber at the end, I almost screamed, because I had suddenly remembered that Luke got his father's lightsaber from Obi-Wan. This movie was poignant in all aspects. It created a sense of longing to change the series, which all true tragedies do. At points, you laughed, you cried (I almost started sobbing in one sequence, but I won't say which one...) you cheered and you begged for one little thing to change. When I left this movie, I wished that it didn't have to end this way-and then I remembered that it didn't. Make sure you have episodes IV-VI with you after this movie. You're going to need to watch them. I don't truly understand why people don't like this movie. For me, it was the perfect ending to a saga 28 years in the making..."
2093,9,"Despite its flaws, I did love it.",I was a huge critic of Episode I and II because I loved the original trilogy so much and I really felt like George Lucas was just phoning it in.
2094,10,The Saga Comes Full Circle,"Warning:Possible Spoiler I have just been to the premiere of Star WarsEpisode III: Revenge of The Sith. It came a few hours ahead of the world premiere here in the Philippines and I must say it was well worth the wait. The fans were everywhere and people clapped as the green LucasFilm Ltd. logo flashed on the screen and you knew in a few seconds that famous soundtrack of John Williams would herald the famous introduction sequence that dazzled an entire generation and left a cult following that would be studied for generations. George Lucas really came out with the chapter that would end all chapters with this final installment. A lot of questions have been answered that were left obtuse or to the imagination in the sequels (episodes IV,V,VI). I felt again the child in me that I thought was lost by my adulthood as i hummed to the famous sound of saber battles that were nothing short of excellent. This really is the darkest of all the episodes as we witness the seduction of Anakin Skywalker to the Dark side & transform to become the Sith lord Darth Vader in all his glory. The sad demise of many in the Jedi order and the rise of the evil galactic empire. Star Wars fans get ready for the ultimate chapter. May the force be with you."
2095,9,"Have to say, Lucas did us proud this time....","loved it I hated the original two, what with McGregor's appalling accent... and Haydens awful lines... however, have to say, only just watched the 3rd one on DVD this afternoon, and have to say, had a lump in my throat... got abit emotional there when Anakin switched to the dark side... awesome stuff when you finally see him suited up as Darth..."
2096,8,The only good prequel.,"So, Episode I was mediocre, Episode II was cringeworthy, and this one... was actually good."
2097,9,When Vader Was Born,Here comes another Star Wars prequel. I didn't expect much then heard all of these good reviews on this film so I had to go see it. I'm not really that big of a star wars fans. I mean I watch the movies but I don't go to any conventions. 
2098,8,a good film but Palatine has lost his evil side,"Episode III depicted Anakin's final descent to the dark side, the culmination of Palpatine's plans for the previous two films (maybe not the intended plot of the film but I think Palpatine is the best character of the Original and Prequel series)"
2099,7,"Not bad, but there is no room to beat the originals...","It was not too bad, I suppose. I gave it a 7 out of 10 merely because I am a Star Wars fan, and I didn't have the heart to give it anything lower. The CGI, of course is excellent. I would say the acting was terrible, but that isn't quite fair. I know Ewan McGregor, and probably the rest of the cast, are good actors, but it's hard to make it seem that way when you are given cheesy dialogue to work with. I know this has probably been said a lot, but it can not beat the originals. I think it is still worth seeing, though. It is pretty much enjoyable, and I had a good time. Plus, you might as well, it's the last time you will have to go see one."
2100,4,Nice Try But No Brass Ring,"After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure. Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great. Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great. We bonded with each and every one. Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Mark Hammel, and most of all Sir Alec Guiness made the magic happen. I guess it's the IL' story of seeing the forest for the trees. "
2101,10,The home stretch.,"After watching Attack on the Clones, I was even more excited about the prospect of a third Star Wars movie coming out so when I went to see The Incredibles in November of 2004, I saw a short teaser for the final chapter of George Lucas's prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode 3, Revenge of The Sith. After seeing the trailer, I was over the moon, I was so pumped to see this movie and it was all I could think about for the next few months so once May 2005 came, my dad and I went to see the film and after 2 hours, I walked out of my local movie theater in awe of what I had just watched. Once the film came out on DVD later that year, my brother and I got the movie for Christmas and over the next few years, we watched it quite a few times. However, as I grew older and began to see the prequels in a different light, I came to see Revenge of The Sith as the only great film out of the entire prequel trilogy but in preparation for seeing Episode 9 later this year, I decided to rewatch it and lo and behold, I actually still think that despite a quite a few glaring problems, Revenge of The Sith is the best film in the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy due to it's actual effort to tell a great story rather than just be a bore fest like Attack of The Clones and Phantom Menace."
2102,3,Slight Improvement... But not much...,"Alright, Episode 3 of the new star wars trilogy."
2103,8,Lucas has fulfilled his saga..,MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS
2104,10,Underrated Masterpiece,"Star Wars Episode III is the ultimate climax of the prequel trilogy and a perfect one at that. The way the story is told and the way Order 66 is executed (pun intended) is perfect. You have this feeling like someone has torn a piece of you out of your body as every Jedi is cut down one by one. The music, the set pieces, the acting, it's all perfect in this movie. From the somber and horrific Order 66 to the heartbreaking battle between Obi-wan and Anakin, this is an example of George Lucas' best. This will forever live as a classic in my eyes, just like the original trilogy that started it all. I will always cry when Obi-wan says his last words before leaving Anakin on Mustafar."
2105,8,Back to what made it great,"George Lucas returned to the style that made the original Star Wars trilogy so memorable. The significance of the original trilogy was its use of implementing aspects of historical films. This is abundantly seen in ""A New Hope"" with its parallel of Samurai films and classic westerns. The second installment, ""Empire Strikes Back,"" is full of this form of homage as well; even paying homage to detective noir classics with Luke's search through Cloud City for his comrades. While this aspect has been missing from the two previous films of the prequel series it returns in this latest installment. George Lucas pays homage to classic romances with cuts from Anakin to Padme showing what love has done to each of them and reminding the viewer of what classic romance films continually did: love is hell. The homage continues when Lucas places Obi-Wan on a lizard-like beast reminding us of classic ""prehistoric serials"" even the music accompanying the scene has a ""Land of the Lost"" type of feel. And lest even the dimmest of viewers missed it, who could not appreciate the homage paid to Frankenstein in the scene introducing Darth Vader to the universe. Thanks for all of the great memories in these terrific trilogies George."
2106,10,The best movie of the year,"""Star Wars 3"" is absolutely a well crafted masterpiece from George Lucas. Although you might find the dialogue stupid at times, it sure does not put the film down either way because of all those light saber fights, great beginning, awesome battle scenes, Ian McDiarmid's magnetic performance as the Emperor, and the answer to all your questions of the other ""Star Wars"" films. This ""Star Wars"" film is passionate. I recommend it to all ""Star Wars"" fans and people who have not been into ""Star Wars."""
2107,7,What's all the rave about?,"This final installment to the prequels is probably, and at most, slightly better then the last two in terms of the story. The romance is still.... well, very conservative and mundane. I thought the dialogues at times, seemed to jump ahead, making it quite choppy. And the speed at which Anakin accept Palpatine's offer seems to be quite illogical. May be it is to speed up the progression of the film."
2108,8,One of the best in the series,"For me this is my favourite star wars film tie with empire strikes back. Sure there is a few corny lines and acting but the film is actually very interesting and the plot makes sense unlike the previous two. No spoilers but the second half of the film really captured me and actually hit me, very well made movie Lucas!"
2109,9,The Force is with us!,"Revenge of the Sith, which I will hereon refer to as ROTS, certainly had a lot to live up especially since nobody seemed to like the first to prequels (they weren't on par with the originals, but still great movies). Did it deliver? Long story short: yeah, and with a nasty punch too."
2110,1,bad acting,"i think by far, by very very far, this movie has the WORST acting ever in a star wars movie, the best CGI of course amazing cgi in all the scenes but the worst acting, every scene got worse, i wonder how much they got paid.. i really despised the indifference, and seemingly hurried, RUSHED acting, if you will. that Hayden Christensen is a real mess up, and the others were a horrible mixture of semi-English, semi-Californian-southern, ""copy-paste"" of tastelessness. you'd think he would have worked on the linguistic portion a little more, it was a joke. what a waste of cinema ticket money. if i were you i would either wait for the massive flow of dvds that will happen sooner than later, or just defy Homeland Security and download it, or do yourself a favor, don't watch it at all."
2111,9,"A Modern Tragedy--chilling, sad...and wonderful","**********No spoilers whatsoever********** I simply don't understand how anyone can give it a 1 out of 10 stars. For me this film was excellent. Sure it wasn't perfect, but few movies are. To put things in perspective I have seen all of the Star Wars films in the theater. I loved IV V and VI, and of course thought V was by far the best of the three. I loved VI but had trouble with the Ewoks. It was the triumph over the Dark Side but did lack a little something in places."
2112,7,A great conclusion,"Just coming back from Revenge Of The Sith, i am sad to say its over, but the new film has a lot going for it. It was a roller-coaster ride. It matches up with Return Of The Jedi, i will have to see it again to find out if its indeed better."
2113,9,This makes up for the previous two,When I was going to see this film I was worried that I was again going to be disappointed. I can happily say that this is not the case.
2114,7,This is star wars,"The best episode in the prequel series by far in which it seems that George has taken all the criticism levied against the previous films and rectified them in this entry. From the action to the music to even the story, the film improves on every aspect of the previous entries and quite wonderfully concludes the trilogy which fits in smoothly into the original films. This is what star wars is about."
2115,10,Best movie EVER! (Maybe spoiler),"This movie is the best movie in the whole wide world! It's just such a powerful movie! It starts off with Action the first 20 minutes! And you see a little bit of the Clone Wars etc. It 5 Lightsaber battles in the movie! You can't be bored while you watch it! That's just impossible! Battle of The Hereoes(The battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin at the end of the movie) is the best thing on a movie ever! The best sequence EVER! Watch the movie! It's the best EVER! George Lucas(The creator of the Star Wars Saga) is the best director and writer IMO! The way he tells the story is like.. Mind blowing! I will never see a movie so great as this one! The special effects is just pure awesome! Never seen anything like it! It looks so REAL.. Dose not look like CGI or whatever.. This movie made me love Star Wars even more than I did before! And I loved Star Wars much before I saw this movie! Ian McDirmad plays the role of the Emperor aka. Darth Sidous very very very VERY good! He's the best actor in Star Wars! The way he talks to Anakin is just.. WOW.. I can't describe it! Ewan McGreoger who plays the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, plays him very very good to. He kind off reminds you of Alec Guiness in the IV,V and VI. And that's good! ;) Very good.. If I were you I would see this movie.. NOW.."
2116,6,Finally!,"Wow I really liked this movie. A highly entertaining return to a pretty decent story and good characters. Episodes I & II are rendered totally useless (as if they weren't already) by this installment. After you see this, you'll be left a little sad because of that fact. There was absolutely Zero learned from those movies, and absolutely Zero added to the mystique of the series. Really a shame, those two."
2117,7,The one we all have been waiting for....,"The third installment of the prequel trilogy, showing Anikins decent into the dark side of the force."
2118,8,"Star Wars, at its worse or its best?",The Stars:
2119,9,Simply Amazing.....,"At the end of Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader redeems himself for the horrible crimes he committed in the previous two films. In a way, Lucas himself does the same in this final installment. For all of us who endured the cinematic atrocities of Episodes I and II, we finally witness Lucas's return to what made Star Wars so great."
2120,10,The best of the Prequels,"It is impossible to judge this film on it's own. One has to have seen the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones to really appreciate the Fall of Anakin Skywalker. And even though (most of us) know how the film is going to end, we still really feel for Anakin as he makes the wrong choices but for the right reasons."
2121,9,"Resonating with today's politics, powerful and sad","This Star Wars chapter is different from all of the others. By far the best of the most recent three episodes, ""Sith"" is entertaining, powerful and heartbreaking."
2122,7,I Have Changed My Mind,"I really didn't like this movie the first time I saw it. I thought it was badly acted and boring. But now I've watched it again, after watching the first two films in a row, and I have to say, this one is the best."
2123,7,"Very Good Looking, But Not Great","The first half hour or so is one solid video game - all sound and fury, signifying very little. It gets a little more interesting in the quieter moments, until an awkward Lucas line hits, or Hayden Christiansen looks more uncomfortable than dangerous. The effects are great, but because there so many special effects it seems like overkill after a while."
2124,10,Star Wars Episode 3 need I say more???,"WOW! I waited 3 hours in line to see the midnight showing of this movie but it was worth it. The special effects are the amazing and the 150 million dollar budget was definitely put to use. In every scene is at least 50% CG which creates many stunning shots. it followed the starwars 1,2 formula opening with a bit of comedy then delivering some very cool action, but at the same time it took it so much further. Instead of having just 1 really cool battle between major characters there was a astounding 5 with all the major characters and 1 new one. George Lucas did a good job in bringing episode 2 and episode 4 together leaving nothing unsettled. The only thing that I didn't like was a few love scenes where bad dialog and bad acting took over but it wasn't enough to ruin the film in anyways. I give this movie a 9.75/10.0 Also for all you parents who might be worried about the PG-13 rating if you would let your child see The Alamo or or watch CSI then you have nothing to worry about."
2125,8,The best prequel but still has problems,"I love revenge of the sith, it's easily the best of the prequel Star Wars trilogy and there's a lot to like about this movie because it's a good Star Wars movie. The cast is really good and all of members of the cast give great performances. The fight scenes and the action scenes are all well shot and well performed. The music from John Williams is great as always. There is some really emotional scenes and a couple gut punching scenes in this movie. The ending of each character arc is great and well executed. The story is also very well executed. But sadly revenge of the sith still has problems. Anakin and padmes love story is still awful and not well made, yes it's not a huge part of this movie but it's still in there. There is some really poorly written dialog just like in attack of the clones. The first act is sadly all over the place and it's hard to follow what the story is until the 2nd act when the story really starts to shine. Overall, revenge of the sith is the best of the prequel trilogy and yes this is a good Star Wars movie, but the cons do hold back this movie from being great."
2126,10,The Greatest movie of all time,Star Wars III is to me the best movie I have ever seen. The acting. The music. The scenes regardless of the computer generated scenes. Has all the fun and adventure you need in a picture Hayden Christensen is excellent. Natalie Portman is very beautiful and turns in a great performance. George Lucas is a great man with vision. When I first saw Star Wars back in 1977. You wouldn't imagine if this movie would have grown to what it is today. A mega giant. I will never forget the star War story. Its really sad now it comes to an end. Thank You George Lucas for giving me a really good outlet to watch. Thank you to all the characters who played in the series.
2127,3,Poor,This was a real waste of my time. It was too violent for a child to see and to simplistic for an adult to be entertained. The women were just well dressed mannequins with little or nothing to add to the script.
2128,10,The best of the last Star Wars,Finally the long awaited Episode 3. I saw it yesterday in a George Lucas approved digital Cinema in Almere (The Netherlands) The movie overwhelmed me and lived up to all the expectations I had.
2129,6,Is it as good as the original trilogy? No. But it is the film we've been waiting for,"When you think Star Wars, many words come to mind. ""Epic,""""imaginative,"" and, ""KICK-@$$!!!!"" The prequels didn't quite match up to these standards. George Lucas is one of the director's who was once among the best of the best, but he has become overly commercial in recent years. Phantom Menace tried to appeal more to children than the people who actually understand the philosophy and sophisticated qualities of the originals. Jar-Jar Binks is loathed by all smart people, but young children enjoyed him. In Episode II, Lucas tried to present a more mature vision, adding in romance and upping the scale of the battles, but although the battles were quite good, the romance was executed quite terribly. He seemed to have read a couple of bad romance novels just so he could figure out how to write dialogue. It's quite amazing that he managed to waist such great talent with his dialogue in the prequels: Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and Natalie Portman, usually very fine actors (and actress) but not so great here."
2130,5,Great CGI  but otherwise disappointing,"Hmmm tricky one! The CGI and action are everything you would expect from the latest  and final  installment of the Star Wars series, but that's about where the praise ends. The storyline would have been better as a half-hour TV show rather than dragging it out over the full length of a full feature film, as there just isn't enough substance to keep your attention. Hayden Christensen is awfully wooden as Anakin Skywalker. When he is still a good guy, he doesn't provoke any reaction from the viewer, and even at the end, in spite of the fact that he becomes the evil Darth Vader, and commits some fairly hideous acts, he still doesn't make me want to hate him. Coupled with these disappointments, is the fact that George Lucas has said that this is the final installment, even though I am old enough to remember, when the original Star Wars film was released in the late 70s, that it was then described as the first of NINE films. What happened to the last three?"
2131,10,So whats the point on hating the prequels because They are the main thing of What brought us Darth Vader and Luke,First I got to say is I love episode 3 its much better then the first 2 movies put together. Put I do still love the episodes 1 and 2 a lot. I think George had a great idea for making the series a huge hit. Put why are people hating the prequels so much come on get over with it prequels derve another chance they are not as bad as what they think it out to be.As a huge Star wars fan I wanted to watch episode 1 and 4 to 6 and I loved them but being little confused with before episode 1 to 4 I brought episode 2 and 3 to find out who this little boy became the most bad ass villain and how we get Luke. Star wars episode 3 with out adat is a great movie its wrath seeing. so if you don't like episodes 1 and 2 then skip them and go to this one instead. it was also nice to see episode 1 in 3D it felt like a different movie. 10 out of 10.
2132,10,Best of the Bunch? Or is it too soon to judge?,"Star Wars is the best. Empire Strikes Back is the best over all or at least I use to think that and perhaps down the road I will continue to think that but I have to say I really liked the last Star Wars. In fact I love it. I keep on watching it in on DVD and every time I do I can tune out the rest of the world. Very few movies I can actually do that with. Since I could remember my favorite movie has always been Empire Strikes Back and it has had a lot of competition over the years (Willow, Back to the Future, Batman, Untouchabels, Braveheart, Dick Tracy, Lord of the Rings.) And as much as I have raved about these other films that I love they could not replace that special little place in my movie lovers heart where the Empire reigns. (Valiant heroes going through an onslaught of trials and perils, fighting back a relentless and enormous enemy, but now with Sith we can see how the enemy first took power over people and the world's they live in and it is brilliant.) I think over all Revenge of the Sith will fall just beneath Empire but it is just a step below it. Sith is everything I hoped it would be and I give it a 10."
2133,9,Sith can happen!!!!,"This is the Star Wars movie to end them all . I put this one up there right next to Empire strikes Back. George definitely save the best for last. The acting was top notch. Yoda is the man. I must applaud Hayden for his performance as a turned to the darkside Anakin. The fierce ness of his eyes make s the character's agony come forward. Its not the action that makes Sith work but the story. Palpatine is the puppet master of all that transpires. Ian should get a award for greatest villain. It is scary to see is mood change from settle to pure evil. You really feel sorry for Padme , Obi and Yoda . Man I think Star Wars fans will blown away by this one. Mr. Lucas we thank you for your mastery of great story telling. It will sad to Stars Wars leave the big screen. Maybe this will open up the door way to the small screen and if so Lucas has to do the pilot . So fans lets enjoy this film and keep the hope of future Star Wars projects alive."
2134,8,Makes up for the first two episodes,Revenge of the Sith was an all-around good film. I enjoyed The Phantom Menace and The Attack of the Clones even though I knew they were horrible for many reasons. But this movie definitely makes up for the first two and happily links this trilogy to the original Star Wars.
2135,9,More fun than you can shake a lighsaber at...,"What do we want from this movie? Lots of lightsaber action? The mother of all duels between Anakin and Obi Wan? Jedi Slaughter? Palpatine being really, really evil? Numerous references to the other movies? Unsurpassed space battles? Yes? Then we should all be very happy indeed with 'Revenge of the Sith'. I've been waiting for over 25 years for this movie, the events in it have been hinted at and discussed for decades - and now we finally get to see them. And, man, are they good!! George Lucas has made a movie that should please everyone without a stick up their ass!! of course, there will be those who comment on the acting, the Dialogue etc - to them I say ""get a life"". This movie is about fast and furious storytelling, visual overload, pleasing the legions of fans and providing us with a damn good time. It succeeds at all of these admirably. The satisfaction of seeing the creation of Darth Vader is immense and anyone who has followed the series will be very happy indeed with what they get. I just want to say that I went to this movie to have a good time, and I did, along with the hundreds of others in the audience. The force is indeed with Mr Lucas on this one."
2136,8,Solid conclusion that hurtles towards the beginning.,"After the disappointments of the first two prequels , at last there is a conclusion to the saga that Star Wars fans can be proud of. Cynics should make no mistake, a finer installment of Star Wars there hasn't been since The Empire Strikes Back. It would appear that George Lucas has paid heed to the criticisms leveled at his earlier installments and for the most part, corrected his errors. The irritating and Disneyesque characters such as Jar Jar Binks are relegated to virtual anonymity, overly complicated tales of political intrigue are done away with entirely. What we are ultimately left with is the greatest tragedy in the Star Wars franchise, driven by spectacular, if sometimes superfluous action and a well executed narrative that given the circumstances could have gone so wrong."
2137,1,Lucas lost his damn mind.,"This movie was crap. Complete and total crap. Fans are just reaching for anything to cling to in order to justify being fans. Now, I can't watch 4, 5, and 6 without seeing that douche bag underneath the Vader mask. Dialogue was idiotic, stating things that were obvious if you have eyes. ""This elevator isn't working."" Yeah, we know. You know how we know? It's because you pressed the button and nothing happened. ""I saw you arrive in your ship."" No kidding. Is that because we all saw you staring out the window as the ship pulled up and docked? The stating of the obvious and the general lack of a story at all made this almost completely unwatchable. And the stuff that was put in just in order to tie up loose ends. ""Do the mandatory memory wipe on the droids."" Come on guys. I know that you loved the originals, but don't lie to yourself. These three prequels were all crap."
2138,8,Great !,The latest Star Wars film is without a doubt the best of the three newer films and a great film on it's own. It has none of the childish elements of Phantom Meanace and the story is far more engaging than Attack of the Clones.
2139,5,"this singlehandly caused a war? yes, between my sexuality and my homosexuality","This is the third movie in the star wars prequel trilogy and it doesn't dissapoint? i was really upset when R4 met his tragic end during the battle at the begining and how quickly obiwan discarded him. it truly felt like the biggest betrayal in the whole movie. and oh right anininikin betrays everyone i nearly forgot about that.<br /><br />anyways i can safely say for sure that i do swing that way because ewan mcgregor aged really well in this movie hahaha :) i thought the action scenes were really awesome i liked the part where general grieves turned into a bug it really took me off guard haha, it was also interesting when it was revealed that there was another clone army but this time of chewbacka all living on kashykk, but the abundance of clones brings a glaring problem to light. why can we make millions of clone units, space ship,s and droids, buyt not save senator padthai from dying of depression? like why did they not give her antidepressents? its not that hard, just stop having space sadness :) im looking forward to future installments of this series even though this one ended up falling flat, perhaps we will see luke and leia against as protagonists? interdosting concept. cheers :) haha"
2140,7,"Better, but not as good the first three","This movie had a lot to live up to and while an improvement over the first two it in this trilogy it would not be a great movie if it stood alone. I found myself wondering what uncaring person had written the stilted love scenes. I saw no reason for these two people to like each other nor any real emotion between them. Skywalkers descent into the dark side was a series of missteps by an extremely gullible fool and rather then feel sorry for him I thought he was massively foolish and naive. It was a good try but the acting was lacking, even the usually very good Ewen Mcgregor, and character development was poor. The movie was fast paced and entertaining but don't expect anything more."
2141,10,It was filmed very well to match episode 4,I really enjoyed this movie I liked that part watching how Darth Vader was formed ya it was made really good o ya and plus it was kinda terrible watching skulker being in terrible pain when Obione cut his legs of that he got all burnt up o ya a lot of terrible things happened in this movie one thing I still didn't get is why Anekin agreed to join senator he should'E just stayed on good Side I guess he wanted more power. o ya n also I didn't think Padme would die like that it was terrible watching her die another thing that was terrible is when Anekin destroyed all the Jedi even young children ya but the movie was made good I like new ones better than old ones its much much better.
2142,10,"The Last Star Wars ""Movie""","Prequels has bad and good sides, at least they have sides. They aren't fairytales like the new sequels. I can't understand why their ratings lower than these garbage."
2143,8,"Good, if taken in the right light.",I found this film to be a good film indeed. It's main flaw was the awful dialogue and acting on the part of Hayden Christanesen (spelling?).
2144,10,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the best of all star wars movies. The powerful Jedi-knight Anakin Skywalker leaves The Jedi Council en joins the evil Darth Sidious. He is a sith lord and want to kill all Jedi master, especially his nemesis master Yoda. The only sad thing about the film is that Anakin turns to the dark side. Great film, especially the picture quality. It is the second film, after Star Wars 2 Attack of the Clones that is digitally recorded. I purchased the DVD and the picure quality is stunning. The best thing about the film is that the action is breathtaking. I can recommend this film to any moviefan. It's a shame if you don't find this movie a masterpiece. Praise George Lucas."
2145,2,The worst one yet,"ALL I CAN SAY IS...G. Lucas better hire new writers. This movie was boring and drawn out - some good action scenes but could have been shorter. Horrible acting (and I like these actors) - even worse writing. I actually felt sorry for the actors who had to try and say these pathetic lines - especially N. Portman - there was almost no reason for here to be on screen. I LOVE the original ""old"" Star Wars - these last ones can't even compare. Sorry, but - I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this film."
2146,10,George... let's be friends again.,STAR WARS - EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH
2147,8,"Flawed, but it's the best of the prequel trilogy.","Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith sees Anakin (Christensen) being consumed by darkness, his wife Padme (Portman) grows fearful of him and Ob-Wan (McGregor) must take action to stop him."
2148,8,"Not quite what the first three were, but better than the last two and as such an adequate closer to the Star Wars trilogy","As the final installment in the Star Wars trilogy, I at least expected Revenge of the Sith to be better than Episodes I and II, both of which are, in my mind anyway, an insult to the Star Wars name. In this regard, I wasn't disappointed, but it still doesn't even come close to matching Episodes 4,5 and 6. Still, by normal movie standards, Revenge of the Sith is pretty good and has only a few real flaws. As such, it is an adequate closer to the Star Wars trilogy."
2149,7,The redemption of the prequels.,This movie saved the prequel trilogy after a disastrous 2nd episode.
2150,7,Not as good as I was told!,"Well I recently went to see episode III and I must say I was miss lead, First I was told that Qui-Gin Jinn(Liam Nelson) would be making an appearance in the movie but it wasn't in the theater that I went oh no you had to go to a digital theater and the closest for me is about three hours away in Chicago, what a rip off. from What I have been told there is ten extra minutes, ten can you believe it, now I will have to wait until Christmas time to see ten minutes that might have made the movie a better experience. and another thing what is this I am hearing that on the DVD are going top be at least 6 deleted scenes, they would have probably would have given the movie a little more sense, now if there are any of you out there thinking about reading the book I am warning you know it is missing several scenes that in the movie, but the book as the scenes that will most likely appear on the deleted scenes and I know that there be many who thinks What I am saying s harsh but this is nice compared to what I saw, and didn't get to see because Lucas want those ten extra minutes to be scene in a digital theater. I must say one other thing if you are going to see I recommend a digital theater if you can find one other wise you will miss out on some pivotal scenes lucky I will soon be near a digital theater to see the movie how it was meant ot be scene by the director."
2151,10,watched it as a 6 year old in 2005,"It is in no doubt a top tier Star Wars film, still stuck with me after 17 years. This film was my childhood and after it came out - I was dead obsessed with all things Star Wars. The musical score by John Williams, especially at the end credits was spectacular and beautifully nostalgic."
2152,8,The day the saga died.....,"Having seen the travesties that were Episodes 1 and 2, i was somewhat sceptical about seeing Revenge of the Sith. But in true fan boy style, i was there at midnight on opening night, ticket in hand, ready to say goodbye to the best saga ever to grace our screens."
2153,3,I've Given it as many chances as I can!!!!!,"OK folks here it is, i've seen this movie three times now. The first time I was one of the people who waited in line and viewed the midnight showing , i left the theater thinking one thing.....I STOOD IN LINE SEVEN HOURS FOR THAT FESTERING TURD OF A MOVIE....Now i went to see this film with a large group of folks, around 30 people, and they all loved it. So i thought to myself well maybe you missed something maybe your just really sleepy and were not able to enjoy the movie for that reason. So the next Day i took my folks to check the film out(my dad being a huge fan of the original) i sat through it wide eyed waiting to move to the edge of my seat, two hours and twenty minutes later i realized the horrid mistake i had made. I left the theater ready to hear my father say what a piece it was....and as we exit he mumbles one word ""incedible""...I stopped looked at him and said ""so you liked it eh?"" he responded with how amazing the effects were and how it tied everything together so well and flowed smoothly throughout the movie. I at this point got a case of the mini vomits that can normally only be done to me with strong drinks. So i went home still wondering how i was the one person who didn't like this movie. One more time just one more i thought to myself, OK what can it hurt. This time i went and watched the movie not trying to enjoy rather to rate it ....now i have come to this list, i call it the make this movie not suck list. These are little changes i would have made to make this movie not suck."
2154,9,Glad to be a Star Wars fan again,"OK, I am sure that there will be lots of people talking about it. I will just throw my 2 cents in. This movie was very dark, with little comic relief. After the disappointment of the first movie, along with the lack of real appeal from Episode 2, George had to really come up with something special to make 3 magic. And he succeeded. Very enjoyable, tons of fun, a very dark movie that is worth the time. Definitely one to see in the theatre, the effects will blow you away (even in this digitally overloaded era). The sound is amazing, and the story and acting were very well done."
2155,7,Darth needs psychoanalysis,"Best of the ""new"" trilogy."
2156,7,"Flaws there are, but a good film this is........","I have just got back from seeing Revenge Of The Sith.. I Liked it a lot BUT! Bad news first... I have spoiled myself crazy when it comes to this film, and there are now some spoiler reports I wish I hadn't read because the scenes didn't have certain things that I was expecting to see in them. I thought the pace of this film was FAR to Fast, maybe its because this was the first time I've seen this film but It was like George just said here this is 30 years of my life thats it its done. Scenes were cut to quickly, for Example, When Anikan kills Dooku, there isn't enough of Sidious goading him on like he did with Luke, and there was nothing about the rise of the rebellion in this film. I wished that the Scene when Anikan is slaughtering the Jedi was all one scene. I wish that Order 66 would have been portrayed a bit slower, I wanted more in certain scenes and The Cutting and the wiping just wrapped a scene up to quickly, although thats the way it has been in all Star Wars movies. Things came one after the other and we didn't have time to catch our breaths!! I wish George had not been such a harsh editor with this film. I didn't like the fact the Qui-gon scene got taken out, I thought it was needed to explain a few things. I thought there should have been a bit more of Anikan being excited about the fact he was going to become a father, I wished it had more emotion in it over all. I thought the scene after Vader rises, when he screams ""NOOOO"" was good just I didn't like the circle Wipe that was bad and I thought there would have been more stuff to destroy, and Sidious cackling in the background, I wish that George had not gone with so many Wipes in this film, I guess I should not loose heart though, the DVD will be out soon, and with repeated viewings I will get used to all of the super quick pacing and HOPEFULLY there will be things added in to the DVD that will make it extended or something like that. The crowd I went with sucked, I was one of the first in line, the crowd laughed at some moments like when R2 banged in to the wall, that was funny, and when Yoda took out the red guards, but there was no reaction, NONE to the key ""Epic moments"" in this film. like when Sidious named Anikan and there was no ""ohhh"" or anything when Anikan choked Padme."
2157,7,An enjoyable ending to the Star Wars Franchise,"So Star Wars has come full circle, with this final instalment of the Star Wars saga, Anakin's final transformation into the Dark Lord, Darth Vader. Much like Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith has some very good acting from the main characters and really does capture the emotions of our heroes as they turn against one another in a daring battle between good verses evil. However, many scenes are rather spontaneous and for the uninitiated, the opening scene of the massive battle above Coruscant is explained in the 2003 Cartoon Series, Star Wars the Clone Wars, where the final 3 or 4 episodes cover the story involving the battle and the capture of Chancellor Palpatine by the Droid Leader General Grievous."
2158,8,Getting Back On Track.,"Completing the roundabout of what many could still consider a stunningly bad trilogy, is Revenge of the Sith. Oddly, my feelings about this one are a bit volatile, simply because it's my favorite Star Wars movie. Ever. That's not saying much in terms of the rest of this trilogy and Disney's failure of a trilogy, but the OG trilogy? Well, to be perfectly honest I've never vibed with the original trilogy that well. I can accept they are wonderful movies, and all better than this one for sure, I can't call any my favorites because this one is still very special to me. The acting finally shines through for most of the cast, although there are still spots where you can tell the dialogue is no better than it was in Phantom Menace (calling back to ""don't make me kill you"" now) it's a lot more bearable this time around because I can finally say the soundtrack brings the A-game in a movie which can actually keep up with it. Of course, I never mentioned John Williams in my other reviews of the prequels, mostly because the soundtracks of those more often than not overshadowed their respective movies. In this movie though, it feels like there is a tangible connect between the composer and the film itself, notably the Order 66 scene, heightened through its already great 'show don't tell' outline, but made into the most memorable moment in Star Wars history with the theme that accompanies it. It's haunting, something I can say about a lot of this movie. Of course, it's made better through the Clone Wars show, but even without it this stands on its own in a foreboding way that makes you really dread the ending that you know is coming. It's great storytelling from a great storyteller, but it just sucks it had to come this late. I love this movie, despite the few problems, and it only gets better each viewing for me."
2159,8,"""You were the chosen one!""","Holy Conolly, this was one of the best movie I have ever watched in my entire life time. Jeez, I love Star Wars, but, this was the second best one out of the entire Saga. The music, THE ACTION. The acting was all right though.You finally find out why Vader is put in the suit, why Anikan turned to the Dark Side, and more."
2160,10,The Best Star Wars Movie Ever Made,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie ever made. This movie is better than the previous Star Wars movies. I thought the sound was good in this movie and it did not even get nominated for an Academy Award. Revenge of the Sith makes you understand the Star Wars story even more. This movie had great special effects. This was the first Star Wars movie to get a PG-13 rating because the others were rated PG. This is the most emotional Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I also like the action. Hayden Christensen does a good job as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. The performance that really sticks out in this movie is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wain Kenobi. The directing in this movie is top notch. I am surprised George Lucas did not win for Best Director.
2161,8,Nostalgia,"After repeated viewings, I think I've changed my mind a bit..."
2162,6,The Redemption of George Lucas,"The first two Star Wars prequels are awful movies, there is no doubt about that. So how is the third and final Star Wars prequel? In short: Good... surprisingly. George Lucas managed to pull out all the stops in his final prequel, and it pays off. The plot takes place several years after Episode 2, the clone wars are now in full swing and the whole galaxy is torn apart by it. In the middle of all this, Anakin Skywalker is having his loyalty tested as his mentor Palpatine and the Jedi are at each others throats, and he is caught in the middle. Soon, he will discover a devastating secret which will ensure his transformation into Darth Vader. I have to admit, the story is actually really good. You know that most of these characters are going to die, but you don't know when. So it's really enjoyable to watch these characters march towards their doom. The acting is sort of a mixed bag, Ewan McGregor is perfect as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Hayden Christensen as Anakin... he was AWFUL. It doesn't help that the script is also weak, while Obi-Wan's dialogue is well written, witty, and in some parts funny, Anakin's is sloppy and embarrassing. And as for Natalie Portman's dialogue.... it is crap as well. The stars of Revenge Of The Sith are the action sequences and the special effects, both of which have taken massive leaps forward since episode 2. The action scenes are well shot, beautifully filmed, and they look spectacular. Say what you want about George Lucas but he does know how to direct action. Star Wars Episode III is a welcome addition to the Star Wars saga and despite its problems, is a redemption for George Lucas after the epic fails that were the first two Star Wars prequels. I say go check this one out."
2163,3,Loose ends and dead knots,"This movie is as bad (or maybe as good for some) as the previous two iterations. Now that we cleared that, I have a quiz of a sort, for those versed in the Star Wars mythos: 1) Shouldn't real ""balance of the Force"" require equal strength of both sides: ""Dark"" and ""Light"", and therefore lead into endless confrontation of the two? Are Jedi knights super-dumb to seek this balance, and at the same time believe that they ought to get ""all the chips in the game"", using Lucas's pretzel logic? 2) Does Palpatine wear iron underwear, so that the dumb Jedis won't sense the ""disturbance"" in the Force when he prances around them throughout this trilogy? 3) Shouldn't Anakin's premonitions/dreams contain something more of the things to come than just a fake grimace on his wife's face? Maybe something about him destroying the Galactic Republic, or burning in a river of lava? Apart from being a lousy actor, is he also the worst psychic in history of the Galaxy? 4) Anakin/Vader springs out on the landing ramp on the volcanic planet, to meet his beloved wife, who he will strangle in just a moment, and delivers unforgettable line: ""I saw your ship!"" Now what purpose, apart from insult to the audience, do these words carry? Maybe we will be blessed with the director's cut DVD release with more of this useful monologue? Something like: "" I saw your ship! On the monitor, you know. That's why I came out. Otherwise I'd stayed inside. But I saw it, and I came, so there This is your ship, isn't it? It's a nice one. Nice and shiny"" Oh joy! 5) What kind of superior neural networking does R2-D2 use, when he always outperforms in a whim more sophisticated Droid ""life-forms""? Note that other R2s in these movies, apart from looking like trash-bins, also share the intellect of a pile of trash."
2164,9,"Same better than episode V (at the same time, my favorite from the Original Trilogy is VI)","3538/5000<br /><br />I will not make a real criticism but rather a counter argument against the haters. Let's start to say why I like this film: simply thanks to its good OST (at the same time John Williams) coupled with wonderful action scenes, a good representation of the conspiracies and political developments that there have been in course of our History (Republic [Roman, French, of Weimar] becomes Empire) and especially the great moments of emotions which begin little by little: Anakin does not want to drop Obi-Wan; Padmé reveals that she is pregnant; forgiveness of Anakin to Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader, Order 66, Obi-Wan discovers the massacre of the Padawans, Vader strangles his wife, the fight between the former master and apprentice, Vader burns under the gaze of 'Obi-Wan and finally the simultaneous sequences of the tapering of the armor and the birth of Padmé! Special mention to the reply that each child must repeat when playing Star Wars; I will comment on them later.<br /><br />Small parenthesis. Before attacking what is annoying with this film, let us launch into the Prelogy. According to my personal tastes: III> VI> IV> V> I> II with regard to the Star Wars saga. Although I'm indifferent to episode II and find episode I just ... cute, I have to defend the Prelogy. Admittedly, I do not believe that it would have been necessary to make a prequel but here it is: SW is a saga of film for child, whether you believe it or not. That explains the Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks, Yoda the puppet, a bearded old fool, robotic comics-reliefs, etcteri etctera. And at the end of episode I, instead of growing up with the public of the Trilogy (as Harry Potter would have done), this episode is very childish (not immature, attention), you just have to listen to the music to to notice. On the other hand, the Prélogie, it grew with its fans. Episode II is for teens. And episode III is more adult. TO fans wanted to feel the emotions<br /><br />they had but Lucas's goal was to introduce the new SW generation. And I'm not against it! That explains why the old people like the Trilo and the younger ones the Prélo."
2165,8,Lucas has Balls,"Lucas proves he still has balls...you will understand after seeing the movie...I was in shock after certain parts of the film...PG-13....you will be ecstatic...trust me..I love star wars..not a fan-boy...this will give you shivers...I still have them thank you thank you thank you thank you they did it...you will love it I promise I liked episode 1 and 2 more than most this is on par with Jedi and falls right under Empire. Acting stiff?...nahhhhhh...There is some moments of lull...but this is the most action packed episode...wait until Yoda....oh my god.... Lucas finally figured it out...I watched episode 4-6 after...weird new feelings emerged...Ebert is right...3 1/2 stars (out of four, morons). I want to ruin so much...I can't ... I promise you will be shocked...I promise"
2166,7,Episode III better than EP I and EP II but doesn't quite tie in right!,"Let's forget for a minute that Lucas totally sold out big time on promoting this film... (ie)pepsi, burger king and m&m's to name a few overly embarrassing plugs."
2167,9,Pigs are flying and hell's frozen over,One of the Star Wars prequels is actually... good?! I'm in shock.
2168,1,Meh when it could have been amazing,"Oh, my how much better this movie could have been. First of all, one shred of character development could have been spent on Vader at all in the the entire trilogy. I mean really, isn't that what its supposed to be about? I would have liked to have seen EP1 compacted into 45 min and combined with a shorter EP2, leaving two more movies to develop and fully flesh out who Vader is. I've seen all three prequel EPs several times and still am mystified as to why Anakin isn't given more than cliché'd you-know-he's-evil-but-no-one-else-knows to work with."
2169,,My first Star Wars review,"I'm kind of a rookie to this whole ""review"" game but I definitely had to write something on this awesome movie and all the star wars movies at that. In my opinion, having seen all of the star wars films,(special crap editions included), this is how they go- from great flick to worthless thing i cant watch more than once. 1)THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK--this movie comes out with guns blazing. Everything cool happens in this one. For people who see Darth Vader as a caped turd in star wars: a new hope, they get to see him in all his awesome glory. Luke buffs up, we meet Yoda, Han and Leia swap spit, and the holy grail of memorable lines is delivered. A pure classic. 2)REVENGE OF THE SITH--Although it just came out, it already ranked up there with the Almighty EMPIRE. This movie is dark as hell. Everything we've every heard or read about concerning the fall of Anakin Skywalker comes to life. It exceeded expectations for me because of how on-the-mark everything was. The infamous DUEL. The death of Anakin and the birth of Darth Vader. The death of democracy. The birth of a new hope. Save one or two silly parts, this movie will long be remembered by every fan: hardcore or not 3)RETURN OF THE JEDI-- Where it all ends. The destruction of the Empire. When I was younger this was the first star wars film I ever saw and from then on it was my favorite. Since I saw it first I already knew Vader was Luke's father. Kind of a bummer knowing that without seeing empire first but its cool. We get to see Luke at his most vulnerable in front of his father and the emperor, as his friends and army are falling. Awesome final duel between father and son. Redemption is a great thing. All around fun movie, oh yeah and one word- Jabba. 4)STAR WARS-- Its a shame that the others rank above the one that started it all. Its not a bad flick at all. Like i said its basically the reason for all this. The origin of the fat guy dressed up like a storm trooper. The Death Star. Lighsabers. Mos Eisley Cantina.The Milenium Falcon. Chewie's mustache. C'mon. It's Star Wars 5)ATTACK OF THE CLONES-- The first time I saw this in theaters I was relieved there wasn't as much talking and more getting to the point with action. That was good. What wasn't good was the staying power it had on me. I realize more and more that Anakin went from a annoying child to a creepy annoying teen. There were awesome parts in it too which is a shame. The glimpses of the clone wars. The Lightsaber battles. Experienced Obi-wan. Not horrible but not good. Mediocre I have to give it. 6)THE PHANTOM MENACE-- Onecool part. And one of the coolest new characters of the new (or old?)star wars universe bites the big on in it too. what kind of crap is that? The rest of the movie I barely remember. There's some underwater city or something. i really don't remember. It's boring but its necessary. And the first hour is really boring. There's some Arabian in it too that owns anakin. I could try to remember but it would hurt."
2170,10,Because of Obi-wan,"Ewan McGregor is the GOAT. Makes this movie 10 out of 10. It also doesn't contain Pong Krell, which makes it that much better."
2171,6,So that's it ?,"This was a fantastic action film brought crashing to it's knees by the most god awful acting I've ever seen. Hayden Christensen is perfectly set to follow Mark Hamill into the bargain bins of Hollywood. He was the worst culprit but most of the other actors were not far behind. And if we are rating this film on ALL of its merits, then acting must be taken into account. Perhaps the script writers should take the blame but someone has to hold their hands up and admit there was a monumental flaw in the film and it had nothing to do with the tremendous battles or the excellent CGI. So I rate it a 6 out of 10. Before Hayden and Co opened their mouths I would have given it a 9."
2172,10,The Revenge of the Sith,"Since I was a child I have loved the Star Wars movies and I know the difficult that implies to make a good prequel I was fascinated with the Clone Wars and the Phantom Menace but I found this episode like ""the cherry of the cake"" all of us are used to the fact that at the end of the Star Wars movies the good ones always win, you know, the Jedis. But in this prequel the story is totally different, you can see the worst side of the force. How the ambition of a man (Anakin Skywalker) can change his values. Also almost all the Jedis died. This movie, directed by the great George Lucas, has the correct portions of action, calm, some jokes and seriousness.<br /><br />The writers have created a script which is brilliant, also the special effects are superb. The film was recorded in places like United Kingdom for the scenes in Naboo's forrest, Tunez for Tatooine among other. In general, the film is entertaining, filled of a lot of interstellar species that surround the humanity. The best part of the movie is the absolutely awesome battle between Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi, you have to see it! This scene take place in the Mustafa system, where all the separatist guns are created.<br /><br />I am going to introduce a little synopsis of the movie to increase your interest in the film. The story begins with a battle in the space between separatist troops and the republic's clones. Obi Wan and Anakin have the mission to rescue to the chancellor Palpatine and kill to the General Grievous and the General Conde Dooku. They are successful killing to Dooku but Grievous got away. They return to Republic and the Jedi council give to Obi Wan the mission to find and kill Grievous. Meanwhile, Anakin is seduced by the chancellor Palpatine to stay in the dark side of the force cheating on him with the lie that a lord sith can control the life and death. So Obi Wan finds and kills General Grievous but at the same time, when the general Mace Windu tries to destroy Palpatine, Anakin betrays the council Jedi and cuts the hand of Mace Windu and Palpatine as Darth Sidious kills Windu. Now Darth Sidious executes the order 66, renames to Anakin into Darth Vader and sends him to kill the separatist leaders in the Mustafa system, where he meets with Obi Wan and they fight. Likewise, while Darth Sidious is in the senate, the master Yoda goes to stop Darth Sidious and they fight. At the end of the movie both, master Yoda and Obi Wan hide and the children of Anakin and Padme are concealing in different families.<br /><br />Other amazing thing about this film is the astonishing music that John Williams, composer and director of the symphonic orchestra of London, made for each one of the scenes in the movie. Additionally, the principal actors; Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker, Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala & Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi had a spectacular performance in the movie. A little disadvantage of the movie could be the time; the movie could be too long for a few people.<br /><br />Finally, the last part of the movie was certainly sad with the implementation of the 66 order, I truly wanted to cry. But this was completely the right way to connect this episode with the fourth. The battle between the master Yoda and Darth Sidious was epic. It is a great film; I definitely recommend this to any Star Wars fan or movie lover."
2173,9,Redeeming the Star Wars name,Really good! It delivered even better than I expected. It is better than AOTC and TPM Combined!
2174,6,A real curate's egg...,"It seems from the more popular comments that people want to believe that this episode is a vindication of Lucas' genius. Firstly let me say that Lucas' genius needs no vindication but if it did - this film would not be it. It is a classic example of the proverbial curate's egg - absolutely breathtaking in its scope and vision in parts, and agonisingly, excruciatingly unbearable in parts. However, it really had to achieve just three main things, 1) marry the storyline up with A New Hope - achieved, 2) appease the die-hards - apparently achieved, and 3) create an engaging film which is capable of standing independently - highly questionable. The concepts and ideas tend to work well, the 'big' scenes and fights are pretty spectacular but the personal journeys of the major protagonists and the inter-personal and particularly the romantic elements were abysmal. I know I'm not the first to say this but I think Lucas is spectacular at what he does well. Unfortunately character development and romance are not part of his incredible repertoire. Just my opinion - no doubt some will agree, others call me crazy."
2175,10,The Saga Is Complete,"The film itself was wonderful, haunting, relentless, and an instant classic despite its few failings. I ignore the critics who lambaste the acting. I roll my eyes at the critics bent on the George Bush agenda. Lucas wrote this story 30 years ago. While not scripted then, the targeted lines could be linked to any administration, hence its timelessness. Look at the poll here and it's clear: The naysayers should just stay at home."
2176,7,"Yes, this is the best entry in the prequel trilogy and superior to all three of Disney's sequels. No, it's not a masterpiece.","The Star Wars fanbase's relationship with the much maligned prequel trilogy is... complicated. The average SW fan (at least on the internet) went from hating those movies with a passion, to praising them as nostalgic masterpieces, in just a few years. All because of another much maligned trilogy of films, and a popular meme subreddit. Five years ago, if you said this movie (and the trilogy it concluded) maybe wasn't THAT bad, you would be called an ""heretic"" online. Now, if you say maybe it isn't THAT good, you're still going to get called an ""heretic""."
2177,5,The Finale of the Worst Trilogy ever made - is it better than the other two? Not really,"It's honestly amazing how hilariously stupid the Prequels are. They are a train wreck of film-making incompetence, and yet many fans have ironically called them masterpieces of Star Wars iconography and lore. They actually defend the steaming pile that is the ""story"" of the Prequels, even though it's clear to anyone who has experienced the basic enjoyment of watching a motion picture that the narrative of the Prequel Trilogy is completely random and incomprehensible to the point where almost everything that happens in the first two movies has absolutely nothing to do with the climax of this one. Don't bother watching any of them if you haven't already, if you like movies, if you like Star Wars or if you care about your mental wellbeing. Please."
2178,10,Awesome movie.,This movie was awesome totally worth watching it twice. It was a nice addition to the Star Wars saga just like the other two prequels but just like those even this movie wasn't satisfying for the bitter 'fans' of the Star Wars universe whom would erase the first three episodes from existence if they've had the chance. 
2179,5,Review of Star Wars Episode 3 : Revenge of the Sith,"Thurs. May 19, 2005 00:01 Sat in what I would call, the most costume packed cinema since my sneak premiere of Return of the Kings, with hundreds of people screaming of anticipation and light sabers illuminating every corner of the cinema. The mood was certainly set, even the popcorn was colored in the light saber colors (Red, Green & Blue). People had been standing in line for hours in blistering rain, waiting to get the best seats. The cinema was heavily staffed and ready to service, what will probably be their busiest event in 2005."
2180,9,Lucas reclaims his cinematic legacy in fine fashion,"This has got to be one of the most difficult reviews I have ever written, but let me explain. I wrestled with myself as to the rating of this movie and cheated somewhat in determining the final rating. While I always assess a movie on its own merit, I had to compare this with "" Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" which will forever remain one of the best films I have ever seen and a solid 10/10 . While I'm not a Star Wars fanatic, I do appreciate great movie making and the original trilogy (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi) stands as a testament of what one man's imagination and vision can accomplish. That being said, I remember cringing and questioning as to why would George Lucas' do another trilogy, to serve as a prequel of sorts? The answer was remarkably simple. The first trilogy is synonymous with popular culture; is one of the most commercially successful franchises in history and admittedly or not, is a reminder of our youth and changed the landscape of modern cinema as we know it."
2181,10,Good Finish!,"The film started out as all star wars films do, although this episode had shadows of the new hope and empire strikes back, with its air battles and good story line. The acting from young Hayden Christenson was awesome, i felt he over shadowed most of the well established actors, although Ewan McGregor portrayal of obi wan this time out was awesome and held his own with the talented young Christianson. The light saber battles where excellent, the actors where to skilled at times, with never seen before accuracy and timing with the techniques, the speed of the movements where incredible. Although i have all this positive feedback to give, i feel that the last half of the film seemed rushed and it was like George Lucas was going off a check list on what he needs to add to the film so it all fits in with the older stars wars. I also feel that the transition from young skywalker to Darth Vader was to fast and more needed to be shown of the character Darth Vader ."
2182,10,Definitely in the Top 3 of the Star Wars Movies,"All the Star Wars Movies have had something special and different. Many people think the first 2 prequels were terrible but I think they were just right. Yes, there was some corny acting and confusing scenes, but you had to give it some hope, how else would you have told the story of the prequels. You couldn't copy the plot from the first 3 movies instead Lucas created a fine set of movies and something new and very fitting. To conclude, I think Revenge Of The Sith was a perfect finish to the prequels and more importantly, a perfect lead up to A New Hope. I'm very excited to see Star Wars The Force Awakens tomorrow and I'm sure Disney won't fail."
2183,10,Great Movie,"I know that this movie has gotten a lot of crap from people, saying that it was not up to par, but i disagree with them completely. I thought that it was a great movie. I think that the plots were wrapped up nicely and it was nice to visually see the things that were talked about in the trilogy! I give it a 2 thumbs up for sure! The special effects were absolutely amazing, and i really could feel anikan's transitional path. I really feel like Hayden Christiansen did an excellent job here, and his smoldering look gave me chills. Some people have said that the scripting and lines were bad, but if you sit down and watch the trilogy right after you watch this movie you can see that it pretty much falls into the same patterns and dialog. Like I said earlier i was thoroughly impressed and sentimental about this final addition to the star wars movies! I would recommend it to anyone!"
2184,4,Just about makes it..,"The best of the three prequels and the only one I didn't get bored of watching. It has the usual visual flare piled on with virtuosity and then piled on some more and its not always engaging sometimes coming across like a computer game. But, there is an interesting story to follow. Namely, how does Anakin flip to the Dark Side. And it does have an excellent turn by Ian Mcdiarmid as Palpatine. Christopher Lee is great but we don't get enough of him and Yoda is always watchable. Ewan McGregor is better than in Phantom but there is something of the Mary Poppins Dick Van Dyke about his Alec Guinness impression. There are some memorable scenes particularly the final fight and anything with Yoda. However, the main let down of the film is that the Anakin story just isn't believable enough and in order to enjoy the film you just have to kinda of let that go. And there aren't enough meaty characters to get your teeth into. Which leaves you thinking that Lucas got lucky in having the original trio of Ford, Hammil and Fisher. So its definitely worth a look. It will entertain, mostly."
2185,10,anakin makes more sense then you all give him credit for...,"OK, basically its this: a lot of you have said that anakin's transition to the dark side was unbelievable because it was so sudden. I think you are forgetting one thing. The sheer power of Palpatine. I think that a huge part of anakin's sudden transformation was Palpatine's direct manipulation of his will. We are talking about a man who wipes the memories of billions using the force. He had amazing power over the mind."
2186,10,This is where the fun begins!,Simply a masterpiece!
2187,9,This is one of the finest we've seen,"I liked the previous two but they really were a disappointment. Some of the worst dialogue ever heard riddled Attack of the Clones, which is a shame since so much rides on the love between Anakin and Padme. For me the dialogue wasn't much of a problem with Revenge of the Sith (or maybe I am so used to it by now I don't really notice). I snickered a couple of times but the story was so engaging, the tragedy was so perfectly played out that I came out of the theater in a strange trance that I don't have happen often."
2188,7,Lucas brings balance to the Force (not really a good thing),There is a really good film in here... somewhere.
2189,10,Best of the prequel trilogy,"Revenge of the sith is one of the best movies of all time period. Where episode I and episode Ii had set up story, romance and silly stuff, episode 3 feels like a Star Wars film and a damn good one."
2190,10,the saga is complete,"(orig. posting - may 19, 2005) JUST SAW THE MOST AWESOME MOVIE BY FAR THIS YEAR: STAR WARS 3 - REVENGE OF THE SITH. nuff said. he he. the most amazing special effects, the most emotionally charged of ALL of the trilogies, and (i may go overboard, but what the hell!) in my opinion, the BEST of them all. i mean, this is THE most anticipated of all movies! the previous two were just the stepping stones if you may, to what the fans and curious ones have been REALLY wanting to see: how sweet anakin became the most feared, powerful (and hated) Jedi of all."
2191,10,Best movie ever,"Godbless r/prequelmemes I love everything about this movie, it's the best, I love it, I love obi wan, I love padme, I love Yoda, I love mace windy, I love the senate, I love democracy, I am the senate, I am unlimited power,"
2192,10,Think again,"After reading most of the negative comments, I feel forced to drop a few lines myself, just to try to bring some balance in the force, be it only for my own sake."
2193,5,"Gross negligence in quality, a trend of George Lucas!","Six years gap between Episode I and III proved a great progress in digital technology as the CG special effects are incredibly improved over the video game worthy CG of the episode I although not perfect in any sense. For a movie bearing the title of Star Wars I expected ground breaking not just ordinary mainstream good special effects so in terms of special effects, although they are generally good but still a failure for such a movie however probably the biggest failure of the movie is weak acts. Scenario is nothing special, audience has the superior position and knows what would happen to Anakin, some stuff are answered like why the emperor got the disfigured face, why twins were separated, why Darth Vader got that look and some other stuff so the screenplay did not require much thinking. Generally the screenplay was descent but it grossly failed in character development. It failed to emotionally involve the audience with Anakin in his transformation from a Jedi to a dark lord probably because the acceleration of change was to slow so when it got to the point when Anakin killed master Windu, it looked very unnatural. Hayden Christensen's weak act complements to this defect in screenplay, he failed to deliver the intense emotion supposed to arise surrounding such action. After that he kneels before the emperor and without showing any emotion says ""Yes my master""... The whole point of him slipping into the dark side was his emotional attachments but exactly when he should show some emotion, he acts like a zombie and after that point, he kills even younglings without showing any emotion. The whole thing looks very unnatural. Also Ewan McGregor's performance when he finds out about Anaking killing younglings were extremely flat and emotionless... ""I can't believe what I see"" he says that without showing a believable emotion when he should go insane! Another goof was that Obi Wan refers to the chancellor as EPEROR, I can't believe such thing could just slip past the multiple layers of scrip control. There is also another problem. In this movie we are dealing with millions of planets but the time required to travel between planets is ignored, most noticeable when the emperor arrives to the volcanic planet to save Anakin just after defeating Yoda. These things are more than goofs. Goofs are the defects which an ordinary audience can not detect easily but these defects are way to obvious giving the sense that Lucas was in hurry to finish the film and did not want to go the extra mile to change some stuff in screenplay so everything at least make sense and he could do that easily. Generally a good entertainment but gross negligence in quality, a well known trait of George Lucas!"
2194,3,Not Good,"This movie was not good, and you are kidding yourself if you think otherwise. Poorly directed with bad dialog and little flow, just jumping around to pointless action. He finished ruining the series with this movie. Hayden Christianson is a terrible actor, and is brutal to listen to the entire movie. Why he made this movie is beyond me. This is how the republic is lost to the Empire? It ruins the original three by making the whole point of being a Jedi not a big deal. They were all easily killed off and not hunted down and destroyed by Darth Vader, just the ones in the temple. He loses all compatibility and the movie stands out as a cheap add on to Star Wars and not a part of it."
2195,10,The Pinnacle of Cinematography,This is the Pinnacle of Cinematography! Nothing surpasses the high ground this movie is seated upon.
2196,8,Suitably Thrilling,"With Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas brings his second Star Wars trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant -- if still a bit uneven -- conclusion"
2197,2,very disappointing!!,"I guess the fact that this movie has such a good of a ranking has to do with the fact that there are a whole lot of star wars fans out there (you know, the people that collect all the stuff and attend meetings dressed as chewbacca...) who will give 10 points to anything that has to do with star wars. I'm not saying that this movie is worthless in all aspects, but I ran short of all my expectations. I think you have to be 12 years old to find all the cheesy jokes funny. At times i thought ""Revenge of the Sith"" was another episode of Harry Potter. I'm not saying that there should be no humor in this kind of movie but it simply wasn't funny, no matter how hard the makers attempted to. Instead, it destroyed the whole atmosphere that should have been pretty dark. Off course, there couldn't be too many surprises in this movie, because most people who go see it know all the following episodes anyways. But nothing was really explained well, Annakin's shift from good to evil is sudden and not motivated. Some of the action scenes were decent but I've seen a whole lot of special FX in my life and there was nothing innovative or special about those in SW3. How come all those mighty Jedi could be killed by just a few regular soldiers, not expecting anything?"
2198,7,SW:EIII The one I've Waited almost 30 Years For,"I'm not one of those who is ready to declare Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith the best of the bunch. It is a good movie, better than most of the others but to me it was much better as satisfying my years of curiosity than being a good movie if left to stand on its own."
2199,1,Fertile idea with neutered execution.,"What in the stars is wrong with Lucas that under his spell human actors who had sterling reputation (Jackson, Mcgregor, Portman and of course our Christensen who was once nominated for Golden Globe in 2002 for Life as a House) fail to deliver? The only reason I can think of is that he spent too much time on the non human actors (Gen Grieveous et al) and the non-human non-actors (props). He might as well CGI all the acting quota if he has no intention to use the actors. In this alone the movie is a failure. Not to mention the crappy dialogue or the atropic plot development. I must say that Lucas has an interesting yarn to spin, about Skywalker becoming Vader. But I winced when this fertile idea turned out to be a neutered excercise in bombarding us with special effects. You can never trust star wars fans who award this movie 10 stars. They hated episodes 4 & 5 but still throng the cinemas in droves. I want to give this movie a one stone from earth (if its possible), not a star if I have my way."
2200,8,Prequel Trilogy Sticks The Landing,"""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith"" is the exact conclusion we needed to George Lucas' prequel trilogy. While ""Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" and ""Episode II - Attack Of The Clones"" may have defied critical and fanatical expectations for the worse, ""Episode III"" satisfies on just about every front."
2201,3,A Load of Sith: Stop at a bar for an hour beforehand and perhaps you'll enjoy this flick,"After reading a glut of positive comments about this film prior to seeing it last night, I'll admit...the hype almost had me fooled. I thought perhaps I'd finally come away satisfied from one of the Star Wars prequels. Let me dispel your notions. ROTS is certainly the best of the 3 ""new"" Star Wars, but if you've seen the last 2 and have any cinematic taste, you know that isn't saying much. So, I felt compelled to add some ""balance"" to the range of opinions on this site. "
2202,8,A ground-breaking science fiction film,"A ground-breaking science fiction film that places equal emphasis on technological factors and spiritual power in the world of cinema, and seeks the victory of freedom and democracy, one of the most important cultural events of the 20th century<br /><br />The science fiction movie Star Wars has caused a great sensation in the world. The application of modern cutting-edge technology in the movie has made a magical display of the future world. The technology effect in the movie has reached an unprecedented height, and many of its production process is still a mystery. There are even rumors that aliens helped director Lucas finish the film. Although this statement has the suspicion of grandstanding, but the film's production water greeting is undoubtedly ahead of time, it greatly on the way to the people's original technical concept of production, to people, especially teenagers played an important role in the inspiration, to ""influence a whole generation"" to evaluate the film is not to overstate."
2203,1,Why is this movie on the best movies of all time list?,"The only thing that was even the slightest bit interesting in this movie was the fight scene between Obi-Wan and Anakin. The effects in that scene were amazing and the only acting I enjoyed was when Ewan said, ""You were my brother, I loved you."" But the rest of the movie is completely forgettable. The older Star Wars movies are way better than these despite the ""out-of-date"" effects as some call them. The scripts are awful and the acting is just as bad. The music was good, but that's just because John Williams is the most amazing movie composer ever. George Lucas is not a very good director, but that's my own opinion. He doesn't seem to able to get the best out of the actors he's directing. ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart""...um, I laughed at that part, actually throughout the entire movie. ""younglings?"" WHAT??! That's almost as bad as midiclorians from Episode I (and no, I don't care how it's actually supposed to be spelled). Plus, the babies look like they're two months old when they're first born. I simply didn't enjoy this movie or the other two newer Star Wars movies."
2204,,"EPISODE III- Good, the Bad and the Ugly","What can I ad that has not already been said to the thousands of reviews on this film? People have mentioned the same things hand over fist. Acting is wooden, the story does not have heart, badly directed, character transitions are implausible and even at times down right ridiculous. Even the visuals have their claim to fame. Some say it is perfect."
2205,8,Star Wars 3,"This has to be the best Star Wars film out of the prequels and the original trilogy. I highly recommend this movie. You will be surprised by all the deaths in this movie! Everything is perfect and most of the scenes in this movie are interesting with enough information to keep you wondering how it will all end up. Who will die first? Who will die last? Who will survive? This is one of the best movies this year so far; if you don't believe me, go check it out yourself. This movie will definitely have you at the edge of your seat scene after scene after scene. Awesome and this movie could not have been better, except it would have been perfect if a certain death in this movie would not have happened."
2206,,Ruined Star Wars George Lucas Has,"The original three Star Wars were fun, they were symbolic, they were fast, they were adventurous, they were just all around great movies. There was fighting, there was adventure, there was tragedy, there were real puppets. These next three movies were just God awful, and the legacy of three of the most fun movie of all time has been absolutely destroyed. Where is the innovation in these next three? Where are the cool characters, the catchphrases, where is the fun of the original three? There is nothing fun about this movie, and I think that is the problem: George Lucas didn't intend for these three to be fun, he wanted us to take it seriously, he even said these were going to be serious movies, which should have turned me away from them, because Star Wars supposedly is above all fun, and that's why the originals were so appealing, and these next three were not."
2207,9,Truly great addition,"First of all, hats of to George for redeeming himself. Sowly but surely. Episode one was garbage, Two was enjoyable and three was truly a great addition to the legend. My only real complaint is, as in most of the Star Wars, the dialogue is often horrible. It saddens me that with all the money spent on these films he couldn't get himself a script supervisor with intelligence enough to know that ""I can't watch anymore"" and ""Oh Anikan, oh,"" are good ways to interrupt the flow. That said, unlike the other two prequels we actually learn a few things in this one, including answers to some questions raised by ""non disappearing Jedi"" from episode 1. Watching everything unfold towards the end of this film was like getting closure on wounds brought forth in childhood. Add to that the incredible style it was done in and I'm willing to call it a masterpiece. I'm confident that my future Star Warsathons will begin with this movie from now on. 1 and 2 will be a rarity though. But this definitely deserves presence."
2208,9,Give Christenson some credit,I just saw the film yesterday.
2209,10,for the fans...,"OK, so to ease the tension of the critics who have incredible disdain for anything Star Wars, ""Revenge of the Sith"" rates as follows: 10 stars for the fans (of which I am. A rabid fan I am not) 5 stars for the fans who can't seem to find anything to like about the prequel trilogy."
2210,8,"Not as good as the originals, but is close","Wow, George Lucas managed to redeem himself and this prequel series here didn't he? This film is fantastic, almost every complaint I had about the previous two films has been fixed, even Hayden Christensen's acting was okay at some parts! From the moment you start this film it feels more like a Star Wars film, that sense of adventure and daring has returned as you are plunged right into Obi-Wan and Anakin's new mission. The script has traded in the light-footed, mediocre script that was quite obvious in the previous two films, for a darker, more mature story line that works. In parallel with this is the improved acting with consistent performances all around, maybe not Hayden Christensen but at least it was better this time, elevated this story full of treachery and deceit and made it much more gripping. My other major problem with the previous film has also been fixed; the CGI is mostly believable making for some very interesting battle sequences."
2211,9,The most enchanting film of the franchise,"The final film of the prequel trilogy leads it to a mesmerising ending. If you want emotion, battle and war, this one has it all. It cries out for another trilogy. One of the best films I've ever seen. The omly issue is the drags in the middle"
2212,5,"Goog to See, but still a poor movie","This is an important movie to see if you enjoyed the other movies in the star wars series, you will probably enjoy it too, however that does not stop it from being a average movie. From the get go i felt like i was watching someone playing the Starwars video game. Immortal people, infinite strength and energy."
2213,9,Best Movie Ever,"Whenever I think about this movie and especially Order 66, I start to get emotional and almost cry. This movie's ending is one of the most brilliant and depressing endings in cinema history. Also after watching the entire Clone Wars TV show, it just adds so many layers to Anakin and Obi-WAN's relationship. If you're getting into Star Wars, I would highly recommend watching the first two prequel's then watching the Clone Wars TV Show then watch Revenge of the Sith. Once you get to Revenge of the Sith, the experience will be amazing. Just amazing movie, amazing performances from Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen."
2214,7,Not as much of a Yawn as the first two....,"Some scene spoilers below, don't read on if you don't want any details of what transpires in the film."
2215,2,Why I hated this movie...,I went into this movie only wanting two things: 1. To witness the emergence of Darth Vader. 2. To see the showdown between Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
2216,10,The Revenge of George Lucas,"The third time's the charm. In his final Star Wars film, George Lucas redeems himself completely for his failures in Episode I and II. Revenge of the Sith is a film worthy to stand alongside the original trilogy. It is, in fact, perhaps the best of all (though I still consider Empire STrikes Back for this position). This is the one fans have been waiting for: the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader; his turn to the Dark Side; his duel with Obi-Wan; and the overthrow of the Galactic Republic, and the destruction of the Jedi. This is by far the darkest Star Wars movie. All the juvenile caterings of the previous two prequels are gone, and the film might actually be the first Star Wars movie unsuitable for younger children. I think this is the story George Lucas has been wanting to tell all along. His previous two prequels, notable only for their level of mediocrity and digital windowdressing, are, in retrospect, nothing more than the motions needed to get to this point. It seems to me that George Lucas (the creative genius George Lucas, that is), must have been asleep for the previous two, using them as the means to an end. And what an end! To start off with, Episode III is probably the best written of any of the Star Wars films. It is also the best acted. Hayden Christiansen, whose performance in Episode II carried all the weight and charm of a wooden stick, is born anew in this film. Previously, it seemed impossible that this teen hearthrob could become the menacing Darth Vader. But, sporting longer hair and a badboy scar, Christiansen carries it off admirably. Also notable for her transformation is Natalie Portman. In the last film, their love affair was completely unbelievable, their chemistry zero, and their dialogue embarrassingly bad. This time round, it works. Portman gives an excellent portrayal of the tragic character Padme, forced to watch the man she loves transformed into a monster. Ewan MacGregor, the only actor who actually acted in the previous two films, once again takes the prize for best performance. His chemistry with Christiansen, already good in Episode II, is superb, giving real depth to the relationship. The most remarkable element of the film's writing may be the actual manner in which Skywalker is turned to the Dark Side, which is completely believable. There is a certain morbid satisfaction in seeing the bad guys win for once, too. Anakin's journey down the dark path is conditioned, on one hand by his love of Padme and his fear of losing her, and on the other by his distrust of the Jedi, and his anger towards them. The final factor is the seduction of the chancellor Palpatine, later to become the GAlactic Emperor, who uses Anakin's feelings of fear and anger to transform him into a Sith Lord. In Return of the Jedi, the Emperor Palpatine was a truly great villain, a true vision of evil. Twenty years later, Ian McDiarmid darns the cloak once again. To me, he is one of the greatest strongpoints of Episode III. Though he has been in the previous films as chancellor, and as the hidden Darth Sidious, it is here that he reveals himself as a force of pure evil, performing a brilliant coup-de-grace on the Jedi, seducing Anakin with an almost Hannibal Lecter-like power of psychology and language, and, for the first time, showing his real power as a Sith Lord in two memorable battles against Mace Windu and Yoda. The action in this film is top-notch, from the epic opening rescue mission, to the apocalyptic final duel. As special treats, we get a four lightsaber wielding Jedi droid, Wookiee warfare and the introduction of Chewbacca, and, for those fans who loved Yoda's lightsaber fight in Episode II, an epic duel between Yoda and the Emperor himself, featuring lightsabers, acrobatics, lightning and all. The special effects are not nearly as good as something as say, Lord of the Rings, but the movie's action sequences are too much fun to care. As the grand finale, we get the battle that all Star Wars fans have been waiting for: the Battle of the Heroes between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader over pits of lava. This final duel, which is intercut with the Darth Sidious vs. Yoda duel, is the best there has ever been. Legendary among Star Wars fans, it is truly something to behold. Finally, Episode III ends with the birth of Luke and Leia, the rebirth of a disfigured Anakin into the masked Darth Vader, the beginning of the construction of the Death Star, and the delivery of Luke to Tatooine, linking two trilogies together, and completing the Star Wars legacy, a legacy more alive in this film than it has been since the original trilogy, and proof of Lucas' genius as a filmmaker."
2217,10,George Lucas is still the master...,"This episode definitely rates a 10. The special effects, plot and characters were incredibly balanced."
2218,10,Better Than I Thought,"My qualifications: Life long Star Wars fan. These days it seems the old films are seen as great and the new films are rubbish. I'm here to bring balance to the Force and the films! I wasn't expecting to like this movie after reading so many negative comments, but I was riveted to my seat. The climax to the film was spectacular."
2219,5,The Second Law of thermodynamics at work,"""Star Wars"", (the original 1977 version) was, in my opinion, one of the truly great movies of all time. Later versions and sequels have been of ... oh, let's say ""declining quality."" They have reached their nadir with ""Revenge of the Sith."" This episode is a distressing illustration of the second law of thermodynamics, the mathematical expression of the tendency of all things in nature to run down, wear out or just plain go to hell. I could be wrong, but it seems to me this is due to the enormous freedom granted by advances in computer graphics. That ability has been substituted for the simple - but vast - imagination that drove the original. Compare the opening scenes of ""Star Wars"" and ""Sith"" and you'll see what I mean. They perfectly illustrate the falsity of the dictum, ""If some is good, more is better."""
2220,9,Media Bullies...,"Being a huge Star Wars fan, and slightly disappointed with the first 2 prequels, I wasn't sure what to expect after reading endless poor reviews of Revenge of the Sith - particularly in so-called 'quality newspapers'."
2221,8,"Good, solid addition to the franchise.","The movie was great! As for people who think it unrealistic that Anakin could so easily be duped by the dark side, just look at our current political and religious climate here in America. The dark side certainly has duped enough American citizens. Similarly, I don't think Lucas had to try very hard to draw any similarities between the Bush administration and the dark side--these were already in place."
2222,7,"Stirring, but there is still room for improvement.","Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is an impressive improvement over its predecessors and contains better elements than in the previous Star Wars installments. In this film I thought that the digital effects were awesome, that the effects were great, that the graphics were amazing, that storytelling was thoughtful, interesting and relevant and that the Force was in a jollier mood this time. To me, the power of the mythology and the awesome digital effects will please people that are not fans and believers of the Star Wars movies. I particularly appreciated the fact that Anakin vs. Obi- Wan light saber duel taking place on the volcanic planet of Mustafar because it fitted exactly the Dark Side of the Force to which Anakin has tragically turned to. And thankfully George Lucas pays attention to important, relevant little detail by adding black color on Anakin's eyelids which connects and/or relates to the fact that Anakin has just turned to the Dark Side. The movie further benefits from the fact that you can feel the unfairness and disappointment when seeing all of the Jedi Knights getting killed as the Sith dramatically start rising to galactic power. Nevertheless, I didn't approve with everything in this movie. There is Hayden Christensen whose performance as Anakin Skywalker I thought wasn't entirely convincing and ideal. Also I was disappointed by the fact that in the light saber scene on planet Mustafar opposing Anakin and Obi- Wan I couldn't viscerally feel the lava and the sweating and tiredness of the light saber duel. Nevertheless, good job on the good things I mentioned Mr. Lucas, you should be proud of yourself for your work in this film. My rating: 7.7/10"
2223,10,Nothing short of remarkable!,"I am in awe of how great this film is! The suspense and drama are so overwhelming. Perhaps more suspenseful than The Interpreter, I was at the edge of my seat most of the time. The wall-to-wall action does a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, and yet there are also those dramatic, substance-filled moments that also remind the audience that there is a plot. Just as amazing are the sound & visual effects. I could not believe how real Yoda & General Grievous look. They both looked so tangible, more so than any computerized effects I have ever seen. George Lucas most certainly redeems himself from the mistakes he made in the previous two installments (although they were OK, they both could have been better.) Bravo! I would absolutely love to see it again!!"
2224,9,What a way to end one of the most famous sci-fi sagas ever.,"The movie starts with one of the top space battle ever committed to film. The special effects are top quality as it is nice to see Lucas using models as well as CGI. The acting especially from Christiansen and Portman was excellent but some of of the line for Obi-Wan were a bit cheesy at times, note to Lucas GET A BETTER SCRIPT NEXT TIME! General Grievous was no way as good as Darth Maul in episode 1. Anakin's turn into Vader was brilliantly done, well I actually heard kids crying in the the cinema at this point. The lightsaber fights were excellently done apart from the obviously CGI Obi-Wan/Greivous fight. My character of the film award must go to Ian Mcdiarmid as Chanceller Palpatine/Darth Sidious who stole the show. Well done Lucas you redeemed yourself after the disappointing Episodes 1 and 2, it was that good I went to see it again last night (June 15th 2005)."
2225,6,Doesn't fit the story of Episode IV,After watching Revenge of the Sith I went home and watched Episode IV again.
2226,3,"Just Okay, Not Great","Like all the Star Wars movies, this one's okay, but definitely not great. Some critics said the movie was too serious, without the humor of the original. But I laughed out loud several times. Like when Padme says:""Oh Anakin! What will you do?!"" Or when the twins are born. Padme looks to be 7 months pregnant, yet she gives birth to two, huge, 10 pound twins! Then there's the infamous Frankenstein's monster scene. Lucas meant for us to laugh at that, right? With the exception of the scenes in space, never a Star Wars strong point, the special effects are spectacular. I've always liked the mechanical devices and alien creatures of Star Wars, and this installment is the best yet for that. I hate to be so general, but there's really too much to talk about in this department, it's just a rich, rich film in this respect."
2227,10,This movie aged much better...,"As a dude who was born in the 2000s and grew up with these as a kid instead of the old trilogy, I feel like this rendition gets unjust hate. Although the acting could be shoddy in the first two entries, by this movie I feel like the actors have came into their own, and the story the fall of Anakin Skywalker is by far the best out of any movie in the franchise. There's tragedy, there's sadness and it all comes together in possibly the best lightsaber fight in any of the movies. The stunning visuals, use of the environment, and just the movement and stunts themselves is insane in this movie, especially for the final fight. And while the campy originals are beloved by older fans, I feel like this movie stands the test of time as an actual film with a story that feels equal parts tragedy and hopeful. I think it's the best Star Wars movie, and while that may be controversial, I believe it fully."
2228,8,on the whole rather good,"on my way to the cinema i walked behind a mother and her two kids, one dressed as Yoda, the other as Darth Vader. Yoda was waving his stick around and his mam told him to stop it. i then wondered if Yoda's mam ever told him to stop waving his stick around."
2229,,Not deserving of the hype it got!,"I am and will always remain a Star Wars fan, and after watching episode 1, much as it wasn't fantastic it started the story off with an admirable goal but clearly it was lacking the charisma of the originals. Episode 2 however improved with greater depth of character, fantastic fight scenes and some of that comedy we all relished so much in the originals. Then here we are the last Star Wars instalment, it's been given rave reviews, comments that had me rushing to the cinema to see it! I was I have to say, disappointed. The acting ability seemed somehow to have diminished, in fact it became laughable. Scenes which should have been serious and touching were cringe worthy. Ewan Mcgregor as OB1 almost lost any ability to register emotion and it felt almost pantomime like. I will give some credit to the opening sequence and the fight scenes towards the end of the film, there was great light sabre action and it was only in the last 20 minutes that the film redeemed itself. We were all waiting for Darth Vader lets face it, the first breath through his ventilator was a great cinematic moment, but after that his gesticulations, his manner was inconsistent with the originals, it just looked like some guy wearing the suit! All in all I was not fulfilled by this film, it was like star wars by numbers, all the pieces of the puzzle were there, but the delivery was not up to standard and failed to complete the saga to the level it deserved. Yoda was by far the best thing in it, and he was CG! Maybe a re-watch on DVD might ease the pain, but I doubt it!"
2230,10,From Anakin To Vader,"Oh boy, it's the moment we've all been waiting for. Ever since the prequels got started, the very thing we wanted to see from the get go is how Anakin Skywalker became the man in the black mask with the voice of James Earl Jones. Now, we get the answers we have long craved. With this film, the loose ends are knotted, the circle is complete, and the entire Star Wars saga becomes one solid storybook. Revenge of the Sith is by far my favorite of the newest trilogy, and it's not because it has it's balance of darkness and silliness, it's because it ties so flawlessly into the original trilogy and makes the two trilogies comes together like peanut butter and crackers. Here, we see why Obi-Wan and Yoda go into hiding, why Padme is not in the original films, why Luke and Leia are separated at birth, how the Jedi get wiped out, why Palpatine looks like he has a shellfish allergy, and why Anakin gets sealed away in a shiny black iron lung like a can of green beans. "
2231,7,It has the High ground againts these new crap star wars,"Really enjoyed this movie, I never understood how Anakin turn to the dark side. He did it out of fear of losing his love. Palpatine new exactly how to manipulate him. It also showed how arrogant and careless the Jedi became. They kept getting chances to destroy the sith. In the end they help make Anakin what he turn into. For constantly disrespecting him and playing into Palpatine's hands"
2232,9,Loved it,"Action packed, engaging, wildly suspenseful. My favorite Star Wars."
2233,10,Wow,Episode III is fu***n' awesome...
2234,8,Best of the Prequels,"I would probably put this right below Empire as the best Star Wars movie. It had great action, pretty good pacing and great effects. Everyone is always complaining about how bad the acting and dialogue is, but give me a break. I don't think that is what Lucas was going for anyway. If you expect Oscar-caliber performances in these movies, then you're watching the wrong movie. Ewan McGregor shines his brightest and really gets into his character and Hayden Christiansen is really able to portray such a conflicted and confused hero."
2235,4,Not as spectacular as some are claiming it to be...,I have to disagree with the other user comment.
2236,9,Significantly better than the other Prequel trilogy movies!,"I watched this movie for the first time in 3 or 4 years, and I just realized how much of an epic Masterpiece this is! The romance from episode 2 is there, but done so much better! It makes you really think about morality, religion and other things! It makes you wonder how bad or good the Dark side of the force is. The beginning was kind of bad, with just a bunch of pointless eye-candy action, but if they didn't take the time the to show what happened to the Republic. Its so ingenious how Anakin slowly declines from the Light side and how he thinks that maybe the Dark side isn't so bad. It was all pretty well done, and I would highly recommend this movie."
2237,8,Saved the Trilogy,"Lets face it: the first two episodes in the franchise flat out stunk. Lame characters and childish storyline plagued Episode One; while terrible acting and almost desperate looking battle scenes destroyed Episode Two. Now comes Episode Three. I must say I expected the same disappointment in the last of the trilogy as I have received from the first two. However, I was pleasantly surprised! Good god it was time they actually got down to business. There are limited ""kiddie"" moments and a whole lot more Vader being well Vader! The graphics are far superior to Episode Two's and makes Episode One look like a made for TV movie. Episode Three has almost a perfect mix of story and action. There are 30-45 minutes that you could have completely left out of the movie but that's almost to be expected from Mr. Lucas. Episode Three takes the viewer on a long needed dark turn to the trilogy. Kids today couldn't care less about Star Wars, the release of the ""new"" Star Wars trilogy should have been more geared to adults from the beginning anyway. This is a great conclusion to an almost completely wasted trilogy. Episode Three has the spectacular special effects, action and romance. How can you go wrong? Go see this one."
2238,6,Average,Unfortunately I think my idea of great Star Wars movies relates back to the time when they first came one the scene and the technology was so new.
2239,9,Story Progression,"Episode 3, like expected, tied up all of those loose ends that us Star Wars geeks were worried would be forgotten. 'Sith' acted as a bridge from one world to the next, connecting two time periods and two stories."
2240,10,Excellent way to end an excellent series,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was an awesome movie. Now; I am a big, big fan of the Star Wars series I own the Box Set of the original Trilogy along with the new three. OK; Revenge of the Sith, not my favorite tar wars. no that would be return of the Jedi. however this is up on my list. this was a great way to end the star wars series in every way, I really can't think of any possible way to make it a better conclusion"
2241,9,Episode III ROCKED THE WORLD,"Sure, the dialogue was tacky. Sure it was awkward. Sure, Natalie Portman could really wind it down with, again, the bad script: i.e. Anakin, the Chancellor is evil! Anakin: in my opinion, the Jedi are evil! ... and, Anakin, you're breaking my heart! *sob*... but the scene where the Jedi were being exterminated just completely gripped the audience into tears. The fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan was amazing - hot lava, light-sabers, everything. It was a bit strange though, I thought, how Anakin submitted to the Chancellor so easily - after killing Master Windu (falls to the floor: what have I done??) Anakin kneels in front of the Chancellor and pledges to do whatever he wants? but otherwise, it was completely better than 1 and 2: 1 was horrible, 2 was decent - 3's great digital effects, storyline and emotional scenes just gave the movie a 9/10 rating. : )"
2242,10,"A good SW prequel, is this a sign of the Apocalypse?","After TPM and AOTC I never thought I'd love another Star Wars movie, but thank the force this one is great. The acting, dialogue and plotting are all a million times better than the last two. I cared for the characters & actually found myself getting emotionally invested in the story! Yoda is good as always but really acts his CG socks off when the Jedi are purged, Ian Mcdiarmds Emporer is so wonderfully manipulative I even felt sympathy for Anakin, it helped that Haydens acting is much better in this one and even Natalie Portman does well. My favourite character is now officially Obi Wan Kenobi, Ewan is perfect in this one, he goes from light hearted banter at the start to heartbreaking anguish at the end, all the while channelling Alec Guiness. The film isn't perfect there are still some plot holes and a bit of ropey dialogue but I loved it and want to see it again, and again."
2243,10,Short and sweet review,You get to see cutting edge effects. You get to see all the cool things you could only imagine for the past 27 years... Get past the cheesy dialog -- that's what makes these movies what they are! Go see it. Enjoy it.
2244,3,I Feel Cheated,"I saw the first episode of Star Wars some 25 years ago and have always been a fan. I endured cutesy little characters, lazy acting, cheesy scripts and dumb computer created characters, but still, I loved the series."
2245,10,Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?,"I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
2246,3,The least bad of the worst,"After suffering through episode I and II, this movie sadly holds no surprises for me. I start watching, and after the nowadays apparently mandatory game hype sequence, once again I'm thrown straight into a scene I know nearly squat about. Before I've even had a chance to let my own fantasy make up for the missing bits, the screen starts filling up with all kinds of crap and before I know it, I'm suddenly in the middle of some sort of action. Don't really know why – don't really know what these people have done to get to where they are, but everything's moving fast and the not-so-special-anymore effects and comic relief count have already hit a six digit number, so there's really no time to try to figure it out either. Then there are some fights, count Dooku dies and a big space ship crashes, and after that, the story finally reconnects to one of the threads left hanging at the end of episode II. Although that just means that Anakin Skywalker meets up with wife Padmé Amidala and finds out that she's pregnant."
2247,3,sad sad sad day-lets all rejoice,"I'm a big lucas fan I though sw 1 was OK the clone wars was awful and the sith is shitty. I never wanted to like a film more than the sith but its impossible. too many bad lines too much bad directing/acting because I've seen the actors be brilliant, just not in this film not even once. Yoda is the best part. McGregar is the second. He's the only actor that seems to breath a little life into his cardboard character. George should have gotten Kasdan to foot the screenplay. Dialogue is shameful and well heckled by the audience. It's a sad day but a happy day as well. No more star wars no more bad feelings its over, we're saved, and thank god. Long live Lucas. Do something you like, no more struggling to make a commercial movie, lets do something fun and creative."
2248,8,"The best of the 6, but...",It is truly the best of the six Star Wars movies. But that says more about the previous than of this. I've always had a funny taste in my mouth whenever I've seen a George Lucas movie. He has an incredible lack of attention to detail and good acting. All his movies are so flawed that you wonder if he ever seen it before releasing it. And the actors he pick??? Mark Hammil and the dude who plays Darth Vader?? Why? They can't act. But enough said about that. The good thing is the story... It has some good twists and you feel that you are experiencing the fight between good and evil up front. If only he good match the story with directing and casting...
2249,9,Awesome star wars movie!,"George Lucas has, once again, created a a masterpiece. This is my favorite of the Star Wars movies, and the acting is a bit better than the other two prequels. "
2250,2,Best of the prequel trilogy but still not very good.,Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith tells the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker. And already we have something this film did better. And that is that is tells a somewhat coherent story. And truth be told everything is slightly improved upon in this one. And I guess that's why people hold it on such a pedestal. It's because for so long fans were waiting for a good Star Wars movie that the day they got one that was ever so slightly better then the other two people began to parse Revenge of the Sith as though it belonged with the original trilogy.
2251,8,Thank you George Lucas,"Finally we receive what we have longed for many years. Growing up with Episode IV, V and VI in the backbone, Episode I and II truly were a major disappointment. In my opinion, they were almost all about special effects. Episode III is all about the story. You don't even think about the special effects; it is secondary to the great story."
2252,9,"Ver very nice indeed, For the FAn , a Lot of new stuff , Love it","Think that this guy direct a film in 1977 and almost 30 years later it's directing the prequel...I think Lucas do a wonderful job in CLOSE all the issues (a very big % of It, nobody wants everything to be explained, at least not me)"
2253,6,A more extreme and less consistent Return of the Jedi,"Future directors, let Episode III be a lesson to you. If you do everything else right, but fail to make your audience connect to the characters, you'll never have more than a mediocre movie."
2254,6,The Bear of the Three New Ones,"The only good or even watchable of the three new installments in the legendary Star Wars franchise, this third one is a feast for the eyes, larger than life and finally after two prior failed attempts actually semi-under control by director Lucas, who for all his many talents just simply should not be directing movies. As one colleague commented recently of these films, only George Lucas can make good actors appear to be unable to act. So yes the acting is still deplorable and the storyline overly simple and banal. But it is still one hell of a fun action packed and engaging ride. Especially if one is familiar w the first three films. Definitely worth the watch. Just try to forget those first two ever existed. At the very least this film shows Lucas's visionary cinematic brilliance and his always ahead of the game grasp of modern film technology. It also shows his visionary story telling abilities -- for besides the terrible casting (Samuel Jackson as a Jedi Master is simply dreadful) and the childish dialog, the overall story IS quite a creative achievement. It's nothing less than an iconic film. Though why he has Natalie Portman in the movies at all, since she does absolutely nothing but stare into space or out of windows longingly and forlorned, is a mystery except that she was a necessary vehicle as the mother of the better known Luke and Princess Leigha. And of course this is just one of hundreds of problems with this and the other two ""new"" movies of the bunch. And yet it still works alright."
2255,6,A far from perfect but satisfying conclusion,"""Star Wars: episode III- Revenge of the sith"" is directed by George Lucas."
2256,9,Well worth the wait,"While I don't agree with the New York Times review that this film is better than ""A New Hope,"" I have to say I was blown away by this film in a way I haven't felt since ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Not only are the visuals stunning -- the light saber fights are the best in the entire franchise -- but the story is surprisingly intriguing. Even though everyone who's been near a theater in the last decade knows that Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) will become Darth Vader, it's still incredible to watch Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) play Iago to Anakin's Othello. The mental transformation of Anakin from loyal Jedi knight to vengeful Sith will be tough to forget."
2257,7,Revenge of the Star Wars Saga!,"In my entire life, I'd never seen a Star Wars movie in my life."
2258,1,What exactly happened here...,"There's no need to talk about all aspects about this movie, because all the good parts are completely ruined by the fact that the actors look COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BORED. It looks like they're all just got the news that they're dying of cancer. They just look so unbelievable uninspired that I actually get angry just thinking about it. It was LITERALLY PAINFUL to watch this thing. The dialogue was equally poor, it was just SO awkward and SO embarrassing. I can honestly, and i swear to god when i say this, that this is by far the worst movie i have seen in a LONG time. "
2259,8,Highly enjoyable,"I saw ROTS at a private screening two days before release (it helps to have a relation managing the local cinema) but have refrained to comment until after a second viewing. The film is everything you could expect from a Star Wars movie, good and bad. The poor dialogue and some acting performances have been highlighted by many but remember Mark Hamill is no Oscar winner. Sure the film is slightly spoilt by the thickly smeared CGI and Lucas plays on our fond memories of the original trilogy with old characters and musical score but on a whole the film succeeds. See ROTS with no major expectations other than to be entertained for over two hours, it has it's faults but if you like Sci-fi then you're in for a treat. Not the best SW but one of the most enjoyable films in recent years."
2260,10,The Best of the 6,"I have the pleasure of owning a theater...therefore, i have screened star wars merely to see if it was working properly and that everything was well and in place (haha yeah right!). Now let me tell you, I knew how it would end. However, Mr. Lucas did the most amazing job of getting me to the beginning of episode 4, even at one point doubting that Anakin would become Darth Vader! All the actors were amazing in it; however, both Hayden and Natalie did phenomenal jobs acting, at one point almost making me cry :-(."
2261,10,The Circle is now complete...,"Quite amazed.... The production was a wonderful triumph, including both the visuals and the story/performances. Everything I wanted to know was included, filling the gaps while giving me - in spite of what I already knew of the Star Wars back story and mythos - a completely new perspective of the SW Universe.... Amazing. Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader is heartrending, particularly because he is so much a likable hero at the beginning of this film than he has been in the other prequels. He knows something is wrong, and he always wants more, but it isn't simply power or riches that turn him to the dark side... ultimately it is love. And the final events that complete his transition, both in to Darth Vader and into the Mask, are quite horrific. And the events end up horrific for Anakin as well - the look on his face as the Mask is finally placed is of a man becoming something Else. He is now the classic SF movie monster - a being changed both by evil and by misguided ideals, and so classic is that moment, it literally pays homage to Karloff's Frankenstein. Fantastic."
2262,5,I cannot take it anymore!,THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SOME MINOR SPOILERS(insignificant but important to some)
2263,6,Simply Stunning...*MINOR SPOILERS*,"I went to this movie, expecting that although this was going to be good, it would not be able to exceed the greatness of any of the three original movies. When I came out of the cinema, I thought, ""Lucas, you've completed your quadrilogy."" "
2264,1,what a pile of garbage,"I cannot believe this film made it into the top 250 of all time list! This comment may contain spoilers is a little bit misleading, since there is no plot to spoil. I'm not going to simply explain why this film is so bad, I will also add in how I believe the story should have gone."
2265,5,Competent but not brilliant,"I think that it is far to say that most of us knew what was going to happen and the movie did go and fill in the gaps between the Clone Wars and absolute dominion of the Emperor. What the movie failed to deliver on was what we all went to see it for - the subversion of Anakin Skywalker to the Dark side. OK it did show how he ended up in the Darth Vader suit but not why he got there in the first place. The reason given, although it did have something, did not ring true with me. I guess, the only thing that would have worked well would have been something akin to the subversion of Dr Yueh and Thifur Hawat in Frank Herbert's Dune. We as the audience must be made to believe that the sweet boy flying the pod car could become Darth Vader. This movie did not do that."
2266,7,Can't get no satisfaction...,"I saw this movie last night with my seventeen year old son. This is the age I was when I saw the very first Star Wars movie. Interesting full circle. This was an important movie, but I felt somewhat disappointed. It seemed almost as if the movie makers were tired of making the series and just wanted to get it over with. ""Oh, let's just answer their questions, so they can get on with their lives!"" But in all fairness, I'm not sure what I would have been satisfied with. After waiting these many years for all the spaces to be filled in, it couldn't help but be a bit anti-climactic. All in all, it was well presented. But I never felt a thrill. Of course, it is hard to beat the thrill of seeing Luke use the force to fly into the heart of the death star and blast away. So, even with the presence of this ambivalence on the morning after... ;) I can't help but be full of praise for the overall success and pleasure of the six great adventures."
2267,2,Could this even have lived up to the expectations? Did they even try?,"I guess I am in the same boat as many other reviewers. I watched ep. 4-6 when I was a child, and was totally enchanted by the magic that was Star Wars... how could I have not? I also read the novels based on the movies, and of course, I wondered about that fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I imagined it many many times."
2268,8,Like a Tree,"No, this isn't some Jedi metaphor that wound up on the cutting-room floor. It's how I would describe George Lucas' structure in the film. The leaves are the blowouts among droids, clones, etc. that Palpatine conjures up and manipulates to his own ends. The trunk and branches are the destruction of the Jedi and the birth of the Empire. The roots are Anakin Skywalker's betrayal of everything and everyone he loves to follow the Dark Side of the Force."
2269,4,sort of what i expected.......rushed!,"While i'm probably not nearly as big of a fan as most of the people posting on this site it doesn't take a SW nerd to realize this movie was rushed from beginning to end. I've seen the deleted scenes and wondered why so many crucial parts to the story were taken out and yet they left in scenes like ""good bye Chewbacca! miss you i will"", i mean how does Chewbacca and Yoda being friends at one time have anything to do with the overall storyline? I'm glad George managed to show more of Anakins Darkside this time around, but with so many bad lines i just could not get myself to believe Anakins struggle between staying a Jedi or saving his wife. its hard to know who is responsible, George Lucas for writing those lines, or Hayden for acting them out. I wasn't impressed with the political comments in the movie either, if i wanted to hear bush/American bashing i'd watch Farenheit 9-11 or another stupid Michael Moore movie. When it all comes down to it Epi 3 should have been given at least an additional 40 minutes more time since so much info i feel was left out. Anyway here's hoping the TV series next year explains more cause Epi 3 sure did not."
2270,8,What the first two should have been,"Finally, Lucas gets his act back together and puts out a film that truly does justice to the Star Wars franchise. Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were far cries from what they should have been--this is what they should have been all along."
2271,9,The only disappointment is that it's all over....,"Lucas brought everything together for one last hoorah! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. My expectations were high and Lucas delivered. There of course were some cheesy lines that I've come to expect from a SW prequel, but it's easier to swallow this time round. That said, Ewen McGregor and Ian McDiarmid put in admirable performances."
2272,8,"Loved it, but....","I just loved that movie because it prepared the way to the classics. Nevertheless, the special-effects-fireworks robbed its soul. Thats the point in all of the ""new ones"", it just looks like a video game too much and in to many scenes. What a relief when it changed back to the old style at the end of it. Don't misunderstand: I love special effects, but to many places looked to artificial (take the Wookie planet)...."
2273,10,Revenge of the Sith is George Lucas' revenge for all Star wars prequel haters,"In Star Wars I, we have cheesy characters, some wooden acting, decent action, controlling special effects, and a sloppily-told story. In Star Wars II, we have wooden acting, a clumsy and horrible love story with less action than the original and special effects that dominate the film."
2274,3,What a disappointment.,"Now, upon seeing this at the cinema, I came out of the theatre feeling a little underwhelmed by it, but enjoyed it nonetheless. However, it was only when I watched it again on DVD that I realise how much of a colossal wasted opportunity this really was."
2275,10,I love Star Wars!,"Star Wars movies rock, but this is definitely my favorite out of all of them. Hayden Christensen and Ewan Mcgregor are such good actors. I have been waiting for this movie to come out for ever! And when it finally did, I was so excited. My favorite part of the movie is when Anakin gets his legs and arm chopped off by Obe Wan and his eyes start glowing red. He looks sooooo hot! But then they have to go and burn him and make him look ugly. I cried (I know, I know!) from the time Anakin is officially named Darth Vader (after he cuts Mace Windu's hand off) all the way to the very end when Luke is given to his family. (I don't know why, but it was all so sad!) This is by far my most favorite movie of all time!"
2276,10,one of the best movies i have ever seen,"i thought this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen before. there are many reasons why i think this way but the main reason is that it is just soo clever. the way the people think of doing a movie backwards... its just like something we have never seen before. i personally thought that you could never make as good of sequels as the original movie, i thought it was a waste of money, time, and just really stupid to do. But i was so wrong! this movie was just wonderful, it had drama, action and adventure, fantasy and romance,all in one film.the special effects were amazing and great! in a way it made you feel like it was 3d even though it wasn't. it was soo good. i am very happy that i saw this movie! people go out and see it!!! i plan on seeing it like 10 more times! i would give this movie a 10/10!!!"
2277,10,Best of it's era,"The 2 first prequels wars just not best the same level as the originals. This on the other hand is the closest you Can get on the orginal films, and makes the originals feeling even better to Watch."
2278,10,Emotional,"My favorite SW movie. Really good acting and amazing performance from Hayden,so many emotions. Big big 10."
2279,6,Average at best!,"If you compare this movie to Episodes 1 and 2, this one is a vast improvement, but these three movies will never measure up to the original Episodes 4, 5 and 6. While the special effects were fabulous, the acting from Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman was so atrocious that it defies description. Their stale, stiff, robotic performances made me want to puke and/or beat myself senseless with the arm from my seat. It was interesting to get the ""full story"" and have it all come together at the end. I'm sure when released on DVD, it might make for an interesting weekend to watch all 6 episodes back to back. If you go see this movie, look for the outstanding acting from Ewan McGregor, a descent story and incredible special effects. Otherwise this is an average movie overall. Certainly not George Lucas's best work."
2280,10,Darth Vader Rising....,"OK now for all these people giving it a 1/10 and going on and on about how much better the original trilogy was. Sure it was great and it was what got us hooked on the Saga to begin with but come on to say that ROTS pails in comparison to those and go so far as to rate is 1/10 (not even Maid in Manhatten is ratted that bad) is really something. It does show something is going down, and no its the films quality its the IQ of these people. Seriously what are you on??? Sure the dialog isn't that great and sometimes the acting isn't too much to talk about, but even the original trilogy had its downsides. Come on one seconds the Ewoks are cannibals about to cook Hans, Leia and Luke and the next they are Saviors of the Galaxy. Seriously thats always been the beauty of these movies, they have their lapses but they make up for it and much much more with all the fights, the talk of the greater good and the sacrifices we witness. And really even Empire's ""... I am your father..."" scene doesn't come close to the rise of Vader and Padmi's death. The chills you feel as Vader dons the back suit, and Luke it held by him Aunt and Uncle in Tatooine is really really something special, and if you were really a true fan of the original trilogy you would go unmoved by it. So please if you just nostalgic about the 70s and want to recreate some magic from those times, just go to the disco, don't go bad mouthing one of the best work of our generation."
2281,4,This is a deadly drama!,"This one is UNLIKE any of the Star Wars movies I've ever seen in my entire life! I mean it was HORRIFYING to watch Anakin (or Darth Vader) getting scorched and badly screaming for mercy! And the way he shouted ""I HATE YOU!"" was extremely gross! This left me shaking and wimpering in shock because I learned that Palpatine was the sickest and most elusive villain in the universe! I like Episode VI better than Episode III because here, Anakin turns from the dark side and saves his son from his former master and former ally! Palpatine's plot to rid the galaxy of the Jedi and treat innocent citizens like garbage was the worst in the world! BEWARE! This film might make you throw up!! However, congratulations to George Lucas for completing the Star Wars saga for us! 2 thumbs up!"
2282,,"The whole story is empty, nothing.","First I want to thank George Lucas for creating such a boring uninspired world that has been in all of our lives for 28 years, 28 years too long. Wow! Revenge of the Sith is an annoying movie bit still the best of the prequels. It actually has some emotional depth HAHAHA even more oscarwinning emoticons than the other episodes . There is so much to H*ate about this movie...the story, characters, special effects. Sure the dialogue is ""quite"" corny , but that's what make ""Star Wars"" movies so much irritating. The acting is much better in this one and the action is fast-paced and well timed, best of the worst."
2283,10,"Even if you're not a Star Wars fan, you should SEE THIS FILM","I'd never seen any of the films before I saw this movie except for the older ones long ago. I made it a mission to see this film simply because it is the pivotal film in the series. I didn't even like Star Wars. In fact, even when I said ""I have to see this movie"" there was reluctance in my voice. But I'm glad I saw it. VERY glad."
2284,7,This is all you need to see of the new star wars,"If it wasn't for Starwars 1 and 2 I would have given a better rating because I would have rather it been a 3 hr prequel. If you are just now getting into the whole Starwars universe then I highly recommend that you start with this one because the story will stay with you far better if you choose to progress through the rest of the story. As a stand alone movie it's very hard to judge because I grew up with Starwars 4, 5, and 6. And singling this one out without tapping into the others is kind of tricky. But if you must know this story tells of young man tore between two paths of training, with mentors on both sides. One he new longer and the father figure in his life and the other a person who's looking for a successor in an powerful galactic empire. The problem lies is there two apposing sides and they are at war and his decision can dictate the possible out come of the war. Also there's a princess who plays a very persuasive part in this who is along side this young man but she carries a secret and will it be powerful enough to keep his heart in the right place."
2285,8,The Force Is Back!,"I'm delighted to report that George Lucas has safely returned the Star Wars saga back to the tracks just in time for the final installment. While I wasn't as harshly critical of The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones as many others were, there is no doubt that there was something missing in those films which made them less enjoyable than those in the original Star Wars trilogy. Any mistakes though, in those prior two films, can be forgiven as Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith forms an almost perfect bridge between the prequel trilogy and the original one, shot so long ago and seemingly so far, far away. As Darth Vader might say: ""The Circle is now complete."" One of the best aspects of this film is how well it sets up the circumstances which lead to the events we are so familiar with in the original film of the series, now known as Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The birth of twins Luke and Leia, the emergence of black caped villain Darth Vader, the banishment of former Jedis Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda to distant planets, and the creation of the evil galactic empire all occur in this film. Going in, I wondered if knowing where the story was heading would be a bad thing. The answer to that question is a resounding no! As one reviewer put it, knowing what the puzzle will look like isn't as important as how the pieces are put together. Anakin Skywalker's descent into the dark side of the force and his gradual emergence into the personality of Darth Vader might be inevitable, but getting there is the fun part."
2286,10,"Not the best, but-","You may be wondering what this title means, how can I give this movie 10 stars and say it's not the best? Here's how:<br /><br />I just love watching this movie, I can never not get enjoyment out of it, yeah there's stiff and awkward dialogue, but the action and music (unironically one of the best film soundtracks) make up for it. If I were to give an unbiased review it'd probably be 7 stars, but no, I love this movie too much for that.<br /><br />It's not the best movie I've seen (not even the best star wars movie) but it'll always be my all time favourite film to watch"
2287,6,Revenge is right...,"Thirty minutes of storyline and decent acting interrupted by 110 minutes of mindless battles and light saber duels. I was a young adult when I became addicted to ""Star Wars"", but now, firmly implanted in middle-age and fortunate enough to get 'senior' discounts, the last of George Lucas' double trilogy was simply an overwhelming special effects display. The fights just seemed to go on far too long to make any semblance of a point, and became tiresome. I am appreciative that Mr. Lucas tied the whole ""Star Wars"" story together, and that the stupid-looking, long-eared creature that ruined ""Star Wars I"" had only a walk-on role. As a whole, Chapters IV though VI were a clear ""10"", Chapters I through III, a mere ""6"". I have a sneaking suspicion that a re-re-release of the original three are just around the light saber."
2288,10,the end of a...,"Don't know, in some kind of deep rooted sad kind of a fashion, my movie going life kind of feels complete."
2289,1,There is no such thing as a lava fall.,"Let's just start out with the plot. We knew what was coming because, I'm assuming, everyone has seen the other movies. The plot was neither good nor bad."
2290,5,A villain's movie,"The Revenge of the Sith is an unusual movie in a way as it's not trying to tell a story about 'what' is happening, but rather 'how' some things everyone knows are going to happen. Let's face it, there's no way anyone is going to see this without having seen at least one Star Wars movie before or has heard of the famous climax of the Empire Strikes Back. So, basically everyone knows how this is going to turn out. Darkly. Bad for the good guys. Especially one key character, that links all six Star Wars movies together. But the fun is seeing 'how' this is going to happen and happily, I'll have to say it's quite convincing. Darkness has always done good for Star Wars. The best one is still Empire, but this is definitely the best of the new trilogy."
2291,6,Thunderous Applause (not),Was this an ad for John Kerry:
2292,8,"Yes, but Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo","Yeah redeemed indeed, to a point, if you can get past Lucas's cheesing (e.g Vaders emergence as the fully armoured Dark Lord - ham ham ham) its a great film and Anakins quandary over his Mothers memory and the temptation to save Padme from 'certain death' is quite heart rendingly illustrated, although his fall to the Dark side is somewhat sudden and seems to occur in the blinking of an eye."
2293,8,The Only Good Prequel Movie,"Finally Obi Wan and Anakin are cool characters. The first act of the movie is awesome as Anakin character is finally great. He really wants to save those around him on the way to saving Palpatine, but knows the mission comes first. Obi Wan and Anakin are actually friends in this movie and have a real bond. Anakin killing Count Dooku was very chilling and is part of the reason what makes Palpatine in this movie so great. The way he can manipulate people and just get under there skin so so satisfying to watch.<br /><br />General Grievous is cool, and so is order 66, the killing of all the Jedi. Although I wish we had gotten to see General grievous capture Palpatine.<br /><br />Every scene with Palpatine is great in this movie. ""Have you ever heard the tale of Darth Plaguesis the wise""-Palpatine.<br /><br />Padme and Anakin relationship in this movie is amazing and all there scenes together were amazing. I just with how the way they got together wasn't so terrible. Every single character is at there best here, Yoda, Mace Windu, are both great in this movie. In fact I only have two flaws with this movie. First Anakin turn to dark side wasn't realistic. I mean because he wants to save his wife he ends up killing young Jedi children. Palpatine manipulations over him should have happened over the course of all three movies, however it's just this movie where we really get to see him be manipulated Padme dying of a broken heart is stupid and should have just died due to child birth."
2294,4,Pretty sure he made the movie so he could get the word Revenge in.,"Where do I start? If you are one of the original kids to see the first movie in 1977, I'm not sure how you can like this movie. I'm a huge fan of the original saga. I didn't expect any of these 3 movies to have the same magic, just because the first set were innovative for their time. Kinda like the Matrix (1) for this era."
2295,6,Star Wars Ep 3 is a good movie but not nearly good enough,"My stance seems to be not reflect the majority, which is divided between two extremes when it comes to rating this movie. I would say that it is an averagely good movie that is disappointing because it could have been a very good movie."
2296,10,Star Wars success,"OK lets clear things up. I'm 13, not 21 so some of you might not agree with me."
2297,8,The turn to the Dark Side is not believable,***Some mild spoilers***
2298,1,"I can't believe this has a 7,7 total score!","I had been avoiding watching this for years. After Attack of the Clones, I was so angry I didn't want ANYTHING to do with Star Wars, ever again."
2299,9,A fine conclusion to an uneven prequel trilogy,"The original Star Wars trilogy has been an indelible part of many a childhood memory. Millions entered the theater for the prequel films with great anticipation and trepidation. Suffice it to say there was little hope of these films living up to their substantial hype, much of it created in our own minds."
2300,10,best sw movie ever,10/10 perfect cgi for 2005. And duello on mustafar.
2301,7,May the force be with us all.,"This is the only film in the prequel that I really enjoy. It's not perfect by any means (but what film is?) but I'm not bored like in episode 1 or annoyed like in episode 2. There is lots of good! Obi-Wan is really awesome and Ewan McGregor really shows how great he is. You can actually feel the bond of Obi-Wan and Anakin and the heartbreak of Obi-Wan. The duel on Mustafar is really cool. Seeing Darth Vader at the end is exciting. Man I don't really cry at movies but I do chock up at order 66 getting carried out. Padme dying because she ""lost the will to live"" is kinda lame and some of Padme and Anakin's lines together are cringeworthy;something I would expect from a 14 year old. Overall though those are very minor things and don't really bring the movie enjoyment level down. So while I don't like this as much as the Original trilogy it's a solid film and one I actually look forward to watching."
2302,10,An historical achievement in cinematic history. A visual tsunami.,"A spectacular visual tsunami. Magical. Magnificent. Breathtaking. Overwhelming. Riveting. Unforgettable. Amazing. Canonical. A new level. In a class by itself. The audience went wild, completely absorbed with the events transpiring on the screen. Just showing up at the theater was an event. Just standing in line to get into the theater was as entertaining as most films. I never saw so many people focused on one thing."
2303,1,Best of the last three -- not that that's difficult,"Spoilers, oh, yes spoilers. Anakin turns to the dark side. Padme dies. The children, Luke and Leia are separated and put up for adoption."
2304,9,Revenge of the Sith - Scored x2,"A wonderful end to the series, bringing it all together very well. That, of course, was great for a guy who raised his sons on the first 3 episodes."
2305,10,Finest of the saga.,"Star Wars hasn't been doing so well lately. Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones both went down as pretty awful, and caused fans to lose all faith in Lucas. But you'd better start believing again. Lucas has created another masterpiece, surpassing even Empire Strikes Back for terms of sheer greatness."
2306,8,Much improved from previous prequels but still not perfect,"This film is no where near as good as Either A New Hope or Empire but, it is my favourite of the franchise. The reason? George Lucas obviously listened to his own fan base and therefore this film is largely void of all the politics and boring conversations that plagues the rest of the prequel trilogy. What he gave us instead was one and a half hours of space battles and Lightsaber Fights plus a little bit of politics (and romance ) to keep us on our toes. This one and half hours is all you need to watch if you have already watched this film. Other things to say are that the visual effects are a lot more flush that the ones in the previous prequels (albeit slightly plasticky) and I am shocked that this is the only film in the trilogy not to be nominated for special effects Oscar. In this film the plot is also conveyed much more fluidly to the audience and the ending (I won't spoil it for those whom have not watched) actually bears large emotional significance as we have got to know these characters now, as compared to the other prequels where nobody has any character trait and we don't care about them. Something that helps this is that the acting in this movie is really great and you can see that the actors are really trying with the lines that Lucas gave them especially Ewan McGregor."
2307,10,Wow.,Wow.
2308,,"Best of the prequels, but not the best of them all...",****Some Spoilers*****
2309,8,Did anyone interpret this?,"In the scene in the opera house of sorts. Palpatine tell the story of his master who he killed in his sleep. He said that his master was so powerful that he could manipulate medioclourines to create life. We all know that Anakin was conceived by the medioclourines. I took it that Palpatine actually created Anakin. Also, that Palpatine had been watching Anakin all his life waiting for the right time. Palpatine could have been feeding Anakin dreams to poison his mind. Believing that I was able to buy Anakins path to the dark side a lot easier. That aside, did anyone else get that Palpatine manipulated the medioclourines to conceive Anakin or am I just out of my mind? No one I saw it with got that, but when I explained it to them a few thought it made sense."
2310,8,"Successful ""Revenge of the Sith"" Concludes the Space Saga","The last chapter in the Star Wars saga, ""Revenge of the Sith"" brought audiences around the world to jam into theaters to witness the end of a box office blockbuster that began in the summer of 1977. George Lucas' brainchild & marketing giant has thrilled in the past & finishes with one of the most engrossing musical scores, best special effects, & most visually stunning sci-fi adventure film of all time. With cast returnees such as Ewan MacGregor (Obi-Won Kenobi), Hayden Christiensen (Anakin Skywalker), Natalie Portman (Senator Padme Amidala), Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu), Ian MacDairmid (Chancellor Palpatine), Frank Oz (Yoda), Jimmy Smits (Senator Organa)& Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) round out the all-star players. With incredible battle & flight scenes, music & sound effects, & an exciting storyline combine to create movie magic to all who view this film. "
2311,5,Pretty bland ending to a good series,"This movie finally puts an end to the 21st century Star Wars films. I have to think that if they weren't so good looking, if the special effects had to be downscaled, the story and acting in these episodes 1,2 &3 would be pretty dull. Thank goodness we still have the original films to watch (even tho they are marred by Lucas' updated changes). If episodes 4,5, & 6 were never made & these new ones had to stand on their own I don't think there would be that much fuss about Star Wars. Let's face it.. do you really hear everyone talking about this picture on the streets & everywhere else like we did when the films years ago were released. The new ones are just okay science fiction movies, no more, no less. I was really disappointed in this last one, I was expecting to be really WOWED!!!! and it was a real let down."
2312,5,Could have been much better...,"I am not really a huge Star Wars fan, I have however seen all of the movies and such. Revenge of the Sith was a total disappointment. The effects were kinda cool, but very overdone and we've seen it all before. The dialogue really sucked big time, very cheesy and unrealistic. Near the end when Darth Vadar yells ""NOOOOO"" I was just so disappointed. It's typical, unoriginal, whatever you want to call it, it pretty much ruined the movie for me. Some scenes were pretty good and I'm glad that the music was very good. It was slightly over the top at times but most of the time it was just right. All this movie needs is a good script, maybe even less over the top drama, make it a little less so and you've got a good movie. Right now it's a five, it could easily be a 7 with some work..."
2313,10,I'm gonna say it all!!!,"Just Awesome! That is all I have to say but IMDb wont let me stop there so I will continue by saying that despite the massive amount of jerks that are observed at a theater (in this case jerks that dress up) who try to cut infront of you even though you sat in line for four and a half hours, and despite the need their need to shout out Go Chewie! or Vader!! This was the most enjoyable movie experience I have had for at least two years. My fiancé works at a theater so I now see movies for free but before she did (about three months ago) we spent over 1,500 dollars per year in movie tickets alone! With the special effects, great acting and great direction, production, and editing I officially dub this movie, Movie Of The Year! Congrats to George Lucas on this one and may he make serious bank for it!"
2314,9,Now this is the star wars movie that was meant to be,"I just saw it last night, and must say, loved it from start to finish. To get the bad stuff out of the way first, which there is very little, Jar Jar actually is in the movie, HOWEVER, he only says ""scuse me"" and THAT""S IT, plus is walking up in a (SPOILER) Funeral scene for Amidala.(END SPOILER) Other than that, the only thing you really have to worry about is the scenes being too slow, which when they are are actually well done scenes (SPOILER) either dealing with Anakin and his slide to the dark side, disputes with the Council, and romance scenes.(END SPOILER) Now for the wonderful stuff, at least in my opinion. I wanted to believe that this one, in the end, was only a tad better than episode 2, but instead, I got what is miles and miles over that, and even better than return of the Jedi. As for New Hope and Empire, it does in my opinion surpass both of them, but only by a tiny margin. Why because I found the acting to be very well done, thanks to a supposed dialogue coach that Coppolla got Lucas, but still, no cheesy dialogue in love scenes, and no overacting the part of a drama king this time by Christensen. I know most people will say he can't act, but for crying out loud. Watch his other movies like Shattered Glass and Life as a House. The only reason he didn't do well in Episode 2 is because Lucas CANNOT communicate with his actors. But in this one, he has matured a little bit, but it's really when he's in the dark side that you'll see a greater performance."
2315,6,Revenge of the Theatre Seats,"30 minutes into this film I found myself thinking that I'll have a really exciting review to pass onto friends. ""The new Star Wars has the best effects yet!"" And that is where the excitement ended."
2316,,"Was worth the wait, but not exactly what I hoped for",Over the past few months I've been reading about this movie and just couldn't wait to see it. Even ordering tickets for a midnight showing over 2 months ago.
2317,10,With the Original Trilogy,"It was what it was, and then some, and was awesome. It did it's job by bridging the two trilogies. I felt this was a 9.5 out of 10, but rounded up to 10. The only problem I had was the bad dialogue between Anakin and Padme. It didn't give the actors much to work with and did not allow them to show off their abilities in those specific scenes. Great lightsaber and fighting scenes. The character development was beautiful in this. It was wonderful to see the concept of what was good and what was evil from different perspectives, and how cheap the dark side really was. The humor was set perfectly, and this was probably the one movie out of the six that became emotional for myself. And yes it was a bit lengthy, but almost each scene was important to the story. I was able to intake the movie as a whole and enjoyed it at the same time. Please go see this movie, enjoy this wonderful chapter."
2318,8,"Great Film, shame i missed the 'bloodbath'","George Lucas has directed his second good film. A New Hope obviously being the other. I knew what was going to happen anyway, as i had played all the games and read the script. I wasn't sure how some of the scenes were going to work out, as a lot of it is effects laden, and the last two weren't exactly vying for the effects Oscar, but by George, excuse that, he did a Star Wars film, not a movie for Hollywood, but a film, for fans mostly. Grevous, I thought, would be the rubbish character shamelessly added for high priced commercial toy sales, as he has more two arms, which is almost ten seconds extra wasted at the toy manufacturing plant, but no! It was an actual character, all right he died within the first half, or so, but he died well. And Hayden Christenson almost acted for a second. My only four problems were Yoda's constant backwards talking, a guy who shouted out the Imperial March as the BBFC rating came up, kids who had to be constantly taken out as they were scared of the violence, and the shameless advert for Sin City at the start, in which after that I heard four little kids say to their parents, 'I want to see that mummy, that looks good.' I mean it's an 18, or R/NC17 or whatever rating in America. Shamless. Be warned though, Vader's reconstruction and healing scene is particularly grisly, but James Earl Jones screaming 'NOOOOOOO!' afterwards is hilarious enough to keep you happy. The 12a made this film. Go and see it, or wait for the DVD. But don't get the septupligy box set or whatever, as you'd be paying Lucas for the two movies before this, and that is not what we want. And as a final note, Lucas, don't touch up this movie, you'll only ruin, just muck about with the crappy ones."
2319,8,The saga is complete,"After years and years of waiting, we now know why. Why Anakin fell to the dark side, how the Jedi were destroyed, how the Skywalker twins were hidden- and how the empire was born."
2320,7,Movie Review By MsClashKing YT,Revenge of the Sith is better than the movies before them but it does have it problems. Some of the Acting is off but the stakes and emotion are at a all time high . The Action is much better then attack of the clones and the Phantom Menace . 7/10 B-
2321,10,"A powerhouse movie with full ""Force""!! (possible spoilers)","Over twenty years ago, George Lucas created a movie that many felt would fail or at the very best gather only a small audience. Alas, Star Wars has become an empire in itself. Star Wars fans the world over drooled with anticipation when word of Episode I broke out, and it's monumental success was a testament to the power of the series. Episode II was also very good, very successful...yet it somehow lacked a little bit of the power that made Episode I so successful, despite (or maybe in spite of) the likes of Jar Jar Binks. Now George Lucas has brought us the chapter we have ALL been waiting for ever since Episode I came out: the actual visualization of Anakin Skywalker following the darkened path to his own doom. Taking place maybe 5 years or so after Episode II, Pademe' is pregnant with the twins we know will be Luke and Leia. Count Dooku and General Grievious are waging war on the Jedi Council and in the beginning of the film, they've got Senator Palpatine held hostage. Most of us, however, don't buy any of this for a second. We know, or perhaps only suspect, that it's all a set-up in Palpatine's elaborate plan to gain total control of the senate and turn it into his Galactic Empire. Anakin, meanwhile, has nightmares predicting Padame's death, and he's willing to do anything to save her. Even if it means learning the ways of the dark side of the force. Palpatine senses this and seizes on it as a grand opportunity to turn young Skywalker into his newest and most powerful apprentice. I'm not going to say much more here about the story line (I'm trying to stick to basics)but I will say that this was definitely one of the very best movies I have ever seen, and certainly a powerhouse landmark in the Star Wars series!!! We all know that we'll get to see Anakin and Obi-wan duke it out with their sabers; we also know that at some point Anakin will meet his near-fatal end on a planet consumed by lava pits, and that this will ultimately lead to his transformation to the infamous and world-renowned figure that is DARTH VADER. A wonderful movie, great story line, awesome action scenes. I do have to admit that a few of Anakin's lines before the final duel with Obi-wan are served a little stiff, but overall Hayden Christensen IS Anakin Skywalker and he does an incredible job in the role. Certainly no one else could do it better! The acting is incredible, the plot is dark, of course, but George knows where to draw the line to avoid offending anyone. Still, it's painful at times to watch Anakin stray to the dark side; he sacrifices so much for it. But we also hugely anticipate seeing the black mask of Vader that we know and love so well! 10 stars!!!"
2322,7,Don't Be Jaded,"........I so very rarely write anything on these boards, but I do always read through them.....to at least see other opinions on a film. Look, I'm 29 years old, and have been a Star Wars fan for life. My first tattoo at 17 was a Rebel Alliance symbol. I've watched and re-watched the original trilogy no doubt hundreds of times. When I used to write film reviews for The Prodigal Sun (Buffalo, NY) I almost always tried to find a way to weave a Star Wars reference into my reviews. Even after I joined the military, and went overseas, and got stationed thousands of miles from my home, I sought out Star Wars fans to associate with, to talk with, to bring back memories with....to watch the prequels at the theaters with. I too was severely disappointed in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. But, after seeing Revenge of the Sith, that disappointment had evolved into satisfaction, even pure enjoyment. Yes, there is cringe inducing dialogue, painful ""romantic"" scenes to endure, and for lack of a better word, childish occurrences and pandering. I'm not going to be your typical fan boy and point out each instance....you fans know what they are. But let's be honest: the original trilogy has its puerile moments as well. It's just that we view them through the rose colored glasses of youth and nostalgia. They transport us back to different times in our lives. They are most definitely superior, but we remember/view/regard them differently. A New Hope was a breath of fresh air to an era plagued by Vietnam, Watergate, the gasoline crisis, etc...Their sequels were highly anticipated because they were fresh and new. But folks, we have aged, and our viewpoints have changed, and we have become jaded filmgoers. I ask you to do as I did, and go see the film with fresh eyes, and marvel at the spectacle, the effects, the score, the mythos....and you will not be disappointed. Just enjoy it as true summer cinema, not a ""raping of your childhood"" or whatever the hardcore critics have deemed the new trilogy. These new films will never equal the original....they simply can't. Star Wars is a cultural presence by now, but even by Return of the Jedi, the critics and haters sprung up, and the myth had tarnished. If you don't believe me, just use your beloved internet to do some searching on old reviews and articles. So, for all this film's faults, go see it without being bitter and jaded, and you will enjoy it....completely. Thank you for your time----------- 1977-2005 ""The End of an Era"""
2323,10,Speechless.,"I left the theatre speechless. Most won't understand. Star Wars has made a huge impact on my life. And now its done. I cannot believe I am saying this, but this may very well be my favorite Star Wars film."
2324,4,Completely betrays the classic trilogy,"As with Episode 2, Revenge of the Sith completely betrays the classic Star Wars Trilogy. I'm one of the few who loved Return of the Jedi and didn't rate Empire as much (although it was still awesome in comparison to 2 and 3). "
2325,8,Great ending to the saga,"OK, where to begin? How about racing through a battle scene of cruisers and battleships over the skies of Coruscant. From the get-to, this movie has you riveted and hanging onto your seat."
2326,9,Very Satisfying End To The Prequel Trilogy,"Despite a few issues here and there, Revenge Of The Sith is a massive improvement over the previous 2 films with great performances from pretty much everyone, Beautiful CGI (Still looks great 14 years later), The emotional moments are strongly written, And the Lightsaber duels are fantastic here. Oh and I AM THE SENATE!"
2327,10,The Best of All SIX,"this FILM is great...it was exactly what i wanted and expected from Gorge Lucus...I kinda see now why it was rated PG-13, there is a multitude of death and the aniken burnt thing is kinda grungy but all in all its great... it fallowed the star wars guideline which must have been very hard on Gorge because he most likely couldn't write everything he wanted because we all know what happens after this stage in the star wars films...the graphics are AMAZING... it looks so real it's...well...its just amazing... people go out and see this...this should get best computer graphics award. anywho thats all for what i have to say enjoy the film"
2328,6,It didn't suck!,"While this was probably the best of episodes 1-3, it still isn't up to the standard set by Lucas with the original trilogy. Where episode 4 used the Hero's Journey story structure that Joseph Campbell popularized to ensure a well-written story and well-developed characters, this movie was more an exercise in connecting the dots--and that wasn't always done consistently."
2329,1,Not the way I hoped it would end,"This movie has a lot of problems in it, and I'll try to list them down. WARNING IT DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!"
2330,9,a story ends,"Before seeing this movie, i was afraid Christensen wasn't going to pull off this role, i mean look how innocent his peach face looked in Attack of the Clones. Even now i'm really surprised of his performance. He has truly transformed. His stare is an extraordinary feat! So EVIL. And for someone so young! I don't think someone looking tougher wouldn't have been so livable. That evil spark in his eyes, but his tone so sure he's doing good. Things don't go so well when he starts speaking, he's still a bit fake, but he has potential. I'm disappointed by Amidala. Portman is a good actress, but i don't see her struggling, suffering. It's all on the surface. Palpatine is wonderful:the tone of his voice, the body language, all exquisitely calculated. Chewbaca, i never really liked him. i think Lucas has a lot of these bug in the story, things that are useless, that don't add up. but i forgive him! Looking back at all the movies, it seems to me that aliens are really done wrong. i mean there either stupid, corny, or they are similar to humans, mentally speaking(Yoda, of course)"
2331,10,Equals the first three,"Finally a prequel that is the equal to the first 3. The first was a little blah the second was better but this prequel is easily the best. The action, characterization and results make this the equal to the first three. First, the weakness. In my opinion the one weakness in the movie is the script. It is adequate but could have been a lot better. The lines were high school level. Then again this is an action movie and there wasn't a whole lot of time left for pretty language. The dialog was good enough and explained adequately what was happening. The characterization was much better than the first prequel and better than the second. For an action movie, you can understand why these people do what they do instead of fight for no reason. The results. Well everyone knows what is going to happen if they've seen the original trilogy. However how the results occur were satisfying. The action was superb and what else could you expect? The action made logical sense in that the characters reacted to the technology very naturally. Things made sense. The things that are there do more than make interesting scenes (although they do that too). The plot--who doesn't know what's supposed to happen? Are the 6 movies now one? I think so, but I will let you decide how much so. Go see this one at the cinema.Stand in line or buy your tickets online which is what I did. Get caught in the hoopla! I think it was worth it."
2332,9,Come on...,"I am 22 years old. I'm not dumb. I'm a college graduate and have a job and am doing just fine for myself. George Lucas didn't make this movie for ""dumb kids"" as I have read in many of the posts on this website. Give me a break. I loved ""Sith"". As somebody who has been a fan of all the movies (yes, even Phantom and Clones), I can definitely say that this was the most plot oriented movie of them all."
2333,9,"Overall, a very good movie","Unlike most of the people who have commented on this movie, I enjoyed the first two prequels, although the second one was a little too rushed to be logical."
2334,9,Best of the Prequels,The finale of the Star Wars saga would undoubtedly evoke expectations of gargantuan proportions from the fans. To come up with everything that the fans want and still make enough sense for a Hollywood movie (which incidentally is not all that much) - would be impossible.
2335,1,About a human who evolved into a part robot but gave us robotic acting throughout instead. We have been taken for a ride thru the stars.,"First thing first, Lucas wanted to tell us a story. Its a good story but Lucas is not a good story teller. (Now my suspicion is confirmed that Star Wars and Empire are the exceptions rather than the norm. 2 out of 6 is bad right?) Consistently wooden acting (except for Portman) and appalling script! But wait, what about the special effects? For the life of me I still don't understand why movies want to compete with computer games. Or CGI should overwhelm the tale. Like the mechanical critters that repair Obi's (or is it Anakin's? I don't care) spaceship. Many of the creatures/androids or other non humans that require no acting ability are redundant. Lucas should learn to rely less on special effects and start to rely on people with story telling abilities, starting from the script and the director. It amazes me that fans complain how bad the prequels are YET still subject themselves to the franchise. I dread the day when movies have so much action but so little acting."
2336,6,"Yea, Okay!","This was by far the better of the last 3 installments. Ewan McGregor gave a lovely and believable performance and Hayden Christensen was slightly improved, but he's still young, so never mind that. The story was more engrossing than that of the previous ones and the fighting scenes weren't so long and tedious that you became bored with them. Natalie Portman should have had more screen time but the time that she was on, did give you a good glimpse into why the rest of the story unfolded the way that it did, although she could have done a little better as far as her acting. It's really ashame that the others weren't as engrossing as this one, but it was well worth he wait to finally see some justice brought to the end of this series."
2337,7,"Engaging story, great visuals overcomes flat acting","Revenge of the Sith is a fast-moving, intense story supported by some spectacular visual scenery and special effects. For what it is, it also deals intelligently with two pretty serious themes: 1) how a democracy gives up its authority and 2) how a person loses his fight with his own demons. Only two actors (Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor) give solid performances (as well as a computer-generated Yoda) and the chemistry between some of the characters is really not there (the dialog probably didn't help). Although Hayden Christensen is a good actor, he did not seem to command the presence or intensity I would have associated with a young Darth Vader. However, the fun and innocence that is associated with many Star Wars movies is there, and combined with the intensity of the last 30-40 minutes, the movie provided great entertainment. Compared to the previous two Star Wars, this one also stands up better to repeat viewing."
2338,7,DC Premiere,It is very exciting to note that I am one of the first people to see the last Star Wars film. It is safe to say that this movie is better than Episodes I and II but still fails to achieve the standard set by the original movies. Lucas still relies too much on graphics and effects and his dialog is dry as ever. Thankfully the story picks up very quickly and there is seldom a dull moment. I do find his scene transitions incredibly annoying but nonetheless the editing and pacing were acceptable.
2339,8,Great plot,Great movie and easily the best of the prequal trilogy. Some of the writing is poor but it can be looked over with the a advantages of this film. ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................
2340,10,A movie for all time,"Star Wars Episode III is a great movie. The characters are marvelous specially Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor), Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). George Lucas has gave us a wonderful gift, a movie that all the fans will remember forever. Now we can truly say that the circle is complete. In my opinion this is the second best movie of the saga. I still consider The Empire Strikes Back as the best but Revenge of the Sith is the next and it has been made for adult audiences. I was thrilled watching the movie because there are many moments of profoundly emotions. This is not the final. I expect with interest the developing of the two TV series specially the live-action series that will bring new characters and new stories to the galactic saga that have been with us since 1977. Thank You George Lucas !"
2341,1,Lucas to star in directors cut?,I want to express my sympathy for all the people who worked hard at producing these movies but who's effort was sold out by Lucas greed for money. 
2342,7,not too shabby.,"The first thing I thought to myself when I saw the opening space battle was that Lucas' faith in CGI was founded, and I did understand why he opted for CGI as opposed to the old-school models that we found so appealing. It was always said that the beauty of A New Hope was the opening; once the audience bought it, you had them where you wanted them. The same can be said of Revenge of the Sith. It didn't live up to all our expectationsin a way, that'd be hard to dobut with that said, I went out of the cinema thinking that it wasn't too shabby, which is more than what I can say for the memories that were Episode One and (the significantly better) Episode Two. I still don't buy Lucas' statements that the Star Wars story is Anakin's story; I see it as one big mix of nuts."
2343,10,ALAS the last episode that goes out with a bang...,"The best of the three prequels with amazing projection same as the originals. This has a different feel, the star wars feel. Certainly satisfying most fans urge for a last star wars masterpiece. The cgi's were truly breathtaking and so as the fights scenes. Concentration on the main characters and sticking to the original plot without any sideplots or minor characters ruining the show,made it even more interesting."
2344,6,Not a bad movie.. but I still feel its a wasted opportunity to create a masterpiece.,"Yes. The movie is good and its great to finally see the link between episode II and episode IV. I would also have to say that I enjoyed the show nevertheless, the relatively low score that I gave to the movie (which is surprisingly contradicting with the general opinion of people) is justified form my opinion."
2345,8,"The End, My Only Friend","There are many that will talk about how bad the previous two STAR WARS prequels were, as if there was absolutely no process of thought involved in either of them. Now, with REVENGE OF THE SITH, they are jumping up and down with acclaim."
2346,5,"Lucas, the dark side ,consumed you it has.",If special effects are the dark side where acting and character interaction are the good then Lucas truly is the Sith Lord.
2347,8,A good bridge between PT and OT; very moving,"Overall, I was very satisfied with this movie. It is easily better than Episodes 1 & 2, although I didn't hate those movies like many of you do. In this movie good and evil clash unlike in any other Star Wars movie, with evil winning out. The movie is quite dark, even darker than 'Empire', well worth the PG-13 rating. I applaud Lucas for going for that in this movie, especially since the story warrants it. Even though we know that Anakin is going to choose the Dark Side in this film, Lucas still grips us and creates great emotional tension. I kept wishing in my mind that he(Anakin) wouldn't do it, but of course he does. That's the sign of a good filmmaker when he/she can do that to an audience even when they know what to expect. "
2348,10,I NEVER CRIED more than once watching the same movie over and over...,"This movie has fixes its dialogue issues,where everyone blames the prequels that had cringy and cheesy dialogue in episode I and II i don't mind that and for me all the prequels are equal to the originals,i forgive every mistake they have and apprieciate and LOVE whats the best they got to offer like Darth maul,count douku,general grievous.e.t.c and the best part is the MUSIC IN EPISODE III its so sad and memorable,the turn of Anakin(my most favorite and misunderstood jedi)to the Dark side is done in a perfect pace,the film doesn't feel rushed and its CGI from 2005 holds even today at 2017 with movies that have incredible CGI. 23/11/2017 is the date i saw the movie for like the 5th time? on my home cinema and i cried again cause i feel a strong EMPATHY to Anakin's pain of his mother loss,of being a slave and never had a happy and normal childhood,Episode III has some flaws but if u are a PASSIONATE Star Wars fan u should do your self a favour and ignore them(episode III has the fewest flaws from the rest of the prequels IMO)and try to ENJOY this one in particular cause if u hate it just like some people hate The Force Awakens u wont enjoy the movie and its a shame if u are in love with the Star Wars Universe.The line delivery from Christensen Hayden are powerful and very much believable.The musical score as i said is PHENOMENAL and even if the original star wars films(which i love so much too for their own uniqueness they offer is very memorable and awesome,its very emotional and strong and fits the anger and sadness Anakin has in him.If YOU stop watching a dialogue between someone and stop criticizing it u wont CRINGE,and you will apprieciate the film more.Amazing choreography of all the light saber fights especially the one with Anakin and Obi-wan,not even episode 7 and i believe 8 THE LAST JEDI will make a better choreographed scene with a heavy emotional weight and musical score at the same time,this movie is my favorite out of all the star wars movies saga.I wont BOTHER to mention the flaws of the movie since for me its almost,ALMOST flawless,especially with the Anakin character who you should do some research before you criticize someone who acts like a today's teenager and is not shown any respect,care or love=Anakin."
2349,8,"Hey, Episode 3 was Great...","Well, i'm pretty happy with the movie i saw in theaters that day. It was the Originals, gone CGI. Finally, a prequel that lives up to the old ones...thats what some people think. I like all the films almost equally, but this is one the best by a very,very,very slim hair. The cast was great, the love scenes weren't killing, and the music. Oh, the music. Vader's march found its way in there, and it was a beautiful movie to watch. As a kid I always asked my parents ""Why is Vader so mean?"" They said something that doesn't live up to what i hoped, and now George Lucas has brought an amazing film. A must see. The lightsaber fights were mad Awesome, and this makes the complete circle, and Star Wars sadly has come to an end"
2350,10,"WOW... Just, WOW!","Lucas has finally pulled it together. He pulled together a film that completely redeemed himself from the disastrous first two episodes. In a story resembling more classic Greek tragedy than Science Fiction, in Revenge of the Sith, Anakin turns to the Dark Side, dragging down the Jedi order down with him. FAntastic performances all around, especially from Ewan Macgregor(more like Alec Guiness than ever), Natalie Portman (She's perfect in the scene between her and Obi-Wan, where she denies what Anakin has done), Hayden Christiansen (He must've taken acting lessons, but he was SO much better) and finally, Ian Macdiarmid as Palpatine. This final performance steals the show far and away. He is perfect in every scene he's in, notably the scene with Anakin at the opera and the scene of Anakin's conversion. The special effects have also taken a huge leap (Yoda is actually believable; it's like you're looking at the puppet again)and the lightsabers are flying. The many duels show almost every match's you could imagine, but the one we've been waiting for steals the show! The battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is filled with such pent-up rage and sorrow, it brings you into it in way Phantom Menace could only dream of. The music by John Williams in this scene (and throughout the film) demonstrate a world collapsing in on itself and the classic tragedy that Lucas promised. Finally, the scene in which Vader returns to the screen hits you like a freight train, it's everything we ever wanted. The music used by Williams in this scene as well is fantastic, albeit recycled from Phantom Menace. If the Academy was truly an unbiased organization, this film would have been nominated in several categories, least of all visual effects. Well, I highly recommend this film to anyone reading this who hasn't, as well as encourage fans to return to this film one last time. And for all those who bash this film, hey, at least there are no Ewoks."
2351,4,"In short: great visuals, good sound, so-so direction, bad script and really bad dialogue. Best actor: Yoda.","In my childhood, Star Wars was great. Episode IV through VI, I loved it. And of course I had to see the other Episodes. What a disappointment. The original Episodes dared and were a bit like child's play, like fairy tales in space. This was their charms. On the prequels, there were too much expectations, and Lucas - despite his power and money - didn't dare to frustrate any of them. But if all you get is expected, it gets more or less boring. "
2352,10,The Anti-Phantom Menace,"Wow. A lot more than I was expecting. This is, without a doubt, the only prequel film that can live up to the original trilogy. This movie has so much depth and heart to it, and anybody who doesn't like this film is either just biased against the prequels, or simply has a heart of stone. This movie takes place in three parts: The space battle, the seduction of Anakin, and the end of the Jedi and Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader."
2353,10,George Lucas proves himself,"This movie is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I think George Lucas was saving all his creative power for this episode. The story, the cinematography, the rhythm of the scenes, the soundtrack... all just really came together and produced what I would call the perfect movie. He employed techniques I have not seen him use before, such as deeply emotional, moving scenes, and some scenes that invoked images of Ridley Scott's Gladiator, giving this futuristic world and almost Romanesque feel. The suspense building up to Anakin's conversion is a feeling that I want to experience time and time again. To be sure, I have already seen the movie three times and will return for a fourth before it leaves theaters."
2354,3,The Force is Yet again not with this movie,"It is the best of the Star Wars prequels, it is the worst of movies. Lucas creates a visually stunning picture show, with amazing effects, interesting scenes, and dazzling perspectives. He then ruins all of this with a story that is so poorly written that suspending your disbelief is in effective. Darth Sidious couldn't convince me to join the dark side, he also couldn't act this way out of a paper bag. The portrayal of an extremely evil man is cookie cutter and stale. Natalie Portman must be getting lessons from Ian McDiarmid, because both of their styles are similar if not the same. They both take the poorly written lines, and poorly execute them. Hayden Christianson, is oh god bad throughout the movie. One would think that if a person was portraying what has a become a cultural icon for evil, that they would be able to do evil, instead we get to much of the whiny impetuous Anakin that we got in the other two movies. Ewan steal the show, and not just because he has * gasp* good intelligent lines, but because he really plays Obiwan Kenobit, as Jedi knight. If only somehow someone could have told me this movie was so bad I would have saved myself the money and gone to see Monster-In-law. At least at the end of that movie I would have gotten some love from my lady rather than an immense amount of criticism for yet another poorly chosen film."
2355,4,Rotten movie - unbearable direction and script,Special Effects? Lets start there... because they are good. Very good. Not perfect -- they seem just a little too CG at times. But overall the film delivers on the visuals.
2356,6,"Better than the Disney trilogy, but falls short of what it needed to be.","This is my opinion on the prequel trilogy as a whole: Good ideas, bad execution."
2357,5,Wasted Potential,"I honestly do not understand the positive reviews that this movie has been receiving  both here and by professional critics. Yes, Episode III is leaps and bounds ahead of the horrible Episode I and slightly-less-horrible-but-still-really-bad Episode II, but that fact alone does not make it into a good movie. The entire prequel trilogy, but this more episode more than the previous two, represent a superb story that is told horribly."
2358,8,"Effective and dark, but still lacking","The Star Wars series of films ends with a mixed but conclusive entry. The film is very impressive - from the massive air battle (and it is HUGE) accompanied by a throbbing beat, this delves straight into the action. Christensen and McGregor have matured not only as actors but as characters - and from the manner of Dooku's death, this really isn't a PG friendly Ewok-fest. The historical parallels add extra texture - one shot of the Jedi Temple burning in the distance, is very reminiscent of the Pentagon burning on 9/11 - and the Night of the Long Knives in Germany 1933, when Hitler took power. Lucas more or less, constructs the story wonderfully, and there is no let up in the battle scenes - Grievous's 4 Lightsaber duel with Obi Wan is a high point. It does have qualities of a very grand Greek tragedy, the whole structure carefully and expertly descending Anakin into hell i.e. Mustafar the lava planet."
2359,8,"Relives most of the Spirit, but doesn't take us to EMPIRE and JEDI","by far the best of the prequel trilogy, since Episode I was playful, yet goofy, and Episode II was just nothing more than a stray. still, despite ""Revenge of the Sith""'s high production quality, disturbing moments and vicious battles, it still lacks the great quotes people have been repeating since 1977, and the charm of actors like Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams. the connection to the original trilogy and the recent films is complete, yet still a little shaky. all in all, i'm not going to be picky about it. the film is nothing short of fantastic, and it is highly, HIGHLY entertaining. the characters, such as Yoda, Mace Windu and Darth Sidious (especially him)were so well handled by Lucas that it's enough to redeem him for all of his odd mistakes with the whole Star Wars saga. kudos to the man in plaid. we were waiting for one of the prequels to nearly live up to the original trilogy. i still prefer episodes IV, V and VI over the newer ones. then again, who doesn't?"
2360,1,Like millions screaming in pain,"Sometimes I wonder if I misunderstood the common rules of the free market. Shouldn't one try to optimize a product before putting it up for sale to gain maximum customer satisfaction and profit? Mr. Lucas once again makes me wonder. How can the director and inventor of maybe the most intriguing science fiction universe in film history deliver for the third time a piece that can hardly be called a movie? Maybe because it wasn't Lucas that made the former episodes what they were, but his team. Now, 25 years later, maybe nobody at Lucasfilms is left, to give in some creative impulses worth being mentioned. Instead, a bunch of YES-men spent their time producing a film based on a script and conceptional layout, that a skilled writer could have done in his lunch break including most of the important dialogues we were punished to witness in ROTS. I stopped counting the logical errors - some of them so severe, that Mr.Lucas and his team might have done good, asking some fans who know their movies a lot better than themselves. But the brutal way in which so many of the ingredients that made the Star Wars saga what it is today, where degraded and mutilated, leaves me speechless."
2361,10,So awesome,"That movie had me from start to finish. I'm so glad I never saw a single trailer or knew really anything about it, because it made it so much more intense. And contrary to most people, I actually believed Vader's ""Nooooooo!!!"". This movie kicked the asses of I & II, and it at least rivals IV & V, for sure. I hear all kinds of criticism of Lucas, but I don't hesitate in calling him a genius. The man came up with one of the most captivating stories ever, and no matter how cheesy the dialogue was or how many plot holes there were, if you're willing to open up, drop the cynicism and get into a movie like this, you surely won't regret it."
2362,6,Better than the other two at least,"I heard that this film was better than the other two (I, II). That is true, but after ten minutes or so I had the urge to leave the theatre. It starts out with utterly useless sitcom scenes with R2D2 which were hardly funny and really made me feel that the R2D2 from the original films (IV, V, VI) is some kind of an obsolete cousin of Revenge's R2D2. I am mentioning this due to the fact that it really feels like technology in IV-V-VI has taken an IMMENSE step back from I-II-III."
2363,5,"No spoiler, Short and sweet","I did not care as much for this movie. I went in with a New hope and was sorely let down after 15 minutes. The story dragged on the acting wasn't as good as it could be, the special effects were sweet, but it bored me so much I fell asleep in the theater."
2364,9,Way better than 1 and 2 but...,"It was impossible for George Lucas to have something as good as 4 and 5, but still he was close with this one, because Episode 3 goes beyond everybody's expectations."
2365,9,George has returned from the dark side!,"When I walked out the cinemas the only scene that kept repeating in my head was when Luke was holding Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi, but instead of Anakin its George Lucas."
2366,10,Finally!!!,At last! Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is out. It was a great film. It connected the two sagas together perfectly.
2367,2,Yet another CGI ridden piece of schmuck,"Please stop milking the public of every single dime it's worth with this series. It may have been something to admire 30 years ago, but today it is a tired story just aching to be over with. And thank goodness it is. I'm not quite sure if I could take anymore of this just to find out what happened. I mean, come on, we all knew what happened anyway. Skywalker becomes Vader, he is Lukes father, and blah blah blah. I understand why some die hard fans may be crazy over this film, but if you're just a little bit of a fan, or not at all, do not waste any money on this film, whether it be at the theater, on DVD, etc. I wish I would have stayed home and watched TV with my girlfriend, since that is always entertaining. But don't get me wrong; I used to be a fan at one point. I am however, very sad to see this series be ""completed"" like this. Mediocre attempt and delivery, Mr. Lucas."
2368,7,A movie that can match episode VI,"I went to see this film in its opening day. I was very excited for this film and seriously after being a fan from the other ones, except Episode II, I realize this film is way better than the other two of the trilogy which is very strange because it doesn't suffer from the trilogy curse. Revenge of the Sith is better than its predecessors. This film is well made with an acceptable script, brilliant special effects and very good action. Its also an entertaining film, but not from beginning to end. The opening sequence is amazing, huge battles but poor lines. Then it starts with the same emotional conflicts that Anakin suffers since the second film. His mentor doesn't help him enough. So, suddenly with absolute no reason at all, Anakin becomes bad. OK, there are reasons, but they are incredible stupid. Anakin is incredible stupid. Then, the cast... The only decent performance in the entire movie is Christopher Lee and he doesn't last too long. Again, the light saber battles relie in CGI an not of great choreography like in Episode I. The script is short, nevertheless the movie is long and it turns boring. The lack of lines is irritating specially at the end. In the end, revenge of the sith is an enjoyable film and is enough for fans expectations. But still is no match for the original trilogy."
2369,1,For shame,"If you are over the age of 26 or so and you have posted a positive review of this film, you are a galactic a.s.s.w.i.p.e. This film is the final piece of proof that the original trilogy was truly the greatest occurrence of cosmic luck. Had Lucas been able to use the digital technology that we have today in 1970s and 80s, the original films would have undoubtedly been as terrible as the new trilogy. We should all feel blessed that Lucas was confined by the times and the technology. This new film proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that with unlimited resources Lucas will pour unlimited quantities of pure human s.h.i.t. onto the screen. The actors are not to blame. The story is not to blame. George Lucas simply cannot contain his impulses to digitize anything and everything regardless of how ridiculous and insignificant. Can anyone tell me why he would digitize two clone troopers standing next to one another talking? Does this retard actually think that it looks better than the real thing. Unlike the slick largely analog effects of the original trilogy, none of the digital effects of the new films will stand the test of time. Anyone who doubts this assertion should sit down and watch the once mind blowing digital effects of Total Recall, etc. This new film is a horrible rotten pile of s.h.i.t. I hate you George Lucas you stupid arrogant weenie."
2370,10,"Dark, sad, brilliant and exciting","Rare are the movies where unforgettable scenes follow unforgettable scenes, and this Episode III is one of them. Chills take you as soon as the first note of the martial and powerful intro scene music rings out, and don't leave your spin till the moving end : it's dark, deeply dark, tense and violent; it leaves you sad and disturbed as if you just witnessed the end of a world. Love, hate and power, global war and private battles mingle with one another into a brilliant and exciting futuristic, classic and timeless opera. Hayden Christensen's strength and darkness as an Anakin slowly becoming Darth Vader impress and although you already know he's to turn horribly wrong you just can't help waiting and wanting and enjoying to see it happen. Even defeated and disabled, he is a great tragic hero. Something in his story touches deep inside of your heart. It belongs to legends, and for this as for its writing, acting and direction qualities, this movie is a legend."
2371,10,Pure genius.,"I have to admit, I wasn't exactly a huge Star Wars fan before this film. Probably because of my theory: ""If you didn't see the old Star Wars trilogy at a young age, it's extremely hard to get into them when you're older."" I have seen this film 6 times at the movie theaters. 2nd most of all time for me. (Losing to Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, which I saw 14 times at the theaters.) I must say that every time I've seen Revenge of the Sith it has been an enjoyable and action packed time for me. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor did great acting jobs in this film as well as the supporting cast. Natalie Portman is ""good to look at"", but her acting skills are, ""bleh"". The transformation into Darth Vader was brilliant and the saber fights were extreme loads of fun. I recommend this film to everyone of every age group. It's a class flick and will never be forgotten...""May the force be with you""."
2372,8,"""Sith"" Prevails!","It has been my tradition to watch star wars film during 12 midnight, the first showing according to the film's original release date. My reactions for ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" are almost the same. Both films weren't able to impress me that much. That into mind, I expected the same thing in ""Revenge of the Sith"". I wasn't even excited for it anymore. To my surprise, ""Revenge of the Sith"" was able to charm me back to become a hardcore fan! It was fun and enjoyable. It was astonishing how 2 hours and 20 minutes seemed so short."
2373,10,George Strikes Back!,"This film excels both dramatically and visually (I could easily watch those battle sequences at the start for over an hour!), not to forget the meaningful message that freedom dies in the thunder of applause.. The powerfully disturbing imagery of Annikin at the end reminds us of the horrors of war, which should put a damper on politicians who churn out absolutist rhetoric such as 'you are either with us, or against us'. The ghoulish pallid face of the Chancellor, that ugly lip/tongue twitch thing, writhing on the floor, will no doubt haunt many nightmares to come. I just can't believe this was the same team that made the 2 previous episodes, I mean how is that possible!!? The Revenge of the Clones had shallow sequences cutting to and fro after a fews seconds' worth of each, which was just a barrage or blur of fancy CG and not much else. Annikin (Hayden) has really matured in this one, and Kenobi (Ewan) has lost some of his cockiness to really make him melt into the role so endearingly portrayed back in 1977. F A B U L O U S STUFF"
2374,8,The Circle is Complete,"I wondered about this movie. How would it all tie together? How would the story unfold? Would Lucas screw it up? Well, the answers go.....beautifully, invigoratingly, and no, most definitely not."
2375,10,"Lucas did an Excellent job, hats off to him","I love Star Wars... I was realized on it when I was little... So of course when I found out that they were gong to make a new trilogy, i was totally excited... I was 11 at the time Ep.1 came out, and needless to say, I was disappointed... it was nearly as good as it should have been.. So when I saw the second, the same thing happened... and the third one? Well, I'm used to disappointment... But oh how wrong was I? I think Lucas NAILED this one. not only were the graphic good, but the storyline was awesome too. everything tied right in with IV, V, and VI. I was extremely impressed, and i felt a sense of closure.. for the fans, i totally recommend it, but if you're not a fan, and haven't even seen the old ones yet, then don't bother, cause you wouldn't understand.... Its a force thing..."
2376,6,Mostly Boring...,Mostly boring. 
2377,5,You had to read the book...or buy the extended DVD,"I have got to hand it to Lucus He has finished his epic and He did it his way. It is complete etc. No wait! It is not complete! In order for most of us movie goers to really make out what is happening we have to buy the DVD extended play version to get all the extra bridging scenes that can make sense out of some of the chaos of these last 3 movies. Is that fair? No but it was impossible to tell the ""big story"" in only 8 hours. You don't want to watch the extended version to get a real grip on the story line? Buy the books. It tells you what is happening. Sudsy prose but you get a fair idea of the big picture. Prehaps that is a cheat but.... well that is the 21st century of film-making. The ""meaning"" can't be crammed into the time allowed. Prehaps a marathon of the extended play renditions of the last three movies with a bottomless bag of popcorn is what we need."
2378,5,"10 Years Laters on a Computer Far, Far Away","I recently rewatched the new trilogy; as a child I discovered the original trilogy in the mid-90s. I remember watching the complete, un-remastered versions, the one that made you fall in love with the story. The one where the blue hue in the light saber wasn't extremely bright, but still a great look, the one where Han shot first and you were okay knowing that he was basically a drug-dealing murderer...with a heart of gold! My review of SW3 is conflicting; if you look at the movie wholly for what it is, the story isn't lacking anything you would expect; it has great action, a lot of lightsaber dueling, the constant fight between the good and the bad. The issues that I have with this film are many, and by complaining I feel as though I may be letting the younger version of myself down. At any rate, here we go: Here's the true issues to this movie and why movie goers may not enjoy this flick: 1) This movie has no real surprises, we know that having watched the original trilogy and the previous two movies, that certain things will happen: A) Anakin will align with the dark side and will become the new sith lord, Darth Vader. B) The clones will eventually be aligned with the dark side and will take on the form of the Stormtroopers. C) Darth Sidious, aka Chancellor Palpatine, will become the emperor, having complete control of the senate. D) This is move is the link between what was seen in SW2 and SW4, so we know that the Jedi's are destroyed but both Yoda and Obi-wan make it out alive. We know that Padmae will die during childbirth and give birth to Leia and Luke, and we know that Luke goes to live with his Uncle where as Leia is adopted by a royal family. 2) The acting is simply bad. Even some of the veteran actors like Samuel L Jackson were just bad, too stiff. I suppose the horrible parts were the various screams like when Mace Windu lost his hand or when Darth Vader screams out ""NOOOOOOOOO"". Just bad. While I was against the casting of Ewan McGregor (please see SW1 & 2 for reasons why) he did very well in this movie. While I would agree that Hayden Christensen probably was NOT the best person for the movie, his acting performance does lend itself to what we saw in SW1 to what we see in SW4 to the final scenes of SW6 where Darth Vader shows regret. Yes, he does act very immature/childish, then again, that was exactly what Vader became, a self-centered, rage-infused, power-hungry jack-tard. Granted, I agree that ""NOOOOOOO"" is not the best acting, and you could also through in scenes like the one where he pledges his allegiance to Sidious (worst bit of acting in the bunch, in my opinion). Overall, I felt like he was exactly what the role called for, but I also believe there were better options for that role as well. 3) Timeline Issues: I know having read many reviews in the past that a lot of people have seen this and agreed, starting with SW1 that the age of Anakin is simply too young. Based on the time line of the progression here is the approximate age of Anakin: SW1 - 10, SW2 - 20, SW3 - 23, SW4 - 43, SW5 - 46, SW6 - 47. The actor who played Anakin in SW6, Sebastian Shaw, was 78 years old at the time of the portrayal, nearly 31 years older than the role. You could make the generalization that using the force makes you older, however, we know that at the time Alec Guinness played Obi-Wan, he was 63 and the character would have roughly been 61, assuming that the character established in SW1 is the same age as the actor, to which Ewan McGregor was 28 at the time (Making him 38 in SW2 and 41 in SW3). You could say that using the dark side makes you look older, which is why Emperor Palpatine still seems lively even at the end of SW6 when he's engaged in the fight. In any case, I think that aging him even 5-10 years would have yielded a lot better acting (which means a better actor could have been cast for both Jake Lloyd and Christensen). It would have also made him more age appropriate for his love interest with Amadala. The downside of being a higher age is that the innocence may have already been gone. Could Qui-gon have sensed this potential rage in him had he been a little bit older? 4) Lastly, like many, I have seen the original trilogy and because of that, I am familiar with the weaponry, the ships, the technology, and unfortunately, instead of seeing more primitive examples in comparison to the original, we see a lot of improvements from ship dynamics to guns. The fact that R2D2 can both fly and can catch a radio is disturbing on many levels, though his rockets are eventually broken, explaining why he cannot fly in future films. The droids that Dooku and Grievous uses are obviously much better off than what we see going forward, not to mention that Grievous himself is a much more evolved AI unit than we see again (and why does he have a cough?). "
2379,10,Tale of the Tragic Hero.....,"My ticket to the midnight screening was bought a few weeks in advance.  The two hour drive from Los Angeles to San Diego was hampered just a little by routine L.A. traffic on southbound I-5.  I could've stayed in Los Angeles and caught the film at my favorite theater, the Arclight,but the experience just wouldn't have been the same without my friends who were just as loyal and enthusiastic to see this film as I was. "
2380,10,George Lucas' Masterpiece,"Revenge of the Sith is the best film George Lucas has ever directed and is the cornerstone of the Star Wars Saga. The most emotional and moving Star Wars film is anchored by the best acting of the series. Hayden Christensen fully embraces the darkside and makes his transformation from Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into the evil Darth Vader believable. Ian McDiarmid steals every scene he's in as the devilish Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Frank Oz as the fully digital Yoda is so real you forget he comes from a computer. Strong support also comes from Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala, Sam Jackson as Mace Windu and Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa. However it is Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi who is the center of the film as well of the prequel trilogy. He has elevated the Jedi Master Kenobi, played by Sir Alec Guinness in the original trilogy, to become the heart and soul of the Saga."
2381,7,Initial reactions ***SPOILER ALERT***,"I liked this movie better than the rest (except for Empire). I just got out of the movie, and want to do a brain dump on some thoughts, so forgive me if they aren't organized."
2382,9,Pure Awesomeness!!!,"I was so happy after watching this, after the abomination called the Phantom Menace and the decent Attack of the Clones, this is exactly what I needed to see! Anakin as he becomes the Sith we all know! The beginning started off with introducing us to General Grievous; one of the coolest bad guys ever! Then we found out the Palpatine was Lord Sidious; also a surprise! Them Order 66 was executed which was sad but the ending Anakin versus Obi-Wan was what made this movie so freaking awesome!!!"
2383,2,Horrible...,I really wanted to give this film a chance. I was a great fan of the originals from the 1970's and 1980's.
2384,2,"Bang, you thought it was all good didn't ya?","When I first saw this movie I thought Lucas had made up for past mistakes on Ep I and II. After seeing it again, and a few more times, I can say that I feel he has made a movie worse then the others."
2385,4,Therapeutic Writing Excerise - **Contains Spoilers**,"That's it?.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! :) I loved Episode IV, saw it at 8 years old, had the action figures too. My favorite was ROTJ though... I've since taken MY kids to see Episodes I & II, realizing that Lucas added some cotton candy in the stories to attract kids that have seen sci-fi flicks all their lives. Sci-Fi is nothing new to an 8 year old in 2005. BUT - I went to episode III not so much for my kids, but for myself. The question WHY was going to be answered... Luke's father in ep. IV appeared to be pure evil, but we would see what and how his human side was turned and how/why he became the ""Dark Father""..."
2386,10,Great Movie for Star Wars Fans,"This is a great movie period!! Don't believe all the print and reviews that you see that the acting is bad. Hayden Christensen does a great job in his acting as does Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, all do a great job in acting. This is a movie that once you start watching you will not want to leave. SPOILER WARNING: The acting of Hayden (Anakin) when he is confronted by Ewan (Obi-wan) and Natalie (Padme) after the attack at the Jedi temple is a great job in him showing the emotion that he is feeling and the troubles that he is having with all of the things that are going around him. With knowing the death to Padme. And during the final fight that has Obi-wan defeating Anakin so as that you think he is dead until the emperor saves him and makes him into Darth Vader he also does a great job in showing the anger and the confusion. END SPOILER: so overall this is a great movie in which Goerge Lucas does a heck of a job to tie all the movies in together and in a way that everyone will understand without any confusion as they leave the theater. BEGIN SPOILER RECAP: War is still strong/ Anakin starts to dream about Padme's death/ Supreme Chancellor Palpatine starts to tell things that Anakin wants to hear/ Supreme Chancellor Palpatine tells that the Jedi are now enemies of the Republic/ many Jedi die including by the hand of Anakin/ Padme is almost killed by Anakin/ Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia/ Anakin becomes Darth Vader and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine becomes the Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious that everyone knows/ Padme dies while giving birth/ twins are separated/ Vader is now the right hand man of the Emperor and thus the trilogy is now complete END SPOILER RECAP. So in closing this is a movie that any star wars fan has to see and one that he or she will be talking about for a long time to come along with wanting to buy the DVD when it come out"
2387,10,The circle is complete,"Fantastic film, great story and jaw dropping SFX. All loose ends and tied up pretty well, leaving very few unanswered questions."
2388,4,Like a chore to watch,"Let's face it, if you're at all interested in Star Wars, have seen any of the other movies, or are just mildly curious about what all the fuss is about, you will watch this movie. So the producers of the film are in a winning situation no matter what. But to me, this seemed like a chore to watch. Maybe the challenge of making a prequel, but it plodded along to the inevitable events we all knew would happen. Anakin's abrupt change from expressing his love to Pad Mai and their unborn child to slaughtering younglings in the Jedi temple was hard to swallow. So was her extremely fast gestation period, hardly looking pregnant at all to giving birth to full term looking twins. Oh well, suspend your disbelief, it is science fiction after all. All I can say is I was genuinely relieved when the ending credits rolled."
2389,7,At least the wait was worth it,"After the disaster of what was ""Attack of the Clones"" the final installment in the Star Wars Saga (until of course the announcement of Star Wars 7-9 and Spin-offs) Revenge of the Sith goes off with a blast. Beginning with an exciting battle with special effects that is a rare highlight of the Prequels and the massive improvement of Hayden Christensen, although still flawed is much better depiction of Anakin and his fall to the dark side that sets up the Originals really well. "
2390,1,"weak acting, characters and story = disappointment","For those that have waited long for the prequels and especially for episode III, it is sad that the fans' patience is met with thrown-in, underdeveloped characters (a.k.a. general grievous, only slightly more personality or development than darth maul), distracting special effects (lava-surfing fight scene, i'm looking your way), and a laughably bad ending (vader's frakenstein-esquire rebirth). it is insulting to our intelligence that we are supposed to love this film because lucas throws in chewy, or boba/ jango fett in ep. II, because it feels more like marketing than storytelling. lucas made many regrettable choices for these prequels, and the series comes to a close very painfully."
2391,9,Recaptures the atmosphere of Star Wars!,"I am not a die hard fan of Star Wars. In fact, I've only watched all of the movies in the last two years despite me being 20. I thought the original three were good because they were innovative, creative, funny and compelling."
2392,10,Best of the prequels,"The Phantom Menace was okay, I loved Jar-Jar but he did get annoying. Attack of the Clones was wonderful though sometimes the love story was cheesy. But Now Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the prequels. Excellent visual effects. I'm just sick and tired of people giving crap about Count Dooku being killed off early. Obviously Lucas has his reasons. Ewan did and excellent job with his role. He does a fantastic job setting up Guiness in A New Hope. I felt sorry for poor Natalie, there wasn't much she could do with her role except stay at home patting her pregnant belly, praying that Anakin was alright. But all in all she did an acceptable job. She's done well in the past with the Star Wars prequels. Ah, and finally Anakin has moved on from being the whiny teenager to a more mature. Hayden did a great job making the transition to the more mature, darker side of Anakin."
2393,10,the force is strong with this one.....,"may 19th, 2005"
2394,7,"Flawed, but it completes the circle.","I've been a huge fan of Star Wars ever since I was a kid, and first saw the original trilogy. And yes, back then, Darth Vader was my very own Boogeyman. He was The Bad Guy. He was The One You Didn't Cross. His entrance in Episode 4 was all it took to convince me of that. I didn't even need to get as far as the 'If this is a consular ship, then where is the ambassador?' line, and the accompanying neck-snapping."
2395,10,A fitting finale to a classic saga,"After almost three decades of speculation, the reasons behind Vader's fall have finally been revealed to us. To say that it should fulfil fans expectations is an understatement. The fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin is a mythic duel that has been collectively imagined in all our minds since 'A New Hope' was released, and ROTS delivers this as though Lucas dived into our thoughts and put it on screen. The choreography of the battle is breathtaking, and the emotion from it heartbreaking."
2396,10,i've seen it twice and i'm dying to see it again,"this movie was every bit as depressing as everyone said it would be, but it worked. heartbreakingly sad but still wonderful. i thought it would bug me that the film was basically tying up loose ends, but it didn't. there were only a few problems i had with episode 3: (1) some of the love scenes were a little cheesy at first (Anakin: ""you're so beautiful"" Padime: ""its only because i'm so in love"" Anakin: ""no, its because i'm so in love with you""..give me a break)but the end scenes (especially padime's last couple of scenes) were super (2) hayden's acting left a little to be desired but it was an improvement over episode 2 and besides, he's SO HOTT so it's really OK...he did dark and sinister and evil very well. (3) there were a few holes in the plot, but it all basically came together very nicely...good stuff: palatine and obi wan's performances...really good and convincing I WISH THE STAR WARS MOVIES WEREN'T OVER!! that makes me sad but what a way to end it!! everybody go see this movie! it's the best ever!!!!"
2397,10,"good, but still slightly disappointing","Episode III was, by far, the best of the three prequels to the original series. The effects were fantastic, the music was brilliant, and Lucas actually worked on the storyline this time. However, I still believe that the original series was better, however primitive the special effects. I did enjoy much of it--however, there were a couple of things I had a problem with. First of all, some of Hayden's acting was rather wooden, but his charisma and looks made up for some of it. Second of all, there was love dialogue that was rather sickening. I could find that same stuff in a cheap Mexican soap opera. There were other lines that I didn't like, such as ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes."" Jedi deal in absolutes as well. He's contradicting himself. Also, he is saying that people who deal in absolutes are Siths--that's rather like saying that molesting a child isn't wrong, it's all how you look at it, which is baloney. I also looked at the book before seeing the movie and was sort of disappointed when the lines were delivered differently then what I imagined. Another thing was when Anakin chokes Padme--I expected it to be more intense. I mean, he's choking her, and her face isn't even red and she falls down unconscious. That part didn't click with me. (Nor did the freaky part with Anakin, Mace Windu, and Palpatine.)However, like I said before, there were many good points about this film--the most important one is Ja-Ja Binks does not speak. I almost jumped for joy when I saw that one shot of him with his mouth shut. However, I sat back down when I realized he was alive, and not dead. All in all, this was an excellent movie with only slight disappointments. I left the movie theater satisfied and smiling. I hope to see it again sometime, and this is a movie that I will definitely add to my DVD collection. P.S. The light saber fights were wonderful--I was in awe watching it. However, when I came straight home and watched Episode IV A New Hope and its fight, I burst out laughing--it was pathetic compared to the previous."
2398,10,nice dice,"Other than the 6th star wars movie, this one is my favorite. Great storyline on how Anakin goes to the dark side which was necessary to show. This episode finally fills in the gaps of the storyline and has intense action and special effects Definitely a MUST-SEE! (even though I'm pretty sure everyone saw this movie :P) This movie shows the fall of the Jedi by the betrayals of the clones and of Anakin Skywalker. The final scene with Obi-Wan and Anakin was intense and will definitely go down in movie history."
2399,10,Was hopeful Lucas would deliver... he did.,"I have only ever been a modest star wars fan, liking the first three as the excellent movies they were, but not going so far as to get it tattooed on my upper arm. When the first two came out, I liked them as well (am I the only one?) but realized there was something different about their caliber: something that made them seem more ""cool"" but at the same time less mystifying."
2400,10,this is a fantastic finish to one of the greatest stories ever told,"I didn't want to put too much hype on Episode III, because I have a penchant for doing so and becoming rather disappointed with the movie after doing so. However, I knew that George Lucas was going to blow us all away...and he did! The action scenes are unparalleled by any other installment in either trilogy. The light saber battles between Yoda and Darth Sidious, and the light saber battle between Anikin and Obi Wan are each spectacular. There is lots battle taking place and it all was shot well and the entire movie is extremely enjoyable and captivating. The acting is superb. Hayden Christensen continued to evolve into the actor we were hoping he would become. Ewan McGregor turns in a performance that is gut-wrenching, his closing dialog with ""Darth Vader"" nearly brought me to tears. Natalie Portman is sophisticated and sexy as always. In my eyes, the epic series could not have gone out in much better fashion. Lucas went out and made a compelling feature that was finally on par with Episodes IV-VI. It is sad to see it all come to an end."
2401,8,Star Wars Rocks!,The Best star wars movie ever!!! The graphics and sound are extraordinary. At first I had doubts weather or not it was going to be a good movie but after the first scene I was speechless. Also in that scene R2-D2 kicks butt. I was kind of disappointed we didn't see much of C3PO but the show was strong anyway. I also think they should have showed more of the clones actually fighting but that really has nothing to do with the main plot. Through the entire movie Anikan and Obi-Wan use their Jedi skills to beat the crap out of things! Oh ya and that includes Yoda to. It is really sad to witness the transformation of Anikin to Darth Vader and his children being born. Over all I think this was a spectacular movie even they some stuff was not so good. P.S Don't worry about that idiot Jar-Jar Binks only had a 2 second cameo at the end.
2402,10,I'll know for sure in 6 hours...,"All I can say is that I read the book, and I am a huge fan of the series. The darker movies seem to be my favorites and this movie's tragic plot puts it in line as one of my favorites. Without ruining anything I can definitely say that the film follows the energy levels of past films. Big beginning and big ending which sandwiches important story lines in the middle. It also answers all your questions about the story and includes incredible scenes like huge space battles, lots of light saber fighting, many alien creatures of all shapes and sizes, and new villains. Also I will mention that there are a couple huge secrets that the Lucas camp has kept hidden from most of us despite all the movie hype. I know fans will love it, and non fans will find this one much more interesting than the previous 2 movies. I can't wait until midnight."
2403,6,"ehh, not bad","Just my opinion, don't kill me for it: "
2404,10,Best Star Wars Movie!,This movie is my favorite in the Star Wars series. It also is my favorite prequel of Star Wars. The visual effects and story were well written. General Grievous looks hardcore with cgi. George Lucas did a great job on the third chapter of Star Wars. I recommend this movie after Episodes I and II but before Episode IV. The story was very emotional and showed the ties to the other episodes. Episode VII is coming in 2015. I'm very excited! Episode III takes place 19 years before Episode IV. This is what I like about prequels. I think prequels are easier to make than sequels because it brings a fictional universe to an earlier time period like this.
2405,1,"Naive, bad acting... only thing that is good is the special FX","This movie was the culmination of Lucas' stupidity. Yes, it was spectacular with the FX and the scale but... instead of the tragedy we were supposed to see as Anikin turns to the Dark side we felt nothing. Just the comic situations a lot of naive dialogue and actions and a very predictable events. Thank god Lucas gave up on doing more episodes i.e. more damage to the series. The true and only Star Wars movies will remain the originals. Ah, and i just forgot to mention the exceptionally poor acting on the best part of the cast. The only reasonably good performance I saw was from the Palpatin character and Obi-One's. The rest of the cast just failed to make us viewers believe in them, support them, feel their emotions, make us care for them. In brief - watch it for the FX and don't expect anything from this movie."
2406,10,Amazing,"I purposely went into this film not expecting anything spectacular. The first two prequel received a lot of hype and didn't exactly live up to the standard. This one, however, stood up and took the challenge. The visuals were stunning and the music really talked to your soul. But the story, oh the story! The story was excellently written. Even the die hard fans who knew some of the outcome going into the film, were still kept on their toes by the well placed twists and turns provided in the story. This movie is always one step ahead of you, in a good way too. Even if you hated the first two episodes and thought that the original Star Wars was ruined, you should see this movie. It will restore your faith in all things Star Wars."
2407,10,Shakespeare in outer space!,"Out of all the ""Star Wars"" films (including the original trilogy), I would have to say that ""Revenge Of The Sith"" stands head and shoulders out of the whole series (with the exception of ""The Empire Strikes Back"")."
2408,10,The best & saddest of the Star Wars series,"RotS is the best of the StarWras series, special effects, action scenes, drama scenes, & plot are very impressive. Although all the important parts of the movie are well presented there a little goofs & corny scenes here & there that some people will complain about."
2409,7,Hhhhmmmmmmmm........,"Just got in from watch this. I'm still mulling it over. I want to see it again, that's for sure. But am I satisfied? That's the Hhhmmmmmmm...."
2410,6,"Great first half, patchwork and unconvincing acting make up for the rest","Well, just got back from watching the much anticipated final chapter to the Star Wars prequel. Fortunately it was a digital screening, which I shall predict, raises the bar on movie experience to a point where people will no longer pay premium prices for conventional screenings."
2411,6,Mediocre.,All over the internet I have been hearing reports about how the latter half of this film is superior to anything they've done in the prequel trilogy.
2412,8,"Not that bad, i mean come on, it's Star Wars!!","OK then, this film is not about the acting skills of the cast, or the special effects. This film is about seeing Anakin turn into Vader. That is it. I am a total fan of all six films, and sure, the acting may not win anyone an Oscar, but is that what you're looking for from this film? I wasn't, I just wanted to see the story complete, and in my opinion it does it very well. Let's face it, if you've seen the other films, you have to see this one. Episodes III is superior to Episodes I and II, and I would say I enjoyed it more than Return of The Jedi (although that may not be saying much) When you see this film, just sit back and enjoy the ride, don't over analyse it, let yourself be taken to that galaxy far, far away."
2413,10,George Lucas got it right ... this time!,"Episode III is exactly where Episode I and II should have been!! This last episode has just about everything for even the casual SW fan: great action, grand music, familiar faces, and a really good plot that ties almost everything up. It is dark (that's good!) and deserves the PG-13 rating. It's definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen you can find, and seeing it often wouldn't hurt, either!! Again, John Williams has provided the nuclear music that has helped make this series the monster world-wide bonanza that it has become. The visual effects are the best that I have seen to date, and the blending of the CGI work into the live action is truly spectacular!! In short, this may be the biggest, most spectacular film you will see during your lifetime!!"
2414,2,"Star Wars III : Revenge Of The Sith, A Big Disappointment....","I have to say, I'm a big Star Wars fan, so this comes as hard to say, but Star Wars Episode 3 has to be the worst Star Wars film to date. I wondered about the franchise after seeing Episode 2 which was also awful, but this movie takes the cake. From the really bad and abysmal acting to the overdone special-effects, this movie is bad from the get go. It's like Lucas spent about 10 days putting this together. I understand George Lucas is trying to appeal to a whole new generation of Star Wars watchers that probably never has seen the original trilogy by making the movie look like an out of control video game, but really is all that non-stop action needed. The one beautiful thing about the original films is their simplicity in detail and story. Vast real looking vistas, down to earth starship battles, these make the original films a treasure to watch. The old films in no way connect to the newer three in their look or style. It's hard to make the connection, and the disappointment in this film of how everything is supposed to relate to the older films is a real letdown. I think George is too obsessed with his new found computer technology of film-making that he has lost the art of real storytelling. Actors shouldn't have to do a whole film in front of a green screen; with the money spent on this film they could have built sets for everything. I was so looking forward to this film, what a sad feeling I had when I finally got to see it. One is better off imagining the years before the original trilogy then spending the time or money watching these prequels. I gave the film a 2 for Yoda, He's the only shining star."
2415,9,wham bam thank you mamm,The
2416,,George Lucas is a boob.,"George Lucas is a boob, but he is a very rich and canny boob. The dialog and acting in the movie was, for the most part, terrible. The effects and sound were up the to the usual high standards of Lucasfilm and ILM. There were some great bits in the movie, but they were few and far between.Yoda, to me, looked better than ever. Seeing the early versions of various ships and uniforms was a treat. Palpatine's turning of Vader was done very well I thought."
2417,10,Master Lucas,"I loved this last part.. As the two last movies thrashed the joy of star wars, this one brought it right up again.."
2418,8,Success!,"Oh, thank God. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Jesus, I was worried, like many others, that this film would do nothing to discard the image of the first two prequels, but by God, it did. Is it flawed? Damn straight it's flawed, and I would have been shocked if it wasn't, but the flaws are heavily outweighed by the positives this time around."
2419,4,Star Wars 1 - 3 fail to live up to 4 - 6,"The first movie (episode 4) had the best bar scene in all of Sci-fi movies. and from the slicing off of the bullies arm we had a sense of danger and consequences. the problems with the first three episodes the violence seemed cartoon-ish, which didn't help the sets looked like cartoons."
2420,10,A lonely road ...(spoilers),"Of course I knew what the outcome would be...we all did. But for years I have asked myself ""Why?"". Why turn to the dark side? Why spend your life controlling everyone else's? Why do you do the things you do? Why are you a cold-hearted killer? In short, why so angry Anakin? Now I know. The path to the Dark Side is paved with good intentions."
2421,4,"Good, not great","I'm baffled by the number of people here who are calling this the greatest movie ever. 49% game this movie a 10. I know this might be hard for hard-core Star Wars fans to do, but try to get a grip on reality."
2422,9,Dark and Disturbing Dramatic Elements Makes This One a Fan Favorite,"No need to give any spoilers here...many of you know what happens..you just want to see how it happens. I think it's fair to say that Star Wars purists will say the back 3 cannot be touched...many new and younger fans will say the prequels are superior. Let's not beat around the bush here...this movie ties the two series together in a bittersweet fashion. I personally believe this will be many Star Wars fans favorite because it has unique qualities. The sappy dialogue is kept to a minimum, annoying creatures are hardly noticeable, and too few slow parts to even notice. One thing that is clear, Lucas has learned from his mistakes. This one is loaded with action, but the effects (which are fantastic) do not take away from the storyline. The dramatic elements are dark and disturbing, almost stylistically similar to the Lord of the Rings. This one makes you care about the characters more than the other two prequels did. 10 out of 10 if your a Star Wars nut, 9 out of 10 if you always enjoyed the series but didn't dress as Chewbacca to see it...7 out of 10 if your a wife or girlfriend who just watched the original series and the first two prequels for the first time last week...so you could see this one. 5 out of 10 if loved Fever Pitch"
2423,10,There is a light at the end of the tunnel.,After thirty years we get to finally get to enjoy the last movie. This film was great from beginning to end. The story of Anakin Skywalker\Darth Vader is complete. I was totally immersed and completely was taken away and lost track of time. I will definitely watch this movie again next week. George Lucas has done an excellent job and definitely redeemed himself. This movie has it all and people will enjoy it for different reasons. The computer graphics were done excellently and I was greatly impressed. Any fan of Star Wars will enjoy this film and watch it again. I can't wait for the DVD so I will be able to watch all the movies back to back at home.
2424,8,Some of the best star wars!,"Apart from the bad acting from Hayden Christensen and the fair performance from Portman the movie is a fantastic visual experience. It's a great story and it combines the two decades of Star Wars very well. The fighting scenes are incredible and John Williams has really made a fantastic score with gigantic potions of drama and sadness. It's bombastic! It's two bad that the love scenes between Hayden and Natalie still are far from perfect.. They have stiff way about them, but I think Portman has become much better throughout these movies. Hayden has also become better since episode 2 but still he is not convincing."
2425,7,"Finally, a worthy prequel","I didn't hold out much hope for Revenge of the Sith. The previous prequels were so dire, I was actually considering not bothering going to see this chapter at all. Seeing the final trailer for ROTS on the big screen twisted my arm into getting to the cinema to see it. And guess what, I'm glad I did! The story's darker edge is evident almost from the start, making this a more satisfying, grown-up Star Wars movie that neatly dovetails the original films. For the first time in the prequel trilogy, George Lucas actually focuses more on plot & character rather than overdosing on CGI nonsense. While the dialogue still has a few clunky moments & some of the humour doesn't work, the plot & the pacing of the film is good enough to see it's long running time fly by. Of the actors the much-maligned Hayden Christiansen comes off best, this time more tortured soul than whiny brat. The much-talked up final sabre fight isn't a patch on Episode 1's three-way dust up (it's sole saving grace), but the film has easily more genuinely emotive moments than it's two forerunners put together. See it!"
2426,6,An epic Nutshell of flaws!,"Though, it can't be deemed one of the worst science fiction, fantasy movies, it is certainly not the best Star Wars movie. The third entry in George Lucas' epic prequel trilogy may offer plenty of iconic and enjoyable moments, but there is also a lot of flaws that overwhelm the movie completely. "
2427,10,Amazing!,"George Lucas, you've done it again! I totally love this film, just now I saw it with my friend and this weekend I'm gonna see with my brother! I can't wait! The Movie was amazing! Storyline was great, all performances were great, the visual effects were just... wow! It was like watching the puppets from the old days (Gen. Grievous, Yoda, the droids, spaceships, Boga) ! I will be very very very surprised if the movie doesn't win the Oscar for VFX! The music was perfect, sound was perfect and the costumes and sets were good, as usual. But there were a couple of things I didn't like about this movie: Accasionally, the dialog was pretty stupid (NOOOOOOOOO!), the wookies should have had a bigger role in the film, also General Grievous. He is like the coolest character in all six films! He should have died later in the movie! But overall: Amazing"
2428,9,"Deserves a nine because its like finding that last piece of the jigsaw, Outstanding.","Well what can i say about this final and 2nd best instalment by George Lucas. Easily the best of the three prequels. The Special effects on this movie are simply stunning and deserve grave merit. Hayden Christiansen Pulls of the role of Anakin Skywalker in this movie with supremacy and a much better sense of maturity than in episode 2. Ewan Mcgregor pulls of again an amazing performance which i feel he has maintained through all three films uniquely unlike many other characters. It would be fair to say Lucas has more than done justice to one of the most eagerly anticipated films of the last decade. This is by far the most well thought out, visually stunning of all the movies and brings together the 5 other movies surrounding it. Ian mcdiarmid is Simply amazing as Sidious (Palpatine) and despite his Physical Disposition pulls of believable Choreograpohy in the fight scene with Yoda and most noticeably Mace windu. It is the Way he manoeuvres sidious's manipulative claw toward turning Anakin to the Dark side that he excels at and as ever has the fantastic deep croaky almost evil voice. It is really this performance that slams the fact into the viewers face that Sidious is the bad guy and not Anakin or Vadaras he is later known. Throughout the early Parts of the film the connection between Mcgregor and Hayden Christiansen is fantastic and portrays the close relationship between Anakin and Obi-wan which they have built up between each other. The main factor that separates this feature from the others is that it brings together all the other films and ties them up with for once outstanding acting and as always state of the art special effects ultimately backed up by a fantastic script. This film may not be up with the Likes of The shawshank Redemption or The return of the King but the way it brings the rest of them together, as a whole it isn't very far of. This is why i feel Lucas's Final piece deserves a 9."
2429,2,I hate you,"YOU WILL BURN IN JEDIHELL, IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE!!! "
2430,8,Very good ending of the series but problems with the characters,"I am probably one of the very few Star Wars enthusiasts that prefer Phantom Menace to Clones. Why, well I never could put my finger on the issue. Now comes Revenge. Now let me say from the start I thought it was good. Better than Clones, but again Phantom Menace somehow had more of an effect on me. Again why? Revenge had all the elements that I would say to anyone go see this movie, but hey, you will need to see it a couple of times, as it has so much going on."
2431,10,Episode 3 the grand finale!,This film has no flaws. As a person who grew up with star wars this film being the final chapter had a lot of work to do and i was a little sceptical following episodes 1 and 2 whether Lucas could pull it off. Wrong. Revenge of the Sith is an utterly awesome spectacle for older star wars fans especially. Tying in all the plot lines that were in doubt from the release of ep 1. Hayden Christianson was excellent. Very dark and brooding and special effects to make LOTR look like a cartoon. Truly amazing. I had my mouth open all the way through. From the Emperor to Obi-Wan and General Grievous the lightsaber duels were nothing short of spectacular and the star wars universe taking shape more and more as the film moved on. I will see again and again as once is definitely not enough! Thanks Mr. Lucas for making the most fulfilling movie i have ever seen!
2432,4,Lame Lucas is an Idiot! (spoiler warning),"Lucas is a buffoon. He can't direct, he can't write and he obviously can't edit a film. The movie was good in only one regard, Visual Effects. After that the movie lost any merit at all. Episode 1 was awful, after seeing the deleted scenes i couldn't understand why he had taken them out. Episode 2 choppy and the scene changes were totally lame and quick. Not much better than the first 1. Episode 3, well apart from the unbelievable awful dialog that takes place its hard to consider any of the scenes as actually believable. Ewan McGregor a good actor looks awful with dialog and directing he was given. The plot was weak. Just plain weak you weren't given any weight of character development at all. Why does Anakin trust Palpatine so much? How did their relationship strengthen rather than that with the Jedi council? The film was rushed to completion sacrificing everything but effects to finish it. One of the funniest parts of the entire film was when Vader screams NOOOOOOO! i couldn't help but laugh at a feeble attempt to be dramatic. Star Wars is an action film and filling the non action scenes with lame politics praising democracy and stupid fortune cookie sayings put more action or at least better filler."
2433,5,Rather disappointing,"I loved the classic Star Wars Trilogy, even the revamped versions that were released on DVD last year. I loved the first part of the 'new' trilogy, but was disappointed by the second one. Now the third and last installment in 30 years of Star Wars was supposed to draw a satisfactory line under the story. Did it succeed? Only partly. Technically, the movie is on top and beyond. The special effects are state of the art and blend completely into the movie, unlike 'The Phantom Menace', where the CG scenes stuck out somehow. The opening scene is one massive fireworks of action and effects. Well done so far."
2434,9,Fitting End,"I am saddened by the end of this great series of movies that have been so influential over the past 30 years. Naturally critics will discuss the flaws. Of course, there were flaws in all the movies. The dialog and some of the acting in the last thee films could have been so much better. The vast majority of critics possess a disturbing arrogance in their review of movies. They project an air of sophistication, yet search for flaws. They are looking for ""artistic"" value, when, in fact, the vast majority of moviegoers ""go"" for an escape and an hour or two of pleasure and entertainment."
2435,10,wow what a movie,Totally blew me away i still almost 24h later can't comprehend how excellent movie this was.
2436,10,The best review of the best Star Wars movie,"Director George Lucas's final episode of the series ""Star Wars"" ends up being his most entertaining film of all the Star Wars films with the main theme consisting of traitors. Chancellor Palpatine (Later the Emperor) is captured at the beginning of the movie by General Greivous of the enemy droid army. Obi Wan who is played by Ewan McGregor and Anikan Skywalker who is played by Hayden Christensen have been given the task to rescue Palpatine and when they eventually rescue him Count Dooku arrives to stop the rescue. Obi Wan is knocked out but eventually Anikan Skywalker beheads him with his life saber. When they leave, Palpatine starts convincing Anikan that the Jedi Rebel Alliance is against him and shortly after they find out that Palpatine who is played by Ian McDiarmid is the leader of the Sith. Palpatine convinces the storm troopers and other fighters that the Jedi are against everyone and they all turn against Master Yoda and the Jedi during battle. "
2437,9,"Loved the movie, but a few questions...","First off, i'd like to say that i really liked this movie, and I'm not trying to bash it. I'm sort of a perfectionist. why are the lightsabers pointy? if you look at them, they come to a dull point. this is not the case in any of the older movies, but I' can't remember about the previous new ones (Episodes I and II.) Also, how is Padme pregnant if Anakin has been away for so long. Maybe Darth Vader ISN'T Luke's father. maybe the dad is... Jar Jar? *shudder* anyway. thats about it, but overall, the only real problem with the movie was the bad writing for the romantic scenes. way too cheesy. it was a great movie. 9 out of 10 stars, definitely. Lucas has finally redeemed himself after the Jar Jar Binks incident. (one of the worst ideas in movie-making history.)"
2438,2,"Boring, predictable, no protagonist, talking instead of images and real action.","The only reason why I was not as bored as watching Episode One is that I already had extremely low expectations. Okay, the SFX department did a good job, and I liked the surfaces of the spaceships, and some of the vehicles were funny and nicely designed. But Episode III has such a bad bad screenplay nobody ever would have accepted anywhere, even at 3rd class filmschools, if not attached to the ""star wars"" brand. The job to be done writing episode III was to show how anakin turns into Darth Vader. So as everybody knows the ending, the interesting question was HOW to get there. Do they come up with a good idea for the character change? And come on, whats on screen now is just a lack of ideas for that. Every star-wars-fan website has better ideas. In a good movie you have strong images that make you FEEL the conflict the protagonist has to deal with. Here you don't even have a protagonist! Anakin remains at a distance from the beginning. You always get the feeling: no, he's wrong, he's the bad guy. I stay on Obi-Wan Kenobis side. In a good movie we'd really feel: yes, I would have acted just like that if I was in his situation. there are so many good movies with dark evil heroes: gangster films like 'bonnie and clyde' or 'the godfather' or 'taxi driver' or Tarantino movies etc. Here you always think: ah, now he's acting stupid and has dark mascara makeup: guess he's on the dark side now... (yawn) Everybody's JUST TALKING ABOUT HIS/HER FEELINGS, especially Anakin. Nothing is SHOWN, nothing is believable. My only explanation for all these people who seem to like the film (8.0 rating on IMDb, I can't believe it!) is, that the basic setting of star wars, with funny creatures in space and the force and the jedi masters etc. is still so strong that it's enough to enjoy the images of aliens and spaceships between the stars, and imagine own stories that might happen there..."
2439,4,might b a 6 or 7 out of 10 but I had to make adjustments for all the addicts that gave it a 10(plz get back on earth and into reality...star wars is NOT REALITY by the way),interesting how Lucas' last movie in the series is SO dark and negative and how he is SO proud of it...i think it was mediocre for plot and acting ...of course the special effects were amazing and creatures/planets were kool give me a billion dollars and i could do that too and probably get better acting and plot stuff going(see how i used stuff instead of writing something that seems intelligent...i did it because it reminds me of the movie)He really didn't add much to the original episodes 4-6 I was disappointed (I expected a movie I could rate as a 10 out of 10)it is worth paying for but definitely not worth all the worship and praise people have adorned it with
2440,10,Finally! I even forgive the first two prequels!,"All I can say is, thank you finally George! The first movie made me cringe, the second made me sleep..."
2441,4,A tragic ending in every sense.,"Three is really a magic number. Three legs make a tripod stand securely. There are three primary colours. Martin Luther King said ""I have a dream"" three times. The third in any set is vital; the master stroke of a combination."
2442,10,Awesome,"I am one of the lucky people to be old enough to remember the Original Star Wars movie ""A New Hope"". I can see it now, me, enthralled, exiting the cinema wielding an imaginary lightsaber and then some years later owning hoards of figures featured in all three of the trilogy."
2443,6,Good but still doesn't match any part of the original trilogy,The blame falls solely on the shoulders of George Lucas for not employing others to direct this and his last three films while he stuck to the producing and writing.
2444,7,Just a good movie,I was more afraid at the beginning of the movie with how serious it was going to be. All the cheesy sounds of droids and the hideous voices of the trade federation made me nervous. If there was anything wrong with this movie that would be it.
2445,10,Lucas bounces back great!,"When I walked into the theater on that magical day, I did not know what to expect from this movie. After a pair of truly disgusting prequels that completely under minded the entire Star Wars franchise, truth be told I was more than a little hesitant of what might happen this time. I then watched Episode Three, and after the movie was done I walked out of the movie in a pleasant state of shock. Everything from the lightsaber battles to the strong solid story are done magnificently. As I left my mind was still going through everything. How all the story lines are put together expertly, so that few gaps are left only for the really hardcore Sar Wars fans. George Lucas should be intensely proud of himself, for putting out his best movie since Return of the Jedi. A great way to end his Star Wars film-making career, truly fabulous."
2446,9,"Worth watching the first two for, and that's saying something!",Revenge of the Sith is a true Star Wars movie. It's as if Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were made to set the stage for the events in this movie.
2447,,Natalie Portman's role was thankless......,"All she did was stay in her living quarters for 80% of the movie wringing her hands and wondering what was up with Anakin. Oh yeah, and was pregnancy the whole time (I don't know if it was just me, or what, but she looked MORE pregnant in the earlier part of the film, than she did at the end)."
2448,10,No scenes that would make you shirk from!,A most worthy addition to the Star Wars saga and not a single scene to shirk from! George Lucas weaved a tight plot and story that thrills and delight loyal fans. However even with such talented actors/actresses some scenes felt hampered and restrained.Only at the climatic scene (Darth Vader Lives!) that Ewan showed great emotion of being betrayed yet subtle compassion was one of this film saving graces.
2449,8,Strong with the force is this one,"It's true. ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" redeems the saga and justifies the very existence of the first two prequels. George Lucas has made, if not the best, then the most emotional ""Star Wars"" film of them all."
2450,9,"Painful to watch, but in a good way!","Got back from watching Episode 3 last night, and all I can say is woooooow..... Yeah, we're gonna get plenty of nay-sayers, but I think those are just going to be the people that are in love with saying how much they hate the new Star Wars trilogy, to be honest. I watched Revenge of the Sith and I have to say I had a great time! I won't give any spoilers away, but I will just say that don't plan on coming out of the theater all joyous and light-hearted at seeing this film, it's a Greek tragedy and we all know there's not going to be a happy ending on this one; it's pretty brutal to a point. But it's executed wonderfully as far as I'm concerned, far superior to the previous two films: it stands well as a lead-in to eps 4-6. My vote: thumbsup. Grab a friend and have a good time!"
2451,8,redemption,"ROTS was supposed to be a story of betrayal and downfall, but it turned out to be a redemption. Not of the characters in the story (that happened in 1983), but rather of the director. I left the theater in 1999 worried that George Lucas may have killed or irreparably damaged the legacy of his original three films. Episode II did little to change that feeling; in fact, it felt as if Lucas was making a point of wilfully (and pridefully) ignoring much of the well-grounded criticism of Ep I. It was thus with much trepidation that I awaited the release of this third (and final?) chapter of the saga."
2452,1,Thank God I only had to pay a student price.,"I'm not going to say much, just as I was walking out of the theater, I was bewildered. I didn't have high expectations, and even those weren't met. Horrible script, horrible acting, horrible directing, horrible development, horrible plot, but some damn good cgi. But anyone should know that it takes all of the parts of a film coming together to make it great, not just overwhelming an audience with bright flashes and whizzing noises. I think I was more entertained by slumber party massacre two, which is slightly above this film...(wait, I meant two some hours of cgi). I have nothing else to say, this is merely to meet the minimum submission guidelines... yep. horrible movie. waste of time. I would have rather watched a five year old play with blocks. Alright, I think that's enough."
2453,7,Don't ask Questions,"The movie is well acted, especially by Ewan MacGregor. His performance is amazing, as he tries to support Anakin and not appear as the enemy to his troubled Padawan. "
2454,3,final installment in the space saga delivers action and effects but little else,"I think its safe to say that the audience has long since abandoned any expectations of genius or eloquence from the mighty quill of George Lucas. No where is this expectation, or lack there of, more evident than in the final installment of the Star Wars saga. Granted, to the legions upon legions of hard core, light saber wielding fans, Episode 3 is a heaven sent, a closure to a story that began nearly 3 decades ago. It is an epic, fast paced with spectacular vistas and booming sounds... All of which really amounts to a ride at theme park, but not a film. The problem is that unlike two previous films or the first 3 films there are no mysteries left. The story line is clearly charted. Any plot twists or revelations are gone ( there was no room left for items such ""Luke, I am your Father..."", for instance or any other more modest subtitles.) All of this means that execution and not content will be key. This is where Lucas and the film fail. Lucas does not provide the viewer with an engaging subplot, dense, deep characters or strong motivations for action. Young Skywalker accepts everything at face value, evil is pure evil and no gray exists in the world of Star Wars. Even the climax is underscored by cheesy allusions to Frankeinstein where some real drama would have been useful. In short, this film is strictly for fans."
2455,9,Going out with a BANG!,"Just when you think George Lucas had given in to the media with all of the endorsements and hype from the previous two films, he redeems himself with a remarkable film that can only be described as amazing."
2456,3,At least there won't be a seventh...,"Depressing, gratuitous scenes of violence and special effects overload. For a movie series inspired by adventures such as Flash Gordon, this movie abandons that noble concept. Numerous scenes could've been left to the imagination which would have made the film shorter and given it a PG rating. Both would have been welcome. This movie makes me wish that a ""new director's cut"" could be made by someone else to remove the things that were tolerated only because it was George Lucas and Star Wars, but would not be tolerated by any studio from almost any other director. It seems to me that George was seduced by the dark side of self-indulgence."
2457,10,Possibly Best Movie EVER!,This is my favourite movie of all time since i was a child! Anakin is just such a huge representation of my character and i can sense the characters this movie gives me the shivers! Built with the best love story ever...and best betrayal...drama..suspense..despair...huge surprises..i just love it! as a huge star wars fan and addict this movie is my favourite. everyone speaks so inferior about the pre-quels. But i am one of the people who views them as definitely superior!! Its just amazing. Perfect script.actors.animations. i love it!!! i really hope George Lucas will or think to make another extraordinary movie such as this movie. and i hope for the new one episode 7 the force awakens to be even better although i don't think it can be better than episode 3 actually i think no film can be better than this. EVER.
2458,6,Great film - I cannot understand the cynics,"George Lucas' saga finally comes to an end and although most seem to be delighted with 'Episode III', there are those who are less than pleased with 'Revenge of the Sith', something I have trouble understanding. Such an opinion must belong to those lacking in sight, hearing and, ultimately, soul."
2459,7,Impressive as a whole- even if (like the dark side) a little unnatural at times,"I definitely enjoyed this film, as I came out satisfied and contented that I'd been very much entertained on a number of levels."
2460,10,This movie will make a fan of you!,"I was one of the all too common people who refused to accept Star Wars because I felt it was something that only geeks would be interested in. I loudly protested when my brother told me that he wanted to start watching the movies, starting with episode one. I watched only part of that movie, though I was remotely interested in what I saw. The next week, we rented Attack of the Clones. Again, I had no interest at first. But the next day, when my brother was re-viewing it, I watched too... and I really like it! So, I gladly joined in watching Revenge of the Sith, and it blows the first two movies out of the water! A superb mix of action and emotion, it stops at nothing to complete the story of Anaking Skywalker in a manner you won't soon forget. A perfect example of a ten out of ten."
2461,10,Must Dfend the End,"(Possible Spoilers, who knows) I felt compelled to right this comment after seeing how many people hated (yes, hated) this film. First I must be a true Star Wars fan, as I liked I and II a lot (though it's impossible to like Jar Jar). And I love this one, making it my favorite, with with VI and IV trailing behind. I'll get to the movie now. First we see how Anikan is now a Knight, a friend of Kenobi, and secret husband to Padme. We see the slow decline of power in the Senate, and Anikans rise to the Sith, etc. But I must answer specific pothole questions: First and foremost: why do some Jedi vanish? Answer: The studying of a Shaman of the Whils who found immortality through the Force. In the book for III, Yoda has a talk with Qui-Gon, who tells Yoda of his power. Qui-Gon didn't get all the details so he was in voice only. Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anikan learned of this power, and became one with Force. Second: why so little Vader? Vader is not the central figure here: The Empire is. The formation of the Empire and the death of the Jedi, which brings me to: Why didn't Vader fight Jedi? We know he could kick there cans, and also, not all the Jedi were killed in the initial onslaught, remember the ""agents of the Emporer"" from IV being mentioned by Obi-Wan? Well, they helped. and a person who can lift an X-wing isn't going to be able to hide for long. Why is Anikans transformation so easy? Easy, easy?! The death of Qui-Gon, his mother, killing an unarmed man, slaughtering a camp of Tusken Raiders, slicing the hand of a Jedi Master, fear of his wife's death, frustration at the Senate? Easy?! It took Thirteen years of a turmoiled life to turn him, Palpatine's goading just put him over the edge. I've said my piece. To conclude: Powerfully acted, the dream of Lucas fulfilled. Long Live the Alliance."
2462,4,It sucks,"No,really,I watched in the cinema and I was gonna fall asleep in the middle of the starship battle scene.It awful!Badly acted,badly directed,because of the blue-screen it's shot like an episode of ""The Bold &The Beautiful"".The characters lack all the charisma that Han Solo & co. had,actually the whole movie lacks the atmosphere and charisma of the original series.And the lines were so cheesy!Sam Jacson's character was killed in the most idiotic way possible!And the birth scene was a complete joke!What,Padme is half-dead,but she has enough strenght left to think up the names of her babies in a second?She just seas ""Luke"" then ""Lea"" and she dies!And the final battle sucked too!As a Star Wars fan I'm offended!Sorry Jeorge,CGI won't save your ass. You screwed up big time!"
2463,10,Awesome Movie,"Not much I can say about this movie. This movie might have been the best Star Wars, better than even the classic Episode 6. None of the characters seemed out of place, and even though it was well known that Obiwan was to defeat Darth Vader, I was on the edge of my seat. The story made you wonder quite often, and was a great link to episode 4. The reason for Anakin's betrayal comes out to make quite a bit of sense, being where it is. On the other hand, this movie is not meant to be watched before episode 4, 5, and 6, cause it brings out some major spoilers you wouldn't know otherwise. I give the movie a 2 thumbs up, 10 out of 10."
2464,5,Sith sandwich,"This film is no masterpiece. It is nothing more than ""Enjoyable rubbish""."
2465,5,Revenge of the ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,In the top 250 and bulging with glowing reviews I can only guess that people are rating it in terms of episode I and II as opposed to any real objective view of a film.
2466,9,Episide III Saves the New Trilogy!,"After six long years of anticipation, the moment all Star War's fans have been waiting for has arrived; the final installment of the new-age of Star Wars is complete."
2467,9,The End of an Era,"It's been exactly 5 days since I saw Revenge of the Sith. I saw the midnight screening, and then again (technically the same day) opening day. I have since I can remember been known to my friends as the Star Wars guy. My room is adorned with posters, figures, busts, and many other Star Wars related material (my favourite being the German Empire Strikes Back plaque). And while I may not know absolutely everything there is to know about the universe, its safe to say I'm a huge fan."
2468,10,Fantastic film!,"I really like Revenge of the Sith! For me, it is the best in the Prequels!"
2469,10,Can You Say Best Sci-Fi Movie Of ALL TIME?!?!?,"People were expecting this movie to be a blast but I'm sure everyone still had a shred of doubt as well.No doubts for me anymore as I've seen it twice already.STAR WARS EPISODE III is the charm of the entire series.The audience actually cheered when the movie ended.Totally spectacular!Obi-wan was excellent.McGreggor really captures the character of the Alex Guiness Kinobi.The emperor was dynamic and smart in what I would call his career moment and would expect at least an Oscar nomination.The plot,special effects,acting and directing were fantastic.Those who actually believe the lies from some bashing I've seen on this and other websites need to get back on their meds.Count the 10s the 10s are honest in my book.I almost never give 10 to any movie 9 is usually as high as I go.This is the best sci-fi movie I have ever seen in my life and I saw the original star wars in the theater back in the 70s as a young boy.This may get BEST PICTURE.No Joke.This is the real deal.See it at the theater or you will wish you had.After you see the first minute of the movie you will know the Force is strong(est)with this one.George Lucas I humbly take back everything I ever said bad about you.You are a genius!!! 10... golden statue sold separately."
2470,7,A good script poorly executed.,"The good: Special effects are top notch! This movie delivers when it comes to excitement, and the storyline lives up to my expectations. There's a few very good 'movie moments' in this movie... the events following the issue of 'order 66' is bone-chilling."
2471,8,All is now explained!,"This is a roller-coaster, a tour de force of a film, with bags of action sequences and special effects throughout. Inevitably, as the third film in the sequence (but the sixth to be filmed and released), the theme is somewhat dark, covering as it must the climax of the downward spiral of the democratic Galactic Republic into the dictatorship of the Galactic Empire. Both the pace and the darkness are unremitting, and there is much less humour than in the other films, especially episodes 4 to 6, which often used the two droids as comic relief at times of high tension, and were thus able to boast a U certificate. This is still a family film, but with a 12A certificate in the UK (PG-13 in the US), is not really suitable for younger children, or for children on their own. There are lots of action sequences, but the plot has an inevitable emphasis on politics and power-broking, and the dialogue mostly concerns itself with Anakin Skywalker's internal conflict and eventual acceptance of the Dark Side of the Force. The casting of the two main roles (Skywalker and Kenobi), which didn't seem to gel totally in the previous film, comes into its own here: Christensen somehow captures the exact look of his screen son, Mark Hamill, from over 25 years before, while if George Lucas had popped back in a time machine and borrowed the young Alec Guinness for the role, he could hardly have been more convincing as the youthful and vigorous Kenobi we see here. The special effects really are just that: special, and even if some anorak spends ages with the DVD on slo-mo locating defects in the early space-battle sequences, this should not detract from the film for the ordinary viewer. All the creatures and droids are lifelike and believable, and I was able to keep immersed in the director's creation throughout. Of course, we are dealing with a prequel here, and practically everyone who sees this film will have seen the Original Star Wars (Episode 4: A New Hope) before this. The film is therefore a bit like watching a massive Rubik's Cube solving itself. At first, we are just caught up in the whirl of colour and action, not seeing where the pattern is taking us, but as we move to the climax, each piece slots into place like a jigsaw, until finally we see the entire form, complete and ready to plunge us into the adventures of the Rebel Alliance's battle with the Emperor's Death Star."
2472,10,"good, good your love of this movie has made you powerful","i like many others last night went to watch revenge of the Sith and i like many others was blown away by what i saw. Yes there are arguments that the prequels are not as good as the original, but i have to say first off that no matter what Lucas did it would never match the originals, as well as our expectations. But this is where everything changes!!! I like many others thought that Lucas left himself too much work in terms of linking them together after the first two,and asked myself whether he could pull it off.I'm glad to say,""the boy done good"".Frst off,the action is immense and well done. A big shout out for ILM for making the film settings appear more organic, than artificial. The acting particularly of McDiarmid is fantastic, the plot even though we know the general story still hits us with a few surprises and overall the film runs like a Greek tragedy. we are not only hit by the sadness of what happens to Anakin, but by the end your very sad at what is the Jedi's fall from grace. you see Yoda and others disappearing off to a new start that will bring a new hope. (pardon the pun)on a final note though, when you watch this movie you will find yourself excited for the rest of the day. But beware i'm now on the path to my own dark side as i have to come to terms with the fact that unless Lucas has a change of heart, this is the last of star wars and lets be honest i cant see him coming out of retirement as lets face it he ain't getting any younger. Believe me you may read this and think this wont happen to me but it is inevitable once you realise this is closure your left with a void that you where left with at the end of 1983 when there was to be no more star wars. P.S don't download a bad copy of the movie a film like this deserves nothing better than a big screen"
2473,8,A great movie with awful actor directing.,"I just got back from seeing ep III and it was exactly what I expected and hoped for. I was very happy with a few minor but extremely major details. There was action the whole way through, Jar Jar did not speak, and Jake Lloyd wasn't in it. That is how I & II should've been! Lucas cut out all the love story bs from II which really weighed that movie down. The effects were mind blowing throughout the whole movie."
2474,5,Not exactly what I expected,"If you went in watching zero of the previous five or new nothing of the time line then this movie was excellent, but if you are like myself and are anywhere between and avid starwars fans to a Starwars Galaxies junkie(This is where I am at) I give this movie and average rating, worse than the Ep2. If you watched any of the Clonewars(Cartoon Network or on starwars.com) it showed you what Jedi and GGrev could do."
2475,,Absolutely breathtaking,"When this film was released, it divided critics. Some panned it, criticising the acting and script - others praised it, saying it was a fitting ending to the epic Star Wars saga. I am definitely with the latter. This film is outstanding."
2476,6,Good but not great.,"After reading other reviews of Revenge of the Sith, I just have to say, while it was a good film, but it wasn't great. First of all the good points were that it was the best Star Wars prequel (easily). This was due to the characters actually acting (unlike the previous films)and the story flowing together with no real stops for unnecessary plot and not flowing too fast (like the first hour of TPM). This is shown in the fact that Anakins fall to the dark side did not happen all of a sudden, the audience could actually see his downfall. The special effects also made the fighting sequences enjoyable to watch. However, this was really all that was good about the film, and it didn't save it from the biggest reason why I didn't like it. In the original trilogy Darth Vader was someone that actually did strike fear into people, but this film ruined that image for me. Sure, I have to admit there has to be a reason why he turned to the dark side, but the fact when you see Anakin in his Darth Vader armour and he acts like a soap opera character just ruins it completely. Also the other 'major villain', General Grievous, was just pathetic. Whats so scary about an old man dying of bronchitis? Finally, Darth Sideous, while acting rather scary, was not as big a threat as the Jedi make him out to be. The fight between him and Yoda was more a stalemate than a victory for Sideous, so the fact that Yodas so scared of him makes me think that the Jedi are just wimps. In conclusion it was a good film, but Revenge of the Sith is not the best Star Wars film and has ruined the rest of them."
2477,10,What makes this 1 so great and the other 2 crap?,"Honestly, every single 1 of the Star Wars films have been brilliant. All visually amazing and and all excellent to watch. Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones are still great. Very underrated compared to this 1, because I honestly think this film is one of the poorest of the series. But it is great. The ending gets to you. But its not the best of the series, like I've read in some reviews. The acting stinks. Except maybe Ewan McGreger. His final lines to Anakin are stirring. But Hayden Christensen seems forced. He could have done a heck of allot better. But the visuals are better here than in any of the other films. Lucas may not have an epic vision, just and epic budget, but he still knows how to entertain and impress."
2478,10,Lucas resets fractured Star Wars trilogies,Some Spoilers -- but few real details.
2479,3,"Too much cheese, wood and corn","It's good that this wasn't the only prequel to come out, for all the expectation levels - people would have committed suicide or something..."
2480,3,Couldn't stop laughing,"This is probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, it's not supposed to be. I'm no sweek, but i was really hoping for this one to make up for the travesty of the other two.My hopes were high going into this one because of all of the high reviews it had been receiving. In the first 30 seconds i knew it was going to be the same crap the other two had been from the rolling cred it line ""Evil is Everywhere."" OOO That's really creative George, how long'd you spend coming up with that. From then on out it was cliché after cliché, along with irritatingly outdated screen transitions coming at the most inappropriate times. I couldn't stop laughing, every line was recycled crap. Anakin was just as whiny as he was in the second one, and how is it that he's twenty years older and padme's the same age she was in the first one. She should be forty, but i woulda been able to ignore this had the rest of the film been better. Everyone older than fifteen who likes this now will hate it five years from now, I guarantee it."
2481,9,Palpatine is a monster,"Even if you haven't seen Episodes 4, 5, and 6, you can tell that Palpatine is up to no good from the start. We can often see him filling Anakin's mind with (dark)amibition by telling him that he will become the powerful Jedi ever and stuff like that, and we know that he is the Emperor and he is really powerful and stuff like that, so he probably gave Anakin that premonition he got of Padme dying in childbirth, which led to him betraying the Jedi and becoming Darth Vader. To everyone out there who used to like Anakin, I just beg you to please not hate him for turning evil. It was all Palpatine's fault. He turned him against everyone he ever cared about, and he is so full of evil, greed, and cruelty that even the devil would hate him. I know I do."
2482,9,Best prequal,"This is definitely the best Star Wars prequel. I really enjoyed it and it's a very good watch. It is in my top 6 Star Wars films and I think it is better than A New Hope. I loved the emotion that it brought when Obi-1 didn't finish Anakin off because it's a sign that no matter what, Anakin is still like his brother."
2483,8,Special Effects Glut!,"In Episode III, the last of the Star War saga, George Lucas used all the special effects he could dream of. And, they are awesome -- it's just that there are so many they overwhelm you."
2484,9,"I was ""forced"" to see this so as to come full circle","I remember seeing Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back way back when and those are still two of the best cinema experiences I have ever had-just blew me away- whereas the last two were so painful I wasn't sure there was any way to spark or rekindle the franchise. Luckily, I believe it was saved with this film. This was a very entertaining film. I couldn't stomach the first and second prequels but this movie is a worthy edition to the Star Wars family. For those who have been panning this film- lighten-up- it is not perfect but it is awfully good. The acting is better- good enough not to bog it down. The action and story blow forward at light-speed and do not disappoint. I really had a good time. One question- did anyone else see the Milleneum Falcon at the docking station early in the film when Annakin, Obi-wan and Senator Palpatine return from space after the initial battle/rescue sequence? I swear I saw it or a ship that looked just like it. If anyone can confirm this it would be appreciated. Could be a nice little trivia nugget."
2485,9,Thoughroughly enjoyable,"Just saw Episode III and it was terrific. I especially liked how the film takes shape to prepare for Episodes IV, V and VI. The clones looking more and more like Stormtroopers was a nice touch among many others that I won't spoil. Sith has the rhythm, quality, and brilliance of ""Empire"", but with a much stronger message of pain, struggle and hope. I thought Padme's character was finely-tuned to tug at our heart strings this time. Added to Star Wars authenticity are fantastic battle scenes, better dialog, great characters (Grievous rules!), make this film a winner."
2486,10,simply amazing,I HAD THE PRIVLAGE TO ACTUALLY SEE THE MIDNIGHT SCREENING WHICH I've NEVER BEEN TO BEFORE BUT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS Awesome THE FILM TO ME IS BEST OF THE LOT. SPOILERS the film kicks off with a huge space battle where obi one and anakin have to rescue palpatine who's been kidnapped by count dooko. Anakin and obi are really best friends at the start but one obi one goes on his on searching for general grievous thats when things start really turning. Anakin starts to get upset cause the Jedi council wont accept him as master so his good friend palpatine manipulates him saying things about the Jedi that arnt true MAJOR SPOILER. we also finally find out that palpatine is in fact the sith lord Darth sidious and its him thats planned everything. when mace heres this from Anakin he takes 3 Jedi with him to arrest the chancellor. This is the moment when Anakin has to make a decision. i wont say anything else but i will be defiantly be buying this on D.V.D.
2487,7,Almost Good!,"Well, George Lucas has certainly gone a long ways to undo some of the damage he's done to his rep (and his own movies) with Ep 3. It's not a great film by any means--still present are the long stretches of painful dialogue, reams of paper-thin characters and uneven pacing. But without a doubt, the first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes are the best Star Wars work Lucas has ever done period, better than Empire. The last few scenes in particular are just flat-out amazing. Terrific action, emotionally engaging...everything the last two SHOULD have been. Overall, I would rank it above the last three, but below Empire and the original. It's not the masterpiece many are claiming it is, but it's certainly an entertaining, thoroughly watchable summer popcorn flick."
2488,5,SITH: Spectacular -- But A Legend Betrayed.,"SITH: Liked it, disliked it -- and felt that the legend had once again been betrayed, by George Lucas."
2489,9,I loved this movie. How can you not? Well . . .,"The bottom line is entertainment value. I was completely entertained, period. How can you not love seeing Yoda fling himself around a wide open space, jumping from deck to deck; how can you not love the moment when Yoda, all 2 foot high, draws his light saber and challenges the 6 foot tall guy? This is stuff that makes me smile non-stop. Of course I did have a bit of trouble when our beloved Anakin turns to the dark side within the span of a single paragraph. I did have a bit of trouble with how easily all of the Jedis were wiped out. Actually, I had a lot of trouble with that. How can the Masters of the Universe, with The Force active in every cell of their being, get wiped out as though they didn't know anything was coming? Well, never mind. Go to see Yoda kick some Sith Butt; or not. Good stuff. I'm going again."
2490,9,Masterful,"Many others will write more in depth, so here are just some personal observations ..."
2491,6,"Not bad, but not good either.","This wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a very good one either. With the criticism ""Star Wars - Attack of the Clones"" endured, I thought Lucas and his team would try not to repeat the same mistakes in this one, but that, unfortunately, wasn't the case."
2492,4,Laughable plot but entertaining visually,"As I have watched the other five Star War films I felt - more out of a sense of duty than a sense of anticipation - that I needed to watch this final piece in the jigsaw. Unfortunately, despite some improvements (such as the near-total cutting of Jar Jar Binks), it still suffers the awful scripting of the previous two prequels, and stuffy dialogue."
2493,10,I am proud to be a star wars fan!,All these years science fiction movies in the past have made people think that only nerds or freaks watch them. I used to think that science fiction was for nerds but I was wrong because after watching the whole saga of Star Wars I enjoyed them all and especially this one which had everything a star wars movie needed. There is plenty of action sequences to enjoy which includes the breath taking lightsaber duels including the one between Obi-Wan and Anakin and it is by far the most emotional Star Wars Movie ever I think. If you thought science fiction movies are for nerds think again because this isn't just a science fiction movie it is an action/adventure and fantasy also and praise to George Lucas!
2494,10,Revenge of the Sith ties it all together,"After seeing The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, I knew that Revenge of the Sith would have to be better by leaps and bounds, and I was right. Don't get me wrong, the first two were necessary for plot development, and I did like Attack of the Clones, but Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was a great movie unto itself, regardless of the fact that it was the last, and most important piece of thread tying the entire saga together. And that it did - seamlessly I might add. I came out of the theater extremely pleased with the movie I had just seen and with the clockwork fashion in which George Lucas had wrapped up his epic space saga. I am not writing any spoilers, because everyone knows (who has yet to see Episode III) what is going to happen ,in a nutshell, but it's the details, and the way Lucas tells the story, that makes it fresh, after 30 years, and all the hype, the last movie in the saga remains what it set out to be from the very beginning, from it's very, very humble beginnings as a screenplay, an idea of a fantastic story in the imagination of one of the 20th century's greatest producer/directors. A story. An epic saga. And the last installment in this story will be like the perfect ending (or should I say beginning) for old fans, new fans, and generations of them to come. Star Wars is a phenomenon unto itself. It is a great story that could be told even without movies. I see it as our civilization's contribution to the legends and myths that are and have been passed down and along down the geneological line for eons. Star Wars will live forever in this fashion. I'm just glad that I'm part of the generation that was privileged enough to grow up with it."
2495,10,The reason to go to the Cinema,"Simply awesome, great effects, good action, this is the type of film that it make it worth while going to the cinema. I would not recommend seeing it anywhere else. the story goes along at a breathtaking pace. some subtle and some not to subtle linking between the two trilogies. do not miss this film. Yoda is great and the Sith lord fight is special from the moment it opens to the final scene this film will take you on a ride. If there are three more stories to be told in this saga then I hope they get written and made. I shall have to go and watch the others again now and enjoy the complete story. do not miss this film if you can help it in any way."
2496,10,Blew Me Out of the Water,"Walking into the movie theater I was very skeptical still trying to forget the complete failure Episode II left in my mind. As I was sitting their watching the movie I realized that this movie actually was amazing, I felt as if I was part of the movie. I shared the feelings everyone had, I felt pain, I felt the good with the bad. Overall it was as I put it an ""evil"" movie but it lead up to that big moment which was cinematic ally satisfying when the put the mask on the severely burnt Lord Vader. The positives: the action was amazing, the animation was amazing, majority of acting was decent. The negative: (note this isn't plural)Natalie Portman's acting was pretty bad for the most part and she couldn't really convince the audience with her cliché lines written up by George Lucas. Other than that after I saw the epic of the crossing over to the dark side in this Star Wars movie, me and my friends wanted to see all of the Star Wars movies, in fact I am about to go see the second episode as I bad as it was I just want to see it again just because the third episode was so good. Overall I highly suggest seeing this movie even if you haven't seen the first two as long as you know the basics of the movie and don't mind some bad acting by Natalie Portman."
2497,9,"Not without its cringe points, but superb none-the-less!","OK, I saw the first screening of ROS last night at my local cinema, and it is fantastic! After seeing this one its hard to believe that the first 2 prequels were made by the same man almost, it is so much better, definitely the best of the prequels, and I might even go as far as saying that its is better than Return of the Jedi. In fact, yes, it is. All of the acting, Yoda included even, is massively improved from TPM and AOTC. Christensen, apart from at one slightly edgy moment, gives a well controlled, convincing portrayal of Anakins descent into evil, and McGregor is also even better as Kenobi, and Portman also delivers her best performance as Padme by far. The computer generated worlds and scenery and just everything, are mind blowing, as the film opens, you are just bombarded with awesome imagery, which really takes your breath away. Not to mention laugh a minute dialogue and action, including from the hilarious R2D2, during the opening sequence. The only down points are a couple of moments of poor dialogue and acting, but fortunately this time around, these moments are few enough to count. (There is also one other thing at the end I couldn't help but cringe at, but I won't say what because it would be a spoiler.) So, hats off to Lucas and team for giving us the best 'Wars' since ESB. Enjoy it as soon as you can!"
2498,,good,"Revenge of the Sith opens with a spectacular light show that looks similar to any video game that takes place in the outer galaxies. This precedes a great story. George Lucas makes it clear that his previous two Star Wars films were flukes for lack of a better term and that he can still tell a story. He also made it clear that he is a bit too in love with the special effects of our time. He over uses them just as much in Revenge of the Sith as he does in the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. This diminishes the intensity of the climactic scene at the end with Obi Won and Anikan and it is also, simply, a distraction. The dialouge in the film is horribly written and the acting isn't much better but putting those flaws aside, the alleged final installment of the Star Wars Saga is a great movie. Anikan's transformation into Darth Vader is the ultimate highlight. The surprise of the film however was the amazing performance by Ian McDiarmid as The Chancellor. He was convincing in every way and perfected every scene he was in. 3 1/2 of 5 stars"
2499,5,OK So Anakin turned to the darkside but why?,"Well for those who still wish to see the movie, you can. It is not as bad as Episode 1 and 2. I guess it is quite an improvement. Why do I grade this movie this low?"
2500,8,3rd best of six,This film brings back the fun and joy in the star wars films after the last two (Episodes I and II). Lots of good moments that actually made me look forward to seeing episode IV again. It's a feast for the eyes and ears if not much for the mind.
2501,10,Good Old Days,"I can't understand the hate against this movie and Hayden Christensen. He done a fantastic job, he is the moody and and angry Anakin we love and he done his part perfectly. After watching disneys sequels, I got confused even more! Damn what happened to these sequels."
2502,10,Episode III is perfect,"I've posted and posted before trying to get people to understand that the new Star Wars movies are never going to be the old Star Wars movies. With this said, I think Episode III is the perfect film. I enjoyed The Phantom Menace, and loved Attack of the Clones, but then again I am a die hard Star Wars fan."
2503,7,One of the best Star Wars films.,"The only thing that made The clone wars tolerable was Anakin, and this movie is totally focused on him. Here, characters finally have some personality and Anakin is extremely well written, having great motivations. The movie manages to make some emotional and powerful scenes that intrigue the viewer more than on any Star Wars film. The only bad things about this movie are the CG, that keeps being horrible, and the fact that it ruins the mystery around Darth Vader, making the original trilogy look predictable and boring after watching the prequels."
2504,7,"More technical-driven than passionate storytelling, but deal with that later.","Long ago (1977, actually) in a collective imaginary far, far away... there was simply STAR WARS, a marvelous popcorn ride that introduced a whole generation of moviegoers to the fantasies, the dreams and the magic of cinema. Then came a superior, much darker and deeper sequel titled THE EMPIRE STRIKE BACK. Still the best of the series, in my opinion. It was the first I remembered ""seeing"" in a theater as a boy, awakening to the wonders of movies. This was 1980. RETURN OF THE JEDI completed the circle, a necessary conclusion that turned out to be bland (it didn't push the envelope) and was shot by the numbers. Anyway, sci-fi and SW buffs closed the book on this original trilogy and lived to tell the story with a smile."
2505,10,Greatest Star Wars ever,This is by far what we have all been waiting. This is the greatest Star Wars ever. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy this over and over again and run right home and watch episode 4. There are so many points of interest that really bring the story together. The circle really is now complete. You will be drawn into the dark side. I spent the last hour on the edge of my seat. The intensity is unreal. You feel all types of emotions. George Lucas really took the time make this story the best possible. He wanted to tell the story of how such a sweet little boy through temptation could be changed. It happens to people everyday. Go see this movie.
2506,9,A Great Film,After reading all of the negative and positive reviews of ROTS I decided to put my own opinion in.
2507,5,Disappointing,"I went to this film with the low expectations, due to episodes I and II. I had allowed myself some hope, because the trailers looked good and the early reviews were positive. After watching this film, I have to wonder if I actually saw the same film as the reviewers."
2508,7,"Perfect plot line, so-so delivery","As a die-hard, I was there at midnight on opening day. I went in with the Star Wars mania that had consumed my childhood. And I have to say, ""Bravo, George! You delivered!"" Kinda."
2509,5,It had potential.,"okay this Star Wars was pretty good. Hayden Christensen did good in the beginning and started to slip in after they landed on Grievous's ship, Natalie Portman you can't really blame due to the fact that George Lucas wrote a horrible script and did a horrible job on directing: poor Natalie, same to Ewan; he tried his hardest to stay to the same Obi Wan that everybody knows, but Lucas had to try and make Obi Wan funny!! I mean what was with that, you notice how Kenobi's personality changes through 1, 2 and 3. Episode I: He's serious, obedient, smart and an incredible fighter, two thumbs up to that Obi Wan. Episode II; He's bossy, and not as interesting. But I still give it two thumbs up. Episode III however... He's supposed to be funny, unintelligent, less skilled with a saber and un dramatic; two thumbs down. Now what was with all the droid jokes?? I watched it again and didn't realize the first time I saw it how many droid jokes there were! It's stupid! Next George needs to cut it on the special effects and put more effort into the Dialogue and acting. The first battle is like walking into ""headache kingdom"". Also Anakin is tring to save Padme, but he chokes her with the force? Also, Where did Grievous come from?? Why did Lucas put him in? The reason why is George Lucas thinks more like this: ""Oh it'd be cool to have a droid who is part human-part droid and he can separate his arms so he has four and he battles obi Wan and is killed and his name is Grievous because his death is grievous, boo hoo."" But do we know anything about Grievous? Where did he come from? Why is he partially human and droid? Who where his past victims, that he obtain the other lightsabers from? But most importantly why didn't he introduce him earlier/ Most of the people I know thought first thing ""who is Grievous""? But WHY DOES HE COUGH? He doesn't even have lungs. Obi Wan opens his chest and you only see a HEART, no LUNGS. So how does he cough. Lucas probably says: ""one does not need lungs to breath young padawan. You only need to trust in your abilities."" STUPID!! "
2510,2,A decent end to a hyped trilogy,"I just saw this movie with a few friends. I'm a Sci-Fi fan, but not a star wars fanatic. After watching this movie, one a my friends quotes ""This movie insulted me as an adult."" I don't know exactly what that means, except maybe the is weak in its acting. The overall storyline is strong. It nicely concludes what was a very confusing and poorly acted Eps 1 & 2. THe CGI is crazy of the wall. Almost all the characters take a back seat except obi wan, anikan, yoda, and Palpotine. As it should be. I heard some comments on Pademe fall from a strong female character. We have to believe the woman has to be shown a blinded by love of a hateful man and she is there to serve one purpose (mother to the twins). Anikan's acting is terrible as usual, but Obi wan and the Empiror acting fill in his gaps. Lucas promised a much darker movie and he delivered. The story got so dark by the end, i questioned why parents would let their 4-6 year olds watch it."
2511,9,"""Wow!"" Forget what the critics think!","I've always had little faith in the talents of George Lucas, for I'm sure very few of you know that Star Wars is actually a stolen idea from a Japanese film by director Kurosawa known as ""The Hidden Fortress"" in the USA."
2512,10,La mejor de las precuelas,"Sin dudas, es la mejor película de las precuelas y me animo a decir, que junto con The Empire Strikes Back, empatan entre ser la mejor de la saga."
2513,10,An Amazing Way to End the Saga,"having now seen the movie 3 times, I am able to breathe and take in what I had been waiting so long to see. I grew up watching the original 3 and anticipated the previous 2 prequels. I wasn't exactly let down by 1 and 2. Sure they don't compare to the originals, but the kid in me still finds them enjoyable. With the release of ep 3, I am even more certain of the prequel's caliber. The previous 2 can't be watched without the third, because when all is said and done, all 3 make up one part of a story. I can go back now and find more strengths in all 5 films just because of episode 3. It not only ties almost every loose end, it also provides such incredible character depth to Anakin that his villainous alter ego, Darth Vader, is now an even greater villain (bet you didn't think that could happen!). What i love about doing the prequels after the beloved originals, is now you go back and watch the originals so differently, and it doesn't take away from that original joy you got from them. It makes them even stronger, if you can believe it. Overall, this film has exceeded any expectations both on a cinematic level and an emotional level, because while I never disliked 1 and 2, i wanted something more. and ep 3 truly delivers on all fronts. be sure to see this movie, both Star Wars fan and non-fan alike. it's great."
2514,8,Almost redeems the others....,"THIS is the ONE movie that should have been made as a prequel to the classic trilogy. The single best opening shot in the series opens into an eye-popping space battle that delivers action, gravitas and even humor within its opening five minutes. Things seem tightened up -- even just the shot scale is more intimate than previous prequels. Performances are better and the VFX artists keep improving on Yoda (it makes me WANT them to go back to the previous 2 prequels and digitally enhance him). Oh yes, and I think I even CARED about Anakin in this one (though still not so much about his forbidden romance with Padme). I think it is a bit difficult to go all out and say it's a home run, but I'll take this triple over any of Lucas's previous fouls with the prequels."
2515,1,"Not as bad as the other Prequels, but still terrible","This movie isn't as bad as the other Prequels, but it is still terrible, but I will start by saying what I liked about this movie, first there is no Jar Jar Binks except in the background during Padmé's funeral, and doesn't say a word thank God he doesn't say anything. and that's it, it is still a CGI snooze fest, that you pretty much laugh at the end when Darth Vader says Noooooooo!!!!!!! The entire theater,( including myself), started out laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes from laughing, it doesn't help that Hayden Christensen over acted his way through the movie, that he seemed like a parody, in fact the entire movie feels like a parody, that we laughed in the Order 66 scenes even in the one, in which Anakin/Darth Vader kills young children, or when Yoda is killing the clones, or each time General Grievous talks, it was just one of the funniest movies ever, right alongside Battlefield Earth, and The Room."
2516,8,Something went wrong in post-production....,Perhaps I've been a little too harsh on this film. I recently went back and watched Episode I and II and can finally say that this was my favorite of the prequel trilogy.
2517,9,Best of the first three,"I would give this a ten, but there are certain flaws to this movie, but not as many as the first two. Visually its stunning, great battles and great presentation. The dialogue is pretty good, but not the best. A little bit of humor is also in the movie. Some parts even might have a tear jerker quality to them."
2518,6,George! Please hire a dialog writer!,Although better than 1 & 2 Lucas is still clueless when it comes to writing dialog. So I'm left with two movies. A great action flick when no one was talking and a boring snooze fest when they were.
2519,8,A great and epic ending to the most well known movie series of all time,"So why does Darth Vader have to wear his unforgettable black armor and helmet? The question is finally answered in the final episode (but will there be a VII, VIII, and IX) of the epic story spanning almost 30 years. Even though there may have been disappointment after viewing episodes I and II, anyone who is disappointed with episode III, doesn't know a good movie when they see one. Personally I'm not a huge Star Wars fan or anything, but I willingly drove my car illegally to the theater, while risking arrest, 10 days in jail, and having my car impounded, just so I can see the becoming of Darth Vader. But enough about that, I'm sure anyone reading this is doing so in order to get a review from one of there peers, not a biased movie critic (not like there was one who disliked this movie anyways)."
2520,10,Lovely ending to my favourite film series of all time.,"Well, I watched the other 5 thousands of times before this one came out. The original trilogy was easily the best with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones not living up to the standards of them. But the third and final film... was absolutely perfect."
2521,5,Somewhat redeemed at the end,"The beginning of this film feels like a video game, and in this case that is not a compliment. Seemingly interesting characters are introduced with no characterization only to be killed. Why did General Grievous have a cough, what are his motivations and why does he take up so much screen time while being such a minor character? Certainly there were other ways for the Emperor to test Anakin's growth by having him defeat Dooku. Lucas has created a world too vast and in doing so he could only stumble to a finish. It was difficult to care about any of the Jedi that died in this film because none of them were fleshed out characters. It seems that their only purpose was to show how tragic and unexpected the demise of the Jedi was. Again, couldn't this have been presented more effectively? This film is nothing but elaborate special effects with no substance until the final 40 minutes or so. The acting was an improvement, however slightly. The acting still seemed wooden but it felt like it was likely due solely to George's writing this time. The story of Vader's transformation is a tragic one. However, it is flawed. The Jedi are supposed to be protectors of the peace, why would one of them leave a severely dismembered person they supposedly loved to squirm around helplessly? Kenobi's action seemed cruel and out of character. Overall, this film had great potential, but the story feels rushed to completion. The last 40 or so minutes contained flashes of the elements that made the original series great. Yet, overall, this was a huge disappointment that will be revealed as such, just like the other prequels, once the initial buzz fades."
2522,6,aren't you supposed to save the best for last?,"When George Lucas said the 30+ crowd prefer the older Star Wars movies to the newer ones while younger preference is the opposite, i realize after seeing Revenge Of The Sith Lucas was saying that kids today have bad taste in movies..."
2523,7,A good film rather than a great one.,"Lucas had a particularly difficult task in trying to ensure that the audience was gripped by a story when they already knew the outcome. They new that the main protagonists would all survive (As they appear in 'A New Hope' and as such, all the battles, however good the CGI (and it is very good) and acting (Some are better than others) were known entities. This said it can be done and has been done better in the past. Peter Jackson managed this in all three Lord of the Rings films and indeed won a well deserved 'Best Film' Oscar for the final instalment. Sith is no Lord of the rings, but is certainly the best of the new Star Wars films and well worth seeing."
2524,7,Nice one George. Take a break .Go make more money elsewhere.,Thats the title of this review.
2525,4,Total Failure,"This key movie tying the prequel trilogy to the original (middle) trilogy was an abysmal failure. When the middle trilogy came out it survived poor writing by having great (for the time) special effects. The special effects in the prequels could not save them because those effects are now common and therefore boring. Without any significant improvements or surprises in the special effects, the writing needed to be improved, but, if anything it got significantly worse. The key piece tying the prequels to the middle trilogy was the origin story of Darth Vader. To say that the writing of the origin story was abysmal would be too kind. George Lucas is quite obviously not a talented writer, so he should have had the sense to hire a talented writer to rework the prequels into something more interesting, less inane, and more believable. This is particularly important for episode 3, though e1 and e2 also did a lot of damage to the enjoyability of the Star Wars saga. The Darth Vader origin story took bad writing to new depths. It was poorly conceived, inadequately developed, and had not even a shred of believability."
2526,10,Almost as great as the originals!,"Nothing can beat the classic Star Wars Trilogy, but this movie came pretty close in my opinion! I thought this was so well done. At the end of the movie i was crying because it was so sad. It made you really feel for the character Darth Vader. The only flaws I saw with it were that Padme died to early because Leia was supposed to have known her for a short while before she died, and that she died of a broken heart. I understand that in order to avoid that though, the movie would have been like another hour. I t might have worked out better if this was split into two movies just so that more could be included but that might have ruined it. I loved this film and saw it four times in theaters."
2527,9,the BEST sequel in the saga,"'the revenge of the sith' is definitely the best one in the saga; not just because of the powerfully made plot but also the special effects being used which is amazingly brilliant. I was always a fan of the Star Wars saga and enjoy all episodes but this one is in the top. What i like the most about this movie is the plot of Anakin Skywalker turning on to the dark side; the way he transforms into dark Vader at the last bits of the film just excites me.The casts; especially Hyden Christenson and Ewan McGregor has done an excellent job in performing their lightsyber skills; the scene at the volcano which they begin their battle is just amazingly made, along with the music. The setting and background of this futuristic world is also very well created. Not only do i enjoy all parts of the film; the music and soundtrack is also amongst my favourite. No doubt it made a record box-office in its first day."
2528,4,The closest thing to 2.5 hours of special effects (nothing else),"I have only seen a few movies where I find my self thinking ""How much time 'till this is over?!?"" Revenge of the Sith is one of them. Itt gave me the impression that Lucas wanted to get STAR WARS over with I have always been satisfied with the STAR WARS movies, especially the original ones. Episode 1 was OK too but not as god as the first 3. It seemed that Lucas decided to just forget the story when he got his hands on the digital animation software. the story line is so cut -and-paste it is amazing that the movie was 2.5 hours long. it could be summed up it like 2 sentences: The Sith Lord turns Anakin to the dark side by promising power to save Padme. Anakin turns into Darth Vader, Padme dumps him and dies during childbirth. I expected Revenge of the Sith to have a more unpredictable explanation for Anakin's turn to the dark side but in the end i wasn't the least bit surprised at all. Palpatine is the Sith lord in disguise, and when Anakin realizes this i was like ""duh!"" The only way Palpatine could have made is true identity more obvious would be if he walked around ,wearing a sign that said ""I AM THE SITH LORD"". As if the story wasn't bad enough, the acting was....not very good, it's like the actors didn't read the scripts all the way through be for the final shooting. Hayden Christensen is not a very good Jedi knight, he comes off more has a stressed out teenager whose problems could be solved with a little therapy. Natalie Portman is the same way, more like a young helpless girl like the fact that she was once a queen had no influence on her at all. This actually surprised me i saw Shatered Glass and Hayen Christonson was very good in it (mabey it's because he was supposed to be a stressed-out teenager) This wasn't the kind of performance i expected from him. But the effects were very good and the fight scenes between Yoda & the Sith Lord and Vader & Obi-Wan were exiting (Yoda is one of the main reasons i like STAR WARS) I would suggest that u rent it or see it at the dollar theater when u r bored one day"
2529,10,way cool!,"I thought it was awesome! It's definitely my favorite of the Star Wars movies (my favorite before was Return of the Jedi). The battle scenes were so sweet! I especially liked the last battle between Obi Wan and Anakin. Really the only thing I didn't like about the movie was that Anakin murdered all those little kids and helped in the murder of many of the good guys (so so sad)...but I guess that's what happens when you go to the dark side. It was also sad how Padme died without really getting to spend time with Luke and Leia. Other than that, it was definitely awesome to watch. A very good way to end the prequels. Anyone else agree?"
2530,8,A nice completion to a masterpiece,I went to the midnight show and I was so excited. The energy at the theater was terrific. I haven't felt that kind of a rush since seeing Episode I. After watching Episode III I almost feel like I and II were made better by it. The character development was brought out like it was in the originals and the effects were terrific. Lucas really did a great job beating the hype to create a terrific film. A lot of the acting was the best yet and the correography got better as the movie went on. This movie is a great bridge from the new series to the old. I was worried that everything was going to fall apart with plot holes left and right but it didn't. A great end to a great saga.
2531,10,Superb!!!,"Fantastic movie!! Star Wars is back with a bang, Lucas has nailed it this time!!! Yoda kicks ass and Obi Wan rules... Its like watching the OT, its great to be Star Wars fan again. The action scenes are amazing! The best ones are Yoda vs Palpy and Obi Wan vs Anakin. Order 66 was very moving and the opening space battle was excellent!! The Emperor and Obi Wan steals the show together with Yoda and R2 D2. The only thing that bother me was the scene between Anakin and Padme on the balcony *ouch* just horrible....but almost everything with the movie is just great."
2532,9,"Finally, we get to see how he gets the ""dark"" outfit!!","First and foremost, kudos to George Lucas and his team at Lucasfilms for creating a wonderful story that has transcended time! This is it!! This is what I and a whole host of others have been waiting 28 years for(let me repeat that, 28 YEARS!!!), to see how the ""Prince of the Dark Side"" came into being! This movie is ""A MUST SEE"" for Star Wars fans of all ages! The movie, from the opening scene, grabs you by your interest glands and holds you there until it's over! I've already seen the movie 5 times and will probably see it another 5 times, it's just that good! Will it be nominated for ""Best Picture"" this year? Probably not, but it should get ""a nod"" for it's flawless ""special effects""! For all of you(myself included) who were not that impressed with the first two episodes of this trilogy, this one is for you! More, more, more, is what you get with this latest installment! More action, more drama, more light-sabers, more force, more life! George Lucas has put the missing links together with this one! This movie should easily be in this year's top ten list of best films! Once you've seen this episode, acquaint or reacquaint yourself with episodes IV, V, and VI! Thanks again Mr. Lucas for a wonderful story told over 6 films!"
2533,10,AWESOME MOVIE!! (you just have to go see it to believe it!!!),"WARNING: There is NO intention of spoiling anything for anyone, so what little I do tell is with the assumption that it is already common knowledge."
2534,10,The Best Yet,"This movie rocked from the beginning to the very end. It was great to see the intricacies of who Anakin turns to Darth Vader and gasp you actually feel sympathy for Darth Vader in his shell of a life-suit. It is awe inspiring when you hear the first breath in the suit (WOW!). It also was great to see the whole thing sealed up, I felt it was an odd full circle to the Aniakin trilogy and the beginning of the Luke trilogy. The whole series now feels like one big long film rather than 6 individual films. The acting was decent and the dialog actually was not a joke, much good in this film. Though the film is intense and emotional it was worth it, I will probably see it once more in the theatre. I urge you to see it, it truly rocked seeing the end (or the beginning of the series, whatever way you see it) I applaud George Lucas' efforts on this one. There was just so much good about this one."
2535,10,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (BEST Movie in The Prequel's),The saga is now complete and I'd like to say 'Thank You' to George Lucas.
2536,7,Lucas finally again creates a very good movie,"George Lucas crafted a wonderful film in the original Star Wars, then turned directing duties over to others for the next two films (which resulted in The Empire Strikes Back, one of the great SF films, and Return of the Jedi, a very good film in its own right). But he retook the helm, insisting on directing, writing, and editing the three prequels."
2537,4,Too Panicked,"""The chosen one, the boy may be..."""
2538,8,"A well-paced and produced prequel, to the infamous IV episode.","Episode III three finally sets a cracking pace; one which is far better structured and edited than the previous two blunders . Had this film failed to deliver, the franchise would have been delivered a crushing blow, one that would have left episodes IV, V & VI as a stand alone trilogy."
2539,7,Arguably Lucas' best directed film,"It seems that a handful of dissenting voices out there are hell-bent on making sure this film fails (an exercise in futility, if ever there was one!), having apparently regurgitated their 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' reviews on a film which doesn't deserve anywhere near such vitriolic criticism. Indeed, I question whether or not some of these people have even seen the film at all given that I for one found little to no evidence to support their claims. And no, I wasn't sitting in my local multiplex sporting a brand new pair of Rose tinted glasses."
2540,1,Weak,"Perfect for star wars geeks, but not for normal social people."
2541,5,Don't be too impressed with this technological terror...,"you've constructed, George Lucas. The ability to create entire scenes with CGI wizardry is insignificant compared to the force of a good script. (With apologies to Star Wars IV--A New Hope)"
2542,10,a lifetime story,"Since Episode III has not yet been released, I can't obviously post a comment... yet. However, seen or not, it actually CAN be commented, just because of the importance STAR WARS has in movie history. Me (as many others in this world) were eagerly waiting for this episode, not only because it will tell us about DARTH VADER'S birth, but because is the linking end of a story we all started to see and enjoy 28 years ago!... Is not fun to know this is the last of the saga; so sad we had no more ""episodes"" to eagerly wait for; so sad no more expectation for STAR WARS ""next one"", but everything comes to an end, even STAR WARS. I know this is going to be a very good one, arguably the best of them all (difficult to believe) no doubt about it. On the other hand, when I started to trace Episode III on advance in STAR WARS web site, I was frightened: THERE WAS NO CREDIT FOR DARTH VADER'S CHARACTER!!! What's this, I said to myself, is there any chance for Lord Darth Vader not to appear in this long awaited movie??? NO WAY!!! There wasn't even credit for the best voice ever to come from a man (Lord James Earl Jones The Voice He Is) and think this is unfair. I don't know why, don't even imagine WHY can this be possible. No problem: Vader and Jones, in the movie they are, brief moment yes, but present they are... forever in my life. Thanks to George Lucas and everyone involved in this LIFETIME story. May the force be with you..."
2543,5,Boring,"Boring!!! I really don't understand why this episode is considered any better then the other two! This movie seemed to drag from one shot to the next. The acting was horrible! Samuel Jackson probably was the worst of the lot....George Lucas really knows how to make good actors bad! The effects and action scenes had no energy to them. It seemed like more of a repeat of the action and effects found in episode 2. I love CG but there were shots where the effects seemed unnecessary or excessive. I think it would have been better off if the whole movie was done in CG, including the human characters. In this way everything would feel more integrated. The humans wouldn't look out of place!!! Again, boring!!"
2544,10,The greatest movie in the Star Wars saga,"Revenge of the Sith is a perfect movie. It does everything right, from the story which is the darkest and most emotional in the saga, to the screenplay and special effects (the CGI still looks decent in 2019 but regardless the design is fantastic), the plot is paced perfectly and after many many rewatches it is impossible not to tear up during Natalie Portman's superb performance when Padmé cries to Anakin ""You're breaking my heart!"" and ""You're going down a path I just can't follow."" after he turns to the dark side. Hayden Christensen (especially unfairly treated) and Ian McDiarmid, who play Anakin and Sheev Palpatine respectively also give great performances which occasionally in Anakin's case are lessened by dodgy dialog (""Love won't save you Padmé, only my new powers can do that"" sounds hilariously bad and lessens the impact of the saddest part in the movie) but that is an unfortunate trait of all of Lucas' fantastic work. Even if you are not a fan of the prequels, this movie is amazing and deserves just as much, if not more recognition as The Empire Strikes Back."
2545,3,Best of the new 3 but doesn't touch the originals,"Without question the best of the New Star Wars episodes but was still lacking. The dialog and acting was horrible! The moment at which Anakin turns to the dark side was so "" oops, I just made Mace Windu die . . . I guess I'm on the dark side now"". Within 2 minutes he is killing Jedi children without remorse when he had just shown remorse for being the reason Mace Windu died. George Lucas does not know how to direct people, that is why Empire Strikes back was the best, because he did not direct it. The movie altogether was disappointing. The makers probably realised that it was pretty much crap so they thought they would overload it with special effects to compensate."
2546,10,Lucas gives the fans what they want and delivers with flying colors,"With the final installment in the Star Wars saga, George Lucas delivers a strong performance by giving the fans what they want; specifically, the two legendary duels at the end of the movie. These duels are undoubtedly one of the most epic and beautifully created fights ever, EVER seen in any science fiction movie. Anakin fights Obi-Wan in a duel not seen since the very first Star Wars movie, and the masters of both sides square off as Yoda confronts the Emperor. Many characters in previous movies appear, such as Christopher Lee. All of the Episode II actors play their respcetable parts again in Episode III and deliver, especially both McGregor and McDiarmid. Strong performances are also given by Oz, Christenson, Jackson, and Portman. This is the first prequel to be able to even hold a lighters to Episodes IV, V, and VI, and in most cases exceeds them. A true find."
2547,8,Lucas redeems himself with an impressive Final Prequel,Well now I have seen them all I can now say that I can rate all 6. I-6 II-7 III-8 IV-10 V-10 VI-9
2548,8,May be the second best Star Wars,"I think this one is up there with Empire and Jedi... This was truly a good Star Wars Movie. The dialogue in this movie is better then in Episode I and II mainly because there is very little. Most of the movie was the huge ongoing war of Jedi fight scenes. I thought this Star Wars was much edgier then the others, it was much darker."
2549,1,The last edition to Star Wars,"When watching this film i was incredibly disappointed. I am a fan of the other movies, however bad the acting was, but this time around I couldn't get over how bad each character presented to the audience. The special effects weren't that special and all round too much money was spent on such a boring and disappointed result. Annikin's portrayal was so cringeful throughout the whole movie i was tempted to throw something at the screen every time he opened his mouth. I am known for sitting through and watching crap movies to see the result, but this was the first i walked out of and demanded my money back. What a boring movie, George Lucus, I'm disappointed."
2550,7,"Great effects, if only the story was half as good.",If I can say one thing about Lucas it is this: he cannot write. Or very poorly.
2551,10,Oh. My. God.,"I've seen many films that I thought were good, but after seeing ROTS, it makes all those other films look like amateur films. Anakin's descent to the dark side was perfectly portrayed. I found myself sobbing at Count Dooku's unfair death, at Anakin turning evil, and at the end, which signifies the end of an era. The actors' lines were sometimes heart-wrenching-""You were the chosen one!""-and I almost fainted from sheer sorrow as I watched Anakin, the once heroic Jedi, lie there burning. This film drew me in right from the start and I intend to snatch it up as soon as it comes out on DVD. George Lucas has truly written a masterpiece."
2552,7,Camp and Cheese,"I was disappointed upon seeing the third and last installment of a saga which I had a religious following for until I viewed Episode 1. This movie is much better than the two other prequels but still does not possess what it takes to be a great Star Wars film. The crappy acting, the choppy editing and especially the five minute lovey-dovey crap every fifteen minutes. The relationship between Padme and Anakin was unrealistic and boring and his change to the dark side was much too quick. The insertion of Chewie was a nice touch but his five second cameo couldn't save the film. The ending with Anakin becoming Vader was impeccable, everything except for the scream when he learns of Padme's death...pure CHEESE. Overall, the movie stank and the only true reason I feel the need to give it a 7 is due to the fact I love STAR WARS."
2553,3,What have you done???,"As a fourteen year old i am sure many readers would have expected an excellent review. well i regret to inform you that this movie was beyond description. No it wasn't as bad as the first two but still sucked. May i ask who the hell wrote the prologue at the beginning? Even that managed to sink beyond hell! Lucas kinda balanced it out with a perfect trilogy in the 1980s and then the trilogy from hell with high tech power guns and graphics. That wasn't what inspired people the first time. It was the brilliant story played out by real actors and believable emotions. Not actors who squeal in bed (mum no! mum mum! no mum!)and falling from an aircraft squirming on the floor when you should be dead ""are you alright malady"" ""ughh ugh I'm dieing but uh uh I'm great lets go"" The old trilogy had cool action, good romance not ""I'm so in love with you "" ""no I'm so in love with you""."
2554,10,"Sad, dark, and action packed, Revenge of the Sith delivers!","As dark as I knew Revenge of the Sith would be, I was never prepared for the magnitude of how sad and gloomy the movie actually was. However, with a plot that links this trilogy with the original very well, and action that tops any other Star Wars film to date, Episode III, is nothing short of spectacular. It's amazing how George Lucas can write some of the most corny lines in film to date, and give little direction for actors who are maybe not as familiar with his ideas as he is, yet still come out with an incredible piece of art. I don't recommend this movie for young children, but I do recommend that fans see this movie over and over again to see all the things going on in every shot. Good job, George. We'll miss seeing these movies!"
2555,10,One of the best movies i've ever seen!!!,Just got out of the midnight showing of episode3 and man ...i am speechless. Effects are probably the best ever put on film. Acting is improved greatly. The last forty five minutes made me feel that vibe that star wars made me feel twenty years ago. Parents do be careful. I took my 10 and 12 year old stepdaughters who enjoyed it.. but there are a few scary scenes. I got stuck in the second row in the theatre and it still looked insane. Don't miss this movie. It doesn't get any better than this.Portman and Christensen are OK but Ian McDiarmid steals the show. His transformation into the Emperor is way intense. Cool to see Chewie back even if it was just for 2 scenes.
2556,9,Thank the Maker!,"An excellent finish to the prequel trilogy. Episode III is a staggeringly great film where all questions are answered and the universe we know and love is expanded upon with new planets, creatures and vehicles as it segues into the original trilogy."
2557,8,"Now I know all the answers, I'm 63 and can go in peace!","It was a relief to finally get to see ""the end"" before I met my own! But, hey everyone, it WAS worth the wait. Others have written much about the actual movie... to which I will only say, ""it is exciting and presents a lot of information. Stay alert! However I'm not satisfied; I want more! Seriously, I find myself wondering now what directions Star Wars could take to keep us going.... maybe along some alternate Episodes 4 & 5 to get to a REALLY Grand Finale Episode 6 (or might that be 666?). Just thinking out loud, everyone. That's what Star Wars does to you... it helps you think along a more grand scale than you thought possible. But back to the present: This is a good, fun movie. I believe the ""darkness and violent"" content ""alerts"" were mere publicity stunts. Much of that type of violence seems to be lost on the younger ones who see more on Saturday morning cartoons. I will see this movie again, and maybe again. (Yes, I know some of you have already been to the movie many times but I've got eight children and bunches of grandchildren to take care of first!) See you all at the movies."
2558,,Revenge of the Sith,Finally it has arrived and i'm glad it did. The biggest nightmare would've been for me noticing monumental gaps in the end of the Sith and the beginning of new hope - fortunately all the loose ends have largely been tied up.
2559,6,This was nothing like I expected it to be....,"I am just back from the cinema after seeing Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and I must say I was not very impressed. OK, the special effects were very good, my hat is off to ILM who have done brilliantly with the effects. Most of the performances by the actors were OK. Samuel L was good in the role of Mace Windu, giving a believable performance, as did Ewan McGregor. Another IMDb comment said ""the usually competent Ewan McGregor spouting some rather silly lines"" but in Mr McGregor's defence, the lines he said are in control of the script writer, not so much the control of the actor, though may have some influence on a few lines."
2560,8,"Impressive, but painfully flawed (spoilers!)","(This review contains (potential) spoilers for all six Star Wars movies, so beware!)"
2561,5,Not That Good( Maybe a spoiler or two),"This movie is not bad, but it's definitely not good either. The scripting definitely needed some re-editing, as well as digging up some new actors. Hayden Christensen has the worst delivery on his lines i have ever had the misfortune of hearing. He says the best lines he has so blandly that those lines are as bad as his bad lines are. The whole character of Anakin was a pathetic kid, whining the whole movie that people didn't trust him enough. Whatever happened to earning trust? The Natalie Portman role was also reduced to a self pitying prick. I like Portman a lot but she did not shine in this movie, partly because she had nothing to work with. The few romantic scenes in this movie are thankfully few, but are the most awkward that i have ever seen. Christensen appears totally out of place in his romantic scenes while Portman appears comfortable enough, but George Lucas cannot write a love scene. The dialogue was absolutely terrible! Audible groans were heard throughout the theater including my own during the balcony scene. The special effects while amazing in one scene, could be absolutely horrible in the next scene. What saves this movie is the action and the two characters of Kenobi and Palpatine. Ewan Mcgregor has given better performances but his is the shining one in this ridiculous farse. He at least tries to make do with the pathetic dialogue that he was given by George Lucas and at least showed some emotion when he said his lines. The fellow who played Palpatine, i forget his name right now, did a great job as the evil emperor. The only really cool part was how the mystery of the sith was explained by Palpatine. Definitely rent this movie, but don't see it in the theater. If you feel the need however, as i did, to see it in the theater, go to a matinée(Cheaper). On a personal note, I wanted Samuel L. Jackson to live a little longer and die a better death than he did. 5/10."
2562,6,Disappointing,"Frankly, after all the talk about how good this film was, and how Lucas had finally gotten it right, I went in to this movie with far higher hopes then I should have. I was to put it mildly disappointed. The movie is completely undone by Lucas' inability to direct actors. Yes the effects were fantastic, and the action and pacing were great. But the story line and acting left much to be desired. Anakin's decision to join the dark side should have been gut wrenching. It should have been given much more time to mature. To be frank, it really should have been started in the last movie. Instead it is reduced to a ho-hum moment, where he just seems to say ""Allright, I'll be evil."" It needed to be far more then the shrug of the shoulders that it becomes. Hayden Christiansen tries to convey conflict in Anakin via a series of twisted grimaces, that don't really work, and fail to truly reveal any internal conflict that may be occurring. Natalie Portman is reduced to a supporting role, and not a very interesting one at that. All she does is cry and worry throughout the film, not at all like the woman of action we saw in the first two movies, and her death scene is given very short shrift. Jimmy Smits is completely wasted in a bit role that barely makes sense, and Samuel L. Jackson, while he does get a great death scene, is once again missing in action throughout the film, seeming to phone in his role. The only actor who rises above all of the muck, and is the saving grace of the movie is Ewan McGregor, who puts on a marvelous performance despite Lucas."
2563,9,"Deep, dark, phenomenal","There is a lot going on in this movie, and it requires repeated viewings. Mr. Lucas worked with Broadway playwright Tom Stoppard to add some grist to the dialog here, and it shows. This film is NOT for the younglings. This movie most definitely deserves its PG-13 rating. The content is dark, and violence, while well-edited and contained, is prominent. Having read the novelization, I am eager to see the deleted scenes in the DVD release. The acting, while still not up to its potential, has improved notably from that on display in Episodes 1 and 2. Mr. McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Mr. McDiarmid (Chancellor Palpatine) are (in my opinion) highly worthy of Oscar nominations for their work here. A magnificent and emotionally overwhelming completion to this series. Highly recommended."
2564,10,Perfect ending,"The storyline calculable, but enjoyable. How become Anakin the biggest villain of cinema history? How disappear the Jedi order? What weakened the republic?"
2565,10,Excellent!!!,I just want to say that I am a Star Wars fan but nowhere near the level of most of the die hard fans. I was very excited for the release of the third and final prequel. I actually saw it the first weekend which is very unusual for me.
2566,4,Ridiculous,"This movie is awful, incoherent with their own concepts, boring, non-sense and an insult. Full of cliches and stupid things. 02:19 hour of wasted time."
2567,7,Now if only we had a real director and scriptwriter.,"Star Wars movies are always a bit difficult for me to opine on. On the one hand, I'm not a Star Wars fanatic; I simply enjoy the movies. So how am I to comment on the sublter things that I may not appreciate? On the other hand, no matter how much fan service you put in or how creative the worlds you shape are, a bad movie is a bad movie no matter what type of fan you are."
2568,7,The Force is....Sort of with this one....,"So finally after sitting through two disastrous films that bare no resemblance whatsoever to the original Star Wars trilogy, it finally seemed with Episode 3, the final part in the epic Star Wars saga, that George Lucas had sat down with his producers and said 'alright, we're gonna cut the fat out and leave in the muscle'. Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith (a clever title that harks back to what may have been the original title for Return of the Jedi) definitely cuts out the fat of the first two films, however that loose skin still remains."
2569,9,Revenge of the Sith offers everything a Star Wars fan needs.,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is not only one of the best entries in the prequel trilogy, it may very well be one of the best entries in the entire saga. It delivers a storyline like no other, and presents it in a way that is dark, and brooding and overall it creates the perfect atmosphere for Anakin Skywalker's descent into evil."
2570,10,A depressing masterpiece,I will try to avoid as much spoilers as possible. I am going by my memory from seeing this movie in the theatre in 2005. I remember that there is little plot and endless battle.
2571,10,A fantastic end for 30 years,"Nowadays when is so difficult to impressive anyone with special effects, The revenge of the Sith has, is one of the best entertainment films that I've seen in the las years. The knight fighting with the light swords is fantastic also the battles in the space are amazing. I absolutely recommend to watch this film even if you're not a Jedi maniac. One of the few films you have to watch in you're life, in the way as the lord of the rings. If you have watched the other films you'll realized this is the best of the last three. I believe this one is in the way of the episode IV and in the way of the empire strikes back. I'd like to mention all the different alien that appear and the impressive built of the different planets. In conclusion unbelievable, just watch it."
2572,7,"Best of the Prequels, but Still Far from Great","Revenge of the Sith has a special place in my heart. It came out in theaters when I was still a kid, and it was the one I probably watched the most growing up. I know nearly every line of dialogue and can recite lines on command. As a kid, it was probably my favorite Star Wars movie. But then, I grew up and realized that the movie has tons of flaws, sharing many of the problems that the other prequels have."
2573,6,i must see...but for no special reason,"opening night. and opening night that has been anticipated by many since a long long time ago. people showing up in costume to finally see the transformation of Anakin to Vader, the birth of Luke... and so on. the movie starts, the audience applauds - and then..... nothing special. the long awaited movie pretty much ends up being just a pretty long movie. a movie which obviously you have to see till the very end - when Anakin turns to the dark side. that is the reason we bought the ticket in the first place. but all in all the movie isn't really good. great affects throughout the movie. probably the best affects of all the six movies. but a very, very slow and boring start to the movie, and very, very ( i can't even stress how very) bad acting all through the movie. if ever there was a doubt of casting Hayden Christensen there is no doubt anymore. the kid just couldn't pull it off. neither could Natalie portman for that matter. even thought her part in the movie was quite small, maybe it was just better that way. other then Ewan McGregor, who didn't shine either but was semi OK, the whole cast really blew it when it came down to the acting, which might just be (and forgive the blasphemy) the fault of the director. with all the down sides to this movie, it is still a must see for star wars fans. it is. because we just have to know the whole story. not to mention that the second half of the movie is quite better the the first half, and it's far from a bad movie. it's just not really good. but truthful it just might be the poorer version of a finally to a poorer trilogy."
2574,2,Here's the thing...,"I cannot believe this movie is rated so highly...and to think it is supposed to be in the Top 250 movies of all time according to this site, just boggles the mind..."
2575,9,"Action packed, very satisfying","Action packed from the start, this movie has eye candy all over. I definitely have to see this movie more often to see it all. The story is pretty well known of course, which makes it not much of a surprise, but it was still great to see. Sort of like watching Gandalf fall with the Balrog. You know whats going to happen, but seeing it on screen is just so cool. The acting was solid, the camera styles were great, and the colors match the mood of this film. CGI has obviously improved as Yoda and some of the animals look much much better then in the previous two movies. Why not rate with a ten ? I guess it has to do with the length of this movie. It would have been nice to see Anakin going over to the Dark side more gradually. Now he just decides and it's done. Lucas could have made the movie a little longer. Let's hope there will be an extended version soon."
2576,8,"Good, but not perfect","I saw it last night at midnight. I liked a large portion of it, but I had 2 major issues, and a few quirks."
2577,6,Unimpresive...Most Unimpressive,"Bore! From the moment I saw that exclamation point, I knew it was downhill from there. The teasers and trailers for what could possibly go on to be the biggest Star Wars movie of all time showed it to be a departure from the first two, a more mature turn for what was to be our final Lucas-helmed look into the universe he created."
2578,10,A brilliant final chapter in the saga,"Revenge of the Sith is quite definitely the best of the prequels and up there with A New Hope and Empire as the best of the six. There's plenty of action - the two final duels - Yoda v Darth Sidious + Obi-Wan v Anakin are simply awesome!! Also some nice references to the original films - the closing scene on Tatooine for one! - and it was lovely to finally get to see planets like Alderaan and Kashyyyk that we'd heard mentioned but never actually been to. And great to see Chewie again too! All the loose ends are neatly tied up, unanswered questions solved and by the end you do feel all set to watch the originals again now that all the background is filled in."
2579,10,"The end of Star Wars , but it was a great ending.","At long last, the final part in the saga of what is considered the greatest series ever is delivered. Episode III was definitely the best in the prequel series, but all six movies were excellent, however. Anyway, you're probably wondering what goes on in between, huh? So it's 3 years after AOTC and the movie starts out with a huge space battle like in ""Return of the Jedi,"" and as we expected, it's Obi-Wan and Anakin in the midst of it, and they eventually have to rescue the Chancellor (Palpatine) who is held captive on a starship headed by droid leader General Grievous. Then Anakin kills Dooku by cutting his hands off and then his head, which is kinda cruel."
2580,10,Nice way to go out,"As critical as we all have been of George Lucas, he is still guilty of several things, giving too much credence to what the fans say, catering to the merchandising agendas, etc. However, Episode III is a classic piece of movie making, and should be looked at as such."
2581,5,Undoubtedly the weakest in the series,"Unfortunately, there are so many wrong things in this movie that I don't know where to start from..."
2582,10,A Rousing 'Revenge',"""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."
2583,7,Darkest story of the SW-series,"I didn't expect too much from this, judging by the quality of it's (new) predecessors. Even though the movie had some very stupid ideas in the story (a coughing robot ... c'mon) and way too much special effects to compliment the story, I still found myself enjoying it."
2584,10,The Best Star Wars Movie,"As a huge Star Wars fan I am incredibly delighted with the final outcome of this grand saga. George Lucas reminded us all of his massive potential as both a writer and a director, by taking new generations to the same place he took millions of people in the 70s and 80s. What I believe makes this particular episode better than the previous episodes and even better than the original trilogy, is the darkness of its content, the quality of the story, and the incredible speed at which the non-stop action advances. From the opening 20th Century Fox and Lucas Film logos the to very end I was completely submerged into an incredibly rich plot complete with outstanding performances and thrilling action. I sincerely believe that making the picture a PG13 was a great decision for it allowed Lucas to construct a better film over-all, especially with the visual portrayal of Anakin's downfall to the dark side. Finally it is wonderful to enjoy an action picture that actually revolves around a solid plot as opposed to a just special effects and lines of massive explosions. This is an unforgettable film for everyone, Star Wars fan or not."
2585,5,Two Words: Soap Opera,"I saw ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"" yesterday. Going in, I felt like an abused wife who keeps going back to her abusive husband. Episode 1 sucked. Episode 2 was tolerable, but it could have been so much better. Episode 3? ""It's going to be different this time,"" I told myself. ""It's going to be like it was when we first met."" (Insert bitch slap here) I can sum up my review in two words: soap opera. The visual effects are outstanding. The acting is atrocious at times. Hayden Christensen makes convincing faces when he's supposed to be angry/enraged; however, once he opens his mouth, ham is spewed out. His exchanges with Natalie Portman are straight out of ""Days Of Our Lives"". Jimmy Smits, like in Episodes 1 and 2, is worthless... this time with more speaking parts. Any Jedi Knight that is not a main character is a wuss; they die off like gnats. I did appreciate Ian McDiarmid's performance as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine/The Emperor, and Ewan McGregor was pretty good until his dialog preceding the showdown with the newly crowned Lord Vadar. If you must go see this movie, check out a matinée."
2586,8,Multiple Action!,"Spectacular imagery of action. This episode has more light saber battles, more clones vs. droids battle, and finally an episode where evil wins."
2587,5,*Insert lame movie pun here*,"The first two films of the highly anticipated new trilogy disappointed hardcore fans of the series and alienated many casual ones, but Episode II, while bogged down by a terribly executed love story, had its moments and laid the groundwork for a return to the series' glory days, but Episode III comes through, even if the end of this sextilogy leaves a lingering sense of departure."
2588,10,This movie was fantastic! Great Acting by Heyden Christensen and Ewan McGregor,"I'm not the greatest Star Wars fan, but i loved this movie. Star Wars 3 is without a doubt one of George Lucas' greatest Star Wars movie yet. I will have to admit that the NOOOOOOOOOOOO at the end was a little cheesy, but you can not condeem the whole movie on one scene. This movie includes great acting by Heyden and Ewan McGregor, the movie also include the tieing together of the first 2 and last 3 movies. The greatest ending in a movie i have ever seen in a long time. The movie ends with (well doesn't end but close to the end) Obi-wan and Anakin Skywalker having a long dual with, of course, light-sabers. Anakin loses, of course, and gets his legs cut off, along with another arm. I would just like to walk up to Heyden and slap him for killing Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and saving Supreme Chancellor Palpatine ... WHY ANAKIN WHY... I also do not get how you people can watch this movie and come out saying that George Lucas has Failed. THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS WANTING TO SEE IT, THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE."
2589,1,"Doesn't try, does fail.","Throughout the Star Wars movies I think that it's fair to say that George Lucas has proved the old adage that everybody steals from everybody in the movies, but in episode three I think he finally crossed the line from tipping his hat to outright stealing. I am not speaking of The Lord Of The rings comparisons, rather that old story of Hitler's rise to power in Nazi Germany, circa 1940."
2590,,Empire Strikes Back Reborn,"After the wooden(but enjoyable) Episode I and the CGI love story(not enjoyable) Episode II, Episode III comes forth as probably the best SW movie. The dialogue has returned to original trilogy level, the CGI is better than ever and Ewan McGregor has finally finished his journey from wooden mannequin to awesome character. There are still about 3 awful Anakin/Padme scenes but once you get over that, it's great again. The performance of Ian McDiarmid was masterpiece, finally the dark Emperor from Episode VI returns. In a different makeup but still."
2591,9,This movie met every expectation that I was afraid of taking into the film!,"WOW! I will be the first to say I am not a die hard Star Wars fan, but a number of us decided to go to the opening screening of the movie, and wow. The film was everything I was hoping it would be."
2592,10,"Excellent movie, nostalgic end to the series","As the Star Wars saga draws to a close (or not?) I am grateful to the mastery and imagination of George Lucas and everyone who has contributed to the series. They finally delivered what the fans wanted, a well-written story and complete tie-ins. "
2593,7,Not as terrible as the other prequals.,"About the only thing memorable from the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones was the special effects. Though they were probably decent enough movies, they were so far inferior to the original trilogy in terms of plot and originality that they were extremely disappointing."
2594,10,Lucas eats critics (puke!!),"Don't really need to say much about episode III.It is powerful and moving like no other.And it would not,could not,have been this way without the groundwork already laid in the previous prequels.I do want to give some high points so there are spoilers.Probably my favorite scene is Anakin waiting in the Jedi Council chamber while Mace and a group of Jedi attempt to arrest Palpatine.It is there that the turning point of the whole story arc takes place and it is well done and wordless.Anakins tear is priceless,especially after you see the dried tears on his face on Mustafar.Repeated themes like this run throughout the series.Also high on my list is the whole sequence after ""order 66"" is issued,especially when Ki Adi Mundi is killed.He was leading a charge and his clone troops are following.The camera focuses on their feet as they come to a slow shuffle and then stop,opening fire on their Jedi leader.It was very well composed,almost musical.My favorite line comes from Palpatine.""It's treason then"".Classic! Most of my favorite lines are from Ian,who was brilliant by the way.Sometimes I read the critics who bash the prequels and honestly I am speechless.I really have to question their intellect and/or motives.No matter.It's time to laugh in the critics faces as Lucas leaves them on the ash heap of history.BYE!!!"
2595,8,Ian McDiarmid rocks,"So much has been said in these comments that there's few left to add, but I'd like to pinpoint Ian's performance as the greatest amongst all. His gestures and, particularly, the modulation of his voice in every line (especially before he reveals as Darth Sidious) is a spectacle in its own. No one could have played a better Palpatine! Kudos to you Ian! On the other side, I didn't like Natalie, Cristopher (Dooku) and Samuel (Windu). They are great actors, but they just didn't play well this time."
2596,10,A Cinematic Masterpiece,"A powerful conclusion to a deep a thought provoking trilogy, truly asking the question -- 'what does it mean to be a jedi?'"
2597,10,A tremendous end to the second trilogy of Star Wars (contains spoilers),"Whether you enjoyed or disliked Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, this film is clearly the best of the prequels. The story is engaging, the characters demand our attention and concern and the action is unlike anything produced in the previous Star Wars films."
2598,10,"Great Film, One of The Best Star Wars Movies","I think this movie is severely underrated. While the story has some bad bumps, we can all agree this has the best fight scenes in the Skywalker Saga and has the be at lightsaber battle scene in all of Star Wars. Every scene in the movie is enjoyable, from Order 66, to the Mustafar Showdown, and even some of the filler scenes. Sure Padme's death was a little lame and forced (no pun intended lol) but it was nice to get an intro to our characters of the original trilogy. I say the movie was very good and is one of the first Star Wars movies I grab at when I want to watch one. I say it is a must-watch mainly for the amazing action sequences."
2599,5,Best of the prequels.,"First off, this was a decent movie. After all, it did have more going on in it, than any of the other movies. From watching it, you could tell that there was a LOT of missing content, though. Plus, there were some blatant inconsistencies with episodes 4-6."
2600,8,Easily the best Star wars prequel. But it still has a lot of flaws,"Revenge is a good Star wars movie. It improves on what the first 2 prequel movies failed to do, and that is to tell Anakins skywalker story from jedi to darth vader. I love the opening sekvens, its fun and visually stunning. The dialogue has improved from TPM and AOTC. Order 66 scene is really great and there is a lot of great moments here, but the dialogue is still not good and anakins turn is rushed Af and makes no sense. The lightsaber battle between emperor and mace windu is the worst in the Franchise. And im not a big fan of the obi wan vs anakin fight. Its too long and it looks like someone is Dancing.<br /><br />Overall, i like this movie, but it cant be compared to the orignal trilogy and the sequel trilogy."
2601,10,Intense,Wow just wow the most intense movie I have seen in a long time. Seeing all the answers to the small questions we have been asking for years.
2602,10,A Flawed Masterpiece To End The George Lucas Star Wars Saga!!,After watching what was to me the most disappointing star wars film The Rise Of Skywalker. I went back to rewatch Revenge Of The Sith and this is where Star Wars ended for me and I feel George Lucas (The Creator of Star Wars) would agree.
2603,9,Star Wars 3 Best in Prequel Trilogy,"Last night I sat with hundreds of people awaiting the best movie of 2005. We weren't disappointed. George Lucas has done it again! Star Wars: Regenge of the Sith promises a heartbreaking ride and great saber duels. Straight from the opening, Lucas has us trapped again in his world. The movie starts with a daring space battle against the evil General Grievous. Artoo wins once more with his cheeky attitude and daring bravado. Christopher Lee as Dooku does a great job with what little he has and 15 minutes into the movie, Anakin has started once more on the path to the dark side. As he debated over whether or not to kill Dooku in an unfair fight, my heart broke when he forgot his teaching momentarily and let anger rule him. As a rule, the acting in Star Wars is what drags it down, its mundane script not giving any help to the actors. However, in Revenge of the Sith, Hayden Christiansen gives his best performance in the series yet. Finally he leaves behind the annoying immaturity. Chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christiansen has escalated and becomes far more believable now that he has stopped whining about things not being fair. Obi-Wan absolutely shines, Ewan McGregor finally having lines he can work with. But by far, the best is still that three foot tall, digital green alien that we love to call Yoda. The wise leader of the Jedi gets his fights again. As for the baddies, Ian McDiarmid has rekindled the spirit of his former evil in the original trilogy to make the Emperor once more the most feared of beings in the galaxy. Even General Grievous, the droid terror, gets his turn with the light saber. Four in fact. By far, the best part of the movie is the epic light saber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan, it's thrilling climax with the lines, Anakin: ""I hate you!"" Obi-Wan: ""You were my brother! I loved you!"" My heart broke 15 minutes into the movie, yet time and time again, my heart would re-break until the end when the twins were delivered to their new homes, Beru and Owen watching the twin suns set on Tatooine, then the end music plays and you realize that the movie of Star Wars is finally completed. If I have one gripe, it is this. Darth Vader's anguish over what he has done to Padme is terribly played and horribly melodramatic. They could have stolen the show with that part and people in my theater were laughing. And, can we say Halleluia for JARJAR NOT BEING IN THE MOVIE?!!! I don't know what he was thinking, but Lucas has finally wised up over how we feel about him."
2604,10,The rise of Darth Vadar ........a thrilling finale thats leaves you wanting more,"Well folks this it. The beginning of the end.The one we've all been waiting for. Finally all will be revealed. In this, the final film of George Lucas stunning Saga, we finally learn the answer to the question that's been plaguing us for 20 years; How and why did Darth Vadar turn to the Dark side. And contrary to popular criticism George has yet scored another Home Run with this dramatic and thriller of young Anakin Skywalker's demise....and Darth Vadar's rise."
2605,3,Proof that bluescreen is no substitute for good acting and direction.,"28 years ago a young, worried-looking George Lucas was sweating it out in the Tunisia desert trying to make his dream film become a reality. It was a film he had thought about for years, believed in passionately and finally a studio had funded him. Everyone thought he was crazy, but somehow a miracle happened in that desert and the film became a sublime, epic work of sheer imagination, a fantasy spanning the galaxy and showing the human qualities of courage and adventure."
2606,,Lucas screwed up the ending??? Please comment,"First of all, Loved the movie. I think the best out of the 6. One problem, When Padme gives birth to the twins, the audience learns they are Luke and Leia. Now of course we all know this is not a big deal right because everyone in the world knows this. Well it is a big deal because without the prequels when we learn that Luke is Darth Vader's son and also that Leia is his sister it is the biggest shocker of movie history. Now if your from a different planet or watching the Star Wars Movies for the first time in order the whole shocking moment is gone because you know this already from Return of the Sith!"
2607,4,Do you remember those times...,"I quite enjoyed Episode III. But in the end (especially during the last shots) I felt like ""I want to see IV - VI again!"" Now that the episodes are complete, when I look back I sure remember Han Solo! I sure remember the chasing through the Death Star tunnels. I sure remember the Millennium Falcon and the X-Wings! I sure remember ... Those have all become small parts of my youth memories."
2608,7,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!,"The above title is in homage to what is the singular funniest moment not only in this movie, but in a great many movies to come along in awhile... not quite the intention of George Lucas, but achieved all the same. Those of you who've seen the movie know what I'm talking about, and it's hard not to chuckle whenever I think about it."
2609,10,Absolutely Awesome,"I just Star Wars ""Revenge Of The Sith"" and was blown away. What a way for George Lucas to end the trilogy. With expectations being at a minimal, I was very impressed with the action and the improvement with Hayden Christensen's acting. His acting in ""Attack Of The Clones"" was pretty bad, maybe it was the script, maybe not. Seeing Anakin Skywalker burnt to a crisp and his legs chopped off was awesome. No wonder the movie was given a PG-13 rating. Seeing Palpatine with in a light saber battle was also something that I was looking for and it did not fail my expectations. Overall, I would have to say (chringe) that this is the best Star Wars movie ever made. That's just my opinion. Take it or leave it."
2610,9,Star Wars: Review of the Second Grader!,"The greatest Movie of the year. Beter then 1 or 2 or 4 or 6. Not as good as 5. I hope it wins the Academy award for great special effects and best film. My favorite parts were when Anakin fought Obi Wan and when the Emperor fought Yoda. I did not like when Darth Vader got off the table and cried ""NOOOOOOOO"", because it sounded like Frank Oz was doing the voice. I think when Yoda was talking to Qui Gon, he was too computer generated. My second favorite part was when Anakin got fried up. You better not take a three, four, five, or six year old to see this movie, because it's too intense. My eyes got covered up when Palpatine got his face changed. I hope there will be a T.V. show of Darth Vader and Obi-Wan. May the Force Be With You!"
2611,10,There Could Not Have Been a Better Conclusion to an Epic Saga,"With Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas justifies the first two prequels a necessary expostion, and finally gets into the meat of the story. You can tell that this is the movie Lucas has had on his mind since the success of the first Star Wars installment. This is the movie all fans have been waiting for, and not only did Lucas deliver, he delivered the best conclusion the saga could hope for. There could be some minor spoilers below."
2612,5,Good but not a patch on the Originals,"Well, the last Star Wars movie, much hyped and touted as the film to redeem Lucas and complete the saga. Did it achieve this goal? Yes it did. Did it do it in a way consistent with the ""Star Wars"" way? Probably not."
2613,7,"Very good, could be better","Visually stunning. I'm not one to rave about the special effects, but the overall appearance of the movie is fantastic."
2614,3,Five complaints about Episode III,"1. I think George Lucas wanted to turn our attention away from the characters and plot and redirect it to the ENDLESS sky traffic in every shot. It does not mesh well with IV-VI 2. R2D2 was CGI for many of his shots. He looked very fake and moved about in an odd manner unlike the ""adorable"" little robot in IV-VI 3. The giant lizard was STUPID. I can't put it any other way."
2615,8,"Darkness, Action, Meaning (SPOILERS)","This movie is really intense. It is the darkest of the Star Wars films, and it definitely isn't for small children. The film is packed with action. Anakin's corruption by Palpetine is very believable. The acting is much better than the last movie. Even though there is a lot of action, there is also some very powerful symbolism. In one point in the movie, Palpetine is physically made to look like the person he is inside. Anakin's transformation into the Darth Vader we know and loathe (Mr.Black Suite) uses very powerful imagery. Though there are some inconsistencies in the film, and the action sometimes gets a little long, it is over all a good spectacle."
2616,9,Two trilogies make a saga,"Watching the movie on opening day, when I heard the familiar sound of the Star Wars theme nearly thirty years old I was in disbelief. I couldn't believe that I was watching the last of the Star Wars films. I must admit that afterward I didn't know what to make of the film. After watching it many times since, the movie has grown on me very much."
2617,7,Solid Star Wars fun,"Unlike the terrible Phantom Menace and mediocre Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith manages to delight through and through."
2618,1,Hayden is nice and bad,This movie was kind of cute because Hayden is so deep.
2619,7,Revenge Of The Sith is an incredible movie in a bad trilogy with intriguing story and great characters but still has a few problems,Star Wars Episode III Revenge Of The Sith is a great ending in a bad trilogy.Revenge Of The Sith is by far the best movie in the Star Wars Prequel trilogy(and also the only good one in the trilogy).
2620,10,Awesome,"I LOVED it! It was sooooo good! I cried!! It was so sweet! Anakin did anything to save Padme! You could really see the anguish in Anakin's face when he killed Dooku. Lucas did a superb job. Hayden Christensen's acting was phenomenal. He portrayed Anakin's struggle very well. Nobody could have done it better. Natalie Portman was wonderful. Ewan McGregor caught Obi-Wan's character perfect. There wasn't a dull moment. General Grievous's part was a little to short, but good. This was the perfect way to end the Saga. I highly recommend it. John Williams did a magnificent job composing the film. I was very impressed. The execution of the Jedi was so heart wrenching. Anakin's fall was portrayed very well, along with Palpatine's manipulative ways."
2621,8,Best Star Wars movie yet,"Wow! George Lucas really out did himself this time...I'm a big-time Star Wars fan, and really enjoyed Revenge of the Sith...I thought it was a great culmination of all 5 previously made Star Wars films, and it really portrayed the agony of Anakin's journey to the Darkside so very well...I got tears in my eyes many times throughout the film and really felt the pain and darkness of the movie...Even though we all knew what the ultimate result was going to be, I believe that Geroge Lucas did a tremendous job in not dictating to us, the audience what exactly was going to happen. I also found it fascinating exactly how much more machine than man Darth Vader actually was and how EXACTLY he was put into his infamous black respiration suit...we all know that his duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi was where he obtained his life-altering scars and injuries, but it was just amazing to actually see it unfold before our eyes... Hayden Christiansen, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, and the gorgeous Natalie Portman, really do a hell of a job leading the all-star cast to great success...this was a real winner!"
2622,8,Great end to the trilogy,The first two films had a lot more misses than hits but thankfully Revenge of the Sith ends the trilogy on a high note that almost reaches the highs of the original films.
2623,10,Fantastic Movie! Worth Every Penny,"This was by far the best star wars movie. It showed the famous fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan, and showed, step by step, how Anakin turned to the dark side. George Lucas was obviously not concerned with the acting though. It showed how the death star began, and Luke and Leia. It went into detail about many of the questions fans were interested in learning from the previous five films. It was a fantastic movie, and lead right into Episode IV: A New Hope. I was pleasantly surprised. This is by far the best of the newer films, and was equal/better than the older films as well! This movie starts off with obi-wan and Anakin fighting the war, and it is a war with the Jedi council and the senate. There are surprises all over the place, and you can't trust who you think you can. Overall a phenomenal movie, and definitely worth your money."
2624,10,Cinematic masterwork,"This is legitimately the best movie. Period. Nothing can even compare. The dialogue, camera work, set pieces, everything is perfect. Hayden Christensen is the greatest actor. Lucas got his stuff together for this, and created a perfect ending to a trilogy arguably better then the original. Overall, this is just the perfect movie. Nothing could be fixed, the acting is perfect, and the story is original, creative, and revolutionary for the time period. I literally cannot recommend this cinematic masterpiece by George Lucas enough."
2625,6,"Better than the previous two, but not by much","'Revenge of the Sith' is slightly better than 'Attack of the Clones,' due to the fact there is more emotion involved in Sith and there is less cheesiness between Anakin and Padme. However this movie still doesn't belong in the same class as the original trilogy. Some of the shortcomings of 'Clones' are in 'Sith' as well. Although watching the interactions between Anakin and Padme wasn't as painful as it was in 'Clones,' there is still some cheesy romantic dialogue and I still didn't feel any chemistry between the two. As in 'Clones,' Hayden Christensen is still wrong for the part, acting more like a whiny member of the Backstreet Boys than the future Sith Lord. However, the most disappointing part of this movie is that part of 'Sith's story isn't true to the story told in the original trilogy. (Here's where the spoiler is and here's where my Star Wars nerdiness comes in.) In 'Return of the Jedi,' Leia talks about her mother being sad and dying when she was young, and Luke saying he never new his real mother. In 'Sith,' Padme dies shortly after childbirth, making it impossible for Leia to actually remember her. My criticism for the prequel remains the same: Lucas should have handed the directorial reigns to someone else (maybe Spielberg?), as he did with 'Empire' and 'Jedi.'"
2626,10,the force is strong in this one,"Its been 27 years in the waiting for the story to come full circle As Don Mclean said ""a generation lost in space"". I have learnt there is nothing constant in life. I think star wars Revenge Of The Sith in an exception.the film enthralled me, disturbed me and most of all made me strong in the force. the linking of 6 films was never going to be easy ,its simplicity and acceptance of human strengths and weaknesses is of great benefit to the plot. The characters are true to there original narrative goal, and the action is in balance with the complexity of turning a character as torn as Vader into the person he must or must not become. It's a like being part of history, being able to see this movie, I guess anyone can dream.of a galaxy far far away"
2627,8,Star Wars is fun again!,"Man, this movie is great. I'd place it just below the first of the prequels in terms of how interesting it is to watch. It has incredible action and visual effects, interesting storylines, building anticipation and a payoff at the end. What really shines here are the combat sequences, which are easily the best out of all the Star Wars movies, new ones inluded. They are well coreographed and fun, characters try to outsmart their enemies instead of brute-forcing it (like they do in the new movies), and the ending leaves an impact. Even more than that, the setting of the movie is fun. It shows a lot of places that haven't seen the light of day before in Star Wars, the different fauna that lives in them, and characters interact with it. It's incredible. Recommended for any sci-fi fan!"
2628,5,After seeing Episode III I'm left wondering...where's the MAGIC???,"About 20 years ago, the original Star Wars trilogy had riveted me to the Movie screens like no other Sci-Fi series ever did, and in my mind the Return of the Jedi was really the conclusive chapter of this wonderful space epic. Then when I heard that Lucas was working on three more prequels I welcomed the news with a mixture of skepticism and anticipation, because of the sheer fact that the merry band of original characters such as Solo, Luke, Leia wouldn't be acting anymore and that alone was already a major letdown for me. I think it's important to point out that people who have been exposed to the Star Wars universe in their childhood, developed this special sense of empathy for these ""heroes"" which could not be redeemed that easily by introducing an entirely new set of actors. "
2629,9,One of the best in the saga,"Despite the lackluster start, the prequel trilogy ends strong. While much of this film, to me, is glued together by Ewan McGregor's fine acting, Chistensen proves to be in the very least more believable and less cringey in this episode as well. It's a fantastic star wars film, If you haven't seen it you should. And feel free to skip the first two prequels, only this is necessary."
2630,10,Best Star Wars Ever!,"Even if you haven't seen any Star Wars movie this movie is for you. The CGI and the story line especially with the followings of young A. Skywalker and his procession to becoming the strongest and darkest Sith Lord, Darth Vader in the movie alone are worth the price of the ticket and Lucascaptivates the whole Star Wars look the ties in the next 3 movies perfectly and after the disappointments of Episode 1 and 2 this one looks terrific. I recommend that everyone see it and if you have seen it see it again in case you missed something the 1st time! Mr. Lucas I recommend you make the next episodes- starting with 7 because Star Wars is back and popular than ever, WE WANT MORE! Rob"
2631,9,Revenge of the Star Wars Franchise!,(Some minor spoilers ahead) 
2632,,Sort of a spoiler; we all know what happens,"George Lucas' challenge with Epidsode III, was to force me to forget what I know, by pushing my emotions around and all the while keep the continuity of the rest of the films intact. I wanted to feel Anniken Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader, not just see it. The guy's world as he's known it for the past twenty some odd years, is crumbling. I wanted him to get mad, sad, insane, sweet, etc. His two powerful moments were when he killed the younglins and when he roared: ""I hate you."" Lucas didn't even dare me to go to the dark side. I wanted to know why Anniken became Vader; what made him crack. I'm introduced to this new idea that the most potent power of the dark side is preventing death. So, Vader goes to the dark side to save Amidalla from dying in childbirth. When Amidalla dies, Lucas makes you feel horrible for Vader. Vader never achieves this crazy new power of keeping people alive, and it made me question the purpose of bringing it up in the first place. And Amidalla dies! In an emotional discussion in Episode VI, between Luke and his sister, Leia says she remembers her being beautiful and she remembers her smile. How is that possible if Amidalla dies! I wanted to see an even bigger uprising then there was in Episode II, and instead all the Jedi's around the entire galaxy got bitch slapped. Except for Yoda, Obi-One and the guy from L.A. Law. The only part of that sequence that moved me was when Yoda clutched his heart and dropped his cane in agony. I almost cried. But Lucas quickly altered my emotions toward another ""tie-up"" scene. Lucas got lazy. He new he had to tie everything together, so he threw everything into this last movie, battle after battle, sequence after sequence, in an attempt to give the viewers some closure. But I feel no closure. I feel as though we the audience were cheated. Lucas earns $20 bil and we go home unsatisfied."
2633,10,Truly a masterpiece!,"One the best Star Wars movies ever made, only rivaled by the Empire Strikes Back. The story is great and the fight scenes are phenomenal! Even after 15 years it still holds up."
2634,7,Not an Academy Award Winning Movie *Spoilers*,"*Spoilers* Star Wars 3 wasn't anything spectacular. I gave this a 7 because of the fight scene, especially between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor). The dislodge was absolutely PATHETIC, and I swear I must have laughed out loud so many times. Especially at the end when he lets out the big ""Nooooo!"" when Padme dies. I mean, the bloke tried to kill her! Natalie Portmen (Padme) is usually a great actress, and I especially loved her in Garden State, but some of her lines were pathetic. Of course, thats not her fault and we ll blame that on George Lucac But when she goes to Anakin ""Hold me, hold me like you did on Naboo"", that was just pathetic. Christensen is not a good actor, and the only reason hes there is to be Darth Vadar, trying to figure out the best way to prevent Padme from dying, wearing a lot of make-up, and squirming on the ground. Ewan Mcgregor was probably the only good actor in there, and hes probably the most experienced actor in the movie, and did the best of facial expressions and dislodge. Mcgregor also showed the most emotion, which I think without McGregor, the movie probably would have stunk. Overall, the fighting was excellent, so were the special effects, but the dislodge was terrible. If you don't care about dislodge, go see it, but if your like me and it bothers you, don't go waste your money."
2635,10,The best movie ever made,"From start to finish this movie is a wild ride. The dialog: superb, the acting: other-worldly, the action: unbeatable. To say it simply, I'm quite surprised this movie has not become the foundation of a religion by now. Do yourself a favor and play this movie from start to finish, on repeat, until you draw your final breath."
2636,10,SW III: Revenge of the Sith,"Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith is, in my estimation, a very fitting end for a spectacular saga that began some 25 years ago, and has culminated into this last GREAT film! I saw it on May 19, 2005, and I was pleased with the story, the outcome, the special effects. I enjoyed the movie, and, for me, ALL the Star Wars movies and books have been very inspiring--good vs. evil--and all that encompasses. I believe Mr. Lucas has captured everything he needed to, and with all the work that went into these sagas, everyone connected with it should be commended for their part in our history. I will be going to see this movie 2 or 3--or maybe more times again, and my expectations for the film have been realized! I have most read the Star Wars books that continued after SW Episode VI (Return of the Jedi). Thank you, Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg, and all the others involved in this movie--you all have my admiration and THANKS!! ba"
2637,7,"Great action, bad acting","So now that I've seen them all, Episode 3 makes me pine for the more innocent and romantic original series (Episodes 4-6). Star Wars was fun, cutting edge special effects at the time (circa 1977) (old, beat-up spaceships) and most of all, romantic. Up until Leia announces that she loves Luke in episode 6, after all, he's her brother, you really can feel the heat of the triangle between her, Luke and Han Solo. What do we have here, a lot of very cutting edge special effects, circa 2005 which make for a fun film. I enjoyed the action scenes. You can get lost in it, and it makes for a fun 2 hours or so in ye olde film theatre. But as far as the acting is concerned, it's horrible! The one thing I wanted to see was how Lucas was going to turn that cute Anakin from Episode 1, who turned a bit whiny in Episode 2, but is still basically a fine, upright young Jedi, into Darth Vader, one of filmdom's great villains. Well, it doesn't happen. I will never in a million years believe that this Anakin could turn to the dark side. And the reason is supposed to be because he doesn't want his wife to die in childbirth?? This is a noble sentiment. It doesn't make you evil! At the point where the Emperor-to-be reveals himself to be a sith lord, I think it would have been more logical, given the way Anakin's character had been developed up to that point (remember, he chopped off Dooku's head earlier in the film), to have whipped out his light sabre and chopped off Palpatine's head. Good riddance and now I can go home and be with my very pregnant wife. I guess, in the end, my expectations were so low, that I found myself enjoying this film as being better than the previous two, despite this major defect in character development."
2638,10,The revenge of Lucas,"Speechless. That's what you'll be when you see this movie. No wait, epic masterpiece. This is more then just a film ladies and gentlemen. I was going into this movie not expecting much in the way of story. Well, we got more then a story. SO much, in fact, as to make my mother bawl. A lot of big Hollywood blockbusters with outstanding special effects usually aren't the deepest of films. They're basically there to be a spectacle for the eyes. Well, Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith, is a roller coaster for the eyes, the ears, and the heart."
2639,4,Nope didn't like it,"This article is addressed to all the funs of the original Star Wars movies (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi) and mostly to those rare funs who didn't see any of the prequels that George Lukas made. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT watch any of the prequels and especially Episode III Revenge of the Sith. I have watched all three of the prequels and I feel that I have to warn people. It has been some time now since I had watched Episode I and Episode II so I will elaborate only on the latest release. OK I wasn't fair. Not everyone will hate the movie like I did. If you enjoy explosive graphics and special effects you will surely be impressed by it at least for the first 20 minutes or so. But if you belong in the group of people that like Star Wars because of their innovative scripts, great performances (like Harrison Ford's) and characters with personality that kept the same throughout the trilogy of the original series, you will surely be disappointed. What made this movie so horrible? Well lets start in the way that all star wars movies start. Action scenes. No surprises there, not even good choreography, only the music saves the scenes from becoming unbearable. Great villains die easy and all the moves are so predictable that you just don't care to watch what is going to happen next. Apart from that it seems that all the Jedi knights are really easy to kill, except for Ben and Yoda. Dialogs are plane stupid. No one talks like that, no one is that lame. I mean there is no one in the whole galaxy that is cool enough, say like Han Solo was in the original movies? Or is that just a 70s thing. Oh well. Talking about cool characters, who is the coolest guy in Star Wars? Better yet who is the smoothest, darkest villain? Darth Vader. Well forget about that, all the coolness was destroyed in this episode. Looks more like an emotionally disturbed teenager. And for a former Jedi and a person that is always prepared and crashes all of his opponents (at least in the old movies) he gets manipulated really easy. OK apart from all that, the scenes are rushed, everything happens quickly (event the conversion to the Dark Side) and the love story is worse than soaps. So there you go. I really would like to give examples my critique but I would hate to spoil the fun for anyone that wants to watch the movie. There is one scene though that really destroyed everything for me, I have to say it. After a fight between Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, note after Anakin became dark and so on, while lying on the ground severely wounded, Vader says to Ben ""I hate you"". Oh come on, the greatest villain is ready to die and he can't think of something better to say. Sounds like me fighting with my sister when I was Ten. All I can think of is, ""your such a pussy Anakin"""
2640,10,The Best of them All,"Before I even begin, I'm going to say that I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. I found that all of the reviews of Revenge of the Sith were mixed. They were black and white, either you loved it, or you hated it and wanted George Lucas to die. Personally, I choose the former."
2641,10,Great Movie!!!!!!!!,"This was a great movie my favorite of all 6. My opinion is that Lucas nailed it. He tied them all together with this film, It's sad and darker than the rest. But it has to be this way. You find out in this film that Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader was not so much driven by greed and power but by love."
2642,10,I love it,As bad as the story and plot is the movie makes up for in insane special effects and fight scenes.... masterpiece. 😍
2643,10,"Oh,I see,it all comes together now!","Well,well,well.What do we have here.It's finally the whole saga...COMPLETE!!STAR WARS EPISODE III REVENGE OF THE SITH is excellent 10 out of 10.I'm a huge Star Wars fan.When episode III came out,I almost crapped my pants.I knew it'd be better than II(of course)and maybe even better than I.When I saw it,I couldn't believe what I saw.Episode III is the new Star Wars movie that moves into the 1977 Star Wars episode IV.And V and VI.I think this movie is way over awesome.There's awesome,then there's STAR WARS EPISODE III REVENGE OF THE SITH.It's possibly better than the original Star Wars.Now that Star Wars saga in ended,it's complete and I'm complete."
2644,1,That was nothing but an action film,"As in the last two movies, George Lucas has done a good auto-destructive job of the saga. He has destroyed the main terrific character of all the saga by transforming it in a teenager's movies evil character. Anakin lacks of the intelligence he is supposed to have in all the movie, and in my opinion there is not well explained why he changed to the dark side. Only he did because the film required it. But that's not the only thing George has ignored from the original saga. The characters' humor in all kind of situations(real intelligent humor, not childish humor as those last three movies) from the original saga has been changed in this one saga by laser swords battles, and all kinds of special effects without nonsense. There are lots of questions about this saga too. How are they more technological advanced if it is the past from the first saga?. Why the empire uses humans and not robots as their soldiers? Why Darth vather ignores the two droids in the original saga if he has been with them all the time he has growth in this saga? But those questions are mere freaky questions. The main problem in my opinion is why he transformed the special universe he created in a mere teenager conduct movie, destroying all that was special in this universe (miriclodians!!!!) For me all the actual saga is not as dark as they proposed, is a mere 'see you in the afternoon while you are bored' movies like those of Jean Claude van damme."
2645,8,The big G did us good,"Thanks George you did it! I was very pleased in the overall story and effects. I rate this one very close to A New Hope. He could never beat it though as anything new, original and innovative can never be recaptured. As a teenager in 1977 I remember the first time I saw A New Hope; Revenge of the Sith left me with the same grin I remember walking out of the cinema with all those years ago. None of the other Star Wars films quite managed this. There were a few bits where I noticed a definite edit and felt a lack of explanation of what happened or was about to happen but you know anyway if you follow the films and unless they make the film three hours long or yet another film I suppose the scissors have to snip somewhere. In the main it was very good a must for anyone who is in to Sci Fi."
2646,6,This is the best movie of the new Star Wars,"With my vote of 6 out of 10, it gets the highest vote to the newest Star Wars movies. The graphics were nice, the story was good, however when it comes to script writing, George Lucas couldn't write his way out of a paper bag. Absolutely terrible script writing. When comparing this to the original 3 Star Wars, this movie makes a mockery of what Lucas had created and wanted us to experience. This movie had potential to be one of the best Star Wars, but with a script that bad, it is hard to get past that fact."
2647,3,Put this one beside Matrix Revolutions and various other crappy sequels.,"I enjoyed the special effects, I really did. But that's not the reason I went to the movies to see it. I went because I was interested to see how George Lucas would wrap up the series. I was shocked. Who wrote this crap? I kept saying to myself as I watched it."
2648,9,With the end of the star wars saga I feel much older...,"Episode 3 is far better than episode 1 and 2, but I still think that it is not as good as the original trilogy. I enjoyed it very much, but it would have been empowered if George Lucas had appointed Irvin Kershner as director, he is quite old, but he keeps fit; and also if he had spent more time in writing better dialogs than in designing annoying creatures. Ewan is a decent Obi Wan but Natalie Portman is totally wasted. She is really a fine actress, but her lines were a shame. The battles are amazing, and so are the sword fights, but I still miss Harrison and the old sense of humor. It is really a great movie, but the end of the saga means that everyone of us is a little bit older. The party is over..."
2649,7,This is basically the birth of Darth Vader,This is basically the birth of Darth Vader
2650,1,"Not great, but better than the last two","I may anger many hard-core fans of the franchise, but I don't think the movie was as good as many claim it was. I, like a lot of SW fans, grew up with the original trilogy and thought it was ground breaking stuff (even though it was only 7 years ago I first saw Return of the Jedi). I loved the story and the whole sci-fi aspect to it. Yet I was deeply disappointed with Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, which had amazing CGI yet the plots were flat, as they tried to involve a child Anakin (which I assume was trying to appeal to younger audiences) and some romance garbage between Padme and Anakin. I don't think they should have included such thing in attempt to appeal more to females and children viewers. Though romance was in the original trilogy between Han and Leia, it was reinforced with good dialogue which made u believe their love was real, and didn't interfere with the story as a whole. Now with the newer movies, its pretty much just long, drawn-out scenes ""I love you. You are so beautiful"". With Revenge of the Sith, Padme and Anakin's relationship is not believable with their corny dialogue and no emotion to reinforce their love on screen. Personally, I think they should have left that romance plot out of the film and focus on what it's really about, Star Wars. Aside from the poor dialogue and acting (especially with Anakin), I enjoyed the back-drop to the story of the Clone Wars. The first battle in the movie was true eye-candy, though I think Lucas relied to heavily opn CGI, which is very noticeable at time, and at times is a distraction to what is really going on. Yet once the talking begins it goes downhill from there. What annoyed me was that Anakin was completely loyal to the Jedi, yet converts to the Darkside after a few lame conversations with the Chancellor, which seems to only take a week. Obi-Wan was Anakin's mentor for what I guess could be no more than 20 years, and it takes so little time for Anakin to change sides. It would have been more believable if we had noticed a significant decrease in Anakin's loyally to the Jedi in Attack of the Clones, or even Phantom Menace. As far as the action goes, it was entertaining and there were many thing I enjoyed about it. Though the fight between Mace Windu and the Chancellor was lame, leaving much to be desired in the way of fight choreography. Obi-Wan's duels with General Grievous and Anakin were nice to watch, but dragged on longer than they should have. And don't get me started on the CGI hopping-Yoda. At times like that the laughing audience in the theater made it seem like I was watching a comedy rather than the highly-anticipated new Star Wars. A main concern about the film is the amount of CGI it has. Even the storm troopers were CGI! Lucas definitely cut some corners compared to the original trilogy. Considering the larger budget he get to work with, I think he could have had a few props made to make it look for life-like, instead of trying to save money by doing everything by computer. And Yoda... he looked a lot better as a puppet in the original trilogy than he does now, as he looks like something out of a Shrek movie. I guess the main reason I was disappointed with this film was because I compare it to the original. I think I would appreciate it if I looked at it for what it has become, a movie for children. (Though I admit, I prefer seeing Jedi die a bloodless death instead of vanishing into thin air, like when Yoda and Obi-Wan died). A lot of the dialogue is so bad, its as if Disney wrote the script. Its really that bad, and I was getting annoyed after the sixth time of Anakin saying: ""I am becoming more powerful"" using different words. Also, the movie is diluted with too much political talk. It all Anakin and Padme talk about, not to mention the Chancellor. What made the original trilogy so good was that you had to look into it more to get a sense of the political situations of the galaxy. RotS leaves nothing to the imagination in regards to politics. ""Democracy good, empire bad"" was the sum of most conversations in the movie. Its as if the characters go out of their way to explain the political situation to one another. Especially with Obi-Wan and Anakin, who'se lines are so awkward that at times its as if they just met. And with the cinematography, it also left much to be desired. Many of the camera angles are just plain awkward, and don't blend well with the CGI elements. And the urban settings just looked lame, as Padme's room looked sterile and something out of the original Star Trek. The pillars at the entrance of the senate looked so fake that I thought it was straight from Wolfenstein 3D (a game from the early 90's). That's just my opinion though. Even Hoth from the Empire Strikes Back (1980) looked more realistic than a lot of the settings from a large budgeted movie in 2005. Overall, I am greatly disappointed with how the franchise was destroyed by greedy Mr. Lucas. If he hadn't decided to cut corners with overwhelming CGI garbage, the film would be a lot better and true to the originals. Then again, that's the price you pay for letting Lucas direct Star Wars movies. I just wish I could erase the memory of the last 3 film, for I really enjoyed the franchise (books, video games)before the Phantom Menace. I hope the kids out there enjoy it more than I did! "
2651,10,Revenge of the Sith Delivers,"So, it all comes down to this. The magic #3, where not only the saga completes itself, but we FINALLY see the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader."
2652,4,To much action...To much violence...To much love...,"I did not like this movie at all. It had way to much action for me. Now, most people love action and would say that I'm crazy, but when there is to much action, I do not like the movie. There was way to much violence in the movie. Anakin burning up - that was really not a necessary scene to the movie. I'm sure most people would get a good laugh about Anakin catching on fire, but I did not. I thought it was plain stupid. Once again, it had a stupid love story. Anakin, falling in love with Padme and turning to the dark side to protect her. I wonder if he knows that if he hadn't turned to the dark side, that Padme would have been saved. Well that's all that I'm going to say. I think I'v tortured this episode enough."
2653,10,All I want is your love Prequel haters!,"I'm quite a soft fragile English woman who keeps crying because of all the mean unfair reviews of this film! This film is the greatest film ever in my eyes and probably always will be. Unfortunately most of the haters of this film are old people who are old enough to have watched the Original Star Wars trilogy when they were first released, or people who are pretty mindless and just jump on the bandwagon. The average person though if their honest loves this film and aren't stuck in the 70's like OT fanboys tend to be, instead their stuck in the 00's decade if they genuinely adore this film."
2654,10,Huge thing for a newbie,"I've never been into Star Wars, ever. In a weird way I had been traumatized by the Ewoks while I was younger (Yeah I may be the only person in the world, but I swear to God that it's true :p) and it always made me avoid all this huge worldwide passion around those movies. And then I met my current best friend, who's a real Star Wars fan, and he taught me what he knew about it... but still never made me watch the movies. But lately, a French TV Channel aired the first two episodes of the Prelogy, and I watched them... to get a chance to know exactly what I had missed. Well... after ""The attack of the Clones"" I thought I hadn't missed that much, and wasn't sure that going to theater to watch ""The revenge of the sith"" was the greatest idea. But when I went on this website, and when I saw what you people were all thinking about this Episod, I said ""Oooh heck... let's take a look""; plus my best friend, and my ex-boyfriend had both been thrilled by the movie, so I wasn't taking a huge risk, was I? So finally I went to theater yesterday to watch a Star Wars movie... me lol... and what a surprise, what an amazing surprise... I've been as thrilled as my friends, without a doubt and, I'm now proud to say that I'm completely addicted to this particular movie. So many emotions, contradictions within the characters, and especially Anakin (amazing Hayden Christensen)whose love is driving him mad enough to make him choose the wrong way and do the most awful things a man could ever do (The Padawan slaughter is the pure contradiction between is fatherhood and is thirst for power and evil)... as far as I can remember, it's been a long time since I felt that much for the characters. And besides, the fights are totally crazy, the Obi Wan VS Anakin is undoubtedly the most perfect ever, and of course Yoda VS Sidious (Yoda being my favorite character since a long time, even when I wasn't into the movies at all). Though, the only thing bothering me into all this perfection, is Nathalie Portman's character... Padme is pretty annoying, I'd say the love story between her and Anakin could have been better, but the end helps to make us forgive Lucas for this. So basically, I'm just gonna try and become a true Star Wars fan from now on, and discover all that I can, because... wow, what a story."
2655,9,They got it right,Well I've gone over to the Dark Side and it's a much sexier place I can tell you.
2656,1,Lucas fails to deliver on what should be the best film of the series.,"I could comment for hours on this, however in simple points...."
2657,,storyline glitch?,"Heres a glitch in the storyline that was pointed out to me by my friend. Its really bugging me and i wish he hadn't told me about it so i would like to share my pain with fellow fans and maybe some day you will wish you never read this. In Empire, obi-wan says about Luke: he is our last hope. Yoda replies: no, there is another...(Leia). Surely obi-wan would know this already as in Sith he was at the birth of the twins. Its not a big deal to me but sometimes its the small things that really annoy. I liked Sith a lot and think it went some way in redeeming the prequel series but i think we would all have been much happier if Lucas hadn't tried to do everything himself. Terrible scripts, terrible acting, only saved by our undying love for the characters and series.I don't mean to be too harsh because I'm a huge fan of the series and do enjoy watching all 6 episodes but sometimes i think fans like me look at these movies as a mother does its children. And when some of the kids don't turn out the way you hoped... you blame daddy."
2658,9,"""Sith"" Restores Balance to Something Other Than the Force...","Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith, in my opinion, is very close to being the best film of the 6, and definitely tops amongst the 3 recently released prequels to the popular 1977 film Star Wars."
2659,10,Fantastic Movie,This movie is action packed with an electrifying adventure and George Lucas does a good job directing it. The battle scenes throughout this movie were sensational and the fight scenes with the were amazing. I was just blown away by the visuals of this movie especially at the end of the movie when Anakin and Obi-Wan are battling it out on a planet called Mustafar that is completely dominated by lava and that part makes the movie even more stunning. The main characters do a terrific job acting which leads to success. One thing I do have to say is that I think Yoda needs to work on his English more because he is always getting his words mixed up. But overall this is a very energetic movie that will not disappoint.
2660,8,The Arrival of the New Star Wars,"I have to admit, walking in to the theater to see Star Wars- Revenge of the Sith, I was a little worried. From the incredibly annoying Jarjar to the mind-boggling boring acting of Episodes 1&2, I frankly was hoping for the best, but fearing the worst. Oh how wrong I was. The acting, though touchy at times, was all around good; and Jarjar had a whole of two close-ups in the whole movie. Though, I must admit, Episode 3 was the most gruesome of the all the Star Wars movies. From multiple limbs being chopped off by life sabers, small children being murder, to Anikin burning alive, this movie is not for young children. This did surprise me due to the fact that the franchise had always striven to be family friendly in the past. I guess George Lucus got sick of it. I also must comment on the sad undertone of this film. You literally get depressed as you watch Anikin destroy everything he once loved. And yes, we all knew it was going to happen, but you can't help yourself from thinking, ""Just kill him, it'll be better!"" And this is probably George Lucus's thought behind releasing the movies out of chronological order. By the fans already knowing what will happen in the end, you find yourself pinning to change the future. I was slightly disappoint though, because there are a few blunders between the new and old. Those you will have to find on your own though."
2661,10,At last we will have our revenge,ROTS was destroyed by TDKR but will have its revenge
2662,10,best movie ever,OK this movie would have to be one of the most action packed movie ever serious! it was very thrilling at points because it was just surprising in its own way especially the ending...i would definitely rate it a 10 because these star wars movies are really full of action but i would have to say that this movie Revenge of the Sith is just the best. Staring the handsome Hayden Christensen the beautiful Natalie Portman Ewan Mcgregor and many other talented actors and actresses...this movie did have it's ups and downs thats for sure but i would say that it is a very good movie. It does have romance in it between the cute Anakin Skywalker and the senator Padm'e Amidala the now married couple that keeps it a secret so their lives won't be ruined...but of course we all know that Anakin turns into Dath Vader in the end but what is really thrilling and where you will hold your breath the whole time would be when obi-wan and Anakin have a light saber battle at the ending now that is very thrilling and just breath taking seriously because you just really want to know who wins and who loses!
2663,10,Witness the birth of Darth Vader!,"I have always admired George Lucas and his creation for it's incredible story and scale. And clearly, he outdid himself with this movie. 'Revenge of the Sith' in my opinion, is fantastic, and the best of the Series. It fluidly merges the Prequels and the Sequels."
2664,9,Episode 3 makes the other films even better,"Star Wars Episode III:Revenge of the Sith has creeped up to my second all time favorite Star Wars movie, right under ""Empire Strikes Back"" and right above ""A New Hope"". It is an almost perfect balance of story and action, something the first two movies missed. But here is why Episode 3 is so good."
2665,9,The Lucas lightsabre Massacre,"Darth Vader. Powerful. Chilling. Unforgiving. Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. Powerful. Chilling. Unforgiving. The fall of Anakin and the rise of Vader really couldn't be portrayed any better. When kind, little Ani finally starts to become obsessed with power it is like watching someone being possessed by Satan. It is quite emotional watching padme start to realise the dark side in her husband as he obeys the evil Palpatines every command. Whilst watching the famous opening credits and John Williams epic soundtrack echoing through the cinema i felt a hair at the back of my neck spring up as i realised i was witnessing the end of an era. One bad thing about this movie is having to watch Obi Wan's very cheesy comments after dispatching an enemy and you soon get the idea that kenobi just takes the Clone wars as one big joke. To be honest, if one of the reasons Anakin turned to the dark side was to not have to listen to his master's voice anymore i don't blame him. But on a more serious note, Yoda kicks butt and his battle with Palpatine is breathtaking. Obi Wan vs Anakin is nail biting stuff and it is very brutal too, (obi wan takes this fight seriously because if he even bothered to make a comment Anakin would kill him) And, the moment Vader takes his first chilling breath you really are witnessing a defining moment in film history."
2666,9,A vast improvement over 1 and 2 (WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS),"This film actually engrossed me in the story. It completely dwarfs Episodes 1 and 2 in story, action, acting. First of all, let me just point out that Hayden Christensen has greatly improved his acting skills. His performance was thoroughly believable, and though clunky at some bits, he impressed me. As usual, Ewan McGregor's performance was great, as was Yoda's. Natalie Portman seemed less wooden in this film, and showed emotion that was believable. Samuel L. Jackson didn't impress me, because his acting was more involved in 1 and 2 than in this one. Up until his death scene, which was powerful (after having his hand cut off by Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine lightning-blasts him out a window into Coruscant's traffic), his character was quite wooden. General Grievous, the cyborg villain who didn't last very long in the movie, wasn't particularly entertaining, though the short-but-sweet lightsaber duel between him and Obi-Wan was fun for what it was. The story was more entertaining and easier to follow than the political jibber-jabber of 1 and 2. One of the most emotionally intense sequences of the movie is when Order 66 is carried out. Obviously a plan long in the making, Palpatine contacts all of his clone leaders and tells them to ""Execute Order 66."" Subsequently, clone troopers all across the galaxy turn on the Jedi they had been fighting alongside with, mercilessly blasting them to death. The montage of this sequence shocked and saddened me. Anakin's turn to the Dark Side is riveting and disturbing. The clones aren't the only ones executing the Jedi. A particularly shocking scene is when Anakin, amidst all of the Jedi extermination, walks into the Jedi Council room with his hood up, looking sinister. Remember the Jedi younglings from Episode 2? They come out from hiding behind chairs and one of them says something to Anakin along the lines of, ""What should we do, Master Anakin? There are too many clones!"" Anakin ignites his lightsaber. The next time we see these younglings is when Yoda and Obi-Wan are inspecting their dead bodies on the floor. The long-awaited fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is up to par with expectations. Anakin is dismembered by Obi-Wan (loses both his legs and left arm), and lies immobile on the shore of a lava river. Obi-Wan tells him how he was the chosen one. As he begins to walk away, Anakin screams venomously, ""I hate you!"" (great acting job) and catches on fire. Very powerful. There are some minor downsides to SITH - more cheesy, nonsensical love dialogue, though there is a lot less than in Episode 2. On a good note, Hayden's acting managed to make the lines seem somewhat decent. Also, some parts seemed rushed (Mace vs. Palpatine, the ending). One major gripe is that the wipe-transitions George Lucas uses almost always takes away the effect of the scene because it doesn't leave any dramatic pause i.e. when Vader is told that he killed Padme, he screams ""Noooo!"" The scene abruptly ends, quite awkwardly, by wiping quickly from this scene to the next. Revenge of the Sith: 9 out of 10. Incredible improvement."
2667,2,All Fx and no plot makes a dull movie.,"If you're a fan of ILM this is great. If you like a movie with some story, give it a miss. Would it actually be possible to write any spoilers? We all know Annakin turns to the dark side. We all know who lives and who does not, we've seen the sequel already. What I expected was some reasonable plot material as to why Annakin turns to the dark side. The excuse given is lame. ""You've got what I want so you're the boss."" No struggle with conscience. No leading down the path without realising. No suspense. Suspense? None at all. We all know what the final battle will be, where it will be and what the result is. The only redeeming feature is the FX and if anything they are over the top."
2668,9,Lucas Strikes Back!! ****out of *****,"Plot: A maturing Anakin Skywalker goes to the dark side of The Force and becomes Sith Lord Darth Vader. We experience the transformation in a dark, scary yet thrilling climax. The story here logically sets up the events of Episode IV, the original 1977 Star Wars movie in which Darth Vader goes to war against his own children, Luke and Leia. After the disappointing Episodes I and II, Lucas regains the force and strikes back with Revenge of the Sith."
2669,6,meh,"revenge of the sith is the strongest installment of the final chapter of the star wars saga, but it just doesn't deliver everything i expected. given the negative reviews that were given to the phantom menace and attack of the clones, it seems that george lucas was more than ever trying to make a movie that would appease critics and critical fans alike. while acting is much stronger this time around, i felt the notion that natalie portman was simply useless in this one. and too, vader's turn to the dark side seems too swift. we could have seen more interaction between the chancellor and vader throughout clones and this one, but it just didn't happen. and more than ever, the battle scenes, especially the planet of mustaffar, just seemed like nicely computer generated sets, unlike the original trilogy, which took actual locations and limitations of technology, and made something great with them. well, that's it. the only time one can actually watch these is if you're watching all six star wars films together. but even then, i'd recommend the viewer to just watch nos. 4-6 then 1-3. it just seems better that way. i haven't turned my back on star wars, but this saga is something that has developed, along with my taste for movies. i saw the first movie 10 years ago as a young boy and fell in love with it. i went through a period of not watching many movies, star wars included. now, as a man, who has gotten back into cinema, i have a totally different perspective of the whole thing. over the last few years, i've opted for classic cinema, including old Hollywood and foreign films, the very ones that influenced lucas' creation. they clearly stand head and shoulders above this saga, as they all don't need any flashy special effects to advance a plot. it sounds sad, but that's the thing. star wars has made its mark, and now it is time to move on. all of you."
2670,10,Can't get enough Star wars,"I loved the Revenge of the Sith.I never thought I was in to science fiction, but I was wrong. Believe it or not I had never seen a Star Wars movie. My husband and I rented the Revenge of the Sith, and I was hooked. I had to go and buy all of the Star Wars movies. Now I can't get enough. I watch all the movies over and over. I wish George Lucas would make more. I don't want them to end. There has to be more!!!!!!! Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker go great together rescuing the Chancellor and confronting Grievous. Anakin and his bad dreams going to Yoda, and his love for Padma making his loyalty to the Jedi harder. Anakins fatal decision to turn to the dark side and march on the Jedi Temple and the order Sixty-Six were very emotional for me. Especially the battle of the two Anakin and Obi-Wan fighting and Obi telling Anakin how much he loves him like a brother, also Padma dying and delivering the twins. I just wish I could have more of Obi- Wan, Anakin, Yoda, and Qui-Gon."
2671,9,An Excellent way to tie in all Six Movies,when I first Watched Star Wars: A new hope I was amazed at how wonderful i felt while watching it...I had never seen anything so Great.... Then I saw the 5th and 6th and I was in love with Star Wars
2672,2,One long yawn,"This film could not be worse. Special effects do not make a movie, there's little else in this disappointment; they go on and on and on. Individually the Special Effects would be great, but when you're bombarded with them most of the time they lose their appeal. "
2673,10,Top Five Greatest Of All Time! Best Of The Six!,"Bad dialog too much CGI ""Lord Of The Rings rules!"" ""It's not like 4-6"" ""I hate Hayden Christensen"" ""I hate Lucas"" or, the most legitimate reason to hate this film, ""I never liked Star Wars"". Which one are you? I actually have a person in my family who claims to hate all Star Wars flicks but for some reason went with us to see Sith. My question is, ""Why, ****head, do you hate it so much yet waste time and money going to see it?"" Anyways, not only does Sith stand on its own better than Menace and Clones, it's one of the greatest movies of all time. Forget about it. If you're a Godfather fan as I am you'll know exactly what I mean when you see it. If you liked CGI-supported Saving Private Ryan, as I did, you'll appreciate this one. If you like Lord Of The Rings, which I do, you have no excuse to hate this film."
2674,10,The Best 'STAR WARS' Chapter of the Prequel Trilogy,"They say the conclusion ties all the loose ends and brings everything together. That's exactly what George Lucas did with his third (and sadly final) epic film. Even when this movie first came out, I knew it was going to be bigger, better and above all: far more physical than the other 'Star Wars' films. Now there's really no comparison to the original trilogy to this chapter, but when you think about it this really is the episode that sets the stage for ""A New Hope ('77), ""The Empire Strikes Back ('80)"" and last but not least ""Return of the Jedi ('83)"" What made this the best prequel was the story, the emergence of the continuing saga of the battle between good and evil and most of all: the lightsaber duels including the one between friends turned enemies Anakin (now Darth Vader) and Obi-Wan. Although that ended in a tearjerker finale when a good person turns to evil and of course is told who he was and what he was supposed to do since he was ""the chosen one!"" How it begins seems like just another fight amongst the galaxy, but how it ends completely sets up for what's bound to happen next which was depicted almost 30 years ago. For those of you who have not seen this, see it when comes out on DVD on 11/1/2005 or better yet: BUY IT! This is the definite Star Wars film in Hollywood cinematic history along with A New Hope which began ""a long time ago... in a galaxy far, far away""."
2675,5,Waaaaaaaaaaay overrated.,"Anyone who has ever seen the original Star Wars trilogy has been waiting for this film ever since. How did Anikin Skywalker become the android in the shiny black samurai helmet? The back story and mystery has always captivated me, so ever since Episode 1 hit theaters I have eagerly anticipated this flick. I, like may people, was underwhelmed by episodes 1 and 2 but really felt that they lacked the same spirit as the first trilogy. I feel that both trilogies stand alone. They are their own tales brought together by common characters. So, On that fateful Wed. I made my way to the movie theater to be one of the first of many eager fans to view what I had waited years and years to see. Well, when I walked out I was a bit disappointed. The battles were epic, the story grand but the acting was lame and every scene seemed to be dominated by CG. Portman as the Queen was unimpressive, in fact she was awful. I love Natalie Portman (especially her roles in Closer, Garden State and The Professional) but she was weak this time around. Christianson wasn't too bad I guess, he looked evil throughout the flick and has improved a bit since his last SW outing. As I said before every frame was dominated by CG almost to the point that I wanted to gag. If you are going to make a film, decide whether it will be all CG or if you are going to use it to enhance effects (not create everything for you). I liked how the original trilogy managed to create convincing effects and sets without CG, so I wish Lucus would have tapped into that creativity he had while making the first film and made the effects and sets work without relying so much on CG. Computer Graphics are a wonderful tool for changing the style of your film as in Sin City or Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but they shouldn't make films for you. Shame on you lazy Lucus... But this Star Wars swansong does manage to entertain. I still felt a chill go down my spine as Darth Vader is ""born"". The battles were still grand. However this batch of SW flicks as a whole couldn't live up to their predecessors... Of course that is a lot to ask."
2676,4,Why did Anakin turn to the Dark Side?,"The movie was enjoyable in parts, but I got a feeling watching it that it will definitely not stand up to multiple viewings. Like Lucas was using a ""trick"" many modern filmmakers use these days: trying to throw enough gimmicks and nonsense on the screen as to distract you from being able to see that there's nothing of any importance or depth going on in the movie. My complaints about the first two prequels were that what I'd really wanted from these movies was to see a young bad-ass Vader killing everyone and to see some cool space battles, but I realized having seen a movie that has all that that it wasn't really what I wanted out of these prequels."
2677,9,A Tragedy of Great Proportions,"Definitely the best of the first 3 Episodes, this is a very dark and cruel chapter in the saga. As advertised, it's action packed and the dialog pauses are well matched with other sequences happening at the same time elsewhere."
2678,4,best of the series?!,"So this was the darkest of the franchise then?! I think not. The film flowed nicely, good effects etc,. The acting.....now, lets put it like this. I saw better performances in Team America!! I kept looking for the strings during the Anny/Padme scenes!! The only problem with these Star Wars films....is George Lucas. Ever read the books? Better stories, and definitely darker. Why don't we get to see Luke and Leia fight each other? Leia a stronger Jedi? Want to know more? Read the books, see what is missing, better characters, better stories."
2679,10,It is Accomplished!,"What a Finish! Talk about 'wrapping it up'! Mr. Lucas (God Bless Him!) gave us a film for the ages with this final installment of the Star Wars Saga. I saw it six times in the movie theater. No where near the dozens of times that I saw the other five films. However, there is good reason. It was emotionally EXHAUSTING to watch! Anakin's final descent to the Dark Side of the Force is almost a Greek Tragedy! When you come to think of it, most of his life is a roller-coaster ride of tragedy. He goes from a young, paternal orphan with few prospects of advancement except continuing to be a slave, to meeting a great mentor/father figure who gives him hope of over-coming his personal circumstances, to losing that father figure to the Dark Sith. Qui-Gon's death in Phantom Menace sets forth the chain of events (obliging the Jedi Council to accept young Anakin as a Jedi Apprentice) that brings Anakin into direct contact with Senator Palpatine (alias Darth Sidius), who then becomes Anakin's father figure, overtly (and most particularly, covertly) nurturing every arrogant and negative urge in Anakin which eventually lead to Anakin's fall from grace."
2680,10,The last one,"Lucas really outdid himself with this one. Counting the earlier films, i still consider this one to be by far, one of the best star wars films of all time. even return of the Jedi doesn't measure up with this one. its like he was just coasting by with episodes 1 and two and then he gave us revenge, and boom!! all those years of waiting paid off. i wish that it could get an Oscar because, Lucas deserves it. putting aside the fact that i am a total star wars geek, this was one of the most well written movies of all time. it effectively showed anakins tranformatiom into Vader and still allowed us to feel for him as a human being. it was totally believable. even though i knew he was going to turn i couldn't help sitting there and silently begging him not to do it. everyone of course knows the ultimate end and yet my friends and i couldn't help being hurt by the fact that he chose the dark side over the Jedi. I also like the fact that it was pure human in perfections that led to his demise. he let his personal feelings get in the way of his life as a Jedi. if that hadn't of happen he could of been the most powerful Jedi there ever would have been."
2681,1,"The horror, the horror","Yes, I was suckered in too. I couldn't believe that III could be even worse than I and II, but it is. I really didn't expect that there would be all those horrendous continuity glitches between I-II-III and IV-V-VI, amply detailed by others here: Obiwan doesn't recognize R2, Leia remembers her real mother, Chewie goes from military leader to 2nd-banana smuggler, etc, etc, etc. "
2682,9,Going Out with a DeathStar-caliber BANG,"While fans have largely been disappointed with the two previous installments of Star Wars, what with Jar Jar camping up The Phantom Menace and the stiffest Romance ever committed to film slowing down Attack of the Clones, and many largely lost faith in the franchise, and the ability of George Lucas to tell a story."
2683,10,Spoiler review,Vary good movie one of my favourites I love the animals fall to Darth Vader. The final fight between Anakin and obi wan was amazing. I might be being biased because I'm a huge Star Wars fan but I thought it's one of the best movie for its time and its in my top 10 of my all time favourites so I definitely recommend it.
2684,10,Ahead of its time,"Upon watching this I went through and watched the Orginal Trilogy, it was stunning and epic. Then when watching the first 2 in the Prequels, I was a little dissappointed, the cgi and acting can be rough in those movies but the storyline is still there. Then when ROTS came out I was very very thrilled after this movie. It was all you want out of a star wars movie! Great characters, action, and a amazing storyline to lead up to the OG Trilogy, Great movie, straight 10/10, peak fiction. But dont get me wrong, the first 2 in the Prequels are 6 or 7/10 but the storylines do match. I just wish they would have made Hayden a little more menancing in these movies and not wait until the last 45 minutes of ROTS to show it."
2685,1,Worse than I expected...,"I just saw the latest Star Wars-well, at about 45 minutes of it, and couldn't believe how bad it was. Special effects aside, this movie stinks! And even the the special effects seemed dated, though General Grievous was pretty cool. Even with the temperature outside being 100 degrees and my A/C broken, I still had to leave. Hayden Christensen couldn't act his way out of a paper bag and all of the other actors seemed be be wishing they were somewhere else. Lucas should of stopped after the last one and kept. He'll make a fortune but this one will tarnish the Star Wars reputation. Stay home and watch a rerun of anything-it will be better then this movie."
2686,4,Just more of the same!,"Saying ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is the best of the prequels is like saying losing a finger beats losing the whole hand. Once again George Lucas has managed to come up short. He's tightened up the editing a bit and trimmed the fat so apparent in Episodes I & II, but he still can't manage to convince his actors to deliver their lines with any believability. Hayden Christiansen and Natlie Portman have the on-screen chemistry of a ham and cheese sandwich and Anakin's pivotal fall to the dark side fails to deliver. Lucas once again over-does the CGI (do we really need a live action head on a CG Clone Trooper) and with a single ""Noooooo!"" manages to water down Darth Vader in the same manner he did Han Solo in his Special Edition release of the first Star Wars. We finally get a bona-fide villain this time around and Ian Mcdiarmid certainly shines but even he can't save this faltering franchise. The Force is truly DEAD!"
2687,10,"The best entry since ""Empire.""",***May contain spoilers***
2688,6,The Godfather part III in space!,"With cheesy dire-loge, inept storytelling and a cast of pretty driftwood in place, you can be sure its star wars time again.As you may have guessed, I'm not a fan of the franchise but think that this is the instalment that, -out of all of them - demands an unbiased opinion.I'm sure that the fan-boys will wail in adulation that Lucas has returned to something ,even slightly resembling form-he has'nt.All he has done is turn the dial up a bit from the insipid ""clones"".Uncle George has spoken of the ""padding"" he did in order to create a new trilogy for 20th century fox,but had promised this to be nothing but the real meat of the story-wrong again!We are made to endure at least another hour of padding b4 the fun begins and even then, the overriding feeling of cold detachment -the result of CG overload-is present and correct.On the plus side ,there are a hand full of cracking set pieces: Anakin crossing the point of no return with the execution of Dooku, a mass Jedi cull that would make Coppola proud and the final face/off between young Skywalker and his Master.Lest I forget to mention ,Sith's biggest asset:McDiarmid, his Palpatine appositively oozes malevolence from every pore and chews the scenery as if it were really there.All in all as enjoyable, operatic ,space-age melodrama goes this is a winner but as cinema's equivalent to the prodigal son? As Lord Vader puts it in the films most embarrassing moment ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"
2689,10,Star Wars' return to glory!,"Now THIS is what we've been waiting for. This is not only the best of the prequel trilogy...but the BEST Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back! It has it all....action, humor, drama, spectacle. From the stunning visuals, to John Williams' masterful score, this is Star Wars at its' finest. The movie opens precisely where the animated series Clone Wars left off, with Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi attempting to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the droid army leader General Grievous. The playful banter between Anakin and Obi-Wan is very funny, and doesn't come off as forced as it did in Attack of the Clones. It's an exciting sequence that mirrors the tone of the movie itself. It starts out light and becomes very dramatic as Anakin once again squares off against Count Dooku. It is the very best opening sequence of the ENTIRE Star Wars saga. The movie then settles into its' narrative as we witness the end of the Clone Wars, and eventual fall of Anakin to the dark side of the Force. The visuals are incredible. The opening space battle is as detailed and complex as any action sequence we've seen, and the final lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar is awe inspiring. But besides the visuals, the movie also includes what many feel the previous sequels were lacking....emotion. This is epitomized in the final duel. Many feel that the duel in The Phantom Menace is the best fight in the series. While it IS the highlight of that film, there is a reason why (in my opinion) it ranks 3rd behind the Luke/Vader duel in Empire, and the duel in this film. You are emotionally invested in the other 2 duels. You know that there is REALLY something very big at stake. And that adds SO much more to the thrilling action. Much will be said about the acting in this movie. Most will easily toss it off as wooden. But I disagree. While some of the dialog occasionally hits a real clunker, the actors do what they can with it. Hayden Christensen really comes into his own as Anakin. He's given so much complexity here as he goes from misunderstood hero, to a lost soul that becomes what he swore to destroy. We LIKE Anakin, we don't want him to go down that road, and do the terrible things we KNOW he's going to do. Ewan McGregor OWNS as Obi-Wan Kenobi. With all due respect to the late Sir Alec Guinness, McGregor IS the heart and soul of that character now. He was given the opportunity to grow, whereas Guinness is the finished version of Kenobi. Natalie Portman has a reduced role here, but her character is no less pivotal. Pregnant with Anakins' children, she struggles to hold on the good in her life as everything she believes in, especially Anakin, collapses around her. Of all the characters in the Star Wars saga, hers is the most tragic. But of all the people in this movie...Ian McDiarmid RULES (no pun intended) as Palpatine. We always knew he would eventually be revealed as the mastermind behind all of this evil, but here he REALLY struts his stuff. The Emperor has never had a chance to be shown as the powerhouse he is until this movie. Big props to George Lucas for creating such a successful bridge between the two trilogies. This one FEELS like a Star Wars movie. That's a feeling I think too many thought was missing from the first two films. There are many memorable images here, but the most anticipated of all is the first appearance of Darth Vader in full armor. (BIG SPOILER AHEAD)It at this point that Star Wars reaches it's most tragic moments as we see the birth of Luke and Leia tied in to the spiritual death of Anakin, and the physical death of Padme. It is probably the most pivotal moment in the ENTIRE Star Wars saga, and it hits home HARD!!! Speaking of bridging the saga, the final shot of this movie gave me CHILLS....I can't imagine a better way to end the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it. So for all those who were left cold by Episodes I & II, you will find MUCH to love here. THIS is the Star Wars movie we've been waiting for. We've been patient through disappointments, and now we have been rewarded. Thank you Mr Lucas for 28 years of unmatched imagination."
2690,5,Feeling a bit let down...,"Three theories on why I left the theater feeling strangely flat: 1) As with any endeavor taking 28 years to complete, anti-climax is a major danger; 2) We all know how the story ends; the only potential interest the viewer has is in how we arrive there. This is a major challenge to the storyteller, and I'm not sure Lucas was quite up to it; and, finally 3) The movie just isn't very good. There are some terrific bits -- it contains four of my all-time favorite light saber fights, an awesome and extended space battle scene kicks off the film, and Ewan McGregor does a brilliant job of replacing Harrison Ford's Han Solo as the focus of wry humor -- but that doesn't make a whole film, folks."
2691,9,Best of the series,"I found it very strange that people are giving this movie an one when it is divinely a great movie. Although the first movie was made in 1977 and the technology wasn't as developed as it is now, but that don't mean it is a worser movie, but now it is. Because the story of this movie is by far the most exciting, where by the other movies it is a little boring.The laser sword fights in this movie are outstanding where by the first movie it is laughable. And in this movie the characters like Yoda are much deeper. I think it is unfair of the people who lived in the time when the first movie was released, because i think they give this movie a low rating because they don't want that their own original movie is lower rated."
2692,10,A Positive Review From An Objective Star Wars Fan,"First off, I am a true Star Wars fan. This means I have loved everything Star Wars that I have been able to experience (Movies, TV, Books, etc.) That being said, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith is the best film of the entire saga. "
2693,1,I can't believe this movie is not NC-17,"Like many people, I am a major fan of Star Wars and was excited to go and see this movie. I have to say that it was a major disappointment, not only was the acting terrible, but it included a scene in which a 8-12 year old child was gunned down in cold blood by a clone trooper. Seeing adults killed is bad enough (I expected that), but to see the senseless murder of children is something that is deeply offensive to me (I am a father of 2). I knew that the story included the fact that the younglings would be killed, but I can't believe they actually showed it! Especially in a movie only rated PG-13, something like that should be at least R if not NC-17. There is no way a teenager should be allowed to watch that kind of violence. What is it going to take before people say that this kind of violence is going too far, are we going to watch a PG-13 film with children being skinned alive and tortured next? Up to this point the most offensive film I had ever seen was Primal Fear in which they show a pastor directing a 3-some with 16 year old kids (I was surprised they even were allowed to publish that movie), but at least it was rated R, so you knew there was something offensive in it."
2694,9,The best of them all.,"I gave it a 9, but it's an 8.5. "
2695,6,An average movie,"People have a tendency to mix hype+tradition with good film making. Had this been ANY other movie than STAR WARS, this ... mediocre thing would never have received the attention it has."
2696,9,Superb ending to a satisfying space adventure,"A tremendously satisfying wrap-up to the Star Wars saga. Answered all the nagging questions about Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and why he turned to the Dark Side of the Force. Anakin is the sympathetic villain. You wish you could change his fate but he has his destiny, as we all do. I am not a purist in regards to this series, so I was not nit-picky about whether this or that fact matched up exactly so. I watched it for the entertainment value and it was definitely a fun ride. John Williams' music was wonderful as always. I especially liked ""Anakin vs. Obi-Wan"" and the very sad ""Anakin's Betrayal."" My only disappointment was that George Lucas did not have someone else write the love scenes between Anakin and Padmé. It would have made Anakin's betrayal even more devastating had that relationship been more fully developed. May the Force be with us all!"
2697,9,Top Notch Movie,"This is by far the best movie I've seen this year. The action, visuals, effects, and music all combine to make an excellent ending to the Star Wars saga. From the opening battle to the closing duel, this is a fast paced movie."
2698,6,Visually entertaining but falls heavily in the script department,"""And so it has come to this. Twenty seven years, six films, a $3.5bn box office gross and arguably the most watched and analysed set of films of all time. And it looks like this really is the end. Being too young to remember the impact Star Wars had when the original films were released and too old to be snared in by the flurry of hype and media attention Episode I received, I've always seen myself as an outsider to the Star Wars franchise. Neither hating or nor loving it (even at a young age) I see Star Wars as science fiction without the sci. "
2699,9,Overall..fantastic!,"I am so proud of lucas. Yes, all the other movies were amazing, but I caught myself holding my breath a couple of times, even though I knew what was going to happen. There was just that sense of ""here it comes, here it comes..."" that kept me on the edge of my seat. I sat wide-eyed through 98 percent of that movie. "
2700,5,Best of the six!,"The only episode you can compare Revenge of the Sith to has got to be Return of the Jedi. There are so many common instances and scenes in the two films, it's hard to make a choice which is better. It is obviously true that Return of the Jedi was the best of the original trilogy. It's the episode which brings the Galactic Civil War to a close, and ends on a high note with great special effects and fantastic acting by all. The way it was filmed alone made it the best of the three, very rapid and swiftly moving from shot to shot. Episode III, Revenge of the Sith has the same qualities to it. It ends the new trilogy, not disappointing in any way leading into Episode IV. All of the lose ends were tied up, ending the series of six with the greatest of all of them. Truly a remarkable film."
2701,10,Best Star Wars ever,"This was such a good movie. So much better than Episodes I and II that they cannot even compare. It's easily on par with the OT if not better (it has the character, story and acting of the OT, plus the kickass action of the prequels...the best of both worlds!) Gone are the Jar Jar antics that plagued Episode I and the half-baked romance that plagued Episode II. Hayden's performance is so much better this time around, it's almost as if Anakin is played by a different actor. The best special effects and action sequences ever committed to film. I cannot recommend this movie more highly. Run, don't walk, to the theater and see this masterpiece as many times as you can."
2702,8,George Lucas finished his saga with a bang!,"Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith Revenge of the Sith ranks right up there with ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as the best of the lot. Lucas had a lot of loose ends to tie up and did it all very well. I liked how the dark side slowly consumed Anikan yet he was still fighting it knowing deep down that what he was doing was not right. Like Luke had told him in ""Return of the Jedi"" ""the is good in you father, I have felt it."" As Anikan became Darth Vader there was still good him and the conflict between good and the dark side raged inside of him."
2703,1,Ed Wood would have made a better job of it,"I do get the feeling that ep 3 is slightly rushed, one minute Annie is a true believer in good and the next minute he is killing younglings (i have trouble writing that word without smiling) Apart from the awful acting of one youngling (surely they could have found a decent actor just for that one line)and evil characters that talk like bill and ted the story itself is the worse i've seen since Plan 9. Obviously George $$$$$ Lucas just wanted to rush it out so he could flog his merchandise instead of making it 4 episodes instead of three and maybe hiring someone who can write a story that it deserved. Stick with the 70's classics and let's all pretend this never happened :o)"
2704,1,GOB: Come on!,"Seriously, this is awful. beyond awful. I'm not going to get into it, but, seriously. filming is awful, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't blend, stupid animals, terrible screen direction (good actors, but they have nothing to work on). this thing doesn't even deserve to be put in the IMDb Worst movie list. thats how bad it is. there is no way to argue that it is a good movie. even without comparing it the the old ones, it is a horrible excuse for a movie. I really don't want to keep ranting on this movie, because eventually it will just sound like I am just one of those people who wants to be cool and hate Star Wars. but no, i love them, the old ones at least. they were real movies. With characters you connect with, and have personalities. Han is awesome! hes so cool! but now what is there? Anikin is s...no. nothing. Obi Won? yea! hes....not much different from Anikin. or any other characters. Mace. there we go. he is so cool! oh wait, he doesn't do anything. its just a cool actor. no emotion! OK, now i think this is long enough."
2705,8,Finally...A Worthy Successor,"When it was announced in the mid 90's that new Star Wars movies would be made, THIS was the one I wanted to see. Not the actual fall to the dark side that we know is coming, but to see a Star Wars film that lived up to what had come in the original trilogy."
2706,,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith,"More aptly put: revenge on the audience. And for what? It seems that George Lucas, who can never be accused of understatement, has managed to do it not once-not twice-but three times. What has he done? Seemingly the impossible: that being keeping us totally bored while he destroys the universe."
2707,10,The fact that this isn't the highest rated Star Wars movie is a crime!,"Don't get me wrong, I like the old Star Wars movies a lot but this movie is what it all was being built up for. The plot of this movie is so great and hosts two of the best fight scenes in Star Wars history."
2708,9,Forget the Hype.....,"I just got out of the first midnight showing of Star Wars Episode 3, second ticket sold at the theater, and I would like to leave you with some thoughts. I will try to remain spoiler free, if i must, i will mark a spoiler."
2709,5,Contrived,"I think what makes a story and characters credible is the question of Why. Why would someone chose to do a certain action over another? Why would someone behave that way? What is the motivational force behind these people? Lucas tried. He really did. Bottom line is that he is not a writer. Lucas is a creative genius in that he created a magnificent story in an incredible setting. He also pioneered transformations in film making. That is what Lucas is and those are the things he does best. However, writing is not his forte. If ""Star Wars"" continues, it would be better left in someone else's hands."
2710,9,George Knew What he was Doing,"OK first of all, its my favorite movie of all time, sure 1 and 2 weren't all that, and 4,5,6 are still good enough to watch, but Revenge of the Sith ties it all together, and after watching them all in order you just have to say that George Lucas Knows What He's Doing."
2711,7,A 150 minutes trailer,"Weak plot development, character's main motivations aren't sufficiently drawn and are shown without depth. Hayden Christensen's acting isn't convincing, especially during the love scenes. He lacks the strength that his character historically should have. As for the rest, the CG steals the show, again very impressive, and the movie actually gives its fans what they've been waiting for 30 years. The excitement watching it comes more from the ""importance"" of what's happening than from the way Lucas achieves its scenes. I'd wish Lucas would have learnt something from Wong Kar Wai, so the movie could have won its ""momentums"" in a more convincing, profound and visceral kind of way. Fans of the saga will only wish it would have lasted longer, of course, I'm one of those. There was so much to develop and so much swapping and leaping, that I often felt like watching a trailer as it jumped from peak to peak, leaving many holes and giving the plot a more so superficial treatment. I love the film, it was certainly the most dramatic of them all, it's a shame Lucas is rather incapable as a ""drama"" director."
2712,10,He's done it again,"I have been a good fan of Star Wars for a while, but I really got into it when Episode 1 came out. I was almost dying for Episode 2 to come out, and you can only imagine how long I waited to see Episode 3. Let me tell you that I was not disappointed. By far the best of the first 3, Revenge of the Sith sets a new standard for Star Wars. Though it was loaded with too much special effects, it was still very awesome. Some of the acting I found quite wooden, like when Anakin force chokes Padme and how she acts like she is choking, it was pretty poor. Greatest of all was it's dark theme. This is NOT a movie you should take a 5-year old to. Very dark, considering the fact that Anakin kills everyone in the Jedi temple, including 'younglings' (young kids). But, for serious Star Wars fan, that makes it all the better. One of the best movies I have ever seen."
2713,9,The best of the prequels and one of the best overall,"This movie has everything; Action,plot,dialog. I stood in line for 2 hours, and if I had known that the movie was so good I probably would have done it for even longer. The movie shows how Anakin becomes Darth Vader and the way they tell you the story is smooth and flawless. It is the epitome of the Star wars saga the acting is much better in this one and so are the special effects, so sit back, and enjoy. This Movie ties the previous two with the original 3, and it makes sense if you haven't seen it go watch it it is a theater movie not a movie rental. the experience of a life time. I was fixated to the screen for the 2 and a half hours. Yoda is back, and so is chewbacca, a lot of familiar faces will be see."
2714,7,A Triumph of Special Effects and a Fine Story Hampered by bad horrible acting,"The special effects are possible the best in any film to date. Lucas does a better job than he did with the previous films. The actions seem forced and Hayden Christiansen never clicks in the pivotal of Anakin. His performance lacks the intensity and he certainly does not sink his into the role. Ewan McGregor is adequate and nothing more. Natalie Portman is once again nearly as bad as Razzie Winner Hayden Christiansen. Ian McDiarmid is deliciously over the top in the performance of his career. The dialog is still lousy at times, but is definitely a step-up from Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The acting lacks intensity and emotion. George Lucas does bring both trilogies together abruptly and sloppily. We never really believe twerpy Hayden Christiansen's joining the Dark Side to become the greatest movie villain Darth Vader. The film is actually campy at times, yet nonetheless enjoyable. Hopefully Lucas can finally close the book on Star Wars Saga. The last 3 films did not live up to the remarkably high standards that the Original Trilogy Set. A were a genuine disappointment. This movie is still easily the best of the last 3. A 7/10 Good But not Great."
2715,9,Easily The Best Installment Of The Series After Episode 5,"I love this movie. I simply can't get enough of it - a true masterpiece. Entirely computer-generated environments that are more detailed and life-like than most real ones. Grandiose battle scenes that easily overshadow anything you've ever witnessed in theaters, especially the lightsabre duels. And last but certainly not least - the Plot line. You will understand the source of Anakin's troubles and exactly how Palpatine came to power. The movie doesn't give a clear definition of good and evil but rather leaves the line between them somewhat blurry. You are left to decide for your self what's right or wrong. That makes the whole experience way better than the naive, teenage ""evil Empire"" we came to know in Episode 4. Palpatine's portrayal it's quite simply staggering. Ian McDiarmid is perhaps the best actor ever to be involved in the series. A mixture of wisdom, hypocrisy, ambition and of course some good 'ol evil marks his character. Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen give a relatively good performance, though the later probably should have worked a bit more on it, given it's importance. However, the movie has one major flaw and it's name is Natalie Portman. I'm not sure exactly who's fault it is but most of her scenes are a major disaster. Bad acting and a naive, fairy-tale-like romance seem to be the trademarks of her character. I can imagine it's hard - blue screen and all, but still her acting and generally dialogs involving her seems to be under all expectations. This is the sole reason I rated the movie with a 9. "
2716,4,"the ""dark"" side of this movie....","I wasn't a hard core fans of star wars, but i can see George Lucas fail this movie. First, i would like to complain about light-saber fighting, is pretty too much until making me feel boring. Secondly, the unbelievable story-line like: why obi-wan can't just kill Anakin instead of watching him burning alive? and yet, Anakin still alive!? I never knew that obi-wan is a ""hentai"". Also, after Anakin go back home for a deep consideration, he still able to catch up with Windu before he kill Palpatine? Isn't it too Illogic?"
2717,7,Merely good but wraps it up,"Star Wars II is merely a good movie, compared with the classics. However, it did do a good job of wrapping up lots of loose ends. The fight scenes were too long, the pacing off, and I hate Jar-Jar. But overall, it was good. It's certainly worth renting if you didn't see in in the theaters."
2718,3,No surprises,"The special effects on Star Wars Episode III are breathtaking. If anything they are too good. All buildings are immense, heights dizzying, and space ships as numerous as swarms of plankton. But they are all computer generated, which means that the actors have nothing to interact with. They can't put a hand on a door frame, can't slump against a window, and don't get jarred around in the seats of their fighters."
2719,10,Best movie ever,"All I have to say is that Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was George Lucas' best creation. We are given an explanation to everything in this movie. Things like why R2-D2 and C-3PO don't remember what Tatooine looks like in Episode IV: A New Hope even though they have lived through the entire saga. We also find out who the treacherous Darth Sidious is in this final installment. This movie is definitely the best out of all of the other Star Wars. This movie is much more action-packed. It has all the great elements a movie needs. It has good, evil, love, tragedy, love, hate, action, foreshadowing, and much much more. George Lucas also does an excellent job with keeping the entire story-line in flow. Like I said before, everything is explained in this movie. The only thing that was wrong with the movie was that it moved very fast."
2720,10,Thank you for saving the series!!!,"I was so hoping that the third installment could save the series, and luckily it did NOT disappoint! No spoilers here, but I will say, that after 2 movies full of wooden acting little kids, shady midichlorines and Jar Jar freakin' Binks... George has returned to the formulas we know and love. Ever since the ""Han Solo shot first"" fiasco, I was nervous! Ewan was stellar! So close to Sir Alec as to be a bit scary!!! And as he has aged, Hayden Christensen has truly grown into his role.He does dark and brooding far better that petulant and whiny. As usual the space battles and sweeping planet shots are jaw dropping and awe inspiring. BTW... all the little transitional bits are awesome! It's easy to see where the costumes, ships and other items from the ""first"" three movies will come from. ENJOY!!! Thanks again George!!!"
2721,5,"Nice pictures... but, ""Where's the beef???""","I've been reading a lot of other people's reviews on this film, and I have to say I'm completely surprised at the staggering number who thought this film was a success! I suppose this gives credence to the suspicion that people get paid to vote on this site for certain films that have a lot at stake, like Revenge of the Sith does. If the die-hard fans who frequent this and other such websites were to find out that it stunk, then the film would take a financial hit. The truth, however, is that it did stink."
2722,10,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith Review,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is by far the greatest of the prequel films. It is also the catalyst for the sequel films which makes it even more great.
2723,9,My Favorite All-time Star Wars series!,"Frankly typing, I hadn't had any ideas what Star Wars was about in the beginning. For me, the movies are even awkward;It started from episode four and ended on the six. So what I had in my mind was this; What did really happen in the beginning? After such a long waiting, finally I got the answer. And I realized the answer for everything that took place in Star Wars' world can be found on this third installment."
2724,10,Perfect end to a perfect saga,this movie is great!!! I loved Anikin's slid to the dark side it is so perfectly planed. i really loved that Obi-Wan said that Anikin was his brother it really shows that he loved Anikin. This is one of my favorite star wars movies yet. It really closes all the open ends from the saga. There may be some people that will not like it. This would be people that don't like star wars. But there r some people who don't like star wars that would love this movie. It is very powerful. I have to say that u may not understand it until u have seen it more than once. I love star wars and normally get every thing after just watching it once but this one is more complex. I didn't get it all until i saw it 2 times. THIS MOVIE ROX!!!!!!!!!!!!
2725,7,A Redeeming effort from Lucas - But it's not Darth time,"***May contain spoilers*** OK, if you wanna know how great this film is etc, the read everyone elses reviews."
2726,5,Bearable but not great,People have told me that this is their favourite Star Wars movie.
2727,6,Most Overrated Star Wars Movie Ever,To think people overpraise this movie just to bash on the sequels. Pathetic.
2728,9,Finally.. a movie worthy of Star Wars!,"I'm a fan of the original trilogy. I hated Episode I and only liked Episode II, I had pretty low expectations with this final installment"
2729,10,Best Movie of the Six,This is the greatest movie of all time. And I am considering all of the other movies out there. I believe that this movie will be the movie that blows Titanic out of the water on sells. I have seen it three times already and it just keeps getting better every time. I do hope that George Lucas releases all of them all in 3D like I've read about in an interview with Rick McCallum. I noticed that in Ep. II you wanted to just slap Anakin and tell him to quit being a little baby and grow up. And in Ep. III you wanted to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger. But the flow between the prequels and the originals are really great.
2730,3,I hate you,"You were the chosen one, you were meant to bring balance to Star Wars not leave it in darkness."
2731,3,So bad it made me angry...,"I wasn't expecting much from this final edition as the previous two were abysmal, and Lucas was still doing directing and writing the majority of dialog. Still, I had hope that somehow he could right the ship and get back some of the old magic, but that wasn't the case. I was bored for nearly two hours, got excited in the climactic light saber duel, and then squirmed in my seat as the some of the corniest scenes in movie history played out... Bad acting, bad writing, and bad directing can't be saved by some neat visuals and interesting fight scenes. If you didn't like the first two movies, you're not going to like this one. Awful stuff..."
2732,8,Above average but could of been better,"(Small Spoilers) First I have to say that if you are in Sydney, you have to see this film at Fox Studio cinema with the Digital Projection, the only one in Metro Sydney apparently. The transfer to 35mm gives the skin tones an odd Pinkish/Orange color. The digital has correct skin tones but the clarity and colour of the digital effects is fantastic."
2733,9,Anticlimactic ...but still worth the wait,"Revenge of The Sith had the potential to be the greatest of both trilogies, but in the end I was left wanting. Understand that I am an avid fan in my late 30's, and I am not given to ""prequel bashing"". In fact, I believe that GL accomplished his mission if one considers the greater context of all six movies. With that said, I felt the most troubling aspects of ROTS involved the coherency and integrity of the plot itself. First, I had a very hard time with the ""brotherhood"" that was supposed to be felt between Obi Wan and Anakin. Friendly banter aside, the warmness resonated from these ""best friends"" was barely above tepid -- less brothers but more like two co-laborers who've worked too long together. Moreover, all of the developing relationships/plots seem to be merely a contrivance to move the movie along to the legendary climax. Anakin and Padme's deepening love, Mace Windu's sudden distrust of Anakin, Palpatine's betrayal of Dooku, a certain ""change of heart"" by a principal character -- it just rings false. It's not so much that there is great dissonance... there just seems to be an artificial consonance of the elements...put together like polyester. Also, the movie seems to be less storyline and more a collage of scenes and subplots -- much of which is introduced and processed in contracted fashion. It is as if GL filmed this great film, and then removed any contextual dialogue or involvement to save room for the ""action scenes"". Sadly, the greatest tragedy of this movie is that you are relegated to that of passive observer as you are kept at an emotional distance. Conspicuously lacking are the qualities of endearment we loved in Han/Leia/Luke. And with that, for whom can you root for in the end? Instead of this being a uniquely engaging experience, what's left is a visually stunning mosaic. However, like I said I am an old salt from the ""Old School"" of Star Wars and I believe that the simple participation in such an event gives credence to my anticipation and my ultimately anticlimactic experience. In short, with all of its flaws  it was still worth it."
2734,8,all good things end...,"Truly remarkable.Unlike the other two prequels this one manages to bring back the excellent pacing and sense of joy that the originals had,all this without loosing its focus on the serious conflict that we all had imagined would take place as the republic turned into the Empire and Anakin into Darth Vader.By the end of the film i had enjoyed the way it tied it's loose ends with A NEW HOPE and how small details such as the music score made such a great impression on familiars with the original trilogy. I expect The revenge of the Sith to stand the test of time in the same way that A new Hope,Empire strikes back and in a way Return of the Jedi did."
2735,8,Why didn't they switch of the freaking' droids right from the start ???,"Well, well, well, here it is, the long anticipated final Star Wars installment. I admit, I was a little bit infected by the incredible hype, conducted by the fans as well as the critics, so my expectations were a little too high . And that's what I definitely wanted to avoid, after I expected the best movie ever with Episode I, and was pretty much disappointed. Resulting attitude before watching Episode II? ""George, please don't screw everything up again !!"" And that's why I was positively surprised with part II! My expectation now was a mixture of these two, and I have to say the movie served both, sort of. I mean, the beginning is awful! After a terrific but rather short space fight almost knocking at the door of ""Return of the Jedi"" (You can say what you want about ""Eeew, ewoks, hate them, stupid etc."", the space fight in ""Return of the Jedi"" has never been topped in any other movie), the indoor space ship scenes just terribly sucked, I partly thought I was sitting in the wrong movie and expected again the worst for the rest. R2D2 is almost turning everything into a complete farce, even the fights are relatively lame, I mean, come on, that stupid, childish droids with their bullshit comments, who needs this ? Which brings me to another weak point: General Grievious ! Oh man, how silly can you get, a coughing, hopping robot lord ? I still wonder what character is more hate able and displaced: This one or Darth Maul ? Sure, General Grievious had more lines (not just two :-P), but that's not necessarily providing him with more depth. The chancellor rescue is OK, although a ship breaking in two pieces we already had in starship troopers, and Palpatine didn't have to throw an annoyed eye at R2 three times ! The middle part of the movie gets better, although there is a lot of talk which sometimes seems repetitive and sort of displaced for we all know Lucas isn't the greatest script writer. The fight scenes are OK, but they are appearing a little discontinued and unfinished, I expected a lot from the wookie fight, and you just get to see some tiny bits ! The great landing of the separatists's army, resembling the landing of the allies in the Normandy, lasts for about a minute, I wish they had skipped some of talks for more of that or the actual indication of the fight's outcome. Anakin's transfer to the dark side is put on stage very well, I mean, a lot of people I know and also a lot of critics don't like him and think he's the wrong choice for the role, I disagree, especially after this episode. Only the motive, which comes, hands down, as the only real surprise in that movie, leaves a little to argue. I think it's a pretty good idea to make Anankin switch sides because of love, although it's a paradox in itself and not really comprehensible. Which brings us to the treason, and the end of the jedi council, this was a little bit too fast for me and without the necessary depth. Well, some jedis get killed, so what ? A little more pathos would have served this scenes well, but I think the whole jedi council and codex is under treated in all first three episodes.But now, after so much critic, let's move to the ingenious final, which makes up almost each of the previously mentioned flaws. The two light saber duels are just awesome, incredible that Lucas still manages to entertain us like this and always brings in some new aspects, after five times ! The pathos is exactly right dosed here, leaving my favorite scene when Anakin is defeated and almost burns to death, with just his hatred keeping him alive ! As mentioned in a lot of previous comments, I can just agree that the indications allow for a glue less transition to Episodes IV-VI, Lucas really thought of almost everything, hats off ! I still secretly hoped the blasphemy from episode I gets revoked concerning the father of Anakin, which is not only offending a lot of people, but also highly uninspired ! Alright, you might wonder why this movie still gets 8 out of 10 after all my complaints, well mostly because of the great final, the typical ""star wars"" bonus, and not to forget, it's always easier to find flaws then strengths, especially after a little too high expectations because of all the hype. I would like too close this comment by indicating that Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg have to be real sissies(they admittedly were in tears), come on, I for my part really didn't feel like crying throughout the whole movie :-)"
2736,8,This movie will surprise you (if you get past the first two),"I have to admit, looking at episode 1&2, this was the best we could have hoped for. If the storyline doesn't impress you then maybe the scope of the movie will."
2737,1,What the heck is this?,If you have to go see this vile piece of llama feces.
2738,10,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,"This movie is the best this year overall, I loved it so much, it made me want to cry a couple of times, it's really intense with a lot of emotions running around. I was NOT disappointed when I saw it, it was everything everyone said it was and more. I say 10 thumbs up to this movie, I love it, it makes you want George Lucas to make more of these Star Wars movies. "
2739,9,Valuable modern Star Wars movie,"This movie is a valuable piece in the Star Wars saga. Though not a masterpiece it offers great action and an interesting story and environments. Let's start from the bad points usually (over)criticized by people. Bad acting: well, is there any of the Star Wars film which has a good acting? These kind of films have much other stuff to offer: stunning visual effects, fantastic scenography, captivating mythology wrapped in to a non linear epic story, great stunts etc. Acting is relevant for movies like the Godfather (masterpiece). Let's say that Lucas is no more of any good writing dialogues (they could be much better) and that the movie generally features severe and didactic dialogue lines. Natalie Portman's talent is wasted, while Ewan Mc Gregor is successful in giving Obi Wan the aura of a wise middle aged master. The character of Anakin is not as deep as should be. The best of the lot is easily Ian Mc Diarmid, who is the most expressive and credible of all (he comes from theater experience so he's quite used in acting with bare scenography ...). Despite that, the story and the events are heart-breaking and they communicate the emotions which are not expressed by dialogue lines and this is, in my opinion, a great achievement. The details in the action/key scenes of the film are very rich and typical of George Lucas Star Wars movies: you have to see that scene more than one time to understand all things the director wants to tell you. That gives great credit to the movie. Another aspect which is always blamed is the strong use of CGI. It is necessary to use CGI in most of the movie because Lucas' worlds, places have been created from nothing, are pure fantasy and the more credible way to realize them is to do the environments with CGI. Most of them would be very expensive to do with a physical set and perhaps would be also less credible due to a lack of details and depth (e.g.: you would easily understand, nowadays, if a scene is shot in a studio). In the whole movie the CGI is surely overused (e.g.: the suit of the clones) but the real deal with that is that is not always consistent. While very good and detailed on average there are some environments that look like to much separated from the actors. Especially the world of Mustafar is a too much ambitious achievement even for modern CGI since lava can't be simulated very well yet and they had to blend Etna's videos with CGI backgrounds and real actors! That's a great effort. There are some issues regarding acting and CGI but, far from that, the movie is almost perfect. It features a well timed and dark soundtrack (the best of the new trilogy), enough pathos, stunning rich original environments, beautiful lightsaber duels, very well coordinated. Yoda, though speaks few (if any) memorable lines, is greatly animated and features great facial morphing. The story is very rich, it shows many facts and ties in a very good mix the moments of pause, action, drama. It is a pity that 60% of the new trilogy story is concentrated in this movie because it would have been great to tell some key moments with a closer and deep eye. Some people find part of the story to be boring. In my opinion is instead very functional to the second part of the movie. There would be many other aspects of the movie that would need a comment, but in a nutshell:"
2740,7,George scores BIG again,"George Lucas has done it again. Another fine entry from that galaxy long ago and far away, one I predict will have the multitude racing to their nearest video store upon its much anticipated release on DVD. Fans of the saga will not be disappointed with the visuals. The effects are simply dazzling. Mouths will drop, and eyes will pop out of their sockets at everything George has packed into this production. Everything that fans have been expecting to see since they were first introduced to that galaxy all those years ago are delivered with great style. The acting is among the best of the saga. In my mind, Ian McDiarmid should get an Oscar nod for his performance as Chancellor Palpatine. Even Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker was surprisingly impressive. Frankly, I did not think he could fill Vader's boots. But all in all, stealing a line from Yoda, you FEEL the force of Anakin's torment as he falls to the dark side. George doesn't hold back any punches this time. He doesn't miss a trick."
2741,10,Amazing....,"Wow, Revenge of the Sith can only be described as an amazing movie. This heart-felt tragedy was an amazing end to the Prequel Trilogy, and wraps it up perfectly. I really believe that this movie will bring respect back to he PT as they see the entire story."
2742,9,"Good for non fans, Great for fans",Growing up my mother plunked me in front of star wars to pass the time when she was too tired to look after me and my brother. (my mom worked night shifts at an ER so subsequently i've seen the episodes 4-6 min excess of 25 times each). i enjoyed the first 2 prequels purely on this merit and i don't believe they were as bad as everyone made them out to be.
2743,10,My favorite out of all 6 films!!,"I don't understand some of the comments of people who have slammed this film. This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie with a great storyline that ties everything together. The special effects in this film are excellent, from the beginning scene with Anakin and Obi-Wan in an intense dog-fight style star ship battle, to the volcanic world of Mustafar where Anakin and Obi-Wan have one of the best light saber battles I have seen in this series. Some people still comment about ""wooden"" acting in this film. I saw absolutely none of that. Hayden does a great job in this film as you can see the hate in him rising and rising until it boils over to a point where it consumes him. Ian McDiarmand does a remarkable job as Palpatine/Emperor. Ewan McGregor made Obi-Wan Kenobi believable in not only his knowledge of the force, but in his fighting skills as well. He is the hero of this film! I love how Lucas showed us how great of a Jedi Obi-Wan was. Obi-Wan is the one who is sent to fight Count Dooku. Obi-Wan is the one who is sent to fight General Grievous. Obi-Wan is the one who is sent to fight Anakin/Darth Vader. It seems to me that Obi-Wan at this time is the most powerful Jedi in the council, except for Yoda and Mace Windu, the two elders. The PG-13 rating is a must: Violence is more prevalent in this film as we see the total destruction of the Jedi order, even the ""younglings"" are wiped out. Heads roll, limbs are cut off, and Anakin almost gets burnt to a crisp. This is the darkest of all the films, all of our questions are answered, and this film is indeed my favorite of the six. Well done George Lucas! Movie fans get your tickets now and go see this film! You will not be disappointed."
2744,3,Terrible movie,Too much eye candy and no character development. The scenes are cut short to quickly leaving the viewer with unanswered questions. I am so upset that Lucas failed to get it right.
2745,10,It was an awesome movie!! Have to see it,The movie is about when Anikan goes through devastating events and that what happens when his own master does not trust him.Anikan is so strong in the force in this movie that he dreams that some will die and they actually do. When he turns to the dark side his powers are so strong that he can kill by just looking at the person. This is a very good movie while Anikan saves his master a lot but his master does not repay him. Lots of breath taking events and the you don't have a chance to live events. A very good movie of how he was just a boy who had a dream to become a Jedi and now becomes one of the most evil person.Anikan stands by his new master.....
2746,9,Great Comeback,"In the last two star wars George definitely screwed up but he redeemed himself and kicked butt. I still wish that a star wars series would continue and go on forever.In the movie it shows how Anikan transforms into Darth Vader. Anikan gets ticked at obi wan because the chancellor who is the Sith lord is leading him to believing that he is the one that should be taking the jobs that obi wan is taking. In the end obi wan and (Darth Vader) fight and obi wan wins but Darth Vader lives of course because he goes on into the other star wars.In my opinion this is the second best star wars movie. I think the sixth one is the best only because i like the people who act in it better no offense to Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen. definitely watch it, its a must see movie."
2747,10,Beyond brilliance,"All righty then. I was really nervous that Revenge of the Sith would flop, like the other prequels (I personally revered them). But, I had never been blown away in intensity, compassion, romance, evil, as many words you want to use, this film, in my great opinion, has them all. I haven't cried in many movies, but Sith made me bawl. Seeing the transition of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader was just completely overwhelming. I myself when watching the original three, thought Vader was the most evil. But watching his background and he himself thinking what he was doing was right...and doing it all to save the love of his life, was just so remarkable and outstanding. Brilliant plot. It tore through you and really made you think. I had to lie down afterwards from all of the intensity and profound deepness to recap my ruminations and thoughts toward this wonderful movie. For a movie to have such a great affect on you like that is worth seeing. That is the greatest accomplishment any director should need. The performances were outstanding as well. Mr. Hayden Christensen's performance in the last prequel, Attack of the Clones, was weak...but here he catapulted into captivating the pain and suffering of Anakin Skywalker. I was blown away. Natalie Portman's passion during the film was also very remarkable. The special effects topped it off as well. You were there. You could feel everything. That is worth seeing."
2748,8,JarJar Binks silent at last,"Yes, fans of JarJar are going to be disappointed that he has just a couple of walk on parts and NO SPEAKING."
2749,9,Brilliant,"It seems to me that many people have made up their minds about this film long before they've viewed it. While I've only seen one negative review of the film, several individuals insist that it's terrible, and without any good reason. Here are some good reasons- "
2750,8,Overly complicated but enjoyable,Looking at this film and the first trilogy you can't help notice a simplicity about the first three and also how the first three where more human.
2751,4,Bad writing leads to shoddy acting,"I thought the dialog was terrible. The first half hour of the movie, Ewin MacGregor (sp) seems to be playing it all for laughs."
2752,10,Best Star Wars film for me,Unbelievably emotional. The drama will drag anybody in and the score is perfect as expected. The action sequences are also very good
2753,10,the best in the star wars saga,"After seeing this film twice in the theaters, I became a Star Wars fan. "
2754,10,I feel sorry for those who won't let themselves like this movie.,"In my honest opinion was absolutely the best of the prequels and ranks up there with ANH and ESB. Of course, nostalgia often paints most of our thoughts of EP 4-6 whether we want to admit it or not. These movies were written as homages to the often thought to be cheesy B-movie serials of the 40s, the movies George Lucas watched as kid on the weekends. They are not meant to be Shakespeare or ""The Godfather"" in the writing or dialogue department. Lucas recently called himself the ""King of Wooden Dialogue."" and has pointed out in ""Making of"" books that he writes his Star Wars dialogue to be ""old-fashioned, melodramatic, and pretty corny."" Lucas has re-made those old type serials with better effects and added mythical elements. Anyone expecting Shakespeare or something anywhere near that just does not understand what these movies are about. We live in an era when we can see great Special Effects films about every weekend, something that was not so in 1977 or the early 80s. So now great effects are not longer considered a novelty. Honestly, would have A New Hope packed the theaters if the effects were non-groundbreaking or considered bad for that time? No way! Go into EP3 ready to enjoy yourself, lighten up and have a good time, I sure did and I feel sorry for those who didn't. From everything I have read on here and the web, it seems about 8 out of 10 people either liked or loved this movie. I hope you do too. Don't let the near 20 percent of people who didn't like this movie get to you."
2755,2,...and the taste of the public gets lower and lower and lower...,"In 1977 as i was 10, i went to the cinema, my father besides me, and we were witness of a scifi - fantasy becomes reality. It was great fun and some kind of magic. As i was older, i realise that the acting of the cast was not worth an Oscar, but it fits to what the story wants. A few years later, i saw the best scifi-movie so far ""The Empire strikes back"", a real masterpiece, based on but not directed by George Lucas. It was a milestone in SciFi - History. The third one struggles with the claim between a serious intended scifi-adventure and a childfitting teddybear-movie. A callow mixture that leaves a flavorless aftertaste. As like the Alien-Trilogy i thought, three parts are enough, the vertex is reached. Then in 1999, Mr. Lucas surprised us with the first part of the story, and for me it was like part VI but with sophisticated sfx. The second part was like a ripped off part of a memo, fast sketched and totally overloaded with sfx. Not bad, but not very good. To much visuals, to less story. But this third part is a deliberate insult in acting and storywriting. It just shows how blunted in the meantime the public became, that they were choosing this movie into the top 250. No heart, no soul, just visual garbage. Happy Merchandising..."
2756,10,"Best ""Star Wars"" film ever",I am a huge fan of the entire Star Wars saga but this is certainly the best one that has yet been made.
2757,10,Revenge of George Lucas,"I felt that this was the Star Wars movie that I've been waiting for since the prequels were announced. Anakin's descent into Darth Vader and his subsequent betrayal of Obi Wan, murder of Padme and immolation were heartbreaking to watch. Sure this movie had some bumpy dialog but no star wars movie is without it (in a New Hope...does anybody remember 'but I was gonna go to tashis to pick up some power converters) Visually this was dazzling, the lightsaber fights represented the high water mark of the Jedi and were flawlessly paced/executed. Sidious' plot to overthrow the Jedi which has been brewing since Phantom Menace proved itself to be worthy of the uber sith lord."
2758,6,"The Lucas Effect, but still an improvement","It was undoubtedly the best of the three prequels, that much was very clear. It's being hailed by people everywhere as being almost on par with the original trilogy - which is definitely over the top, they aren't even in the same league - but definitely a big improvement. It was much darker and placed much more emphasis on the plot and the chain of events that led to the downfall of both Anakin Skywalker and the Republic with key philosophical lines interwoven to show the why as well as the how. Some good acting performances with improvements from everyone, better gags and better plot. Unfortunately it still had the superficial character development, abysmal dialogue and excessive special effects."
2759,1,Nooooooooooooooooooo!,"The acting and the dialogue are awful. The script completely lack any logic. The human actors were poorly integrated into the special effects, which made the special effects seem like a video game. Sam Jackson gives an awful performance, which consists of looking very serious at all times and speaking in a condescending tone. The viewer is pulled out of the movie whenever he's on screen. The plot makes no sense. Lucas shows no respect for the laws of the universe he's created. Different characters appear to play by different rules for no apparent reason. This movie will age incredibly poorly, just like the other two prequels."
2760,10,The Best Star Wars,"CAST: Hayden Christenson, Ewen McGregor, Ian McDirmond, Natalie Portman, Frank Oz, Jimmy Smits, Samuel L. Jackson, Kenny Baker, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels."
2761,8,I liked this movie,"I don't know why a lot of people are complaining about this movie. I really liked it and more to the point my 6 year old nephew saw it and loved it. (He is a big General Grievous fan!) I am a girl (obviously) and I loved Episodes II and III because of the love story. I hated Episode I because of the long and boring pod race and Jar Jar Binks. I also really liked Episodes 4-6, the original trilogy even though I didn't see them until I was in junior high school because I didn't want to be a geek like my brother. Anyway, back to the movie, I loved the guy who played Chancellor Palpatine, he was the best actor in the whole thing and Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor were good. I think that people should just lighten up about this movie and find another hobby if it bothers them too much."
2762,9,It's okay to be a Star Wars fan again!,"Hold up! I didn't really like the first two new episodes (just like many of you), but after seeing this one...I'm won back over. The best star wars since Empire Strikes Back. Yes, of course this movie has bad acting and BAD DIALOGUE, but none of the star wars movies exactly excel in this category anyways. After seeing this movie, i went back and saw most of the other episodes as well. I've gotten to appreciate Episode I and II a little bit better after seeing this movie. Both movies mean a lot more when put into context and not having ridiculous expectations. I'm tired of film critics and snobs that pick apart the star wars movies. This isn't the godfather or citizen kane. I like indie and highly polished dramas too, but these are MOVIES, not FILMS. The 6 movie saga has finally been completed! The star wars saga are the best popcorn-movies ever made. Anakin Skywalker's story is so epic. The moral is finally clear. All of us have a choice between pleasing ourselves or making sacrifices for a greater good. Anakin had the choice, Luke had the choice, all of us have the choice. Although these movies are jazzed up with special effects, the main characters are no different from the imperfect people of the world--confused about destiny and the meaning of life, but wanting to do what they believe is right (even though everyones perception of what is right and what is wrong can be drastically different)."
2763,10,This Star Wars movie is only second to Empire Strikes Back!,"As far as the Star Wars universe goes many were disappointed with the way the last two movies turned out (Episodes I and II). For me though I really enjoyed the last two, and was really looking forward to this one despite whatever the critics had to say about it. I must say I was not disappointed in the least, the story was out of this world, and even though you knew what was going to happen before it happened it still kept me watching."
2764,9,Dark and very intense,"This is defiantly the best installment of the prequels and I will say it goes on par with ROTJ! I've seen it two times at a digital screening already and the CGI and the effects are just IMPRESSIVE! Defiantly the best ones I've seen yet in a movie! The acting of Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen and Ian McDiamired have really improved since Attack of the Clones."
2765,10,Movie of the year.,"Stop your complaining, belly aching, and theatrics you nay-sayers. People are so cynical these days. ""Oh, it's so awkward, it's stilted (what does that even mean?), it's horrible, it RUINED Star Wars for me, I hate George Lucas...do I fit in now? Am I part of a new rebellious I hate everything scene?"" People are so quick to latch on to something they think is new and innovative. Like LOTR, which ROTK won (somehow) 11 academy awards. Really it you would think about it ROTK isn't deserving of so many awards, it's like saying the newest King Kong should win 11. While SW (movies that generate a huge fan base, and do things never before conceived receive no awards, not even for costume design or art direction."
2766,9,Star Wars Episode III,"After the horrible acting in ""Phantom Menace"" and clumsy love story in ""Attack of the clones"" the ""Revenge of the Sith"" is the prequel installment we've all been hoping for all along it was good and it made being a star wars fan cool again."
2767,10,A moment in history,"I was not going to to comment on any of the Star Wars movies because to me the prequels could have gotten the worst rating and I would say the movie was kick ass!!!! But I thought that I have this account GO FOR IT. For starters this movie was KICK ASS.... I love the way Lucas has entertained me once in again in the best movies of all time. When I left the theater I was left in utter amazement as I did as a young boy 9 years old when I saw the first Starwars movie. the flow of the action was just as bit as good as it was in 1977. In the scene when young Skywalker becomes Vader I remember feeling sorrow because Anikain was such a kind and loving boy that was tortured by the darkside and I remember my mind wandering to the scene when Vader tells Luke to join him to the dark side Lucas has done such an incredible job with all these movies except and I am thankful Idid not have to deal with it in ROTS is JAR JAR BINKS. He definitely must be the most hated character in this saga and the poor fella just stumbled his way into the story. I hope I can make it to my 70TH am I am sitting in front of my TV watching some kind of digital or or other technology and the Saturday afternoon is any one of the trilogy starwars and I am sitting with the same sense of amazement and I will yell out THIS MOVIE KICK""S ASS so all of you who are still around me can here me. THANK_YOU GEORGE LUCAS :)"
2768,6,Revenge of the Mind-numbing Invetability,"Well the summary says it all... it's everything you expect it to be. It ties up all the loose ends for the fan-boys (although I'm sure they'll spend hours finding some loose ends to find and discuss on some internet forum somewhere). Keeping the die-hard fans happy seems to be the motivation behind the movie, although I think that's an impossible task seeing as people have spent decades fantasizing over what the first 3 episodes should have shown, and are bound to be let down to some extent."
2769,4,worth the wait - ?,While I was desperate to see this film I have to admit I left feeling disappointed. I don't think that this film faired much better than the previous two in this trilogy for the reasons I will list below.
2770,9,"Star Wars Episode 3, the movie that was meant to be","There is no way in the world that someone could possibly write a 'spoiler' for this movie, as the end result is already known to all those of you who haven't been living under rocks since the 1980's. However as the old proverb goes, ""it is not the destination, its the journey"" and what a journey! Star Wars Episode 3 offers viewers what each offering has done before it, escapism. No matter what was going on before watching it, you become immersed in the atmosphere and picturesque surroundings. Perhaps this is the true 'force' of the movies."
2771,6,I loved you!,"""You were the chosen one!"" ""I loved you!"" Two best lines in the entire series, my actually rating is 5.5/10. I'm glad Obi-Wan getting his own show because my god he carried in prequel series and he deserve better. Still so cringy stupid robot and goofy character moments that should have been cut out. And some odd dialogue at moments that felt stale but better than the previous two. I like the dark tone it definitely spice things up made it more serious with high stakes."
2772,10,The Story of Anakin,I had high expectations before going to see this movie. I left in awe and wound up thinking about what I had seen for days and even weeks to come. George Lucas has made what is by far the greatest Star Wars movie of the series. You can argue all you want about sequels and what he could have done but in my opinion he could not have made this movie any better. It was perfect.
2773,5,Extremely lackluster film,"Like the rest of the prequel trilogy, this movie is quite weak, showing Lucas to be incompetent. It is amazing that the same man did the first three Star Wars movies twenty five years ago, as these movies are universally worse."
2774,10,Unhappiness leads to the Dark Side,"Believe it or not, I cried at the end of the film. Episode III is the hardest and most cruel movie I've ever seen. At the soundless finale I had the feeling I was in that coffin. There are many cruel films but none creates such sense of suffering as this one."
2775,3,Did they take more doubles until ALL the actors got it wrong?,"I am a fan of the Star Wars series. But this one made me think that the director was patient enough to take enough doubles (easier with a digital camera) until all the actors were bad enough. Even Samuel L. Jackson managed to suck here! Which I had considered to be impossible. I am disgusted, but the best actor in the movie was Joda."
2776,1,Better than Battlefield Earth! Worse than anything else. :-(,"From 1977 a Star Wars fan until yesterday. Still, rube that I am, I will probably buy the DVD to complete the series. Nonetheless, this film fits comfortably in my personal list of worst ten films seen."
2777,4,The applause and laughter tells a worrying story...,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan I couldn't wait for the latest (and apparently) last installment to open... I took a deep breath, put The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones out of my mind, discarded the sour memories of CG Jabbas and Greedo shooting first and took the plunge."
2778,10,Best of them all!,"This movie was brilliant. The acting was much better compared to Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace. Christsensen did a good job portraying the confused Anakin, and Portman was fine as well. The real ""steal of the show"" was Ian McDiarmid playing Chancellor Palpatine. He conveyed his true character through subtle words and facial expressions, and his acting was superior to most of the other actors. There were several things that could have been fixed however: the whole movie seemed somewhat rushed. Most of the dialog between Anakin and Padmé wasn't quite what you'd call great either. Padmé also wasn't as strong and independent as she has been in previous movies. Instead, her scenes are all shot in the same place for a good part of the movie, making it seems as though she never leaves. But overall, it is the ending all Star Wars fans have been waiting for. The whole movie is well done. A brilliant ending to a brilliant saga."
2779,10,"It isn't perfect, but it's darn close.","There is a reason we all waited and had faith in George. It comes true with III. Let the critics pick it apart or hail it. Let the geeks ""find"" the flaws and snark about a missing link or two. But the movie going public has sent a message with a half-billion dollar first week to all the nay sayers. Yes, half-billion in the first week world wide. "
2780,10,"Raised on Star Wars, and now back in love with the series!!!!","At my ripe old age of 1 month old the first Star Wars movie hit the theaters. Since that time I was raised on the first 3 films and considered them my favorite movies. When I first heard that PREquels were to be made, I was a bit disappointed simply because I believed that George Lucas bit off more than he could chew. At the time I was disappointed with Phantom Menace however found Attack of the Clones decent. Now that I have seen ROTS I like the first two much better, because they are needed to tell the story. Revenge of the Sith is by far my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it twice and still want to see it again. The continuity of the series is pretty darn good with this new addition and if you sit and think about the series as a whole it is breathtaking. You have all of your classic archetypes and themes of forbidden love and the fallen hero. However I was torn while watching ROTS. I loved watching it and yet it hurt to watch it because it is the ultimate tragedy. I felt for Anakin, I empathized with him and my heart practically broke free of my chest when the mask was first donned. Chancellor Palpatine is fantastic!!! And even my disappointment at Samuel Jackson's acting in the 2 previous movies was tempered by his better acting in this one. I have never watched a movie that has made me think about it for so long after watching it. It is truly a phenomenon. The political warning found in the movie is a very important reminder in our modern era as well. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!"
2781,10,I loved this movie,"I loved this movie. I watched it two times at the movie theater and wanted to see it again. It tied up loose ends. Things you have always wondered about but never had the answers too. I think the special effects were great. I think Hayden was great as Anakin. I wasn't much of a Star Wars fan until I watched TPM, AOTC, & ROTS. I will always think these movies are much better than the original ones. There is much more romance in these movies. The fight scene between Anakin and Obi-wan was great. I could feel the emotion. You understood the conflict that was in Anakin a bit more. You see he is not as heartless as you think. I loved Hayden and Natalie as Anakin & Padme. They really made these two characters believable. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out. This movie made Anakin/Darth Vader more human. I loved the end which surprised me. Good Job George Lucas. It was a great ending to a great series."
2782,6,Lucas Had a Hard Task Set Out for Himself,"There has always been a fundamental difficulty for the three Star Wars prequel episodes: most fans know how it ends. The challenge with any prequel is to provide enough additional material and a strongly independent story line if one hopes to do more than create an extended prologue. Alas, even in the culmination of this second trilogy, Revenge of the Sith, we have precisely that: an extended prologue. The movie ends with precisely the things in place which which most fans are expecting to be in place, and no more: no little twists, no extra steps we don't know about, no treating this story on its own terms. The movie exists to establish the universe of the second (earlier-produced) trilogy."
2783,10,The Saga ends at the beginning,"This time I walked away thinking, this movie kicked ass, thanks G.L for not confusing me with another love/hate prequel. Obi Wan Kenobi is superb in this movie, he shines and makes the transition to Episode 4 as Lukes guardian on tattoine."
2784,5,"its the last, but not the best.","First of I'd say that I'm a pretty big Star Wars fan. There are a lot of things that I really liked with this movie, but at the same time there were a lot of thing that I really didn't like with it. The whole movie moved too fast, instead of focusing on certain pivotal points there were several different things thrown in some of which didn't need to be in the movie at all. I would have much rather had some of the battle scenes be longer, rather than several different battles happen one right after another. Don't get me wrong though this movie did have a lot of amazing and good scenes, but all and all it is definitely not the best Star Wars movie to date."
2785,8,By stats this film should be in the lower side of the top 250,"First off I saw this film about a week after it came out and enjoyed it personally. I thought the fight scenes were very cool and the last battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is well done. Lava world was a little too CGI though and that says a lot. John Williams is awesome, he is truly a genius at doing the score to these films. Now for my point cause I got to write 10 lines *shrugs* I looked at the top 250 and there were some films that had a 7.8 with only 3,000 votes and they are on there. Star Wars has well over 50,000 votes and some change and it has a 7.9.. Who know s the answer to why it isn't there. I actually don't see a point in a 250 anyway in some ways but it should be there from the stats. "
2786,10,Absolutely excellent film,"Went to see Revenge of The Sith first time at UCI in Huddersfield at half past midnight on the day of its release, it was lucky I booked the next day off because I just couldn't sleep afterwards. Many put the movie up against the original trilogy but the comparisons are tinged with nostalgic memories when we were young, if the originals were released now as completely new the children of today would find they lacked the awesome power of CGI they are used to. The battle with Yoda and Palpatine was out of this world and watching Mace Windu kick the chancellors arse kept me on the edge of my seat, if it wasn't for Anakin he wouldn't have stood a chance. The battle with Obiwan and Annakin at the end brought the movie to fever pitch and I can fully understand why Obiwan let Annakin to burn and suffer without mercy killing after destroying all the Jedi at the temple including the younglings. In my humble opinion this movie is far better than Clones or Menace and gives a understanding to how things were the way they were in the classic star wars we have all come to love."
2787,10,Best episode of the new trilogy!,"I have seen this movie in an early screening show and since 17-5-2005 I have seen it 3 times more:) sure I am a fan, sure I love whatever GL creates but who cannot love revenge of the sith! I am maybe pathetic but I had tears appear in my eyes during the emotionally very intense Jedi massacre scenes!"
2788,10,You did it George!!,"Finally! Lucas was able to fulfill his destiny and achieve a work of a lifetime. Revenge of the Sith is without a shadow of doubt the best film of the second trilogy. A real masterpiece that seconds only Episode V Empire strikes back. Now we all realize to the REAL power of the Dark Side!!! It seems to me that George somehow forgot the formula of Star Wars after so long. The first two episodes (the Phantom Menace and Clone Wars)were not at the same level as the first trilogy. Although they were good, they lack something that was the intensity of the main characters. Now! In Revenge of the Sith that intensity is back. Maybe that is another ability only achievable by the dark side of the Force."
2789,3,Good but not great,"Compared to the other 5 movies in the series, this is clearly the best. The special effects are fantastic and that is certainly the highlight."
2790,1,Stupid lame ending spoils the whole movie,WARNING! THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! Why did George Lucas have to spoil an otherwise fairly good movie by putting such a lousy ending in it? This was supposed to be the darkest of all the Star Wars movies. It should have ended with the camera zooming in on Darth Vader's face so that it would finally take up the whole screen. The last sound should have been the sound of his breathing and the ominous music we are accustomed to hear when Darth Vader is around. That would truly have been shock and awe and a worthy ending to the 6 series saga.
2791,9,Right up there with A New Hope and Empire,"As a big Star Wars fan there's no doubt that the last two installments of the Star Wars Trilogy have been disappointing. I'm glad to say that Sith, The Final installment of the historic Star Wars franchise, is one of the best. From beginning to the end I was on the edge of my seat. Intense star-fighter scenes and some of the best lightsaber duels are seen in this movie,which means non-stop action and fun. The sub-par acting and not-so perfect dialogue should'nt make a difference as this has never been the strong point in all the previous films. But while most of the acting was below par,Ian Mcdiarmid turned in a brilliant performance in his role as the evil, controlling Palpatine. And the scene we've all been waiting for, Anakin becoming Vader, delivers. In the end ROTS is dark and depressing, but very satisfying for Star Wars fans and non-fans alike. 9/10"
2792,9,That's the end of the story,"The third episode of the Star Wars saga is also the third in my heart. As a child I grow up as a fan, as a matter of fact, the first movie I saw at a theatre was The Empire Strikes Back at the early age of 4. "
2793,10,Revenge of the Prequel Trilogy,"""Revenge of the Sith"" is a film that I had eagerly anticipated since seeing ""Attack of the Clones"" back in 2002, and after a long 3 years of waiting I have to say that ""Sith"" did not disappoint."
2794,1,Revenge of the Who Cares,"Like passing a car accident, I knew Revenge of the Sith would be a disappointment but I knew I had to see it. It was as I expected."
2795,7,Movie vs. Book,"Personally I was disappointed that the movie Revenge of the Sith left out some very important details about certain characters, and the emotional struggles involved that they elaborated on in the book."
2796,7,It could have been better..,"First of all, I'm not a big fan of the star wars saga. But I do watch all of the movies. What I say about Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith ? It's not a bad movie, it was good enough. I mean it did give us the revelation of our big curiosity about what had happened to Anakin, that could turned him into such evil. However, it doesn't give me a thrill when I found out what really happened.. I sort of think, that the reason wasn't quite dramatic as I would expected. There's nothing new, I've seen that similar reason in many movies I've seen. But hey... it's an old plot, it was developed in ... the 80s (is it... ?), that kind of plot might have been a new idea back then, but now... it's a common plot for me... Not that it was a bad plot, I just.. expecting something more, like when I was first impressed by the twisted ending on Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"", it was a quite uncommon plot back then. And considering this saga has a lot of fans, well... I could only say, ""It could have been better.."""
2797,10,Lucas delivers.,"Everything we hoped for! It links beautifully with the original series. And by the way Ian McDiarmid rules this movie. His Palpatine excess everything else, evil or not. What a disturbing presence, you'll get terrified by this guy. Very little Jar Jar Binks too, thanks a lot Mr Lucas. The sound design is astonishing and the effects are cool. You can actually see bodies flying when the explosions goes off. And general Grievious...he's bad. A mean one. This is also John Williams great conclusion. The soundtrack rocks, with all the famous themes all rolled into one. It's really and opera, no question about it. Great work, some really cool stuff."
2798,6,Very bad acting,I would have thought with all the previous films that the script would have been better. Even with a bad script the actors could have done a better job of delivering the lines. I don't understand 10s and 9s other than the die hard Star wars fans are so desperate for more movies that anything will get a 10.
2799,5,It's all a bit average really,"Well, on the plus side, its not boring and its certainly not as bad as ATTACK OF THE CLONES. There aren't as many mawkish love scenes or whining from 'Anni,' although there's still too much of that for the films own good. Christensen's performance has gone from terrible to annoying (he's bad, just in a different way), but then no-one is much good in the film. They're just there to link the computer effects sequences that Lucas is really interested in."
2800,8,"Good, but...","I'm a fan, not a die hard fan, but a fan, this final piece in the Star Wars Saga is in my point of view the best, not for the special effects, yet they are incredible, finally George Lucas made a story, that ties all the lose ends together created by The Phantom Menance and keeps the film moving (a problem in the other 5, sometimes."
2801,9,fantastic!!!,"This film is by far the best of all 6 episodes. I think the special effects and costumes were brilliant. Lucas really has done himself proud! I thought it was an emotional and touching script, perhaps a little over-dramatic in parts but very well done. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor are a great team and act well together. Christensen particularly, did a fantastic job. Natalie Portman played a very moving part too and I think she did a good job. The fighting scenes were very well done and I noticed that there are many more fighting scenes in this film than there are in any of the others. They just create a sense of excitement!! This movie is unmissable and all i can say is GO AND SEE IT!!!!"
2802,9,The Grand Finale,The final episode of the Star Wars series. We hoped the best and feared the worst. Did the movie fill the empty hole made by EP 1 & 2? From my point of view: Definitely.
2803,10,May the force be with us all. Absolutely brilliant,"Having been an ardent fan of the original trilogy, I was rather disappointed with both Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, It felt like I was just waiting and waiting for those films to kick in but it just never did. With Revenge off the Sith, Lucas has created a dark, moving and action packed conclusion to his space opera saga. The film starts off at breakneck speed and doesn't seem to let go. Everything fans love have been included here, frantic light sabre battles, Yoda doing his thing once more, the transition to the dark side (very tragic), its all here. To say that this film is dark is an understatement, memories of Empire Strikes back come to mind where things don't go entirely for the good guys but as Revenge of the Sith comes to an end, there is that nice feeling in the back of your mind that there is indeed a new hope on the horizon."
2804,10,The saga has been completed well!,"Before I went to see the last Star-Wars, I had heard many comments of the movie that it was really bad. Also I had heard that the film was excellent. I agree with the latest comment. The film was really perfect! I've been a Star-Wars fan all my life and I had my own hopes for the last film, and all of them came true. This was definitely the most emotional of the six films. There were some VERY tragic moments in the film. George Lucas did well in this film. Everything is perfect. The acting (specially Ewan McGregor's), the sound, the visual effects (are really beautiful and genuine), the music (beautiful), the editing and the best of all... the script was so amazingly wrote, that it fits perfectly with the beginning of episode IV. I have to say it is definitely one of the best action-drama films I've ever seen. In fact, one of the best films I've ever seen! Thanks to George Lucas for giving this great saga."
2805,10,amazing!,"Now i am no star wars fanatic but i thought this film was brilliant. i've seen films 4 5 and 6 and thought they were fantastic and couldn't wait for 1st 2nd and 3rd to come out. But when the 1st and 2nd came out I was hugely disappointed. I thought the acting was rubbish, even from those who I admire such as Ewan Mcgregor, they had some of the most annoying characters to ever be on screen and they did not do the stories justice. so when it came to seeing the 3rd film i was a bit dubious, worried that they would ruin any kind of good reputation they had left. However with this film George Lucas has redeemed himself and proved what an amazing film maker he is. 10 out of 10, this film is spectacular! The acting is amazing, even from Hayden Christensen, who I couldn't stand in the 2nd film and the graphics are out of this world!I advise anyone who has enjoyed the other films to go see it, you wont be disappointed!"
2806,4,The Best of the Worst in the Star Wars Saga,"The first Star Wars movie in the prequel trilogy that actually feels like a Star Wars movie, only in look, but not in tone . This movie still has bland acting, dull characters and story flaws. The long lightsaber fight at the end seems more like a 20 minute dance off than an actual fighting scene with characters we are (supposed to be) emotionally invested in. The story seems rushed, especially Anakin's turning to the darkside. I find it hard to believe that the thought of losing Padme was enough to get Anakin to go on a murderous rampage and start killing children. The fact that no one can see that Palpatine is the master of all the evil in this movie is jarring and it makes all the characters seem stupid, but this is due to very bad writing on Lucas' part."
2807,10,Star wars Episode 3 is officially the best movie ever made,"Star wars episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is the greatest movie ever made. for those who haven't watched it, you are definitely missing out. It is a must see movie. I watched it 3 times while it was in cinemas and i never got sick of it. I love it... especially the action! i don't want to put in any spoilers, so i will refrain and say only that the action near the end was amazing and totally awesome. I also enjoyed the acting, special effects and overall the atmosphere of it all. Revenge of the Sith is the best of the whole star wars saga (although all of them are good) definitely 10 out of 10. No movie could possibly compare to this... no, not even lord of the rings. Thankyou George Lucas and cast for a fantastic and much enjoyed movie."
2808,9,"Well, its been 25 years!","After being bombarded with 2 previously lacking in taste Star Wars films, George Lucas makes up for it all in the final installment of the saga,Star Wars episode III: Revenge of the Sith. The movie starts out a little bye bye birdy-esquire but soon finds its ground, and delivers what all Star Wars nerds, I mean fans have been waiting for; the unveiling of the ultimate cosmic bad ass Darth Vader. This movie is nothing short of action packed, the only lacking spots I could conjure up were in the first grade dialouge , which is overpowered in the intense battle sequences, and over all good quality. This movie delivers in depth what we all have been pondering over; such as how and why does Anakin turn to the dark side, and how does Luke and Leia come about. All in all a film that shouldn't be ignored."
2809,10,Just about perfect!!!,"As I said, it's just about perfect! Finally Episodes I and II make more sense and the gap is mostly bridged between the two trilogies. No unnecessarily lame jokes from C-3P0 (like in Ep. II), not a word from Jar Jar Binks (who I kind of liked but was awfully incessant with his banter in Ep. I), no childish dialogue (like ""Can I go, mom? Yippee!"" in Ep. I), none of that. Just pure, unadulterated tragedy, angst, and action, mixed with hope for the future and much better dialogue. It will make you want to watch Episodes IV-VI really badly. Honestly, I would rank it as my number two favorite, second only to Episode V, ""The Empire Strikes Back"". That's if I'm playing favorites at all. Mostly I just prefer to think of them as one very long movie (or two very long movies, if you split up the trilogies). Anyway, go see it right away if you haven't already, just be prepared for a very sad, tragic movie that ends with everything going to hell. And remember, hope awaits in Episode IV, ""A New Hope""."
2810,10,A very good ending to a long saga,"I thought this was an excellent film. All of the scenes were put into place in a rather superb way. Even though I did not get overly excited about the film like some fans of the series did, I could certainly understand why this film has done so well. Although the storyline was very good, it was the action sequences that did it for me. I think that the best scenes involved the fight between the chancellor and Yoda, as well as the lava/saber fight between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. I also loved the way they added in the special effects. They really made the backgrounds interesting. I really do agree with other people when they say that this is the best film of the series. It would be nice if there were still more Star Wars films to be made, though."
2811,9,Premiere of Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith,"I saw the premiere yesterday, and it was fantastic. This was the last episode of all six. And i think George Lucas has given everything he could use in this movie. One negative point of the movie was the script, i think anakin turned to fast into Darth father. Also the acting is better since 1 and 2. But still it wasn't good enough, but the last scenes made everything good. Too link this movie to the first one (4), he (George Lucas) had done a perfect job. The screens with the computer animation background are on a extreme high level. The Lord of the Rings was a joke, but this one. George Lucas has given many viewers in the whole world, a great movie that deserves to be in the Top 10 on IMDb, which it is now. Another think i saw yesterday, and i read on more forums, that when the movie started in the Cinema's, everybody suddenly started clapping, as a respect for the final piece, they did this too when the movie ended."
2812,9,The memory of Leia,"It is, with certainty, the best one of the three first episodes of the series Star Wars. The ingression of the spectator is well paid, since the incredible scenes of combat, that had surpassed in very already produced; until so waited transformation of Anakin Skywalker in Darth Vader. I find that George Lucas closed with gold key the series. However, a thing was badly explained for me. Padmé senator dies in the birth of Luke and Leia, however, in episode VI has a scene where Léia says the Luke that has a vacant souvenir of its mother. Thus, or George Lucas slid in the narrative of the history of the Saga, creating this vacuum. Or Léia is the person of better memory of that already it was said... Sorry will be of bad English."
2813,10,George Lucas deserves a pat on the back from EVERYONE,"I would like to say that Revenge of the Sith was an excellent movie. Outstanding actors, John Williams at his best as well as George Lucas, and a very great story to end the saga of Star Wars. "
2814,8,"Besides a bad beginning and some corny lines, pretty good...","I had been pumped for the opening of this movie. I even made my own lightsaber hilt (out of a flashlight and tin foil). Too bad I never got around to seeing it until about two months after it opened. I had been prepared to see the most amazing movie of my life. I had heard good and bad things about it, but mostly good. When I walked into the theater, I felt sad because this was going to be my last experience seeing a Star Wars movie in theaters, and excited because I was finally seeing the movie and I could now discuss this with my fellow Star Wars nerds."
2815,6,George Lucas has redeemed himself...,"That is the prevailing thought that I had exiting the theater after viewing Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the Sith. To fully understand that thought process, its important to note that I believe that, after revolutionizing the motion picture medium with Episode IV in 1977 and stepping away from the director's chair for what is the best movie in the series, Episode V, George Lucas the director has done much to run the franchise he created into the ground. Episode VI is good but not great largely because its more childish elements. Then, after a long hiatus, the first two prequels are an indication that Lucas was willing to forsake character and plot in order to get as many bright and shiny images on the screen. Lucas may be showing off just how much he could accomplish with technology, but, in the end, the thing he most succeeds in doing is proving that no amount of digital wizardry could adequately make up for brains or heart when telling a good story."
2816,1,The reason for the end of Hollywood,"This is one of the worst examples of movie-making I have seen - the whole screenplay is forced, with events happening ""on demand"" as if another 5 minutes of film would render the movie too expensive. Shots cut back and forth so frequently you don't know what's going on, in all fight sequences enemies, without fail, MAGICALLY die if they're needed to, in absolutely impossible situations in what I can only describe as ""feather fencing"" - however the hero always emerges the winner. The first half or so I just had to sit and try and distinguish between the good guys and bad for about 45 minutes. The brilliant dialogue also cannot fail to entertain: ""Anakin...... I cannot believe what I'm hearing...... you've joined the dark side""."
2817,9,A Dark Tour De Force,"I was really surprised. Finally Lucas had abandoned all the muppets, dispensed with the cuteness and made a down and dirty sci-fi flick. The fight scenes were great. Although I think General Grievous and Count Dooku could have put up better fights. Anakins transformation was believable and this is arguably the best of the series. Clearly the best hands down in the new series and possibly even of both series. Yes, maybe even better than Empire. The first two films of this series were sub-par. Its a shame they couldn't have been summarized in a Clone Wars cartoon, this would have saved some people a wait in long lines and brought us all straight to the main course instead of two poorly executed desserts. This film along with the original Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back clearly belong in the Sci-Fi cannon."
2818,5,Is this a comedy or an action movie,"OK, just a few little issues I have with this movie..."
2819,8,Good movie all around,"Storyline: Even though it tied up some loose ends leading up to the original trilogy, a little too much was given away. However, out of the new trilogy, this was the best written one by far."
2820,10,Perfect,"I think this movie is the movie of the year not just for the ending and connection of an 30 year old epic. The whole movie clicks superb, everything is building up the story for 4, 5 and 6. This is surely a 10/10. Both for the outstanding story of George Lucas (the king) and the beautiful worlds and space they've built."
2821,10,As good as it gets,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is one of the best movies I have ever seen. People who criticize it should be ashamed of themselves. It is always just human nature to try to criticize greatness, or whomever is in power. From the drum beats at the beginning, through the great action in much of the movie, the great light sabre battles, the turn to the dark side, feeling Yoda's grief as the Jedi are picked off by clones, to the perfect ending, which ties in perfectly with A New Hope, this movie rocks. Ten, ten and ten is all I have to say. Everyone should see it and you should go into the movie as you went in to Episode IV, with an open mind ready to enjoy, and not looking for something to complain about. Hats off to George Lucas for fulfilling the Star Wars legacy. And, despite what many say, Hayden Christensen did a great job. Relate his choices to choices you can make in life, and you will understand Episode II and III. May the force be with all of you,Travis"
2822,10,An Epic in every sense...and more,"Truly ground breaking in every sense, a technological marvel and cinematic treat for all true movie and Star Wars fans. This wraps up the Saga perfectly; bridging TPM and AOTC with the original trilogy. I didn't feel any little nagging sensations at the end or feel that there were any loose ends."
2823,10,Very dark...very good...,"I just wish that the first 2 movies had the same drive and energy of this one. Truly, the first 2 could have been only 1 movie from the beginning. And The attack of the clones could have started to explore more of the Dark Side of the force and how Anakin turned left the Jedi order. In this movie we couldn't help to cherish seeing Darth Vader again...sure he is the bad guy but he is the heart and soul of the six movies and to see back again...made the movie theater tremble. Although I'm not a great fan of Hayden/Natalie pair, the truth they were much more mature in this movie. Overall, I think this is the GREATEST of the first 3."
2824,9,A fitting end to the most illustrious saga in cinema history...,"There are certain epics, that leave their mark on cinema history. AThe day that ""Star Wars"" opened, everyone knew that something quite special had begun. Four more films followed until one was left, ""Episode III - Revenge of the Sith""."
2825,7,Meh,"It's definitely the best one of the prequels, but still not as good as the sequels."
2826,10,"Nothing ""sudden"" about Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader","After reading a number of reviews of this movie I felt compelled to add a bit about Anakin Skywalker. Many of the reviews seem to suggest that his descent into the dark side and his existence as Darth Vader is unrealistic, that after being so good how could he so quickly turn from that to the dark side? Let me point out that anger and darkness have been present in this character in all three prequels. In the first he lived as a slave, and this created in him an incredible sense of injustice, of anger. He loved his mother but had hatred for other things, for how they had to live."
2827,9,Lucas infuses grandeur and soul into Sith,"Awesome movie!!!! ""Sith"" does an amazing job developing the plot and incorporating the story lines of all 5 episodes. After seeing episode 1 and 2, I did not expect much out of ""Sith"", but I was pleasantly surprised and entertained by the superb graphics, the action, the storyline and the grandeur of this film. ""Sith"" is worthy of the respect given to the original trilogy especially New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Thank you, Mr. Lucas for getting back to your roots and making a quality film versus a studio driving money maker with no soul. Bravo! I cannot wait for the video. Video will give me the chance to see Yoda, Obi and Mace kick some butt."
2828,4,it's OK and thats all,"OK first I just want to clarify I am a Star Wars fan. Granted no movie will ever be perfect, but this one is far from it. I expected this episode to be dark and dismal, and to a point it was. It just seemed that the ""lets make this movie for kids"" aspect was in high gear. For starters is it absolutely necessary for every robot to speak in the movie no!! It's the constant talk from the droids that take away from the movie the entire time. Then there is R2-D2, that was just lame. Now lets move on to the Jedi. What the heck Mace Windu can sense a plot to destroy the Jedi, but hey lets not warn any of them or take any precautions. Then the way most of the Jedi die is unbelievable. Mace Windu gets punk-ed, Aayla Secura doesn't even draw her weapon (and that ticks me off because she best's aura sing and returns from the dark side), Ki-Adi-Mundi at least tried but goes down rather easily, Kit Fisto and two other Jedi get killed by Palpatine in under 5 seconds. I mean these are the Jedi right what happened? Then you have Yoda getting beaten like rag doll. Other characters like Padme just cry all the time (and this is the headstrong determined character from the first two movies) But the good does out way the bad. The circle is now complete and the whole story told. We now know way Obi-wan and Yoda Disappear when they die later on in the series(it turns out they are not related to the wicked witch of the west) We see why Palpatine is all disfigured and just how manipulative he is. Over all the visual aspect was nice but the backgrounds just a little to busy, the fight scenes where OK, but a little over the top. All in all there was a lot I would change through the movies including episodes 4,5,6, but hey there not my movies. So with the saga complete what can we say. Lets go the way the original Star Wars would have wanted it..... may the force be with you."
2829,1,as much as i liked star wars...,..this was crap.
2830,10,Good old Star Wars is back baby !,"This is grand finale, and it is grand alright. Battleships, aliens, Jedis, light sabers and the final chapter of the legendary Star Wars series!"
2831,,Why did Anakin turn to the dark side?: a tentative theory,I had trouble with Anakins seemingly easy conversion from protector of the innocent to slayer of and have come up with a theory that has partially satisfied some concerns I had.
2832,7,Guess what happens to Anakin at the end (there's a spoiler blacklist?!?),"I'd rather not give this movie any rating until I see it again, but I want to record my first impressions. There were moments when ""Revenge of the Sith"" bordered on greatness. I'm not a fan of computer animation (used excessively) yet the opening sequence has a thrilling kinetic energy, due as much to the editing as the effects, which can set the audience off-kilter, and let them briefly experience the adrenaline-fueled confusion that Anakin experiences, which will eventually lead him to the Dark Side. The other powerful moment is a scene in which Anakin stares out the window at the bustling world of Coruscant, contemplating his choice and his fate. The score hums ominously on the track, there is no dialogue (a huge plus in this movie), and we are immersed in the draw of the mystical Dark Side, calling Anakin home. Unfortunately, these scenes are somewhat rare. We all know the ending of the film and at times, because the action is robbed of suspense, it is easy to become distanced from the material. Quite a number of things were just as they should be: Obi-Wan & Anakin's climactic duel, Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader (which actually happens before his disfigurement), and then finally the entombment in Vader's suit (I didn't much care for the ""Nooooooooo!"" though--if you see the film you'll know what I'm talking about). But these events feel almost perfunctory because they're so inevitable. Maybe it was just me. But Revenge of the Sith offered tantalizing glimpses into Anakin's twisted soul, and to me that's more interesting and gripping that all the special effects in the world. I wish there was more of it. Palpatine is a fascinating character but McDiarmond has a tendency to ham it up, and this is especially true once the Chancellor becomes the Emperor. The romantic scenes, as we all know, are clumsily written, which is a shame because anything involving Natalie Portman should have the potential for tremendous chemistry. And I remain unconvinced that digital cinemascapes are the way of the future. When the film worked, it worked because of the ""neither here-nor-there"" quality of the special effects, NOT because they actually convinced you of a specific time and place. None of the worlds (save Coruscant which is supposed to be man-made anyway) are memorable, because the camera never lingers there; it sweeps over obviously artificial landscapes and swoops through big fights using digital characters--so we're never allowed to get a feel for a place, the way we could with Tatooine, Hoth, or Endor in the classic trilogy."
2833,4,Less of a Turkey,I grew up when the original movie came out but despite being a massive Sci-Fi fan I just didn't rate it or the two follow ups.
2834,8,"By far the best of the prequels, but not perfect","With the third prequel movie, Revenge of the sith, the starwars saga is finally complete and the gap between the old and the new trilogy is bridged. With this third movie, Lucas finally gives us a movie again that is GOOD, entertaining and even moving. There still are some flaws, but the overall impression is a good one."
2835,10,Outstanding movie (probably spoilers),"In reading other peoples reviews, I was somewhat perplexed. Almost everyone who gave this movie 7/10 stars or lower said, ""It's a good movie, but not as good as Empire Strikes Back"". Well, how many of those people saw The Godfather, and gave it 5/10 stars because ""It's not as good as Empire Strikes Back""? I'd guess none. If you compare this to Empire, or A New Hope, sure, it's not as good.. But it's damn close. This was MUCH better, IMHO than Return of the Ewoks.. er ... I mean Jedi. This entire movie had the same type of feel to it that Empire did.. Everything was dark, depressing, and, most of all, action filled. The only fault I could even conceive of giving this entire movie was that there was too much action. (almost inconceivable) The visual effects in this movie were to put it simply, breathtaking. And, the way Palpatine turned Anakin over to the dark side was not only believable, I actually wanted to go out and kill some baby Jedi's myself! (j/k) This movie is definitely one of my top 5 of all time. I could see myself in the theater multiple times for this movie. 10/10."
2836,1,The Worst Movie Of All Time,"Star Wars Episode 3 revenge of the Sith was maybe the worst movie i have ever seen, not because of the horrible script, not because of the horrible acting, but instead because everyone already knew what was going to happen. We already knew who would die, who would be born, so there was nothing new to learn which made it incredibly boring."
2837,,Overrated Star Wars,"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is a confusing film. It has many of the problems to the other Star Wars Prequels such as bad dialogue, acting, and line delivery. However, these flaws aren't nearly as prevalent as in The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. George Lucas went from two very flawed films into a less flawed film. This film has been getting a lot of attention and love recently and I think it is unwarranted. I believe they feel nostalgic from when they enjoyed it as children and didn't grow to see its flaws."
2838,9,Absolutely Great!!!!!!,"Don't worry this wont contain any spoilers!!!!!!!!! OK to make it plain and simple. I thought the Pantom Menace was at best OK. The Attack of the clones was good. (Even thought I must admit that I did appreciate the story line very much of both these films) But, Revenge of the sith was in my opinion up to par with the original 3 instalments. OK there is some laughable moments (dialog wise) from Padame. But this was just one of those experiences that makes you say. WOW in the end it was all worth it."
2839,6,Much better prequel with some faults,"While quite a bit better than the previous prequels, this STAR WARS still has some ""Grievous"" problems. I found a lot of the acting to be ""stunted"" and bland, and not compelling, particularly in the first half. These days it seems that special effects and lack of character development are the status quo. I still managed to make my way through the entire movie which I couldn't do for the last one. Other elements that bothered me were -why would a droid commander have a cough? Also, some of the old familiar characters like the Wookies are just thrown in for good measure. I miss the ""Harrison Ford"" romantic figures that seem like more realistic ""heroes"". I'll end this by saying that this one is definitely better than the previous, and I did like the tie-in to the original STAR WARS at the end."
2840,10,Action Packed,"Okay i went to the ""movies"" at 3:30 to wait for Episode III to begin at 6:30..AND IT WAS DEFIN8LY WORTH THE WAIT (i was the first in line)....the last 3 were always my favorite, but the first 2 were a bit lacking, the acting wasn't top notch, the emotions weren't targeted, and the story lines dragged. But now George Lucas has defin8ly given himself a name w/ this incredible master-piece!! Lucas finally achieved the perfect space film of our time, your emotions will be going off the wall, the acting has improved, and the plot is great. The whole time u watch it u will be making your own connections between the beginning 2 and the last 3. From the sadness to the applause, this is an all out gr8 movie! He really put enough time and effort to make this film complete the saga and end the series. My advise is, go out and see ""**STAR**WARS** Episode III Revenge of the Sith"" "
2841,5,a missed opportunity,"a few random thoughts about the movie, from someone who was 10 years old when episode 4 came out and saw it 8 times at the woodfield theater in schaumburg, Illinois..."
2842,5,"Mediocre, and quite disappointing.",What an endeavor! The culmination of a six-movie plot in the making over 27 years. 
2843,9,Excellent,"If you like Star Wars films and are not a complete geek,(Oh... how I hope so. They are wasting the movie in my opinion. Can anyone say: ""Get a life?"") You will see this beauty in this ever-convincing (if you're not a nerd,) movie. Sad as it is, some people think ""fantastically"" about Star Wars. Life as we know it will resume soon after Revenge Of The Sith is no longer new. Or so they presume? I have read, and frankly, am saddened by the nonsense being posted here. I wonder how many people have truly, without prejudice, shown their true colors, rather than spout off about dialog and plot holes, like why's the try(sic) - droid fighter Not blue???? OK, morons rule, but only for the moment folks. Anywho, if you like good entertainment, hop on The Revenge Of The Sith. Unless you're scared that is.. ;}"
2844,1,Vietnamese Prison Camp,"After watching this poor attempt at a film, I now know how Senator John McCain felt after leaving his cell at his P.O.W. camp. I am certain that Dale Earnhardt had a better time at the end of his last race at Daytona. I believe my quest as a citizen of America is to start a scholarship fund for George Lucas to return to college to learn how to properly write, direct, and produce a movie that doesn't belong in a San Fransican Bath House. Now on to Natalie Portman, your new job is waiting for her at the Bunny Ranch. Big foot has more of a right to be on film than her. Hayden Christensen's best role will always be Virgin Suicides, a well written piece. I feel bad for Sam Jackson, who killed his carrer with this. Jimmy Smitts and JarJar are the finest actors in the film."
2845,10,A Simply Excellent Movie.,I have given this movie 10 stars. I never give movies 10 stars.
2846,8,"Klimt repenting,","In a post-Trump world, the essence of the post-post-post-Ironic. moment is the admittance of the bankruptcy of the Senate. It is the purpose of this friendly reminder to recall that four times REALLY MEAN something. Having lost sight of the invisibility cloak that is Ironic. newspeak, we who were too nice to bother struggle to disagree with our internaL flame - the hopeless need to express yourself. Mashed potatoes are the top v1 course of non-action; the medicine is never at a standstill, it is morphing, subtly out of reach. The rest is Gungun."
2847,1,Craptastic,A movie this bad is insulting to its viewing audience. I'm still wondering how anyone found anything redeeming in it?
2848,9,Outstanding!,"I just saw the movie last night and I still have goosebumps from it! While nothing can compare to the wit and charisma of Episodes 4-6, Episode 3 certainly reclaims the character development and energy that the first two episodes lacked. "
2849,7,Lacluster movie,"This was the pinnacle of all the Star Wars movies and one of the ones that me and some friends most looked forward to. I'm not a major guru of Star Wars but my friend I went with was. And he completely disregarded to movie ever exists now because of how he was disappointed. But I like to look at things with an open mind and take heed of some things he mentioned. From the start of the movie it began with Count Dooku having less lines to say than the goofy droids later in the movie. As he has his own head chopped off my Anakin. It would have been nice for the Count to at least give some uncommon wisdom at that point or something, anything."
2850,7,"I'll accept this, but it still could have been better","This film is good, not great. However, I don't write many reviews of movies on IMDb, but I do feel compelled to write one for Episode III. Therefore, as always feel free to disagree with my comments on the film, they are merely opinion. I say this in advance because I know how some people can be very passionate about things they love... that's how I am with Empire Strikes Back."
2851,1,A truly under-appreciated step,"While this movie's lineage seems to be the lesser of the Star Wars universe, and even regarded by some as a snag on the beautiful tapestry that is the Star Wars franchise, I think there is a lot to be said for the Revenge of the Sith. This episode is the conclusion to the ""prequel"" Star Wars film line and obviously had a HUGE standard to meet, and I truly believe it does deliver in some aspects. The CGI was outstanding for the time; 2005 was no paragon of masterfully crafted computer generated images, but it definitely is passable and by no means distracts a viewer from the plot. The action sequences generated just enough rise out of the viewer to keep a certain level of excitement and heart rate."
2852,10,Incredible,"(possible spoilers) I walked out of this movie stunned. It was visually enticing, creative, and heartbreaking. There were points in the movie the action was so intense and fast that it was hard to keep up with. It did have it's comedic moments but they were all very well done (whoo-hoo R2)!! You get to see the droids (R2 and C3PO) become almost human in their actions. The most disappointing thing I can say?? Was I wish they would have done more with the Wookies. General Grievous started out with a kind of stance of who is this wimp of a guy? but that quickly turned around and he turned out to be a lot better of a bad guy. I still don't think some questions were answered, but hey that's star wars for you. As a whole though.. what a way to go!!! Awesome, totally freakin awesome! I can't wait to go see it again...."
2853,10,Absolutely bloody great,"I loved it. A great way to end the series. I am not one of the many who hate TPM and AOTC I like them for what they are, they are many things I don't like about them, for instance I find the most annoying thing about TPM, not Jar Jar Binks but Jake Lloyd. Anywya any passed transgressions are forgiven with Sith, go to the cinema and bask in Star Wars glory. Sure there are still some clunky bits between Anakin and Padme ( particularly the lovely Miss Portman who still can't do Star Wars) but they are quite few and far between. All the action and effects sequences are very well done but this is ILM we are talking about. All in all a great film but more importantly a great Star Wars film."
2854,1,Failure,"Having seen the horror of Episode 3, I think it is safe to say that George Lucas has truly managed to perform an act of cultural blasphemy."
2855,7,A Fitting Conclusion of the Star Wars Saga?,"OK...I just finished watching the movie, about 30 minutes ago. All in all, the movie was good,, at the same time, I do have some complaints. There are a couple parts in the movie that do not follow the storyline set in the original trilogy (I fear that I can not be more specific without giving away the ending). Another complaint that I have is that the dialog in the movie, especially that of Samuel L Jackson (Mace Windu) and Natalie Portman (Padme Amadala), seems somewhat weak...as if it was ""dumbed down""(for lack of a better term). I am a big Star Wars fan, having loved the movies for years, and followed the story further, through reading the books. This movie was no different, I enjoyed it quite a bit, but was saddened by the lapses in detail and dialog."
2856,10,Never been more excited going in and out of a theater!,If it wasn't the fanfare...the fact that I was with people I care about...and just the pure eye candy of the film: It was the fact that 28 years ago I remember being scared out of my 5 year old pants when Darth Vader first appeared on the screen. The anticipation I felt during this movie last night was like a child ready for his first roller coaster ride.
2857,10,just great:),it's just a great movie and it gets all the link with Episode IV. its a shame some off them are a little 2 easy 4 me like just erase C3PO's memory. 1 last little negative point Lucas gets rid off 1 off his lead players far 2 soon at least thats my opinion. but on the other hand the movie has some very funny parts with R2D2 again. I just love that.
2858,9,"Above Average, Not a killer","I'm not out to write a long review. I don't want to let anything slip that many of you are waiting to see. I'll only say this, I went to the first showing which was sold out and no one in the theater felt that it was worth losing the sleep and going to work groggy with bragging rights. "
2859,9,the 2nd best Star Wars movie ever,"Having heard so many people say that Return of the Sith (ROS) is better than the previous prequels, I said to myself that maybe it was. And they were right. In fact I think it's probably almost as good as Empire Strikes Back(ESB), which is one of the greatest movies of the modern era, if not the greatest. I think what keeps ROS from taking the top spot is the fact that it's not yet 20 years old and that unlike in ESB, George Lucas has got the technology and special effects to produce the marvelous show that we saw. ESB made up for it with a very strong and meaningful storyline, working wonderfully well as a dark tunnel than The Two Towers did for the Lord of the Rings trilogy."
2860,10,best movie ever,i think that this star wars is the best stars ever . i personal fell that George Lucas has done a really great job. it really shows what happen to an-akin well. this movie i think is the best in the saga. i give full credit's to all the cast and crew. who really did a great job.i give this movie 1o out of 1o. i could sit and watch it over and over again it is that good. well i get speechless when i think of the movie. it was done so well. the digital effect were amazing. i don't know what to say about the movie it is just prefect. i was waiting for this since i can remember. i love this movie so much and i am so glad that it turn out to be the best movie i have seen ever. i can't wait to buy the DVD.
2861,10,Natalie Portman on Revenge of the Siths,"The movie rocked!!! Its amazing how a movie can just transport you to another world full of different emotions. Natalie Portman as Padme was amazing, she really nailed it! She is an incredible actress. You could really feel the emotion and the sadness in her. The movie was sad and even though you knew what was going to happen you couldn't help praying for it to change. I know I had my finger crossed for Anakin not to turn to Lord Darth Vader. Because of this movie the original trilogy would have more sentimental. You can never see Darth Vader the same way. Its sad to know thats this is the end of the saga, but who knows... they did say the same thing last time. Cant wait to see Natalie in action again, she has been nominated for her work on Garden State, Closer and of course Star Wars: Revenge of the Siths. All incredible movies. Congrats Nat!!"
2862,8,redemption for Lucas?,"It's finally here the movie that Star Wars fans have been waiting for since 1977. Director George Lucas finally delivers the episode in the saga that tells the complete story of how Jedi Knight, Anakin Skywalker, turns to the dark-side of the force and becomes the evil Sith Lord, Darth Vader. There was a lot ""riding"" on this film for Lucas. Especially considering the critical reviews for the two previous installments in the saga. So, did Lucas deliver? Mostly."
2863,6,Too much Hype.,"Everything about this movie was Hype, from the commercials, the studios, and the local theaters. I went tonight at midnight, when it was available to be played for the first time."
2864,9,Brilliant!!!,"All that can be said is: This movie really takes the cake. All the questions finally answered, the little mysteries that have plagued fans for so many years are resolved, and we see that man can truly be driven evil by his own good emotions."
2865,10,Better finale than the first trilogy,"Star Wars Revenge of the Sith finally got it right. The finale to the prequel trilogy is not only way better than the first two movies but its better than Return of the Jedi. Sith is simply a much deeper story that Jedi was and Anakin just is much more complex than Luke ever was, he is ambitious and passionate and given the right set of circumstances could have easily become a great Jedi master and follower of the light unfortunately it was not to be. Even though we all knew the inevitable conclusion throughout it all we are still compelled to watch because the whole time he is constantly questioning himself and it looks as though at several instances like he might not turn to the dark side. Even after he takes down Mace he can't believe what he has done. I mean its hard to argue against Anakin laying there maimed and screaming ""I Hate you!"" at Obi Wan as he is burnt nearly to death and then on the other hand you have little people dressed up like teddy bears fighting storm troopers who by the way seem to be completely useless when compared to the clone armies used in these movies. Lucas finished off with some of his best story telling even with all of the special effects my only complaint would have to be the often campy lines that Ewan was forced to say as Obi Wan throughout the film. I also applaud Lucas for making this last film more adult, the pg-13 rating was really necessary to do it right and I'm glad that he didn't sacrifice some more intense scenes just so he could make a kids movie."
2866,4,well... i mean we still have the original trilogy. right?,"I gave Episode III 4 stars simply for the fact that their were some parts that made me smile as a star wars fan. Far and few but they were there. Like Darth's first mechanical breaths, or seeing some of the vehicles starting to resemble Original Trilogy battle technology. The biker scouts on the wookie planet looked really cool too. "
2867,9,What A Great Flik,"This Star Wars movie has become my favorite out of all of them. There was only a couple of things wrong. One is the little scene with Anakin and Padme on the balcony of their home exchanging some corny love lines and the other thing was Darth Vader's big ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO."" Still you can't base the movie on those two events. It was well done. Lucas is a genius and he has a great imagination. I have seen the movie 4 times and I plan on seeing a couple more times because its so awesome. I have to add that I cried in some parts of the movie because there were a lot of emotional parts in the movie such as the fall of all of the Jedi, Padme's death, the part where Anakin is in pain after the duel with Obi-Wan,the fact that he slaughtered those children in the Jedi temple, and much more. I encourage those people who haven't seen the movie to go see the movie. You will be on the edge of your seat. Hayden Christensen is at his best. The final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is spectacular. I give it a 9/10"
2868,8,One of the best starwars movie,"I think that Lucas has done a great job bridging the two trilogies. I think with all the new technology and special effects, this is the best starwars episode.(""This is what I think"") The acting was not really the strong point of the film but the make up, costumes, special effects were breath taking. Sabre fights were really fantastic. I found a great contrast in the character of master Yoda from episode V, but I liked this serious and wiser image better. The story was original and logical. I think that starwars fans will be satisfied and the film certainly came up to their expectations. Overall a film that must be seen."
2869,10,The best one since Empire Strikes Back.....,"NOTE:Although I've mentioned that this comment includes spoilers, I'll inform you before telling one. So you can read this without worry. Besides there's no plot twist or major shocking thing that happens in the movie, so no worries."
2870,5,how in the world is this a 7.9?,"Okay... I've been a Star Wars fan like most. I grew up with the movies, but this movie was extremely disappointing. I had no problems with the storyline, and that's the only way I can conceive the high ratings it has received here. The dialogue was horrendous, however. And a coughing robot with an exposed human heart driving it? George Lucas truly has turned to the dark side. I would love to get a copy of the movie and mute all of the voices. Perhaps someone could rewrite the dialogue and add enough CGI to make the words match the speaking mouths. The emperor's sinister laugh absolutely HAS to go, and the entire speech about creating a new ""empire"" in a voice ridden with unmasked evil does not lend much faith that anyone could truly follow such a man. If Hitler had been so obviously menacing, would the masses have vowed their allegiance? I just think it was an unjust end to a truly influential series."
2871,7,Overrated,"I feel this movie was VERY overrated, from what I heard from people it was supposed to be in the same class as the classic ones. it's not. Sure it was a good movie, but I was disappointed, I had high expectations. Some of the lightsaber fighting scenes in the beginning of the movie were really bad, and you could see how fake both it and the blue screen generated background was. The wookies had too little screen time, the emperor looked and sounded really silly, And the last scene with Vader where he screams no...wow that was pathetic, they could have gone without the no. There are many good moments though, but that would be spoiling now wouldn't it ;)Ep 3 had the same feel like ep 2 in the beginning, but it slowly turned darker and darker up until the end of the movie, if you ask me they should have used the dark tone in the entire movie instead of letting it slowly turn it dark, because it was the dark part of the movie which was the saving grace."
2872,10,Best Film of the whole Saga - Lucas Rebounds,"OK OK OK.... I'm gonna keep this quick and simple. I thought that the final installment of the historical Star Wars saga was the best of them all. Not only was this movie a big step up from the other prequels, but could even rival the original classics. This movie had absolutely everything and George Lucas absolutely redeemed himself. The acting was great, unlike in the THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES. The visual effects were superb. But what makes REVENGE OF THE SITH the best of the saga is the awesome storytelling and unforgettable light saber duels. So if you have yet to see REVENGE OF THE SITH, i suggest you see it. If you have seen it already, see it again and keep it in theaters longer."
2873,9,Film of the year? without a doubt!,Well what can i say. After being horribly disappointed by the phantom menace and with attack of the clones being fairly average i still kept my hopes up for this film. and did george lucas deliver? he certainly did. I came out the cinema simply speechless.
2874,8,Star Wars has only 4 movies and this is the fourth one,finally !!!! i saw a star wars movie after wasting 280 minutes on the last two piece of S*** prequels 
2875,5,Not as good as everyone says.,"Look, I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I've been called a fake fan so many times for having an opinion other than others, where I hate the prequels but I love the sequels. This movie doesn't deserve the hype. I do only like the ending, where they set up the actually good movies. I find anakin to be annoying and Hayden Christiansen can't act if his life depended on it. Another redeeming quality is Ewan mcgregor. Fans praise this movie for no reason. I get that most of it is nostalgia, and I didn't watch them growing up. Another reason is probably the clone wars show, which i could never get past the first episode. Overall, it has decent aspects, but a lot of bad stuff."
2876,5,Star war complex?,"I don't know why so many people love star war so much. Is there some kind of star war complex deeply planted in their minds from very young age? For me, star war is a movie lacking imagination, with boring to death conversation, and just so-so special effects. In 1970's, star war might be ground-breaking and jaw-dropping. But it is no longer the case after 3 decades."
2877,7,Not the best but..,I have to rate this film a 7 out of 10 I think. I feel the movie was 'rushed' and too much CGI was used in the film - far more I think than the previous movies. I felt disappointed by the way the film although has plenty of action in it - the fight scenes were too quick and the script a bit dodgy to say the least ! At the end of the movie where Darth Vader gets off the operating table seems like a poor rip off of Boris Karloff as Frankenstein. Very badly done and not the best scene in the movie as it should have been seeing Anakin become Darth Vader.
2878,9,A fitting end for the new generation,Great movie. Better than TPM and AOTC together.
2879,10,Anakin's transition and Windu's part in it,In this movie Lucas shows again that he is a masterful storyteller and he can awaken emotions and feelings in you like few can.
2880,,Decent... but dumb,Pretty decent movie overall. 
2881,,ewan mcgregor? why!!,"Ewan mcgregor is one of my favorite actors. The star wars prequel trilogy was just terrible. Why mcgregor? why would he do this. the movie is to dark for kids but to stupid for adults how can they fix this. every time I think of jar jar I want to throw up. And why s the dark side evil. i have never gotten that it is like the writers just threw you in the war and say ""hey this is the side to root for. Why mcgregor? why would you just read the lines. you must of known they were terrible. Why mcgregor? why do you say you have the advantage on the high ground so weirdly when anikin can just hop up ten feet and match you. why mcgregor why? you should have just walked out no one deserves what mcgregor went through. Why mcgregor why?"
2882,,Love it or Hate it.,"Obi-Wan lives, Yoda Lives, Palpatine lives, and Anakin becomes Darth Vader. So, when the movie was over, was anybody surprised?"
2883,7,Consumed by Darth Vader.,"After been watching the earlier Star Wars movies from the 70's you don't know what to expect when your off to see Revenge of the sith. It's previous movies, The Phantom Menace and The attack of the clones, were in no way equal to the prequels - They were stupid, had worthless acting and generally boring - Revenge of the sith, on the other hand, reached the heights comparable to the first star wars. I can strongly advice that you go see Revenge of the sith before it's too late - You won't regret it ! "
2884,6,Great because it's a Star Wars movie - average otherwise,This movie has been critiqued ten thousand times on IMDb so I'll just throw out a quick blurb.
2885,10,The beginning of the end-how the angelic Anakin turns into the monstrous Vader,"I was happy and sad going out of the theater, knowing that the saga of Star Wars is complete and nothing else  that epic  of this miraculous world would ever be released. The movie blew my mind away, although I had prior to that moment the novelization and script read, and my fantasy could hardly imagine how it would look like. The entering space battle/chase boomed into the theater, like nothing else before, and despite it's almost a third of the novel, it was only a prelude to the real situation, in what the turn of events led. War is tearing the Republic apart, as much as the mistrust between Jedi Consul and the Chancellor, or between Padmé and Anakin. I saw how the deceit turned the love into hatred, dedication into selfishness, compassion into lust of power. If I could have kept up at the scenes with Padmé and Anakin in love, or those of the execution of Order 66 (extermination of the Jedi), the movie definitely made me sob seeing helpless Anakin crying out of pain with his corpse caught on fire at the bank of the volcanic river. And yet, Padmé  the woman in love  surrendering the very last breath of life she had, to her beloved husband (having just given birth to Luke and Leia) made me burst in tears. I laughed the way R2-D2 set two attacking him super battle droids on fire, or the way C-3PO complained about his being helpless. I admired the sword fight, and battle techniques of Yoda, Obi-Wan, Anakin and my mind roamed in the landscapes of the worlds shown. Above all this the special effects, never-seen-before places, backgrounds, and all those machines, creatures, and gadgets. It was all that far, far away, where endless imagination of George Lucas could only bring us to."
2886,10,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,"This is the best of the six Star Wars films and well worth the wait! George Lucas ties the saga neatly together with this final chapter, and I for one am no less than ecstatic. The acting of Christensen and McGregor are superior, as are performances by Portman and McDairmid! This is more than a film, it is an experience that leaves you exhausted. The Emporer scared me, I cried with Padme, agonized with Anakin and felt the crush of sorrow with Obi-Wan. Afterward, I had to go back and watch A New Hope, Empire and Jedi to relive the redemption of Anakin Skywalker by his son, Luke! Thank YOU so much, George, Hayden, Ewan, Natalie, Ian, Frank, Samual, Anthony, Peter and Jimmy (+ anyone I've forgotten) for this great Finale to the Star Wars Epic! Royal_Sapphire"
2887,8,"Too Hollywood, sure, but oh so worth it!","This little baby is very dark--no surprise there, yet even more than I expected--but also has the workings of a potential classic. The fact that we all know what must happen is actually extremely engaging -- you ... just ... wish ... but no. "
2888,9,"Kinetic, Fun and Powerful Film Making - Lucas Delivers!!!!","This is the Star Wars Movie we've been waiting for...Wow! I had mixed feelings over the prequels - Episodes I and II both had their share of good and bad moments. There were times I was taken out the film due to clunky acting, and unconvincing effects....not so for Revenge of the Sith."
2889,10,Absolutely fantastic,"I seem to be in the minority group who enjoyed the other 2 prequels. Whilst Episode I was quite disappointing, Episode II paved the way for Episode III, which is the best of the prequels. In my opinion it is second only to Empire Strikes Back."
2890,4,"Lucas is good in something, but it's definitely not writing and directing","Well, the expectations came to their and. A hell lot of money was spent on promoting, and The Revenge Of The Sith made a fortune for the producers. Therefore George Lucas has succeeded. Unfortunately the movie was week. The only two positive things I can mention without spoilers are the following: despite the duration of 2.5 hours, the movie is not a bit boring. And the other reveal: Jar-Jar gets only 4 seconds. They should have worked more on the script. The channel towards the ""original trilogy"" is incoherent, the dialogs are lame, and Yoda speaks an annoying English. (He always does, but this time he gets too many lines.) I see Hollywood on the downhill, because it's getting a more and more important aspect about scenes to ""make the audience loving it"" instead of ""simply being good"". So after killing the Matrix, the Star Wars galaxy ended up in the deep. Let's hope when some will decide to make another trilogy of this galaxy, it will be done by experts, not marketing people."
2891,10,"Sit back, buckle up, and enjoy the ride. It's that good.","After seeing PM and AOTC I was a little skeptical about this one. With the understanding that this was going to be the darkest of all 6 star wars movies, and being a Star Wars fan, I had expectations. Well Mr. Lucas did not let me down. Not only did he meet my expectations, He blew them away."
2892,10,The greatest movie on the planet!,"Once again George Lucas has created something that everyone enjoys! 4 out of 5 people would probably agree with me. This movie may be the last in the saga, but all the movies will last in peoples hearts for eternity! It shows how a good person can become evil, but they always have a chance to be redeemed. People probably know that Palpatine can be similar to Satin, and how he can manipulate and trick people, and make false promises. It has the greatest lightsaber battle ever in the whole saga! It also shows that you sometimes cant prevent people from dying when it is time for them to go. This one is my favorite out of all the movies. It has great science fiction that only Lucas could ever think of. Lucas is one fantastic director and a good man. People probably wish that he could make more movies, but that is up to Lucas. This is indeed one of the best movies I have ever seen!"
2893,7,"The movie that put back the ""war"" in Star Wars","Well let's face it. I'm a really big fan of the series. So let's say i'm not quite objective when i see a star wars movie. I remember as a child, not knowing what i was watching, to be amazed by the story and special effects of the first trilogy (well the second). For years i tried to put my hands back on it, and then a friend lent me the tapes of episode 4, 5 and 6. My love had now a name. A couple of years later was released episode I. I liked it even if i know how bad it is. Then episode II. A bit better, but still really really bad... and then yesterday evening, episode III. Total failure? At least, at last, a good one! We've been waiting for that one. Like i just said, it's this movie that ""war"" back into the Star Wars double-trilogy! But first the critics! mainly my hard feelings are going to Padme! As well as she could play in the first two episode, as well as Anakin was really (oh yeah really really) bad in episode II, well she is really bad in episode III. Hopefully, she is not appearing too often. And now Anakin. Has he finally improved? oh yes he has! The dark side is string in him, and he really has it, that special touch that makes you feel so dizzy when he start getting mad! OK, i'm stopping here, go watch and check out yourself for the lightsabers, and other special effects and the fights, etc..."
2894,9,An Excellent End and Beginning to the Star Wars Sagas,"A great end to the new trilogy that sets up the next 3 movies beautifully. All the loose ends are tied up and all the questions you have (e.g. How did Anakin become Vader?) are answered with tremendous CG Space battles, intense and eye catching lightsabre duels (one character even blows darth maul's ""double lightsabre"" from episode one away and uses 4 at the same time!). There will no doubt be some people who won't enjoy it, the acting can sometimes be a little much and one scene involving a fully suited Darth Vader is more than a little over-dramatic (Anyone who has seen it will know it as the ""Nooo!"" scene). But other than a few minor gripes this movie is nothing short of an instant classic, a must-see for all generations!"
2895,6,There is more put in balance here then the force- the reviews also find their center.,"Well... there is a large amount of disappointment welling inside me. Don't get me wrong. The movie was in no way bad or awful, but it certainly wasn't great or wonderful. In the end, it's a unworthy finish to a rather notable trilogy."
2896,10,This Movie Connects Episodes 4-5-6 with the first 3 Episodes Excellently,"Now a legend is finished. Episode-3 greatly reflects Anakins's will and manages to clearly identify why Anakin chose his path to walk alongside the evil side.Episode-3 Revenge of the Sith is the best StarWars film ever made with it's technology, well organized scenario and it's ability to make connection with other episodes; 4-5-6. In the film it is too hard to find a logical error. We see how Palpatine was able to be a galactic emperor, how Anakin became Darth Vader, what was done with the 2 children of Anakin, and what happened to Yoda and Obi-Wan and to other Jedis. All the questions which were wondered a lot are now solved. Also as before the music were again exactly on time when they were required well and they were wonderful. I think this film will reflect George Lucas work well and will be a classic."
2897,8,the best one hands down SPOILER,The opening fight above korriben when they enter the general's ship and obi wan jumps out of the cockpit and takes out the droid's and everything r2d2 gets up to at the start.The way that all the Jedi are killed is genius. The fight with the wookies just looks brilliant. Then later on all the Jedi light saber fight's.The best ones for me was obi wan and the general(with the 4 light saber's)and Yoda's fight with Darth sideus is the best one ever hands down.I was a bit disappointed that Natale portmen dint have much screen time.The acting may be a let down a little bit in some part's of the film but it doesn't spoil it at all.The visual effects make up for it easy but i still don't think mace windu should have got a purple light saber.
2898,10,Most Awesome Star Wars Yet!!!,"I LOVED this movie (yeah, first day, @ noon) It was definitely worth my money. The only thing I can complain about is the somewhat cheesy dialogue between Anakin and Padme and not so good performance of Natalie Portman. I know she can do much better, and this movie didn't show it. Everyone else's awesomeness made up for it a million times over, though. It definitely bridges the gap between the movies. You see Obi-Wan acting like good old Ben, and Palpatine is creepier than ever. New villains: General Grievous (part droid, part alien), and... wait, I can't tell you more than that! Just go see the movie, you bums! May the Force be with you!"
2899,7,"Starwars, Good points and Bad points.","I thought the new prequel was good for the most part. There was definitely a lot of action in this one. (Unlike AOTC, which I thought was too mushy). Palpatine had a much bigger role in ROTS, which I definitely liked. I've been waiting forever to find out how he got deformed. And of course there's the battle between Palpatine and Yoda, I thought it was the best battle in ROTS (The battle between Anakin and Kenobi kind of bored me). There we definitely some parts that were bad though. For example, I thought they could of done a lot better with the visual effects, especially on the light sabers. It was almost like Lucas was trying to give everything a classical look since ROTS is so close to ANH. The visual effects were better in AOTC I thought. And there's the Romantic parts. Padme was such a strong woman in TPM and AOTC, in ROTS she's more like Anakin's secret mistress. And there was the descent into the dark side. First Palpatine has Anakin kill Dukoo, which was way too easy I thought. Then he wants him to leave Kenobi behind, which he won't do. Then Anakin chops Mace Windu's hands off, and offers Palpatine his allegiance to save Padme. Then he goes and kills the kids in the Jedi Temple (I was kind of disappointed because Anakin didn't kill all the Jedi! The only ones they show him killing were the kids, I thought he was supposed to of killed them all single-handedly, or at least mostly) Then he goes to Mustufar and kills all of the Seperatist Leaders, all cool. Padme later on come to Mustufar to find Anakin. Then the fight between Kenobi and Anakin ensues, and Kenobi wins (I definitely liked the part when Kenobi chops all of Anakin's limbs of with one strike). The part I really didn't buy was when Padme died. 'She's lost the will to live', how lame is that? The great George Lucas cannot come up with some better explanation then that?! At least have it that she was severely injured when Anakin used the force on her, at least that's believable.. One other thing I didn't like was Anakin never used Dark Force Lightning.. how boring, he just used all of the boring force powers that everyone's seen like a thousand times from the last two prequels. All in all it was good, but there were definitely some parts that needed work.."
2900,9,Equal to the OT,"Reading through some of the other reviews, I'm rather shocked about the amount of bad mouthing. By all means, the dialog is unintenionable silly at times, but so it was in the in the original trilogy. "
2901,10,Perfection!,"Lucas has made up the the last 2 films. Episode 3 ties in the original trilogy perfectly. It leaves you dying to watch the other films. Episode 3 actually makes the original trilogy better which is tough for me to say. It also makes heroes such as Luke and Han Solo much greater and significant. Where the original trilogy had many memorable moments, episodes 1 and 2 had none. Episode 3 had more than I ever expected. I just saw the film last night and I am still speechless. Besides a few claps from the audience, the entire theater was speechless. At first I was surprised. Did they not feel the same way I did? But as the lights turned on, I noticed an entire room filled with the biggest smiles that I have ever seen for a movie. The halls outside the doors were filled with people calling friends about the greatness of the film. People will remember this film equally with the original trilogy. And thats all the fans have been asking for."
2902,10,A great end to a great saga,"I literally cried the first time I watched it. I'm 16 .My father is a big fan of the early star wars trilogy and when I was a little kid, instead of watching Toy Story and Lion King, my father made me watch STAR WARS. I have to say, I loved it. I grew up watching all the star wars films whenever I had nothing to do and I kept asking my father, ""why does the first episode have the number four daddy?"" ""because they intend to shoot three prequels, son"" he would answer me, and I thought, since I didn't live when the early star wars was released, I wouldn't live to see those prequels."
2903,,"Very good, and I'm not a Star Wars fan","O.K so it isn't much of a shock that someone has posted a comment saying that this film is good. But seeing that i'm not a SW fan at all shows that u don't have to know the backstory to like this film. Like 99% of the world I have heard of Darth Vader n Luke, n know pretty much who and what they are, it's hard not to considering the hype those films got. I never, or will ever understand why these films got so massive, i mean the dialogue is cheesy, the acting not always the best, and my main gripe was with the effects, specially in ep II, they were excellent, but did every scene really need to be completely CG'd?? LOTR proved that CG shud only be used to help the story, not smother and spoil it. BUT................. this film was very good from start to finish. It did something that no other star wars film has done to me, it got me gripped."
2904,6,"Go see it, just to say you saw it.","You can read the vast amount of other comments for a synopsis. Ignore the 1-star and 10-star reviews, as they are biased crap. Bottom line: Lucas cannot write dialogue. He is an awesome special FX designer, but seriously should have passed the buck on the writing."
2905,9,"I did not like the first movie and was never much of a fan, but *SPOILERS*",*Here be spoilers! Warned you are.*
2906,7,A Delayed Negative Reaction....,"When I first saw this film I was looking forward to it a lot like many other people. Yet after-wards I had mixed feelings about how Lucas ended an otherwise seamless saga. Unlike some, I didn't think the other prequels sucked. Episode I was a introduction so I could understand that we wouldn't see scads of Anikan in the first film. Episode II was good besides Anikan's whining and no Darth Maul. Yet Episode III was somewhat disappointing..."
2907,5,Great Movie made Good by Lazy Writing,I'm a huge fan of episodes 4-6. Most of the issues with those installments were simply related to lower tech effects and a few to many muppets.
2908,8,"Good, but ""Empire"" is winner and still champion","Most of the criticism I've read of this movie so far concerns dialog and acting. Granted, it's not the best I've ever seen. But it isn't the worst either. Okay, I squirmed in my seat through all of Anakin and Padme's ""I love you"", ""only because I love you so much,"" and so on. Knock it off and get down to some saber fights. But being perfectly honest, how many of us haven't talked that way to our own significant others? If more of us did, our divorce rates wouldn't be quite so high."
2909,9,Exceeds Episodes I and II by leaps and bounds,"Even though the dialogue is a little slow and not very well written (at some points; there are actually some good lines), I thought the movie was fantastic. The special effects were definitely top-notch, and a good amount of the actors are much better in Episode III. I loved the transformation from Anakin to Vader when the camera is at Vader's POV and the mask slowly comes down and locks in place. A few things that made me cringe were the shot when Yoda is falling off the pod in the senate and his claws scratch off the side like on a chalkboard. That made me feel a little queasy... Also, when Anakin is being burned almost to death really freaked me out. I love those shots when guards repeatedly come up to Yoda, and he just kicks their asses. "
2910,10,Episode 3: the King of all Star Wars movies,"I am really excited to say that this was the BEST of the three prequels for Star Wars, I enjoyed every minute of the film and now feel that the Star Wars saga is complete. The best part of the movie for me was the final duel between Obi-Wan and Lord Vader a.k.a Anakin Skywalker...The action was intense and the duel was done fantastically...I also enjoyed the part where Yoda took on the evil emperor in the Senate and fought him bravely... The movie also linked how the storm troopers a.k.a clones went from being good guys to the dark side of the battles. Overall, the movie answered all the questions that were left from the first three movies especially how Jedi Anakin Skywalker became the evil Darth Vader. Kudos to George Lucas for making this final chapter come true and for answering all the questions from the first Trilogy..."
2911,10,The Force is definitely with us fans,"Buy the popcorn, get the drinks and get ready for a movie that rivals the first trilogy of Star Wars."
2912,7,Lucas Scores on Story but Where is the Fun?,"Like the first prequel Star Wars Episode I, George Lucas makes it very clear from the opening scene that he has a lot of story plot to share with us. Not much sub plot in Episode III, too much mushy love story between Anakin Skywalker and the Princess character especially when we can figure out about half way through the movie how things are going to end up between them. Battles become repetitious, how many times does the automatic dome release switch have to get hit by The Force luring the combatants to the outer balcony with the crowded skyline as the backdrop? Spoiler . . . . . . . . . . The ending could have brought us right up to the moment of the original Star Wars movie, but instead went for the tearful, sappy ending instead. And in this age of ultra high tech print quality and ultra quality sound, why was the print in the large theater complex where I saw this film, non Digital and non SDSS sound? One thing each Star Wars movie in the past did was to demonstrate the advances in film and sound technology. Episode II was an all Digital Film, why would Episode III with arguably better graphics and animation than all of its predecessors be presented in a lower quality fashion. Rush to get the Bucks! IMHO."
2913,8,Better than EPISODE IV... an absolute marvel!,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith redeems the prequels in a big way - a VERY big way.
2914,7,Could have been better,"I, like every other Star Wars fan, had waited a long time to see this movie. To watch the story line finally come together was what we had been waiting for. Once the movie was over I was left walking out of the theater scratching my head. ""What just happened?"" was all I kept asking myself. There were scenes that should have been left out of the movie completely. SFX were great, as usual, but the dialog was lame. I wasn't at all into the movie until the end and even then I wasn't as into it as I had expected. The only thing I can say is Anakin's line at the beginning ""This is where the fun begins."" doesn't mean the movie."
2915,10,Star Wars - Back at its BEST!,"The first Star Wars movie I saw in the cinema was Return of the Jedi (aged 9) and it was fantastic! Since then the Empire Strikes Back became my favourite - a dark foreboding movie, lending a real and palpable gravitas to the whole story line. I can't explain how excited I was when Episode I was released - and how confused and un-fulfilled I was having seen it. I wasn't totally disappointed. It wasn't dire, but it certainly wasn't ""Star Wars"". Then Episode II - I had really high hopes, and although it was better the Phantom Menace - it was still a bit disappointing (Anakin jumping out of the speeder? Oh come on!). So when Episode III was due for release, I was in two minds - should I set myself up for further disappointment (only worse, since this is the last of the six), or should I allow my childish enthusiasm to boil over into hyperdrive. I went for hyperdrive - and wasn't let down. This movie is great - and truly in the lineage of Star Wars - an absolute triumph! Exploritory, explanatory and dark - a masterpiece, Lucas and Star Wars, back at the top!"
2916,10,Possibly the most meaningful in the series,"Might contain spoilers if you haven't seen Episodes 4,5, or 6. But I don't think I wrote anything directly shown in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith."
2917,9,By far the greatest movie ever,"I've been rating movies a ten for a while, and they deserve that rank, but they're all one compared to this. If I could, I would rate this movie 100 out of 10. This is the first movie where the Sith actually show some of that Sith wrath that I've been waiting for. Sure, the ancient Sith Lords would've been better, but the spectacle of Darth Sidious, and the amazement of seeing Darth Vader again is overwhelming. Also, this marks the first movie to actually cause me to cry. Not once, four times. Killing little children between the ages of 3 and 5 is just a little rough for me. I've never been a ""killing children"" movie person, but JEDI children? That's just sad. Also, I LOVED what I call ""The long-awaited return of Force Choke."""
2918,7,For fans...,"First of all, I'm a huge SW fan... one might even call me a die soft-geek or something like that. And, my dear fellow geeks, this is the prequel you've been waiting for. Forget the horrors of Phantom (no Gungan lines whatsoever! No annoying little brat yelling Jippee 'cause he can be a Jedi, ...), take the SFX of Clone, add Galaxies of darkness, et voilà: the best prequel of the set. It's a guarantee; you'll probably be faking light saber battles for weeks and weeks, and even pop in a little Sith-toned 'Riiiiiiise!'."
2919,5,disappointed,"I guess that i would start off saying that i love star wars and have waiting to see this installment in the series. Even though the special effects are dazzling and entertaining, the script should have been better. After the last 2 movies any movie hayden chris(whatever his name is) acts in i think i will avoid it like the plague.His delivery is pathetic. I personally think my 4 year old nephew would have been more convincing. I haven't seen or heard so many corny lines since ""Army of darkness"". What a waste of time i considered this move to be for me. I could have gotten 4 more hours of sleep. The only reason this movie gets a 5 is the special effects. Start the petition for H.C. to never act again."
2920,9,"Now the ring is complete, when i left you i was an apprentice...","Is difficult to be cool after have just seen it in the Italian release in a midnight premiere. Is 2.47 am of may the 20th and i must admit that Geoirge Lucas is a smart guy. He had listened all the fan suggestion and he has corrected the shot from Episode I, that i quite liked, especially in the visual way, but was a little bit childish as plot. And, when it was released had an impact great (i repeat, on the technical way, in a way to let the 1977 work as a Luna park compared to Diseyland, if you know what i mean). So the story this time is great, there are all the citations that must be, for instance the Frankenstein's (Karloff's of course) one, when Darth Vader ""really"" born. The story has its dark taste, and i think this is what it has to be. the duels are as they must be, with the logical Asian influence (but we must not forget that the story, in the beginning, was a mixture of genders, Asian, 30's serials, sword & sorcery all in sci-fi sauce...), but very very huge. A defect in the too much quick death of Chris Lee, but i think we can forgive... For the rest is a great chapter, under the original only because is not the original and can combat with ""Empire Strikes back"" for the role of best chapter. There should be a lot of more things to say but, first, I don0t want to be thrown in a lava river for have saying too much:), and i really late and i begin to feel tired and need to go in exile....May the Force be with all of you....and gives to George the strength (and the will) to make the final 3 chapters (at this time is the only thing to do, we know is difficult and he said he doesn't want, but is time to beg him....bye bye Jedi friends!"
2921,6,Ticks all the boxes.,"The final installment of the saga is now with us and due to previous disappointments our expectations were quite low, but we could still hope."
2922,8,The Force is Somewhat Strong with this one,"Star Wars Episode 3 had great expectations in theaters. The prequel franchise has disappointed fans everywhere and this movie was supposed to be the one to redeem the series. While Revenge of the Sith was substantially better than Episodes 1 and 2, it still did not reach to the heights of the original trilogy. While the quality of the movie may not reach as high as others, the movie did do what it was supposed to, create a bridge between the prequels and the originals movies."
2923,9,Great finale to the prequels,"Just wanted to add my spoiler-free opinions on this film. I think that it definitely is an improvement over AOTC. Though, saying that, I realize may not comfort too many critics. The acting has improved in this one, even though it may not be Oscar-worthy. It is still enough to convey the needed emotion. While, there were some cheesy moments, they are not really bad. Actually these moments I'm thinking of may not be cheesy to the another person. This is all opinion, so all I can say here is, in my opinion, the good FAR outweighs the bad - and there isn't really anything I can think of that is so bad that it would ruin it."
2924,3,No Story,"I've been a fan of the Star Wars saga since it first came out in 1977. I was three when I saw the first. Episode V is my favorite of all time, but please don't compare III with it."
2925,10,Hands down the second best star wars film!,"When I saw this movie i was like ""WOW!"" Mr. Lucas you have redeemed yourself with this great movie. It was comparable to The Empire Strikes Back. The movie is in my opinion is the darkest of all the six Star Wars movies. I highly recommend this movie because the movie didn't have that childish feeling the Episode 1 and 2 have in them. The acting in my opinion wasn't excellent but Hayden Christensen who plays Anikin did a much better job this time around. The Emporer who is played by Ian McDiarmid was exceptional. I think he was robbed of an Oscar nomination. He was just so dark and he seemed so real. You have to watch the movie to explain how well he performed. Portman and McGregor did very good portrayals of their part. The special effects that ILM did was just unbelievable. I can't believe that it wasn't nominated for best visual effects at the Oscars. ALL and i mean ALL the clone troopers were computer animated. I was fooled into thinking that the clones were actually real they weren't! This movie was so good that in my opinion it was the second best Star Wars movie behind ""Empire."" To all you Lucas haters I say this ""What on God's Earth were you smoking when you saw this exceptional movie."" Lucas did a great job. He was did a great job directing and writing the movie. And I want to thank you Mr. Lucas for a job well done."
2926,9,This Episode was worth waiting 22 years,Revenge of the Sith beats easily its two predecessors. I won't start to compare with the old trilogy because it really isn't the same thing at all : those movies are classics... you can't compare classics with other movies... 
2927,9,Wow. It actually is very good.,"I was surprised at how good this was. Aside from some awkwardness present in nearly every scene involving Padme, this was an impressive movie, and ranks neatly beneath A New Hope and Empire for me."
2928,10,Awesome,"Regardless of the dark texture of this film, and the fact that it takes us in a direction we've been hoping not to go for a long time, it's clearly the best of the prequels by a long shot."
2929,10,The Best Star Wars and Science Fiction Film of All Time,"Constantly throughout the last few years, when Star Wars is mentioned the general public shivers and yells out that it sucks and how Lucas has rape their childhood and how if murder was legal they would kill him. These accusations are ridiculous. If people actually put this much effort into their real life as they do bashing Star Wars and George Luca, then they may actually go somewhere in life. While the first two prequels had flaws, I enjoyed them as decent sci-fi films that could captivated your enjoyment for two plus hours. Revenge of the Sith has put the crying pathetic people who strive for attention to rest. It is simply put the best Star Wars film of all time. (Yeah, that's right, better than Empire!)There is never a dull moment on screen and the landscapes, battles, duels, and confrontations are absolute gold. The CGI is flawless, unlike AOTC, which had a lot of noticeably fake scenes. Examples of this are in Yoda, General Grievous, Mustafar, Kashykkk, Utapau, and the space battle above Coruscant. The acting in this is truly wonderful. Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor, Frank Oz, Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson and Hayden Christensen (Yes thats right) were simply marvelous. No wooden performances or whining about sand, every actor in the picture was fantastic. Add these to a great storyline, respectable dialogue, and a wonderful John Williams score and you have the best Star Wars film of all time. Many of the nonbelievers who are so much in love with their opinion and ego and who don't want to be proved wrong, have expressed immense hatred toward this film. Don't let these pathetic lifeforms make you from not seeing this movie. Sith has numerous references to the Original Trilogy and is a perfect segway to A New Hope. The last hour is amazing, it is truly a tragedy and the viewer is caught up by all the emotions of the film. If you say this film sucks, I say watch the last hour of it and then tell me that you weren't moved. Star Wars is back and has claimed the title of the Best Sci Fi Series Ever. (Lord of the Rings is still awesome though.)"
2930,,star wars,"I really like this movie. it was one of the best. I just wish they could have went a little bit more into the future, I mean the fourth movie begins when Luke is like18-20, and the third one ends when Luke and Leah are just baby's. But Hayden Christensen does a great job being Anakin. I think Ewan, and Natalie are really good to. The emperor changing part was also great!! The part of Anakin and obi-wan fighting was great also I mean with all the special effects and all the moves it is just great. THe end though was just heart wrenching. When Anakin kills Padme I almost cried. Also when Padme tells Anakin that hes breaking her heart, oh my god, its just so sad he didn't even take her feelings in to consideration."
2931,3,"best of the Pre, but still sick (spoiler)","Anakin literally changing from saying ""What have I done?"" when killing a jedi to ""Yes let's kill of them"" in a single scene. Is the emperor like hardcore mind control that we don't know about? He says ""I can't kill him, it's against THE WAY."" ""Yes do it."" ""Oh, OK."" And why does he try to learn the dark side to save padme? I thought anger led to the dark side, not compassion and love! And why does Padme know basically that the republic is evil from the beginning and yet she can't understand Ani when he says ""I'm lost."" One thing definitely did improve though: dialogue between characters was phenomenal (for a prequel of course) It's funny, when you watch Lucas' earlier films like Star Wars ( the only of the three originals that he actually wrote and directed) and THX 1138 you see what appears to be a veteran film maker who entertains and is well developed in direction style despite them being only his first few ventures."
2932,8,Star Wars finished with a bang!,"This movie was truly the best of the six. The digital effects, the actors, the anticipation. so much. Everyone in the audience probably knew what would happen, Obi Wan and Anakin would fight and Obi Wan would win. Its the way it is, but people around me were still surprised, i was surprised. This movie was so amazing, The tremendous build up to the greatest fight in cinema history. I am serious, there is no other movie i have ever seen, and i have seen quite a lot. The duel between anakin and obi wan was so awesome. I personally own the movie and every time I watch when the fight begins, my blood gets riled up. I start humming to the music. Also Yoda and Sideous fighting was incredible. To sum it up. if you are a fan of star wars see this movie. your jaw will drop. if you aren't a fan of star wars then... **** you!"
2933,7,"Special effects, action steal the show","Star Wars fanatics obviously will embrace Episode III as another amazing film by the great George Lucas. While I enjoy a good light saber battle from time to time, I am as far from being a die-hard as there is. Frankly, Episode I was terrible, and Episode II did not stand on its own very well. Needless to say, I was not excited at all heading into the final piece of the saga."
2934,9,Best Star Wars Ever,"I remember George Lucas saying after the release of 'The Phantom Menace' that audiences were looking for 'The Matrix' not 'Star Wars'. I couldn't disagree more. Audiences were looking for 'Revenge of the Sith'. Unlike 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' there is a clear enemy, an evil spreading through the galaxy and threatening the fate of all the characters. ROTS is by far the most emotionally driven film of the series, and features the best special effects in cinema history....hands down. Lucas has raised the bar once again in the realm of science fiction, and in 'Revenge of the Sith' has perfectly woven the entire saga to a satisfying conclusion."
2935,10,Amazing how it all ties together,"Of course, like every other Star Wars fan, I had been in much anticipation for this movie. Saying that it met my hopes for a fantastic way to finish the legacy, would be an understatement. Since I saw the movie at it's midnight sneak peak, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, and how it all ties everything together setting the stage for episodes 4, 5 and 6. Since it is the third installment of the pre-quels, we already know some of the history and what happens to some of the characters later in the story. However, all it does is completes everything we perhaps have wondered about. "
2936,,Awesome!,"I loved this final episode to the Star Wars saga. It connected everything so flawlessly. I went home and watched the original ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" afterward and could definitely see the continuity and relations made throughout the prequels-especially in Episode III. I must say, in my opinion, Hayden Christensen did an excellent job of portraying the conflicted Anakin. His transformation into Darth Vader was both remorseful as well as gruesome. I found myself rooting for Anakin in the beginning, when he had the nightmare about Padme dying in childbirth. Anakin was willing to do anything to save and protect Padme, which I sympathized with. Of course, by the time Anakin/Vader fights Obi-Wan on the lava planet, I am thoroughly in Obi-Wan's corner. I also thought the insinuation of Anakin/Vader's slaying of the Jedi children was disturbing, though I understood why it was included. Overall, I felt Christensen's performance was stellar, along with the performance of Ian McDiarmid who portrays Palpatine. Definitely worth the wait!"
2937,5,Ridiculously Disappointing,"Did anyone who commented actually watch the movie??? Or were you all brainwashed by the filth that is the mainstream media? This movie did not live up to the precedent set by the original. George Lucas...I am ashamed. You could have done so much better with these three but you didn't. To put it simply...you failed. The dialogue coupled with horrendous acting (not even worthy of the high school stage) made this movie bad. then what was up with the first 30 minutes trying to be funny. We didn't come to see playful banter between obi wan and Anakin. The first entire scene did nothing for the movie and was simply a way for the people at ILM to strut their stuff. Well, stop. And the acting...oh was it bad. How do you not change emotion at all ever? Your wife is having a child and you say it's the best day of your life...could have fooled me. Your expression and mannerisms were no different than when you were lying near a pool of lava having just had your legs severed by your long time mentor. Something a tad bit strange there. In all, get some better acting, beef up the dialogue, and stop the ILM commercials."
2938,7,A light saber too far?,"For all the die-hard fans, this film is a dream come true. However, one of the film's strengths, it's special FX, is also a major weakness. Weakness in the sense of too much of a good thing and WAAAAAAY too many light-saber duels."
2939,4,Old Trilogy kicks new Trilogy in the Butt!!!,"OK, hats off to George Lucas. What he did with the FIRST trilogy will live in our hearts forever (even mine). The new trilogy however, will be lucky if the die-hard fans remember it. Revenge of the Sith completed George Lucas's humiliation. It is sad, because like I have already stated, the first trilogy was Awesome!!! Classic lines like ""Luke I am your father"", and ""It is your destiny"" have become household quotes. I can't think of one line from any of the new ones that will be remembered for any period of time. There is one good thing about the second three: The Music. That's about it. There were some bright spots in the new three. Liam Neeson did a great Qui-gon but couldn't save the movie. Christopher Lee was a good Dukku but again couldn't save the movie. And Hayden Christiansen's acting in the final two of the new three was disgusting. He was far to whiny and corny. For me, he ruined the final two flicks. George Lucas fell away from what made the first three great. His attempt to modernize the new ones backfired. Alexander Smith"
2940,4,I skipped school for that?,"I skipped school to see this flick ... then again it's Star Wars, I probably would've skipped even if I knew how bad it was. Granted I watched this movie giving it the handicap of being a modern Star Wars, but I really didn't expect it to be THAT bad. Hopefully it's one of those flicks that you have to watch it for a second time to truly appreciate it. It had its moments, but for the most part the graphics, scenery, ship-battles were all over-the-top. Anikin's switch to the dark side was at very best very cheesy (honestly, that was the hardest I've laughed at a serious part of a movie). The love story with Anikin and Padme is pretty much a display of a geek writing romance. There are more than a few plot holes and everyone's favorite villain (Darth Vader) reduced to a corny ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" The best I could really say for this movie is: ""Eh ... could've been worse."""
2941,7,George Lucas has done one third the Justice.,"I liked Phantom Menace, it was pretty good cinema. I thought that Attack of the Clones was excellent. But they weren't right. They were both great movies, but they just weren't right."
2942,1,Awful,I've never wanted to watch the new 3 Star Wars films but as I wanted to know the full story I thought I would give them a watch.
2943,8,The true prequel,"We've got a real, worthy prequel to the Star Wars trilogy on our hands now. You're welcome to banish all memory of episodes I & II from your mind; THIS is the movie we Star Wars fans have all been waiting twenty years to see. THIS is the movie that began unspooling in our heads the moment Lucas announced plans for a prequel trilogy back in '96. And it delivers."
2944,5,Animation-technology validated with insufficient plot,"The film is, of course, a must for any hard-core Star-Wars fan. The animated scenes and characters are virtually indistinguishable from the natural actors (apart from them having mechanical or un-human bodies, which, obviously, is the whole point). The blend between humans and artificial parts is perfect. Perspectives are impeccable. I only caught one glimpse of a light saber being blocked behind the opposite person. 10 out of 10 for animation-technology-perfection. There is just this obsession with impossible extreme-g turns, people cushioning falls that will break any bone (or whatever) structure a few times over. Also, Industrial Light and Magic is true to its name - including too-obvious re-use of animation. General Grievous' head comes straight out of ""The Fifth Element"" (the friendly aliens in the pyramid). Obi-Wan's riding dragon moves just like that hound in ""Ghostbusters"" chasing the geek across the lawn. Senator Palpatine's character is directly modeled on Ian Richardson's (splendid) performance in ""House of Cards"" (down to intonation of speech)."
2945,7,The Darth Insufferous Review,"I don't own an Imperial Stormtrooper outfit or a lightsaber but I liked Episodes IV through VI. I tolerated Episode I and would gladly choose a root canal with a dull Makita industrial router to sitting through Episode II again. With this mixed history of reaction to the series I wasn't expecting that much from Episode III. Just please, PLEASE, no Jar Jar Binks."
2946,4,bread and circus for the masses,What a huge waste of potential. At least I felt closure in that I had watched the entire SW story.
2947,10,Great movie.,"Awesome light-saber battles, when anakin turns on Jedi is electric, but the anakin and padme dialogue/scenes are a bit iffy. ILM have done a great job, as has George Lucas. The visual effects in this movie exceeded my expectations for the film, and the movie lived up to the hype. What i like about the film is that it fills in EVERYTHING that you wanted to know, and you can see Anakin being gradually turned towards the dark side of the force throughout the movie, constantly having buttons pushed by various individuals in his life. Like I said, the movie builds up to a climactic battle scene between Obi-Wan and Anakin, and that alone is definitely one of the reasons anyone should see the movie, fan or not."
2948,8,The Force Returns,"I will admit, after the disappointment of both Episode I and II, I was skeptical of the quality of Episode III. I hoped that the series would gain some redeeming quality after Episodes I and II came out, and, with Episode III, it did. While Episode III was not as great or groundbreaking as the original three movies, it was substantially better than Episodes I and II. I especially liked the beginning space fight that were so prevalent in the original three movies. Overall, I felt that the movie successfully tied the two series together, while I felt that some of the ties were a bit cheesy and seemed to be added in at the last moment. Still, this was a great movie that I plan to see many more times. I was much more satisfied with Christensen's acting performance in this movie than in the previous episode. The excellent acting, tying together of the series, and addition of several awesome action scenes made this a very good movie."
2949,9,Lucas has left the Buddhism behind...,"Others have commented, ad nausem, about the movie's (still a little clunky but) better acting, the threads of the story being tied together - I particularly enjoyed the comment that it was now ""safe"" to say you were a Star Wars fan again - LOL! C'mon - if you could run around since 1977 saying that Star Wars was your favorite movie (like me) ..... you just have no shame, LOL Anyway...."
2950,9,Episode III: What more do you want? C'mon!,"Alright, so the prequels weren't the best thing since the original trilogy, but what could be? I can tell you one thing: out of all of the prequels, Episode III had the best writing, acting, action, and computer animation. Though many fans believe that still isn't saying much (and to an extent I agree), Episode III fulfilled all of my expectations. If it didn't for you, then all you have to do is look at the film from an overall saga point of view and realize that not only does it effectively show Anakin Skywalker's downfall, but it also successfully sets up Episode IV-VI. Anyone who has ever seen an interview with George Lucas knows that the saga is about Anakin and as hard as it was to watch a 9 year old boy whine about being cold in space, Episode III was worth all of it. Lucas gave fans the ultimate film with one of the darkest tragedies in film history (as well as one of the best 20 minute CGI battle sequences ever created). If you were angry because you didn't get to see Darth Vader kill people in his suit....um.....what the hell happened in almost every scene of Episodes IV-VI? Huh? Yeah, how many higher ups strangled to death slowly for our enjoyment? LOTS. Further, Obi-Wan died by getting chopped in half in super slow mo. And who could forget Jek Porkins? Wait...Darth had nothing to do with that one, but it was pretty funny. Anyway, Episode III was an emotional, exhilarating film that not only gave us a visual extravaganza but also an epic story that impacted a generation of moviegoers while forever changing ""a galaxy far, far, away...."""
2951,10,Look deeper and you'll see it's actually excellent,"I greatly enjoy Revenge of the Sith. Sure, the dialogue is horrible in parts and it moves a bit slowly in places, but the foundations of the story are strong and the acting is fantastic. One thing I noticed watching the Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope in succession is that the inflections of Hayden Christensen's voice as Anakin are very similar to Vader's tone of voice. Sure, it could be because of the apparatus Vader speaks through but in my opinion it really ties Anakin to Vader. Hayden Christensen was a stellar actor considering the script that was given him, and I love Anakin as a character. And of course, Ewan McGregor was perfect as Obi-Wan. Ian McDiarmid fantastically reprised his role as Palapatine/Sidious, and Natalie Portman as Padme was, in my opinion, an excellent casting choice. Even though the dialogue is corny at times, the acting and the storyline are very strong, and they really captivate you emotionally. I cry every time I watch RotS. 10/10 film."
2952,1,Way to ruin one of the best stories ever told.,"Hayden or however you spell his name should be locked in a closet and forgotten about, he ruined one of the best parts in an epic film series ever. George Lucas did not live up to his old standards with this one and some of the editing choices in the film were very poor. What happened to the good old days of puppets, don't get me wrong CGI is cool but not when it looks like crap. I think Lucas jumped the gun in making all these films at the same time, he should have made the first one and developed the rest as technology got better. And how does dialog like this get approved? I could have written better dialog on a couple of Zanex and a bottle of whiskey after being up for a week. The story is however incredible, to bad it was ruined. And thank God for the original Star Wars God bless Lucas for that."
2953,9,Thank you GL!,Thank you George Lucas for ROTS. This movie really brought everything together and made up for the previous shortcomings. I was most pleased with the mastery of CGI Yoda. He didn't look CGI and this allowed for some of the best light-saber duels in the trilogy. Actually I can't recall a scene in the movie where I thought it was computer animation. One of my favorite scenes is Yoda verses the Emperor.
2954,9,masterful,"ROTS is a masterpiece, if flawed."
2955,10,"I'm not a critic, that's why i loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!","I have to say first off, that anyone who sits through a movie, just to pick out it's flaws, needs to get a freakin' life!!!! It's just a movie for cryin' out loud!!! Enjoy it for what it is. In the history of motion picture, there has NEVER been a movie made that didn't have some sort of flaw. Nobody's perfect. If you feel you can make a better movie, quit your whining and go out and do it!!!! Revenge Of The Sith is the best of the new trilogy. I am debating whether I liked it over Empire or not. It's a toss up. Yes Obi-Wan had some crappy lines and R2 was the comedian of the movie, but that's what makes this film unique. Star Wars is Star Wars, no matter how crappy someone may think the movie is. Heck even the original trilogy had it's issues. If I remember correctly, Star Wars (being Ep 4: A New Hope) had several flaws, one of which being that at some point on Luke's Speeder you can see the wheels under it. I couldn't see it, but then again I ENJOY ENTERTAINMENT so I don't look for flaws."
2956,10,The Best Star Wars Movie Of All Time,"First of all as a Prequel Fan I should admit that this trilogy had some flaws. Episode I and Episode II weren't as good as the fans wanted them to be but at least they helped the plot by telling necessary stories. Revenge of the Sith totally redeems the trilogy. This movie still has some flaws like bad dialogue in few scenes but it really doesn't ruin the movie. Anakin's turn to the dark side is told great, the Order 66 is great, the final battle with Anakin and Obi Wan on Mustafar is perfect. This movie is the best Star Wars movie. It has everything you want."
2957,8,In our top 3 Star wars films.,"There has been much talk about how good the prequels actually were, while we agree the first two are not great, the Revenge of the Sith is an exemption, this Film actually stays true to what star wars is all about and gives us many memories. The best things about it include:"
2958,8,Farewell Star Wars; you've been thoroughly enjoyable!,"I saw ROTS on the opening night and also two days ago, and have to say that the film is pretty good. Yes, the dialogue is pretty clunky, but Jedi's are fairly boring people aren't they? No-one ever had a go at Leonard Nemoy for Spock talking in constant monotone. We all know that Portman and McGregor a good actors-leave off them!! The opening battle scene sets the tone for the film brilliantly, with comic moments from R2-D2 to boot. General Grievous is an inspired choice of villain, although his breathing problem isn't exactly what I'd call original! Again, the film has a few too many meetings of the Jedi council, that seem to hold up the action slightly. But if Lucas thought they were necessary, so be it. Anakin's turn to the dark side is swift in the context of the film, but you have to remember how he's veered towards evil in episode two."
2959,2,Don't be fooled by some of the high ratings on here,"This movie is truly terrible. It is the best prequel, but not by much."
2960,10,The Prequel Trilogy goes out in style,"A great movie, very thought provoking, funny, very sad and ultimately very satisfying, a superb bridge to the Original Trilogy and as they all are a great stand alone movie. As with all Star Wars films , see them yourself and make up your own mind. The movie starts with an epic space battle which builds and builds, then we start a roller coaster ride of political intrigue interspersed with numerous lightsabre battles. Anakins fall from grace is well engineered, he is after all basically good, just suffers from the same fears as us all, but becomes to possessive and manipulative and it's these flaws that Palpatine exploits and a few unwise choices later is tricked into becoming Darth Vader by default. But as I always say, don't take mine or anyone else's view, go see it yourself and make up your own mind."
2961,8,A underrated tragedy.,So to be honest it's hard to watch film you know the ending of and what happens before without worrying how it will go and that's the point this story literally ties it all in and shows us how it happens. There is a lot to fill in between episode 2 and 4 so this is definitely a fast paced film. For me it's definitely space opera tragedy at its best as the world created in the first two movies crumbles around you.
2962,10,Finally!,"I have never been so relieved walking out of a film... this belongs with the classic trilogy, at the moment its my joint fave with ESB, forget the 2 trilogy thing, it should be a quadrilogy; i refuse to recognise the first two prequels."
2963,8,Infinitely better than the other two prequels,"I liked it! I wasn't expecting it to be better than oh, say . . . Attack of the Clones, but it was good! A great connector between the original series (which it couldn't compare to, but that would have been impossible; no one expected that)and the prequels. Granted, there was maximum cheesiness from some of the lines (which I will not mention here)and some of the names (also which I will not mention here). Stuff like that made you want to say ""George Lucas . . . what were you THINKING?"" All in all, what came to my mind as I watched Episode III was ""Wow, this is infinitely better than the other two prequels. Cool, they're fighting!"" It was much, much darker and less kid-friendly, but I thought that it was for the best. Soooo . . . good special effects, enjoyable plot, no outstanding acting, but overall good. I'll definitely see it again."
2964,10,"best of the new Star Wars films, quite possibly as good as the old ones.","we really enjoyed this film. To be picky there are always going to be things that aren't perfect or as imagined they would be, but overall any disappointments were far outweighed by the good points. These included excellent action sequences, unsurpassed spectacle, and the highest tension in any Star Wars film (about halfway through, a really heart pounding scene marks the turning point). The new trilogy does not have the charm or wit or humour of the original trilogy, but The Revenge of the Sith, far more that episodes 1 and 2, make up for this with its pace and drama. It is not hampered by idiotic joke aliens or anything cute and cuddly, and the romance is kept well and truly under control so that it never becomes the embarrassment it was in Attack of The Clones."
2965,8,Lucas ties it all up with a satisfying bow,"The ""8"" I gave this movie was an average, the first half had a lot of awful dialogue but memorable--if getting old--visuals (exactly how many scenes of clone wars do we need?) ; the second half was terrific. We know what's coming in this movie (unless you never saw episodes IV, V & VI), but the fact that we already know what HAS to happen doesn't detract from the tale Lucas gives over when he gets around to actually telling us HOW it happened."
2966,7,"Great film, but it drags","The only problem this movie has is it's tendency to drag. The movie isn't too long, but the story just drags at crucial points in the story when other things should be going on."
2967,7,A wasted opportunity,"Ups and downs. The movie is certainly the best of the 3 prequels, but it still has problems. I loved the path that led Anakin to the dark side, very well written, and Christensen is very good. But, on the other hand, many of the climax scenes lack pathos: Obi Wan's reaction to Anakin killing the children, Padme's reaction to Obi Wan's report about Anakin's actions, for instance. The final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin is more a show off of abilities than a fight for survival and the sake of the galaxy (in their different point of view) and, again, it's flat and void of emotions. Many of the action scenes are spectacular and enjoyable, but just a moment after people are always too well combed, clean and fresh (dirty ripped clothes, dirty sweaty face, some scratches and blood here and there could help give the idea of what they've just been through. Again, they fail to give you the feeling of 'miraculously escaped from impending death'. Speaking of lack of emotional involvement, if someone told me I could watch Luke and Leia's birth without crying, I wouldn't have believed it. Sad but true, I was far from crying because of awful directing and poor screenplay. The only scene that managed to involve me on an emotional level was mutilated Anakin sliding in the lava and taking fire, but when he's rescued by Palpatine and bionic legs are put on him BEFORE curing and even washing his burned skin (or even remove his burned clothes!!!) it's simply ridiculous. Padme's death totally lacks pathos, again, and remains a mystery. Furthermore, she has just given birth to two children, isn't this enough reason to live? Has she been killed by Palpatine? If so, it's not clear. Last but not least, what about an echography? The story is set in a hyper- technological world and she had to wait to childbirth to discover she was carrying two babies. Jedi are definitely out of touch with the real world, too busy keeping the order and balance in the galaxy I guess, OK, but in the end, when Obi Wan asks Padme if the baby is Anakin's I laughed. Padme's been living with Anakin for at least 3 years and I bet Threepio is innocent."
2968,1,Lack of plot,"I was not sure whether I should have checked or not checked the ""Contains spoiler"" option, because telling the fact that this movie doesn't have a plot (yes, it doesn't) in a way ruins your experience of finding out. Well, it does have a ""plot"" in the sense that ""The Twins"", i.e. Lea and Luke, are saved from their nasty father. Bu that is about the same as saying that there is a plot in the new discovery series about the second world war, in the sense that the bad guys lose it in the end. Why? Because, on average a full 100% of the viewers already know this. On the other hand, my review doesn't contain a spoiler, but only an anti- spoiler, as it prevents you from spoiling your evening. To conclude, this movie is the worst one in the whole series and has only one positive aspect: You can watch the entire movie keeping on your Chewbacca suit (including the headpiece) and, even better, even keep on your Darth Vader helmet on top, and still be able to understand the plot."
2969,10,an intelligent review,the movie opens with a couple of dancing Jedi star fighters. not a lot is around them but their movements are strangely hypnotic and you wonder what there mission might entail. the much larger starship they are dancing around wisps out of the way and you get your first glimpse at what is the heart of the move: WAR! a dazzling onslaught of technological imagery blends ever so delicately into dramatic brilliance in the 20 minute opening that you can only sit and marvel in the film's splendor.
2970,2,ugh,"It was like being hit in between the eyes by a wooden stick. I mean, honestly, George, what were you thinking? I enjoyed the original trilogy of star wars but was no massive fan. After watching episodes one and two i was disappointed, but hoped this film would redeem the series. all i got was a massive kick in the nadgers."
2971,10,'Bad Acting'? Where?? THE most emotionally charged Star Wars film.,"I really don't get how this film has ""bad acting"" as an overall attribute. The performances were excellent. You get a few bad lines here or there (the ridiculous ""NOOOOO!!!"" comes to mind), but really I thought the acting was excellent. Christiansen REALLY proves himself this time around. Even though his transition from light to dark SEEMED abrupt, you can see in his face that he knows what he's doing is wrong. He is only motivated by the hope that he can ""save"" his wife, who may or may not have died anyway. Anakins problem is that he reacts too quickly. Maybe Padme never would have died, who knows."
2972,9,Bridging two Trilogies,"I was expecting to enjoy this film as an effects-laden version of what I'd had in mind since seeing Episode II, but it manages to be different whilst still being a Star Wars film. There are a few stylistic differences, but otherwise it's a pure Star Wars film that fits perfectly."
2973,9,Awesome!,"I like all of the Star Wars movies, and yes i mean all of them. I don't see why everyone thought that episodes 1&2 were bad. Seriously I thought they were good. But anyways Revenge of the Sith was AMAZING!! It answers all the questions you had, and paves the way for A New Hope perfectly. I can't wait to see it again. It would have been even better if they had come out with episodes 1,2,&3 before 4,5&6 but you can't always win. So i definitely recommend that you see it. It is so good. In my opinion it won't come out on DVD fast enough. Even if it comes out next month it will still have been to slow, for such an awesome movie. And I am babbling on only because this review wasn't long enough till now."
2974,7,Best of the Prequels by Far,A definite improvement on Ep I & II. Only time will tell if it should be grouped with Ep IV - VI in terms of quality.
2975,7,A magic circle is closed. You HAVE to see it..with your own eyes..,"OK, I admit it. ""Revenge of the Sith"" has brought me back to those wonderful times and to those sessions seeing Star Wars back to my childhood. I saw these films a million times and I really feel that they somehow had some effect on the concept of cinema I have today. As so, Lucas did a really good job immortalizing the hexology. Those kind of feelings will never change in my head - Star Wars will always be among the most incredible movies of all time. As to ""The Revenge of the Sith"", despite some really bad physically impossible parts (like that fire thing!!) which I guess has lesser importance in the sci-fi genre and some forced dialogs tending to give the film a nostalgic view, it still is, undoubtedly ,the best of the three sequels. The obscure concept of this one, and the dark side omnipresence makes it a so much serious film. It ends as we expected, of course, but Lucas did after all surprise us and the way the film connects to episode IV touches perfection. All of the actors are good, but none of them is excellent, what brings some equilibrium to this film. In fact, we have a very very good interpretation of Senator Palpatine, who became a terrible sith lord. In my vision, we must see Star Wars as a whole one big film - it is and always will be an epic sci-fi masterpiece, or maybe, THE masterpiece, as it will always be a reference in the future days of cinema. The circle is closed."
2976,10,Fitting Finish,"Excellent finish to a legendary saga. With better dialogue it could've been one of the greatest movies of all time. But let's face it, the original trilogy (well A New Hope at least) had some awkward dialogue, we've all just grown accustomed to it over the years. Cut the film some slack too for lack of surprises since I'm sure the people who complain about this found out as much as they could about the story before seeing the film. And finally, of course Ewan and Ian were great, but Hayden did a wonderful job too. People need to understand that THIS IS THE GUY WHO BECOMES DARTH VADER! Don't expect him to be the Fonz. He acts serious and scowlful for a reason. I still think he used a Jedi mind trick to romance Padme..."
2977,,Let the eight - ten year olds be the judge.,I've read a lot of peoples reviews regarding all three of the new Star Wars films. A large majority have taken great pleasure in pointing out all the pitfalls and failings of the new films compared to the old.
2978,9,My favorite movie of '05 so far,SPOILERS!!!
2979,10,The saved for last,"The Revenge of the Sith is, to my personal point of view, the best movie of the saga, of the year, of the decade, and I am not that big a fan of Star Wars, I don't know anything about the expanded universe, save for The Clone Wars, and only because it ties directly to this Episode nor do I know anything aside from the main characters, but this movie it truly is a masterpiece, the movie opens with an amazing fast-paced sequence and it never slows down, and the few slow moments are pretty well done and flow very natural, we see a very, very conflicted Anakin, and you truly feel his pain as he is torn apart between the light and dark side of the force, The Duel is amazing, truly absorbing, the only complaint I may have is this..."
2980,8,Lucas makes amends...,"Relief!! Don't get me wrong... I don't dislike I & II, but they were a bit short of the mark, Ep III plugs the gap very nicely, some great sequences, character development and no complaints about the CG! General Grievous kind of eases the pain inflicted by Jar Jar. As a big fan of the originals I kind of felt that justice had been done, that the balance had been brought back to the force, so to speak."
2981,10,Did you ever hear?,"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create...life. He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power...which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself."""
2982,8,Lucas Wised Up and Delegated!,"As one who did not trust any reviews or ravings preceding this film (we saw it all before when CLONES was hailed as ""The best since EMPIRE"" and turned out to be another dud), I have to say I was thrilled. I'm not going to get into all the hits and misses, read enough other reviews and you'll get the picture. I will simply say it finally feels like a STAR WARS movie again."
2983,1,Awful story Dreadful actors,If it wasn't graphics and the 70's sequels this movie would have registered as one of the biggest blunders
2984,9,The best Star Wras movie ever!,"Oh my god are those people crazy who vote 1 or 2 stars out of ten????? For me this was the best of ALL Star Wars episodes! The special effects were just WOW the story was good, i mean now you know how Anakin became Vader and nearly every question was answered. Why do the people always say that Hayden and Natalie cannot act? Hayden did a very good job (and he is so sweet) and Natalie is for me one of the best young actresses, she just could not show her BEST, because all action scenes were done by the male persons. And why do people always critic the love scenes okay some were really schmaltzy, but it belongs to the story and for me the two have a lot of chemistry!! All in all it was a wonderful,sad,thrilling movie and George Lucas is a genius!!!!!!!!"
2985,5,"A good movie, but not as good as I hoped","Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith has to do about the fall of Anakin to the Dark Side of the force. If you have seen the Original Trilogy, there is not really much to spoil."
2986,10,Ties everything together well!,"I have been a fan of the orig. trilogy since I was a young girl and up until now I have found the new Star Wars episodes to be OK, but not close to the originals. This time though, I thought that Episode III tied the old together with the new well. In Episode III, we are able to see how the classic Star Wars saga is set up and many missing holes are filled in. In this Episode III, I actually felt a few moments of familiarity as we glimpsed into the early lives of some of our beloved familiar characters. Watching this movie definitely made me want to rush home to watch A New Hope again and this time with a new perspective."
2987,10,Travesty done to Lucas' life work,"Star Wars Episode III ; The movie that is a connection between stories of a sexology and most demanded movie for 6 yrs for some and almost 30 for others. Well done, this film is fills in what the crowd had been waiting for. I sit at Loews Fresh Meadows, NY and what happens at the very climax, the most anticipated climatic ending of all movies, the screen blanks with the audio still rolling. It is too late for the apologies as, with no picture, hear Darth Vader's first breath. A wait of 10 minutes until they fix and the picture starts rolling, but it is too late, it is not the same and have ruined something I've waited for and many others too."
2988,10,Revenge of the Sith - A Review,"If Return of the Jedi was about the redemption of Anakin Skywalker, then Star Wars Episode III - The Revenge of the Sith was about the redemption of George Lucas and the legacy he created and nearly destroyed."
2989,10,Best Movie Ever!,"I loved this movie! It really shines a light on how Darth Vader isn't the evil person people think he is. It also shows how Obi-Wan Kenobi might have the Dark Side in him as well. I feel this movie is far better than the Original Trilogy and the New Trilogy (TFA and TLJ). I still can't believe Obi-Wan would do that to Anakin! He didn't even try to help him! To conclude, Anakin Skywalker was portrayed perfectly by Hayden and could not have been better! If you have heard about all the hate on the prequels, don't believe it. Watch the movies for yourself and see how amazing they are!"
2990,10,"By George, He's Done It!","I am unabashedly a Star Wars fan; have been since 1977 when I first saw it as an awe struck 8 year old, right up to now. I have enjoyed all the films greatly, particularly the original trilogy. The prequels, however, have for me always lacked the magic that those first three great films held for me. Well, I'm hear to tell you that THE MAGIC IS BACK! I had high hopes for this movie going into it, but I expected that it would probably only be a little better than Attack of the Clones. Boy, was I wrong. It FAR exceeded my expectations. Lucas has created a fun, exciting, visually beautiful, sometimes frightening, often moving film that does not disappoint. Sure, there are a few lines of dialog here and there that are pretty hokey (listen to Anakin and Padme speaking sweet nothing to each other) and maybe a scene or two that might have done well with a rewrite, but they're not enough to detract the experience of what is an incredible science-fantasy epic. Lucas proves that he is the master of visual storytelling, more so than in any of his other Star Wars films. Ewan McGregor has channeled Alec Guiness and has come full circle to become Obi-Wan Kenobi. He IS this character now, and you see that on screen by how comfortable he looks in the role. And it's a good thing, because we see as much of him as we do Anakin here, and the audience has to be convinced that he and the man we see 20 years after the end of Episode III are indeed one in the same. The other great performance is by the great Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine (the Emperor). He is wonderfully devious and now ranks up there with the greatest of villains, Darth Vader himself. I cannot express enough just how grand this film is. The opening sequence is one that will be remembered long after you have left the theater. The transformation of Anakin to Lord Darth Vader is done so well that even though we already know what Anakin's fate is, by the time we get to the point where he makes that final fatal choice I found myself desperately wanting him to make the right choice, to stay on the light side of the force. That's how well Lucas has painted this picture. We are immersed in this world and the stakes feel so high. Revenge of the Sith is a not-to-be-missed film, on par with The Empire Stikes Back, which I have always considered to be the best of the series. Now it has excellent company. That it wraps up this Star Wars saga is very befitting. I applaud you, George! This is truly your masterpiece."
2991,8,Nice Build-Up for the Original Trilogy,"Disclaimer: I am 18 years old and until now I had never seen Star Wars. While most people's view on Star Wars nowadays is clouded by nostalgia, here is my unaffected take on these 'classics'. I'm watching in this order: IV - V - I - II - III - VI"
2992,7,Thoughts,"Well recently I have just seen Star Wars Revenge of the Sith. I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't a little bit disappointed with the film. Don't get me wrong it was a very good film and it had its strengths and weaknesses, as does any film. A few things that I'm getting a little sick of in movies recently is the reliance on the special and digital effects. It's almost as if Lucas has gotten lazy. Episode 1 through 3 is absolutely bombarded with digital effects. Like Yoda, in Episodes 4-6 Yoda was a puppet and it worked. But in the new ones he's completely computer generated. Another thing, is the comic relief that Lucas threw in there. There was too much and it made the film seem corny. A third thing that I didn't like, was the acting. Hayden Christiansen is not the greatest actor in the world, nor is Natalie Portman. But Hayden played a good Darth Vader and you felt his pain and suffering. All and all it wasn't as good as I was expecting but it was very entertaining."
2993,2,boring and crap,"I think people only like this movie either because 1. they are nerds and they got so hyped up for its release and expectations that they simply didn't want to believe it was crap..or 2. They're people who, when they see something that is SUPPOSE to be good, they just tell themselves its good because thats what the rest of society 'probably' thinks."
2994,2,"A surprise, but a welcomed one",This movie gave birth to many memes that it isn't comprehensible.<br /><br />I am the senate
2995,8,Star Wars - Revenge of the Sith,Star Wars magic still alive.
2996,10,"Good Technics, Good Story and A lot of action scenes","I recommend to see the movie because Lucus shows his abilities to make Star War Episode III is very exciting and fantastic movie. This movie is better than Episode I and Episode II in term of more exciting and more action scene in the movie. I think this episode may better than other episode including episode IV, V and VI. IN term of actors, I think most of actors in this movie can show their abilities in terms of action scene a lot. Less drama scene in this movie that I like it because I love to see more action scene than love scene. If you would like to see great action movie and great fantastic movie, you should not miss this movie. Pornthep"
2997,7,Better but not the best,"Return of the Sith is better than it predecessors but chapters four and five are still the best. Visuallly stunning and detailed to the finest, I still prefer the movies four and five because you had never seen anything like it before. Now they have turned into a virtual video game. Some parts of the movie were far fetched. The last scene with Anakin fighting Obi Wan wan for one , no pun intended, was ridiculous."
2998,7,every thing you could hope for,"This movie has maybe three to for instances in its showing where the dialog is poorly written and as a result the acting is wooden.other than these moments sith is an excellent movie.Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid steal the show. Hayden Christiansen gives and excellent performance while completely dropping the terrible whining he had in clones. the coolest thing i think is we find that Darth Vader is not and evil person, but a good person doing evil things. is sole purpose is to save padme but unfortunately at any cost. he is a redeemable character despite even murdering the young lings which although not shown is the darkest part of the movie when he ignites his light saber towards the young lings and the sound travels through the theater and into your blood. Yoda is masterfully done to the point where he is and actual actor and not an animation. the graphics are as usual spectacular but the darkness of the story really shines through. with epic battles at every turn and masterful manipulation on the Jedi and senate sith is really is all you could ask for."
2999,2,Why?,"Why has Lucas been so corrupted by the dark side of commercial film making? Surely he had enough millions of dollars already to safely rest on his laurels and retire the series as it was meant to be? Or at least produce a half-decent attempt at the prequels? I was brought up on the original SW trilogy. I loved it as a child and I still think (objectively, I hope) that it was one of the best-told stories ever done on film. What a way to sell out and bastardise the foundations of an entire sub-culture in our society."
3000,4,"Still doesn't cut it, not quite","There MAY be a few spoilers in this review, but they have been kept to the absolute minimum."
3001,8,Reasonable attempt at salvaging a storyline,"Lucas does a reasonable job of salvaging his beloved storyline. Special effects achieve Lucas's tight standards, but the actors still lack the passion to tie the special effect scenes together. The action sequences and light saber play could have stolen some techniques from Hong Kong (ala Matrix) and improved the action quality. The character of Padmé finally comes full circle as the Yoko Ono of the Jedi. Hayden Christensen, however, just has one look - angry at the world. I wouldn't call that acting. His portrayal of Annakin Skywalker is particularly disappointing. The drama leading up to his turn to the dark side is virtually non-existent and not very believable. All in all. Lucas did a good job of tying the story together, didn't throw in characters you hate (Jar Jar) and created a respectable sci-fi action film."
3002,7,"It has it's flaws, and does drag at times..but still one of my favorites of the series.","I just recently watched this again, and I must say; it's all in all not that bad of a movie if you can accept some of the lesser qualities, and take it in for the big picture. It's still fun and tells a great story. It also has a good range of emotion, along with some amazing symbolism (which of course is a staple of the films). I feel a lot of people were too hard on Lucas at the time. I can understand where a lot of people were coming from though. I myself was not even a fan of some of his decisions at the time. However, given everything in the prequel trilogy, yes it could have been better, but also could have been a lot worse. Also...come on...at least we got Darth Maul out of the whole thing."
3003,10,Best movie of the whole saga,"First of I was pretty upset to see that critics would say that the movie is making fun of Gerge Bush, which it doesn't; their reviews are just biased and unrelated to the movie. The movie starts off excellent, and never stops to amaze with stunning visual and fight scenes that make the ""Matrix"" look like kids fighting in the playground over who gets on the swings first. But i must admit the movie is not shot in THX surround sound, at least not when I saw, but it doesn't screw over the movie the slights notch. All in all the movie is perfect needed no more nor less. Come on, thank Lucas for not putting credits before the movie like every other movie, now that would make Star Wars III a (9) instead of a (10."
3004,6,"Criticize this movie, I must !!!","Although I have never criticized the prequels like the way which somebody did, I believe that this time I must."
3005,9,Awesome!,"Now, don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars, but after the last two movies, I wasn't so sure about this one. I had heard pretty good things from my friends about it, so that got my hopes up. Then, I saw it, and it was great (except for some parts)! To start, Hayden Christiansen was a lot better in this movie than in the last one. I thought he did a great portrayal of the downward spiral into Darth Vader. Besides him, Ewan McGregor and Ian McDirmid were very good...well, except for Palpatine's ""goooooooooooooooooood"" line. That was a bit overdone. Then, there was Padme. I didn't hate her, I just didn't enjoy the scenes she was in. They were just kinda boring."
3006,9,Staying true to the original Trilogy and Story,"Okay, so I'm a Star Wars fan, being the generation who grew up with Episodes IV, V & VI. As a result, I may have a slightly biased opinion towards the conclusion of the prequels.<br /><br />Ep. III tops the bill as the best one from the prequels in my opinion. Come-on, it did get 25 wins and 61 nominations!! And the Star Wars Saga has often been described as ""The Most Iconic Movie Collection of all Time""!<br /><br />Admittedly, it's a long film and the first half comes across as quite boring and political. However, it really helps to complete both the story and background to the Star Wars Saga, culminating in a 'tour-de-force' climatic second-half to the film.<br /><br />Both actors and actresses fulfill their roles very well, with excellent performances from Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and Hayden Christensen, helping to bring Episodes I, II and III to their ultimate fulfillment - the downfall of Anakin Skywalker and birth of Darth Vader. I know it's a long film, but just sit back and just enjoy it for what it is: the penultimate fulfillment to Episodes IV, V and VI."
3007,10,You are the chosen one!,"No movie has struck me so hard like this one, I came out of the theatre; excited, devastated, and so satisfied. (Weird mixture of emotions for a movie)<br /><br />The funny thing is, we all knew the biggest spoiler of the movie, Anakin turns into Vader, but the journey and the setting to get to that point is what matters.<br /><br />Anakin was my hero as a kid, I wanted to be a Jedi, and seeing him killing children and fighting his mentor to death as a 9yo... no words can explain the feeling.<br /><br />Best movie of my childhood!."
3008,4,Boring people doing uninvolving things,"I notice from the voting breakdown that 47% of voters gave ""Revenge of the Anagram"" a full 10 points. Sad. I suppose that's what happens when you give 15 year olds the vote. Based on Yoda's dialogue alone the film would rate a 2 at best and Yoda's advice about emotional connection to Anakin was just a dreadful piece of pseudo-profound nonsense. The Wookies made more sense."
3009,7,"Better than previous two, but that's not saying much...","This movie is about as good as anyone could have possibly done with trying to bridge the gap between the first two prequel movies to the original Star Wars film. Unfortunately, the first two prequel movies were very uninteresting; too much CGI, bad dialogue, bad acting, etc. The high points have to be Chancellor Palpatine and the huge fight scene at the end, but everything in between was just OK. I used to consider myself a ""huge star wars fan."" But now after seeing the three prequels, I find I really only ""love"" Empire Strikes Back. Overall, i find this movie only disappointed me yet again even though I did appreciate the darker tone. It is called ""Star Wars"" after all."
3010,9,My compliments to the chefs!,Where to begin? From the thrilling opening moments when about a zillion things zoom all over the screen to the final tragic death of Padme at the hands of a midwife droid - THIS FILM ROCKS! Is this George 'God' Lucas's finest moment? The battle scenes on Mustafar are easily the best part of any of the six films (apart from when we first get to meet Darth Maul) and the lava is particularly convincing - something I know is hard to get right in films.
3011,10,Rises the same hight as giants as LOTR and The Matrix,Spoiler!! SPOILER!! SPOILER!!
3012,10,It's a very good prequel/sequel,"I just went to see the movie with my wife (she didn't want to go) and finished loving it too. It was a very sophisticated and unreliable experience, and it has all to win an Oscar. The special effects were superb and the story has understandable statements in every aspect. For a person who doesn't follow the star wars craziness, it will be a very good movie to watch even if they haven't seen the other productions. Though there are things that seem forced and unexplained, I think it was done specially for the fanatics. I'm not a 100% one of them but in my opinion it is a good long story that will last forever in the history of the movies. George Lucas is a great storyteller. Bravo!!!"
3013,9,Great fun,"I found Revenge to be one of the best of all the Star War films.The story tied in very neat with A New Hope and all questions where answered to satisfaction.The lightsaber Duels in the film where by far the best in the series and Lucas really did a good job showing the Jedi's and Republics demise .I would be careful when taking children as there are some very dark scenes in the film.I see there are lot of people giving unjustified bad reviews in some ways they are as follows: 1.Complaining about the dialogue in a star wars film in its self is funny I love the originals as much as anyone but come on be honest the dialogue was never great. 2.If you read current political views in some of the things said in the film you forgot to leave reality at the door and forgot you where watching a star wars film and simple just enjoy it. 3.Corny acting , great special effects and story are what made the original films so likable (Mark Hamill was never going to win a academy award for star wars guys.) 4. Last of all most of you guys being unfair are simply looking through adult eyes when you should be watching with the eyes that made you love star wars in the first place the eyes of a child.Case in point my nephews and niece are ages 3-9(of course lightsabers are their favorite things) and they love all the star war films."
3014,10,The circle is complete.........,"Okay I'll admit I was on the edge of my seat to think will Georgey boy make a terrible film here? But luckily he made the greatest film I've ever seen in my life! I was hoping for a return of the Pod-race events,but sadly no,maybe when the film comes out in October I'll see something about it.But if you misunderstood my previous statement I'll spell it out plain and simple,there is no Pod-racing in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith.But the film has a four armed robot with a grudge,a deformed 80-year old man who is as limber as Yoda's first light Saber duel in Episode II,a non vampiric version of Christoper Lee,and five incredible Saber duels,as well as an opening sequence that pretty much sent Peter Jackson's Ring into a puddle of mud.In short ladies and gentlemen,we have a film that even God went to the cinema for.What else could you ask for?"
3015,,The name Vader?,"Don't get me wrong I love Star Wars, huge fan all my life, but I just have a question about ""Sith."" I was under the impression that the name Darth Vader was going to be explained, I know you can't hold a candle to half of the junk said about the star wars films, but in the film the when Sidious ""knights"" Anakin, he just gives him the name with no particular significance. This has bothered me, just because for all intensive purposes, he could have called him Darth ""Pencil"". Does anyone see this? I just thought it would be cool if his name held up to something, like Vader in some particular language meant to give life, or cheat death."
3016,8,Great ending to an average trilogy!,"I just came back from the theater after witnessing the final chapter of the new trilogy... well what can i say, i'll make it as short as humanely possible since i'm dying to doze off a bit and tomorrow i won't bother writing anything anyway (i'm sure of it)."
3017,4,Lucas should have watched Star Wars before he made this.,"It's not that this is a terrible movie. It's not. It's just not the same type of movie at all. I could go ahead and list all the problems with the movie, but it's been done hundreds of times on this site."
3018,7,Heros hanging from edges,"One can relate this Stars Wars installment to a roller coaster ride in a fantastic theme park. You know exactly what to expect, you know its not going to go off the track, and you know that things will be whizzing past you too fast to truly observe and absorb the stage."
3019,10,Hello there,Hello there
3020,6,"Better than the last, still not as good as the first.","I am not really surprised that this movie did well at the box office. I was disappointed once again, by this installment. Really everyone else seems to think that Lucas has redeemed himself. But really, it isn't as good as the first three. It isn't as good as half of the movies that hit the box office this year. Yet everyone is just thrilled that it didn't stink as bad as the first. One thing that really disappointed me was that this one didn't live up to the promises of the first three movies. Obi Won said in the first movie how great a Jedi Anakin was, and how great a friend. I felt let down that we didn't get to see him being a great Jedi. I didn't see him being great at anything, but whining. Obi Won kicked some major butt, and the fight scene at the end where Obi Won carved him up like a turkey was cool. It also didn't make any sense that Mace Windu could get the emperor on his back in a fight. Then Yoda turns around and gets his little green bottom spanked in a duel. Isn't Yoda supposed to be the best swordsman ever? And another thing that bothers me is, at the end the Jedi, we were led to believe that the Princess was raised by her mother. Now we find out that she didn't know her mother either, so that is kind of don't make any sense either because it comes up at the very end of the movie and Luke wants to know what his Mom was like. Leah say she was sad. Maybe she should have told him it didn't matter, because she was adopted. Seriously what did Leah's stepmother have to be sad about? There are just way to many let downs to go into. Watch it if you want. It isn't the greatest, but it is better than the last two."
3021,10,it is a pretty cool to be a Jedi,I was surprised that Luke Skywalker is Darth Vader.But other than that the movie was AWESOME!!!!!I would watch it every day if I could. Because it was SO good!!!!!!!!I LOVED it!!!!If only the director showed the movies in order.That would help with the confusion.A lot of confusion.I wish I could watch it everyday!That would be a dream come true.
3022,1,To dark and evil,I thought the last episode was to dark and evil.
3023,10,very much so lives up to expectations,"Overall, Revenge of the Sith was a very good piece of film. The action was fantastic, the storyline was great, and special effects were spectacular. "
3024,10,Greates series of movies ever!,"Grapichs was great, just like George Lucas to create a masterpiece. Story line is one the best out of all the movies. Star Wars is truly the greatest saga in the world. The final fight between Kenobi and Anakin is definitely the best light saber fight out of all six movies. It is great from the introduction on. You have to hang on to your seat from the very first scene because there is nothing better than being dropper strait into a fight. Creature creation in this movie is very good, I lover Gen. Griveous (top notch character). The acting was very well done Ewen McGreagor (Kenobi) is deffinently in my pole of the top ten greatest actors of all time."
3025,8,My favourite from the new saga,Still not the best but from those 3 this one was really good.
3026,9,From Constipation to Serious Sith,"Thinking back on The Phantom Menace, which was nothing but poor acting in front of green screens, and Attack of the Clones, of which only meagre love scenes and a hilarious fight between Yoda and Count Dooku come to mind, Revenge of the Sith cannot possibly be any worse. Still, Episode III begins poorly, with emotionless performances from actors who have noticeable difficulty with acting in front of green screens. You almost start to think that the movie's title is nothing but an anagram, referring to the powerless impressions of constipated actors. Lack of emotion also arises because the Clone enemies are computer-generated robots. The special effects division seems to have taken over everything. What is it they want to prove? ""Look what we can extend for over two hours with less than ten live actors""? A turning point is reached when Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) fights General Grievous, the Clone leader. The story picks up speed, introducing human emotions, something that the first two prequels painfully lacked. Maybe Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) eventually turns over to the Dark Side a little too easily, but when you compare the arguments given to him by Ian McDiarmid's wonderfully overacted role of Chancellor Palpatine, to Windu's (a very miscast Samuel L. Jackson), you would probably do the same thing: Palpatine is by far the most convincing character in the movie. Anakin, now called Darth Vader, lets his anger and frustrations take the overhand as he joins the evil Sith. With this, the original Star Wars sensation finally surfaces, even though it comes in its darkest shapes. The final fight, although dominated by special effects, is very compelling and the way Vader is left for dead is bloodcurdling. The finishing scenes are meant to neatly tie up loose ends, securely linking this movie to the next (or is it: the previous?). Episode III finally brings emotion to the screen. Moreover, it succeeds in recalling the true Star Wars feeling. It's a nuisance that some shots are corrupted due to special effects overachieving (there are over 2,200 special effects shots in this film, more than Episodes I and II combined), and that some actors can't stand their ground in front of green screens but in the end Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the three prequels. George Lucas manages to strike the right tone once again, and he turned this movie into some seriously good sith."
3027,10,the 2005 movie of the year,"if you weren't born when the old ones came out then this will make you love them. it is lucas once more at his best. its got everything , space battles , numerous lightsaber battles , emotion , visually spectacular new planets and the newly scary bad guy general greivous(i think thats how you spell it). right from the start you're shot into the middle of a space battle, the best yet. so many lightsaber battles, you lose count. yoda faces off with darth sidious and the inevitable between Anakin and Obi-Wan. great visuals add to the makeup of the star wars Galaxy and overall make it the best the film could be. an emotional ending adds to making the film better and the last shot of the twin suns is classic"
3028,8,Luca's Revenge,"Wow! Great last 10 minutes when someone at Lucas Films said ""hey, the next one has a 70's look"" and you see that in those 10 minutes star ships, customs and scenarios roll back to the very beginning of this saga. Great flashback to when I was 9 and got amazed for the very first time by Star Wars."
3029,8,"Fast, intense, epic, fun, and... engaging!","I'll give this scattered review a shot without using that now ubiquitous movie-review buzzword: ""flawed"": When ""Sith"" is at its best, it ranks right at the top of the series. ""Phantom"" wasn't nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be (more like a good movie wanting to break out of a mediocre one), and despite the romance angle, ""Clones"" overall was better than ""Jedi."" Going into it, I'd suspected ""Sith"" might end up side-by-side with ""Clones"" in the middle two as far as ranking the series goes, but one has to give serious thought that this may even be better than ""A New Hope"" (but why stop there?)."
3030,9,The misjudged prequel jem,"Revenge of the sith is a movie often judged by many for beeing lacking and soulless. Although the movie contains bad screenwirting and some scenes where actors underdeliver. The movie is action packed from start to finish where love, power and betrayal make the viewers sit at the edge of their seat. Through the whole movie. Superstars like Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee elevates the movie exerience with their talents. Epic fighing scenes in space and on the ground baffels everyone who experience them. In addition, the touching story of good becoming evil is truly a welltought out tale which Gorge Lucas had been setting up for over two decades.<br /><br />In conclution. Give this movie a chance. It's a good movie experience. Despite what the internet says about the movie. This jem from the starwars prequal series has been wrongly hated and aged quite well. This is why I like this movie and I think you will to, just watch it with an open mind."
3031,5,Good effects,"The special effects were good as to be expected. Good action but clunky,chunky writing again. Where were the Wookies? I expected to see so much more of them. Anyone else think that when Vader freed himself from the restraints at the end that it was like watching Frankenstein? The scene where Skywalker pledges to the Sith was lame. It was as if he flipped a coin and it came up tails and said ""Sure, I'll join you."" Where was the major conflict leading up to Vader joining the Sith? I was expecting so much more of a conflict with Skywalker becoming Vader than was given in the movie. With Samual Jackson, you kept waiting to hear ""Yo, Sith lord, your butt bout to get whipped"" He was obviously the street Jedi."
3032,10,A fitting end to an amazing saga,"WARNING, SPOILERS BELOW..."
3033,6,The Saga is now imperfect,"What's good: At long last the Sith stop being a ""Phantom Menace"" and actually come out and show their faces. One thing that made the original trilogy so great was the constant presence of a great villain. In the prequels, that villain is greatly lacking, until now. Ian McDiarmid gives a compelling performance, and the scenes between him and Anakin are the best part of the film (could of used more of that back in Episode I)."
3034,9,The End of the beginning...,...and it ends not with a whimper like Matrix :Revolutions ..but with a bang...this movie is a stunning visual and plot based roller coaster..a joy for fans..it easily beats Return of the Jedi but comes short of Episodes 4 and 5..
3035,9,A modern Tragedy,This film completes the circle and is as powerful as watching a Shakespearean tragedy as the story powers its relentless way forwards toward the helpless destiny of its protagonists.
3036,10,The Best of the Prequels and One of the best in the series!,"All i can say is this... I saw this movie at Midnight last night and then in NYC AMC Empire Digital Screen theater at 3pm, it only got better with the second viewing, there is so much going on, you have to see this movie more than once, there is son much to absorb. The acting wasn't academy award winning ( Maybe Palpatine was ) but it was better than the last 2 prequels, the action was the best in all the SW movies, especially the space battle, and the Lightsabre battles. The emotion was good, the drama, and the Jedi temple massacre was moving. If you only ""liked"" the first 2 movies you'll love this one, if you hate the first 2 you'll may ""like"" this one... if your a ""TRUE"" SW fan as I am ( since 1977 I was 15 and saw ANH 17 times ) you will embrace this movie as Anakin embraced the Darkside."
3037,9,Good start...then bad...then better...then great....THEN EXCELLENT !!!,Best:
3038,9,A Beautiful Effort crippled by Dialogue,"Sooner or later, a man has to know his limitations. With Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas has everything going for him. The best story in the whole saga happens in Episode III. All kinks have been worked out in how he goes about making his movie digitally. He has but to think of it and his artists render it beautifully on a 40 foot screen. So it really hard to watch and digest this movie(, and it was one hard pill to swallow for me and I like Episode I and II,) and come to the realization that the only true failing of this film is the dialogue that George Lucas wrote. The dialogue is not only bad, its downright comical at times. I've already heard some bad things about the performances, especially Hayden Christianson's and I'm here to say you can't blame Hayden. I feel he played the part right but he was given horrid line after horrid line. Lucas owes this kid an apology. Its a rough 2hr21min. folks. I went to a midnight showing of this movie and while the movie ends with a downer I had expected as with Episode I and II to hear applause at the end credits. I personally mustered a few but like most in the theater I honestly didn't know how to react to this movie. I never knew a movie could be crippled by dialogue the way this movie was. Only the U.K. born actors gave performances that weren't marred by it. ROTS had all the makings of the greatest chapter in the Star Wars saga. I can't whole heartedly recommend this film but I do love it with its one great flaw."
3039,7,Unexpectedly good,"I went into this movie for a rewatch expecting to hate it, mostly because its two predecessors were so awful. But the truth is, this movie is pretty good. Sure, it's nowhere near as great as the originals, but it's really just a fun movie up until the halfway point, when it turns into a tragedy. It's easily the saddest Star Wars film, ESPECIALLY if you've watched the final season of Clone Wars! Yes, it has its flaws-the dialogue is still bad-but I'm willing to look past that for the sake of the story. I've grown to love these characters, and it tied this trilogy with the originals quite well. It's really not my favorite Star Wars, but it's stood the test of time and is definitely one of the most entertaining. And anyways, Star Wars is at its best when you just turn off your brain for two hours and enjoy the ride :)"
3040,4,Boo Hiss Lucas!!!!,"Good action. Bad acting. It made me fall asleep during ""serious"" scenes. Did not like how it didn't explain how Darth Vader just all of a sudden had control over the entire death star operation. He should have changed to robot Darth half way through the movie and explain how he got power over so many people in the empire. The birth of Luke and Leia was the worst birth scene I have ever seen in a movie. Natalie Portman needs acting lessons. You can't just grunt for a few seconds and then pop, she screams ""Luke"", then another grunt, pop, and scream ""Leia."" Vader's screaming of ""Noooooooooooo"" when he became robotic was terrible also. George Lucas, I want my $10 back."
3041,10,"Atlas, Darth Vader is more powerful than Sidious.....","Excellent...Wonderful..Amazing....By far the best star wars movie ever.....A Jedi Anakin not getting his chance to become a master Jedi and his inability's to save Padme, Anakin has no choice but to destroy all the Jedi's, however Obi Wan his mentor was to great of a swordsman with his light saber.From the beginning to the end, it was all action.Not once i could of missed any second of this episode for it was the GREATES SHOW I EVER SAW..The graphics were phenomenon and the settings appeared real as Lucas wanted it to be for the audience.Lucas my friend and master, you're an amazing thinker and for your members in the star wars team you all did a wonderful job.What was so excellent about the show also was that every possible sequence made sense now and there were no questions again as most were answered for the sequence.People go and see this show cause the people of this world need star wars 7.8.9................infinity......Come on people.."
3042,4,Better than the other 2,"Its better than the previous 2 but is still pants. Push all 3 films together, scrap the awful pod racing, frog people, and dinosaur riding and you have one film which would have been OK. Lucas has a ham-fisted writing style and his scripts are awkward and force his actors to deliver lines which exhude cheese. His film direction still rocks but seems to be cluttered with techno rubbish, the opening shot is so forced and CGI'd that it looks like a video game. There is no great spectacle, just a mash of images which never really achieve the ""great"" impression on the viewer that a New Hope and Empire Stikes Back achieved. "
3043,6,"on balance not as bad as I expected, but...",Don't get me wrong. I am a fan of the original Star Wars movies. This effort is however not in the same league.
3044,9,Brilliantly traced climax to one of the all time great stories,"Though not without fault, this film is outstanding for 2 prime reasons."
3045,8,Bells ringing,"Entertaining as usual albeit a bit shallow at times, this is overall a good movie (I love special effects) and there is a little bit more in it that meets the eye."
3046,10,The Star Wars we once knew returns!!!!!,"YES!!!!! Its true, Star Wars as I remember it is back on top form. It's hard to describe what makes this film good and better than Episode I & II (which I liked but will admit they are not great), so you will just have to watch it to find out."
3047,7,"George Lucas, (almost) all is forgiven","After the big disappointments of episode I and II, I had my hopes up for this one as it was going to feature Anakin Skywalker turning into Darth Vader, which would really tie the new trilogy together with the old one. Although the movie started 45 minutes later than expected, we got a bit of waiting-entertainment from Darth Vader who was walking around the theatre waving his lightsabre. When the film finally started, and the embarrassing Swedish translation of the text in the beginning had passed by, we got to witness a really well done mix of drama, humor, action and a bit of romance, and the scenes where the Jedi's are betrayed even made me feel sorry for them (something I probably wouldn't if it had been in episode I or II). If I was to rate this film compared to the old trilogy, I would probably say it's better than episode IV, no as good as episode V, but equal to episode VI. George Lucas, all is forgiven (except all the changes you've done to the original trilogy in the DVD-set. Hayden Christensen instead of David Prowse in episode VI? Pff!) Thank you George for a worthy ending to the saga."
3048,9,Epic movie,"I remember when I first watched it , the whole 6 movies in one DVD set in fact . a very long time ago in a ... never mind . anyway , I found the original trilogy to be a bit boring . but the new one really captured me , especially this epic conclusion chapter . and made me realize something : star wars is not just for ""nerds"" ."
3049,10,Best of the Best,"At long last, Star Wars fans can cease their salivating and dive into the last movie of the ever expanding saga. Star Wars III, Revenge of the Sith opened last Thursday morning at midnight to thousands of coffee overdosed Jedi wanna-bes and fans of all ages. This last feature film by director George Lucas is the one that everyone has been waiting for. Since the story of Anakin Skywalker originally unfolded way back in 1977, fans have been awaiting this ""lynch pin"" episode that by all expectations would hopefully answer every remaining question. Before another word is added to this review, you should be warned that yes, I was packing ""light saber heat"" that night in line with thousands of others holding my giant coffee, spouting off random Star Wars trivia to those who would listen. In short, I am a total Geek."
3050,10,A great finish!,"George Lucas is a genius! He created the most amazing love story, inter-galactic space story ever. Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is a perfect conclusion to a 6 part story. Watching this movie makes you want to go back and see episodes 4-6 again. So much is answered in this movie, some obvious, some not so obvious. I had to watch the movie twice to truly absorb it. I think its brilliant that Lucas left some wonder to the viewers' imagination. Anakin's downfall was very sad. His reasons for turning to the dark side are very sad. Watching Darth Vadar kill the Emperor in ROTJ is bittersweet. I now know the answer ""why"" and I couldn't be happier with the final result. Thank you Mr. Lucas for giving us the most amazing, entertaining story ever!"
3051,4,Disappointing,"My rating: 4, simply for the SFX."
3052,9,"A worthwhile trip to a galaxy far, far away","FINALLY! Star Wars is once again the highlight of our generation, as it was the generation before. A few years ago, I saw George Lucas slowly letting himself depend on special effects, hoping to cover up on the weak storyline in Phantom Menance and Clones. I had hoped desperately that Sith would be better. The first 2 minutes into the movie, I knew that Sith would be no disappointment. (As all movies do, Sith had flaws. It was annoying to see R2-D2 with more gadgets than in the 1977 original....) This movie was sad, but that could not be avoided. As we all expected, Padme dies at the fault of Anakin. The movie overall was very, VERY well done, not the corny love story of Clones, and not the innocence of Phantom Menace. I still think that nothing (yet) tops the original trilogy, but I found myself matching Sith closely. I almost cried at the end- it was that good. See it again, says I!"
3053,9,"Very well done, considering what other people said.","The reason I'm not giving this a 10 is because it wasn't exactly the perfect movie. The love scenes were kinda short and not very well done, but everything else was terrific. This shows a dark, sinister form of the Star Wars galaxy, similar to Episode V. But it doesn't lack in great battle scenes, terrific ships and war crafts, and some tidbits of humor here and there. And, without revealing the plot, some of my Star Wars theories were proved! Boo-ya! But seriously, with all kidding aside, this is a great film, and any die hard Star Wars fan will be impressed, unless of course, you are the kind of guy who only likes the original three."
3054,10,Excellent!,"I went to see Star wars and found it excellent! It's a lot better than the second one and perfectly meets expectations. I though that Natalie Portman was very credible as Padmé Amidala though Hayden Christensen's acting was a bit deceiving. Nevertheless, the plot is very believable and the settings and characters are unbelievable! Yoda, for example, is very well animated and looks as life like as can be, though he does seem a bit small compared to in the other movies. Obi Wan Kenobi is magnificently played by Ewan McGregor and Ian Mcdiarmid is more splendid than ever in his role as Chancellor Palpatine. The special effects are extraordinary: you could almost swear that the settings of the movie really exist. On the whole, a must-be-seen-soon movie to miss under no excuse!"
3055,9,The Force was this time with Lucas!,And back I am! It was totally amazing! 
3056,10,A real masterpiece,"All I want to say is that George Lukas is a real genius. I expected the movie to be very intriguing and dynamic, but it was just brilliant. The story cannot be told better. Every detail was entwined perfectly. In addition, the acting was so precise. Hayden was the best. He expressed Anakin's sorrow, rage and anger really well. The other actors were quite good too. I want to say that I underestimate the talent of George Lukas and i shall never forgive myself. I used to like the old trilogy more than the new one but Episode 3 is as good as The return of the Jedi. Congratulations Lukas you shut the mouth of all the critics who deny the merits of the best saga ever made! The force is still strong with you George!!!"
3057,9,George done good.,"I was seven years old again last night. I can remember watching Return of the Jedi with my parents, 22 years ago. Mom said I didn't blink once. George and company transported me back to that state of childhood enjoyment with Episode III. Revenge has got all the Star Wars pre-requisites: Great effects, sound, and score. Hokey dialogue. Fast pacing. Plus Revenge has what made Empire and Return so great; it develops a real empathy in it's audience for the characters. Which allows the ""hokey"" dialogue to be excused, even relished. The story we all know, yet the surprises are very much there, as is your desire to actually hope for something good to come out at the end, for Anakin to not degrade to the dark side, for Yoda and Ben to save the Jedi (and the Republic). For the Padme and the twins to live happily ever after. I have to say, well done George. All I want to do is see it again, right away. Now A New Hope has a greater sub-text, and it's exactly what you know it should be. In the hierarchy of Star Wars films, Revenge gives Return a run for it's money, and coming from this seven year old, that's enormous praise. There's a sense of sadness when the final credits roll; no more Star Wars to look foreword to. This is stayed, however, by the fact that all six films are exactly where they need to be, and Revenge threads nearly thirty years of story telling perfectly. Again- Well done George and Company. Well done."
3058,8,Full Circle...for me,"I've read a few posts and to some people Episode III was not what they were expecting. I totally respect their opinions. George Lucus is by nature an independent filmmaker. Like most independent filmmakers, they make movies for themselves. They tell stories they way they want and don't expect everybody to like their work. I respect Lucas for this and for all of the fans who didn't like the prequels, I'm sure he likes to hear their opinion. But that won't make him change his mind on how he made these films. Now to what I thought of Episode III. I LOVED the film. I liked Episodes I and II, but I like them even more after seeing this one. It made them even better in understanding the story of Anikan Skywalker. Plus, I think Hayden Christensen took some acting lessons for this one. That was good to see. Way to go Mr. Lucas, you told a great story that spanned 28 years and six films."
3059,10,"To: GEORGE LUCAS....Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you, thank-you, thank-you,thank-you, thank-you, thank-you, thank-you","OK, i hated Episodes I and II but holly crap George thanks for listening. I was so prepared to be disappointed I can't believe how much i enjoyed this movie. I've never given any movie a 10 out of 10 before this one (not to say that it was actually perfect, but considering the first 2 installments were sooo bad, Episode III makes up for all of them.) All those questions you were wondering about well guess what? They all get answered! I really didn't like Hayden Christiansen in Attack of the Clones but i have to say that the actor was a better fit for Anakin Skywalker in this movie. Natalie Portman was a bit of a nuisance but her scenes are all very short (and necessary for the movie.) Ewan Mcgregor and Samuel L Jackson both gave great performances (as expected) The lightsaber battles were awesome. I want to keep going but I think I'm starting to ramble....GO SEE THIS MOVIE! PS if you haven't watched to Clone Wars episodes 1-25 you should, they lead right up to the beginning of Revenge of the Sith and it gives you a bit of background on General Greivous"
3060,10,True to form - George Lucas come through on this one!,"Revenge of the Sith is the final episode to the six part Star Wars saga. While many fans will agree that Episode I and II were a bit lacking and not as good as the original trilogy, this one hits it home. Episode III is very much in the original style. The characters from the Star Wars Legacy: Yoda, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan, the full-circle story of Anakin (Darth Vader), and the birth of Luke and Leia take the forefront. Painstaking attention to details wraps up every loose-end leading into Episode IV, V, and VI with definite perks for the devoted fans who know much of the untold story. Amazing special effects, incredible acting, masterful story telling, and over-all breathtaking artistry easily rank this movie in the best top 10 ever. Fans will not be disappointed. This episode is crafted in the style of the original trilogy at the polite request/begging of Star Wars fans everywhere - details galore and it even includes those all important character fades. Worth the wait, and the effort. I've seen Revenge of the Sith 15 times now and I still catch something new whenever I see it. If you haven't caught it in the theaters yet, you'll soon regret not going. Star Wars was born to be big screen. Definitely a classic - Thank You George Lucas!"
3061,7,"Great Movie, but...","I believe Lucas made the 3rd best of the 6, but I think he should've shown Vador at his best(skill wise, we saw him at his worst evil wise). After Skywalker became Vador the only serious fight he was in, he lost. I believe it would have been better if he would have fought real Jedi at the temple. Also it would've been wicked to see him show up at the funeral and go nuts, Then ask what happened to his baby. That could've better shown why the children needed to be hid. It is better to show an audience instead of tell the audience if you understand what I mean. Too many times Lucas just told us. I wish I could ask him about the edit of the fight between Yoda and Sidious. It seems like a mistake to show Yoda on the floor of the Senate then the next time he is squeezing through a tunnel. It looked like a bad use of cross-cutting."
3062,8,"Good, but not great","I'm thankful that this one was not as unbearably bad as the first two prequels in the Star Wars saga, and am relieved to tell that it was a respectable film. The special effects, to begin with, were amazing. I enjoy exploring Lucas's world very much because of them. Moreover, I was very pleased, in general, with the performances. Other than Natalie Portman, who in my opinion was mind-blowingly mediocre, everyone did quite well. Especially Christensen! I was very impressed with his improvement from whining adolescent to dark antihero. Ian McDiarmid, though, was wonderful as the fearsome Darth Sidious. So, to conclude, I was impressed, but nothing compares with the original Star Wars films..."
3063,5,oh how the force of star wars has fallen,"this is simply a lament over and disassociation from the movies of episodes 1-3... i was really hoping to enjoy this last one.. episode 3 was supposed to be the one to close the story and let everyone know that lucas had some ounce of skill left. in my eyes and the eyes of everyone i went with tonight, the movie failed. the claps in our theater were filled with an eager hope at the beginning of the film and later turned to a mere empty shell of 'good job, nice try'... the best parts of the experience were the fanboys and gurls as they all pledged devotion to the film series with their costumes and light sabers, but even that, by the end of the film, was left in ruins and many of them removed their helmets and masks to reveal a look of sadness and disappointment. some may argue that this look was simply for the end of the series, but most will realize that those disappointed glances were simply for the fact that this series is still only half completed. as for the movie, it was filled with plot less dialogue, stoic cuts and fight scenes so saturated with CGI and motion blur that it was a chore to enjoy. the story line was punctured with so many sudden scene changes and instant story/plot changes, that it kept the audience from becoming engaged in any one aspect/struggle. lucas, you must know that this was total and utter failure. this movie and the preceding two are nothing and don't even stand to pale in the shadow of the original Star Wars series. In your attempt to simply reveal the basic story of how things came to be before episode 4, you have succeeded... but only in the most basic sense. what took you 3 films to accomplish could have been done in a simple 1 hour independent film. and it would have most likely drawn in the audience more, simply because the story would have been enjoyable. i went into that theater happy, excited and exhilarated... and have come out of it a totally disappointed shell of a lucas fan... from now on, when i see the lucasarts logo, it will bring a shudder instead of a smile. and when i hear the telltale theme from the original Star Wars, it will bring back memories of a phenomenal trilogy that was later (slightly clarified) by 3 greatly lacking pieces of computer generation... if my review sounds too negative, i am sorry. i am only speaking the truth. yes the jedi have fallen, and the sith have risen; but the force as a whole is no longer... in 25 or so years, i only hope that another, more promising film-master will be found to truly bring justice and balance back to this series. maybe this film-maker will only be an unskilled youth, but he will have no problem reviving this lost saga... but until then, may what is left of the force, be with you..."
3064,6,"The best of a bad bunch, but just too contrived","OK, it's better than the woeful part 1 and the mind numbing part 2, but lets be honest that's not exactly hard! Visually stunning this film falls down in too many ways to be a classic. Firstly the dialog's, clunky, too many one liners delivered by actors who; either know they are too good for it (Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson) or would find it hard to act their way out of a paper bag (Hayden Christensen). Only Ian McDiarmid has any decent script to play with and he does it beautifully. Unfortunately he is playing opposite the wooden Christnesen for most of it!! Secondly, we all know what's going to happen, in part 4 so we know that Obi Wan, Yoda, Vader and the Emperor wont die, and just about everyone else will. There are no surprises and as a result very little tension in the second half of the film. My biggest problem with the film is the turning to the dark side of Anakin. It happens so fast, one minute he loves his wife the next he's butchering ""Younglings"" it really doesn't flow. I think this probably stems from the actors lack of visible talent. I was delighted when the mask finally goes on and we get the beautiful tones of James Earl Jones instead. So I give it a 6, mostly for the visuals, stunning fights and because Jar Jar isn't in it!! I still feel that the world would have been just as good a place with only the original 3 films, which were all so much better that this."
3065,5,Not all that great a movie actually,"I, along with everyone else wanted this to be the ""great"" movie in the series. Unfortunately, it can't deliver. Although the positive buzz it is receiving may be self-fulfilling and might sustain it to be the highest money maker of the three."
3066,9,Excellent work George Lucas..finally a good new trilogy star wars movie,"Of course, I still have a few things to say about it."
3067,10,Excellent!,"I have always been a Star Wars fan. I loved the movies when I was a kid. Everyone was disappointed with Episode I and II. I actually liked them. it was very good and i think that they chose some really good actors for all of the parts. By far, this movie is my favorite. It is really sad because Plo Koon and Mace Windu get killed, well all of the Jedi do, but those two made me mad when they were killed. I think that Yoda was awesome. There at the beginning, i liked the little bit of humor George Lucas put into it, but all of the sudden in this episode, these droids can talk? and i think he went a bit far when there were those 4 or 5 word sentences, they were very choppy, but later in the movie it got much better. I like how they did the Darth Vader think, how they put the mask on and then next thing you know, he does his little breathing thing. It was awesome. When it comes out i'm gonna buy them all on DVD. I bet with new technology, Lucas will redo all of the old ones."
3068,9,Great movie,Right up their with A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Palpitane steals the show. Obi Wan is great as well. I really feel bad for Obi Wan at the end. Gut wrenching that's all I have to say. I liked this movie better than Return Of The Jedi and the other two prequels. Lucas was never known for his great dialogue. So I don't know why people are harping on that. Sure the actors in the original trilogy were better actors (Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford) but Ewon McGregor is right up there as well. Heydan Christansen was very wooden in my honest opinion but the verdict is still out on him as an actor. His career is just beginning. Let's see if he takes the path of Harrison Ford and not the path of Mark Hammill. Overall I loved this film and I gave it a 9 out of 10. May the force be with you.
3069,7,A solid 7/10 - some spoilers ahead,"I don't know that I can give a good review, because I didn't get sucked into the movie, I was always apart, aware that I was watching a movie, and kept noticing odd little things that I usually only notice after watching something 50 gazillion times."
3070,,"Pretty Good, the best of the Prequels","I saw the midnight premier last night and am running on literally an hour of sleep right now. So on that note, if I don't make sense, just bear with me. Definitely the best and most epic installment of the new Star Wars film's. Lucas pushes his flashy vibrant style to the limit, pulling out all the stops on graphics, fight sequences, and gigantic dog fights."
3071,8,The best of the prequels,"I went to Revenge of the Sith not really knowing what to expect. Everybody I know that had seen it was giving me mixed reviews. Some thought that it was terrible, while others said it was one of the best Star Wars movies ever."
3072,10,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen!!!,"After seeing Revenge of the Sith for a second time this weekend, I've come to the conclusion that ""Sith"" ranks right up there with The Empire Strikes Back as my all time favorite movie. Honestly, ""Sith"" didn't have any glaring weaknesses. The movie started off fast and never really slowed down. The action sequences was the best of any movie I've ever seen. And the special effects was one of a kind. Even the acting and dialog was MUCH better this time around. The people who criticizes it are only doing it out of spite."
3073,4,Same old same old,"Here we are, most people seeing this movie with the main purpose of seeing how Anikin turns over to the dark side."
3074,5,"Episode III: The Cirlce Is Now Complete, Thanks to George Lucas","Episode III is by far STAR WARS at it's best & obviously George Lucas at his best. This movie is the connecting piece, the last in the (until now) unsolvable puzzle. It's the long awaited story of Darth Vader's Birth & Anakin Skywalker's Death (From a Certain Point of View)."
3075,10,Oh my god,"Oh my god, this movie is Spectacular. I don't care how bad Episodes I and II were, this movie made up for all that and more. I am casting my vote for the greatest movie moment of all time for when Anakin first puts on the helmet that makes him Darth Vader and when he takes his first, ominous breath. The light saber battles were epic in every sense of the word and you are absolutely bombarded throughout the film with images, sounds and action. Lucas has created a masterpiece and hardcore fans and non-fans alike will love this movie. Several of my buddies, many of them extreme film critics thought that the film was terrific, and they don't even really like Star Wars! After seeing it, I wanted to immerse myself in Star Wars, to throwback to my younger days when all I did was eat, sleep and breath this stuff. There are pieces of dialog that are a little shaky but I was absolutely blown away at the quality and more importantly the improvement over the first two movies. Lucas didn't hesitate to pull out all the stops on this one. It was pure movie magic. The movie gave me chills, had me spasming in my seat with excitement and made me feel like a kid again. Fantastic. It had depth, plot, acting, action, love, heartache, brutality and was the perfect finish to the greatest set of films of all time. Thank you George, thank you."
3076,8,What a Movie (Contains very minor spoilers),"Man, What a film. I went in knowing that this was gonna be the one to break the Prequel deadlock, but i didn't know it was gonna be this good. The opening of the film was just great, with ships blowing up and Star-Fighters weaving their way through tight gaps, Magnificent. "
3077,8,"My faith, essentially, restored to the galaxy","A funny thing happened to me last night. I finally remembered what it was I loved about Star Wars. When I was 5 years old and watched the Original Trilogy, the fact that Luke was whiny and C-3PO was corny, didn't sway my opinion on the film... I just loved it. The thing of it was, I was experiencing real emotions and real sympathy and real attachment to people and characters that didn't exist, and was simply mesmerized by the spirit of the film. When I saw Episodes I & II, I was about 17 years old and starting judging movies by a different set of standards. Rigid acting, annoying JarJar, pitiful little boy Vader robbed me of what little faith in movie magic remained inside of me. At the ripe old age of 22, last nite, midnight ; I sat in my seat with pathetic optimism about how I was going to feel once the movie was over. I wasn't the only one either. I heard reluctant claps and cheers throughout the theater at the beginning of the movie, as though no one wanted the responsibility of having faith in this movie- even though we were all there at midnight! The opening action sequence was beautifully shot, fast paced, and entertaining ; but I was still shaking from nerves about what was to come. After the pretty lengthy rescue mission of Palpatine was complete and Anakin was reunited with Padme, and Padme told Ani that she was pregnant, I finally caught a glimpse of Christensen's improved development as Anakin. I always assumed that perhaps, Hayden was miscast, but he really surprised me within his first few scenes of dialogue, that he was worthy. But, more importantly...sitting in my chair, I felt the anxiety in my stomach leave me and I began to care all over again. I cared about Padme, about how Obi-Wan was going to feel when he realized that Ani was to be consumed by Vader. I was finally, once again, connected to what I was watching on the screen. Watching Ani slide into Vader was definitely THE aspect of the film that I found to be the most well done. You could simplify it, and say that his love for Padme and power to control his environment and people's destinies are what drove him to his subsequent transformation. You'd be correct in saying it, but there's loads more. Just the mystery surrounding his birth, born of the force, etc. you have to assume that there would have to be an inherent conflict in him. Also, the fact that he had a secret marriage, mistrust from his fellow Jedi, and knowing that he was a superior Jedi, and watching the Jedi waver on their own code. Combine that with your standard fair of human emotions: fear, jealousy, possessive love, death, and you realize that there was never any other way for Anakin to go. He had to embrace the light, the dark, and finally redemption. "
3078,10,A brilliant movie with some laughs and a sad ending,"The best Star Wars, second only to Return of the Jedi. It ties up all of the loose ends for the original trilogy. It does go slow at some places but does pick up speed very quickly. It has the best space battle other than Return of the Jedi. It has the most battles which makes our day. The battle between Yoda and the Emperor is the best fight scenes in film. The only real bad thing is the beginning sequence makes you a bit dizzy. The best thing is that we see our favourite characters again including some new characters like Chewbacca and General Grievous. It does make you cry when Natalie Portman dies and when all the Jedi die."
3079,10,What I enjoyed!!,"I loved this film. I thought it was the best film i saw EVER!!!! Ewan McGregor had the best lines & they were funny, e.g ""Always on the move."" Which i think is amazing how he says it. Anikin was as stunning as ever (even when he turns into Darth Vader) & don't get me started on Samuel Jackson who is HOT!!!! I give this 10/10 because of the great fights, great lines & sexy guys!!! Chewabacka is sweet & so is Yoda Jaja Bink's is in it for about 2 minutes, but he doesn't talk. If your wanting to see a film this summer, you'd have to see Star Wars 3 because it's the best film ever! It's better than the first 2 & I can't wait for the next one to come out. It's going to be a follow up to this one with Darth Vader getting revenge on Obi Wan Kenobi. So watch out for the 4th one!!! Can't wait!!!"
3080,10,We knew it was going to be the best and it is,"Most movies i've seen are ones where i go in, sit down, watch and then leave. I might talk about it to others for a few days afterwards but then the movie fades like a smell in the wind. The lead up to Episode III is amazing. The fact that Lucas didn't even know if A New Hope would even be liked by movie goers when he made it makes this movie so great. Why? Because when people did like A New Hope he has put his blood sweat and tears into this Saga and everyone always wanted to know how Darth Vader came to be. So in this movie he honestly pulls out all the stops."
3081,6,better but not good enough,"WAY too much CGI, Lucas! After watching the new film, I reviewed The Empire Strikes back, easily the best of the bunch. That movie still looks wonderful and has the best story. The first two films appealed to the child's imagination in every audience member, the more recent trilogy appeals to a video game generation with a short attention span"
3082,8,Not as bad - or good - as it could have been!,"Well, Lucas got expectations up high by announcing the best Star Wars movie ever, and, I must say, I'm disappointed. The movie was great, of course, and there was some nice, intelligent dialog going on (Well, I only heard the dubbed version.. *beurk*). But you can overdo the VFX-stuff, you know! Leading to SW, this film should have been less pepped up with huge CG sets and great effects, as the original trilogy is going to look ridiculous compared to E3. VFX perfection level goes up and up all of Episodes I, II and III, but then, with SW, it drops to a level that makes those wonderful films look, well, almost boring! Finally, a question @ English Audience: Does Anakin sound terribly snobby and bored during the romantic/emotional scenes in English as well? For that would really be a spoiler, looking towards the DVD release ;-)"
3083,10,This movie is amazing,"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself."
3084,3,not as bad as previous two but still bad enough,There are so many plot holes and errors that it would take a lifetime to point those out. this instalment is marginally better then previous two but it's still not good enough to ever forgive them for making these three episodes in a first place. I feel a room full of five year olds would do a better job writing a script for this.
3085,10,Lucas has outdone himself!,An absolute work of art. Very powerful. I'm eternally appreciative that Lucas finished the saga.
3086,10,Really great story and special effects.,"This movie had a wonderful cast of actors and a really great fast moving story. The action was the best. Hope to see more out of the two young actors Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. ""The Revenge of the Sith"" really answered all the questions about Darth Vater and his wife and what happened to him and her. The special effects are some of the best I have ever seen. A true gem of a movie. Yoda was so life like and the whole story line was moving. I was taken back by the city and all that was going on in the background. It was so life like and breath taking. Hayden Christensen did a superb job of bring Darth Vader to life."
3087,10,Perfection from Lucas!!!!!,"perfect ending to the life of Skywalker and great introduction to the most evil force in the galaxy. all expectations shattered and i was left amazed, the movie is flawless. the movie explains everything between ep1 and ep6 which was unanswered so far, tying up all loose ends. also gives a huge range of new and mixed emotions towards the man previously thought of as completely inherently evil and totally moves the emphasis of the star wars series from one skywalker to the other. it portrays the transition of a man in control of his destiny twisted by fear, greed, and ultimately, love. it is a story of treachery and betrayal, a story of love and fear,"
3088,10,"Great movie, excellent recovery from the last two","Revenge of the Sith might be the best Star Wars in the series (its hard to top the classics), but it is very good. It is definitely the most eventful of the movies, and most important to the overall story. The acting, effects, plot... all of it is spectacular. If you are any sort of Star Wars fan this will keep you on the edge of your seat through most of the movie. The movie is produced from the original story written in back in the day so most of it ties together nicely. Many loose ends are tied up from the last two, adding some needed importance to them. The plot does feel a little ""rushed,"" its basically the same feel the Lord of the Rings series gave to those that read the book. The only downside to the movie is that most people who have seen the originals already know how it ends."
3089,10,Best of the Star Wars Saga,"I honestly think this is the best star wars movie in the history of star wars. People complain way to much about the movie but I don't really care. The movie had amazing action and the story was great, if not excellent. R2-D2 was absolutely hilarious and yoda, like always, was as cool as he can be. The opening space battle and everything involved was incredible and the rescue of palpatine was great. Greivous was a great villain to introduce even though I thought he died a little bit too quickly. Everything about the movie was done brilliantly no matter what all the star wars haters have to say. I'm gonna go watch it again so I can fully appreciate it's beauty."
3090,10,Fan-frellin-tastic!,"Outstanding! Thank you Mr Lucas, you outdid yourself. I loved it. The visual spectacle of the SFX was astonishing. The music was soul stirring. The costumes were incredible. The aliens were amazingly real and lifelike and not just like people in a rubber mask ... thank you Henson Creature Shop for you great contribution. Thanks too, to Brian Henson for making Farscape where the new makeups and creatures were perfected over the last few years."
3091,10,Episode III - worthy of it's name,"The 3rd episode of Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith is a great improvement to it's predecessors, The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, because it brings back that good old Star Wars spirit. Among of the movies from the new trilogy, this one looks the most like to episodes IV, V and VI. Ep III has a much darker tone, sometimes it gets quite bloody and emotional.The acting is greatly improved, Hayden Christensen really became one with his role as Anakin Skywalker/ Darth Vader, he even makes viewers to sympathize with the fallen Jedi. McGregor (Obi-Wan) did his job well, but McDiarmid (Palpatine) is just brilliant, as he has that such an look in his eyes and really makes you think that anger is burning inside of him (one of the very best villains, in my opinion). Some of the best parts of the movie are, of course, spectacular light saber duels and breath taking dialogs (especially the one with Palpatine and Anakin). Revenge of the Sith possesses elements needed to become a cult movie, it brings joy to us SW fans once again and gloriously ends the Star Wars saga."
3092,9,Through this film I have realized something about GL,I have heard a lot of criticism towards George L. about bad dialog and story writing and his ' screw up' in the prequels.
3093,1,Void and disappointing...,"I re-watched this film the other day... I don't know what I originally saw in this film but giving the fact that the ""new stuff"" element was completely gone after a few years I was thinking:"" this is kids stuff"". I was and I would always be a huge fan of the original series but in this new series Lucas fell too much in love with his own creation. His attention for tiny details spoils the movie's mystery. Nobody understood too much about who's who in the original trilogy. Nobody knew what is the planet's name, or how those light sabers work, but I sincerely think that NOBODY CARED ABOUT HOSE THINGS. We just wanted the movie to go one forever and ever, or at least to borrow some more cash from our parents to watch it again that week. I literally had nightmares with Vader for weeks, I was in love with Carrie Fisher for months, that's what I'm talking about! Instead of these feelings I found myself picking of things like: General Grievous's voice is ridiculous, it's speech and laughter resembles that of a 5'year old in a condom commercial, Anakin is like an anguished kid that never owned a bike as a kid and in these days smacks the world with his Uzi (saber...whatever!), and all the rest of the characters make stupid and funny faces all round this film, especially in a fight. Really nothing serious comes to my mind because beside of a lot of CGI's and programmers staying after hours I could never identify in this film something with substance and subterfuge. And this is disappointing. The original trilogy made me think, put my imagination in motion, I wanted to be bigger and better things after 2 hours of watching the screen but this movie left me completely void. I gotta mention that I'm not a depressive type of individual but this film made me think that nothing good lasts."
3094,1,I laughed and laughed and laughed...,"I liked the other Star Wars movies, but you'd have to look to really see how bad Episode Three is. I've seen this satire called ""A Lost Hope"" and at the part where Anakin comes out of the machine as Darth Vader, he takes off the mask and says, ""OW! This mask is chafing my eyebrows!"" I thought of that part when I actually saw the movie and these fanatics were giving me the evil eye when I laughed. The acting was probably around ""Saturday Night Live"" caliber, and why it's even worse is because they weren't sucking on purpose. Like the part where Anakin finds out Padme is dead and he goes, ""NO!"" And the scenes with Anakin and Padme. They were so cheesy. Most people didn't see how poorly written the movie was because they loved the other star wars movies. I can tell that Lucas was just trying to get it finished, and it didn't matter how b/c we all know how it ends. I think he got really lazy on this one."
3095,10,One of the Best Movies I've Seen In Cinema,"Star Wars Episode 3 has got to be one of the best ever movies iv seen on cinema.. a deliciously satisfying combination of expected events grants this movie a 10/10 any day.. As a generic rule for any movie, you shouldn't really go in expecting it to be absolutely awesome (thought it is), as sometimes u MAy get disappointed. The visual effects are absolutely brilliant and help deliver a thrilling, spine-tingling and somewhat sad theme to the movie. The opening sequence is spectacular and a must-see at cinemas. You can tell the director and screenwriter has really really really learnt from there mistakes in previous movies (ie. too much love, too much useless nonsensical talking, too much absolutely ANNOYING comic relief supplied by c3po and r2d2...). I believe they have learnt brilliantly from their mistakes in previous movies to create what i think is the perfect movie. Anakins change in character is especially well done through excellent use of dialogue between himself, Palpatine and Padme. His motives for his change in allegiance are really really convincing, and so is Palpatine's argument. Note, i watched this movie with my friend, who did not really understand the later or previous episodes of star wars, and he only gave the movie a 7.5/10. So i think it best for this reason to fully understand at least episode 1 and 2, and remember to consider the star wars saga as ONE WHOLE BIG FAT MOVIE, which has been cut up into little episodes. If u are expecting a happy woo-hoo ha-ha ending u may be disappointed. Just go in there with proper knowledge of the first two, and that star wars IS a saga, not individual movies. In short, Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of The Sith is nothing short of sheer brilliance, and a definite must-see at cinemas, for anyone who enjoys a 10/10 movie."
3096,5,Star Wars- 5 Movies Too Many. Revenge of the Sith Completes Lucas's Anal Fixation With Symmetry,"First of all I remember as a 14 year old walking out of Star Wars Episode 4. That is to say the first Star Wars movie. (I won't make a comment on how I find the entire Star Wars movie numbering system clumsy and annoying.) (Heh, I just did) It was the first movie that truly captured the romance of space in full cinematic grandiosity. It speaks to the potency, originality, and wonder of the first movie that it can spawn 5 annoyingly plebeian follow ups just on anticipation alone! And never mind all the nonsense of the the 2nd being the ""dark"" artistic triumph. Or the 5th being the return to the ""dark"" motif that somehow redeems the series. ""Dark"" for who? For little boys who still sleep with the lights on, no doubt."
3097,7,"Better than previous two, still questionable dialogue","I definitely think people show go and see this movie, to link the Star Wars story in their mind if nothing else. The action and characters in this movie are better than the previous two, but I am still left wanting in terms of dialogue. I know these are sci-fi movies, and don't usually depend on deep lines and intense character devlopment, but I can't help comparing the witty banter of Episode 4,5,and 6 with the contrite lines of this movie. I just think George Lucas is good at many things--just not writing lines--especially for people who are in love. People who had a hard time not laughing at Padme and Anakin in Episdode II will find this movie to be similar in the couple's lame praise of each other. Oh well!!"
3098,9,Quite Good,"I loved this movie. The story was heartbreaking....in a good way, the action was good (but the Obi-wan Vs Darth Maul fight scene was still the best), the effects were convincing, the score was terrific, the acting was great.......but the SCRIPT!!!................OH GOD!!! I cringe hearing such a talented actress like Natalie Portman delivering dialog (that are painful to the ears) like: 'hold me, like you did on Naboo, so long ago when there was nothing but our love' ------> George Lucas WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!!! But nevertheless the movie was very entertaining, Hayden, Ewan and Natalie did the best with what they had, and for that I give this very entertaining movie a 9 out of 10."
3099,9,Star Wars Strikes Back (little spoilers),"It felt like a Star Wars movie. A little space combat, light saber duels, and of course, wookies. From the extermination of the Jedi to the first sights of X-Wing and TIE fighter like ships, Revenge of the Sith ""tied"" together the trilogies well and at times seemed to pay homage to the originals. I especially liked the combination of the different music from each of the other films. The only problem I had with it was it did seem to drag on a little in the middle, but otherwise the pacing was good, much better than Ep. I and II. It was a fun time, I didn't realize that it had lasted for two and a half hours. And the most memorable moment from the film is, of course, the first breath of the reborn Darth Vader. In short this is the best of the new trilogy and feels like an original in many ways."
3100,10,best of them all,best of them all. no weak parts at all I loved the way all was explained and the action was nonstop the different worlds the wars were fought on were great the light saber fights were more and longer than any other film Darth Vader at the end sent chills down my back as he looked onward out at the death-star along side his new master and how bought tarkin he was only there for a second but looked just like a young version of peter cushen this movie had it all and it was darker than empire I loved all the star wars films but this one Lucus has outdid himself on Ewan did a great job as well so did Hayden he got in great shape for his role and it showed
3101,9,ROTS was better than expected!--Not disappointed at all!,"I feel sorry for the nay-sayers whining and crying about how the newest three Star Wars flicks don't measure up to the old ones . . . blaming it on Lucas's billions. Frankly, if I had a billion dollars I'd retire from film-making . . . but Lucas saw his films through until the end. I am personally grateful that he finished the first three (they're a lot of fun to watch), and wish he'd commit to do 7, 8, and 9 as well. I enjoy suspending reality a bit and journeying to a galaxy far, far, away . . . "
3102,1,A dashing of childhood dre,"I remember, when Star Wars first launched, I was just a child of single digits, but the movie was like nothing we had ever seen before. Weekly we would down to the pizza place with our family, have food, and after that we were each given a quarter to go and get a pack of collectors cards for Star Wars! We loved the movie and for most of us (at least those that couldn't afford a laser disc player) the theater was the only chance we would have to see it for years."
3103,10,Absolutely Fantastic !,I was sad and happy when I approached the cinema doors.
3104,10,Excellent,What we have all been waiting for thought episodes I and II for. A very dark film with bite.A tragedy really. How one mans evil can cause a galaxy of horror.How the weak and frightened can be manipulated by the strong to do the most awful things in the name of good.Haven't we all seen that in real life? 60 years ago and today we never learn. On a personal note I have waited 28 years since I heard the publicity for the first one and a chance comment that stuck in my 6 year old brain that Vader the way he is because of a fight with ken-obi on an active volcano.Now I have seen that fight.Its nice to have closure but I will miss star wars.Unless they make the other 3. Heres hoping :)
3105,10,Revenge of the Sith,"I thought it was a great film, just as the others have been. The story is fluid, without a hiccup. Very moving at times, as well as comical in all the right places. After watching this film, I went home and watched the balance of the story. A work of art, and a great piece of film history. Too bad that's it. For all those critics out there, you must not have liked the others so why did you bother to see this one. For all you fan's out there who liked the others, you will love this movie. Lucas did a perfect job bringing all the element's of this epic journey together, a flawless finish. He could not have done it better. However I do wish that there was more. Apparently we will get a television animated series, hope that's just as good."
3106,4,Not that Great,"OK, let me start by saying, yes, it was a lot better than Episodes 1&2. But I think that is what everyone keeps comparing it to. When this film is stacked up against the original trilogy, there simply is no comparison. The story of the creation of Darth Vader is not only slightly incomplete, but fairly inconsistent with the formation of the character. Neither Natalie Portman nor Hayden Christiansen can act their way out of a paper bag in this film, but that seems to be par for the course for them in these films. Why they even bothered to get Jimmy Smits in this film at all is a mystery to me, he has a grand total of like 5 minutes of screen time. The film is just another vehicle for George Lucas to showcase ILM and show the world exactly how much they can do digitally. But the inconsistencies in Anakin and Padme, the two most pivotal characters in the films, outweigh nearly everything else in this film. I do have to give credit to Ewen McGregor and Ian McDiarmid though, they actually acted in this film, and try as they did, two actors can't hold up an entire film of this scope. Everyone who is a true Star Wars fan should see this film, if only to have the full story, but make sure if you are exposing someone who has never seen these films before to show them this one, and the other two members of the second trilogy, last, as they will not grab the attention and pull in the viewer like the originals."
3107,3,The Animated Clone Wars Beats This Like A Bad Monkey,"To begin with, I do not care how unpopular my opinion is about this film, I will defend it to the bitter end... Despite honestly giving it every benefit of the doubt I could in the wake of Episode 2, all remaining hope for the series was utterly dispelled within the first ten minutes of entering the theater, and nothing thereafter could resurrect it. Even taking into consideration the glowing opinions voiced by the ""lucky few"" reviewers who saw it the week before, and listening to friends and family who have all done more research than I, watching this film served only to prove that it was the greatest waste of good animators I have yet seen."
3108,9,"Finally, a good film in this trilogy","I think this is by far the best of the first three episodes of the saga. now lucas has redeemed himself about the two first. specially the end of the first one was awful. the attack of the clones was correct and the revenge of sith is masterful because the effects are amazing and the transition among the dark side is really well explained. and i must say i was really surprised about the performance from Anakin. I was doubtful about this last film, but it has equilibrated this trilogy. the most curious thing is that in the 4 to 6 episodes Coruscant didn't appear. Is it mentioned?"
3109,10,Of the six movies this one is the best.,"I was sixteen when the first movie came out. I watched five times and it was the first movie I ever went to where the audience cheered and clapped. George Lucas has done what all of us fans wanted him to do in this movie. He has explained well how Anakin became Darth Vader and puts all the pieces together leading to the first movie. I will watch this movie again and will buy it on DVD when it comes out. I want to say that George Lucas should be called a genius for what he has done with Star Wars. As a teenager, I often wished someone would come along and make another series like Star Trek. The six movies for Star Wars provide another look at how things might happen in space and what could happen. I don't think there will ever be another series of films like these."
3110,10,Excellent Movie,"If you like Science Fiction movies, action movies, movies with special effects, movies that don't always have to end with a happy one, or just the Star Wars movies in general, then Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith is the perfect movie for you. The story gets darker, more tragic, more emotional,more exciting, and even more depressing throughout the movie as you slowly see Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) turn to the dark side not to mention the Jedi's being killed and the creation of the empire. This movie is filled with action scenes. There are 5 different light saber battles: all of them fun to watch. However, the first one: Obi-wan/Anakin vs Dooku was too short, Obi-wan vs. Grievous was even shorter, Windu vs. Sidious was also too short, Yoda vs. Sidious could of been a tad bit longer, Obi-wan vs. Vader was plenty long and the most exciting light saber battle in any Star Wars movie. The best performances came by Ian Mcdiarmid who is funny to watch when you see his evil side and Ewan Mcgregor who has a great voice for Obi-wan. Hayden Christensen's best acting came when he starts to act all evil. The special effects are awesome really making the move come to life. This movie alone is fun to watch over and over even if you're not a Star Wars fan. Lucas couldn't of ended the saga in a better way than what he did."
3111,10,This is where the fun begins,"Amazing. Just fantastic acting. People talk crap about the acting, but it's really not all that bad. Ewan is great, Hayden is great, Natalie is hot. The best Star Wars film of all"
3112,10,Becuse of obi wan,"The visuals are stunnig, the action is amazing and the meme are beutifuel"
3113,10,Yes,"This rating was for the republic, for democracy"
3114,10,Because of Obi Wan,R/prequelmemes got me here<br /><br />good soldiers follow orders<br /><br />good soldiers follow orders<br /><br />good soldiers follow orders<br /><br />good soldiers follow orders<br /><br />good soldiers follow orders<br /><br />good soldiers follow orders
3115,8,"If you condemn it, it's simply because you didn't understand it.","I've noticed that the people who bash this movie didn't understand the story or the motivations behind the characters' actions. They say that this new sequel is nothing more than a 2 1/2 hour chance for Industrial Light and Magic to show off, thus forsaking character development and a compelling story. These claims are abominable, because Revenge of the Sith is easily on par with the original trilogy and ties the prequels together with those films quite nicely."
3116,5,George has finally done it,Yes George has. It has taken him two prior films to do so but he got there in the end; he's made me think that Vader is a tool and I actually laughed at him. Laughed. At. Vader. One of the most iconic characters in cinematic history.
3117,10,Lucas returns to greatness,"With episode 1 and 2 weighing in my mind as I entered the theater for the final Star Wars movie, I was a skeptic like most of the fans who watched the wooden acting and bad dialogue of the last installment,""Attack of the Clones."" Without a major scene with Jar-Jar and a crappy ""I don't like sand"" scene, Lucas brings it together and gives us the definitive prequel. I always thought without Harrison Ford that it would be impossible to bring the charm back in full force but amazingly its back and sadly for the last time. It bests even ""Return of the Jedi"" as my third favorite Star Wars film. Now even though its a 10 in my mind, its slightly imperfect. Some of the dialogue that plagued 2 still remains and the fact that the ending is not in question before you see it,(sorry, Anikin becomes Vader)some of the effects were a strain, at least on my eyes and it takes itself more serious then even ""Empire Strikes Back"" which limits some of the fun. But that doesn't matter because it brings a lot of the emotion that had been lost in Star Wars in the last 2 installments, it seemed impossible but Lucas redeemed himself."
3118,10,It Rocked,"if you thought the first two movies kinda sucked and took forever to get to the point, then this one is the one to go and see. The movie kept you on the edge of your seat and when all is revealed,your like Wow! that was pretty cunning. The graphics were amazing! Yoda is his usual self, a computer generated green guy who whips the senators soldiers and turns them into scrap metal. It was also nice to see all the different worlds that other Jedi knights came from. The best thing of all your in a room filled of star wars fans and get to share the experience with others as well. Overall, best movie out of the 3 new additions to the star wars saga."
3119,9,Brilliant merger of old and new trilogies,"I don't get all the negative hype on the style and feel about Episode III. I realize that I'm not 4-10 years old as I was during the original Trilogy releases, and with that understanding, I can use my ""inner child"" to go back there to that time of my life and view the prequels... Long story short, this is obviously the best of the ""first"" three episodes. It is in my opinion a brilliant merger of the old and new trilogies. Sure there are a few campy parts, but hey, I recall those in episodes 4, 5 and 6, too. I gave it a 9 out of 10, 10 = Empire Strikes Back."
3120,7,Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
3121,9,Rises to the rank of the originals.,"For anyone who pines for the originality, aesthetics, and overall mythic punch of the original three, this latest addition will satisfy. New additions to the score by John Williams are excellent, and are well utilized. This installment is by far the most coherent and compelling of the prequels. The first prequel had the dramatic and aesthetic impact of a video game demo, and the second was only somewhat better. This latest installment really ought not to be considered alongside them, but rather alongside the original three, and the fact that it stands right before Star Wars (""Episode IV"") in the narrative development will luckily encourage future viewers to do just that. -Jay A. Gupta"
3122,9,A lot to chew on,"Being someone who was into the original trilogy for the mythology, the spiritual message about the power of Love, and the internal transformation of both Luke and Anakin, Episodes I and II were somewhat disappointing to me. And III continues what I think is a fairly shallow understanding of what might have gone through Anakin to turn him into Darth Vader. The character of Anakin would have to be a lot more complex than the one we see. Still, Star Wars doesn't claim to be any more than a B-grade sci-fi adventure with fabulous special effects. The fact that Lucas seems to channel certain universal truths within his story is sort of an added bonus. What I find most compelling about the new trilogy is the political drama - it's dealing more with the external world. And I think this is very timely. Anakin's character is asking us to look at how we both individually and collectively sell out to our longing for security and power and act out of our fear of loss. I also think it shows some depth on Lucas's part that the Jedi are flawed and the democracy is a mess and that Palpatine's position could be attractive to someone wanting change. There's a lot to this movie I'm still absorbing, but I'd of course call it a must-see. The spaceships and creatures are amazing, and the story is riveting. And it's more than a movie. In such an emotionally potent chapter of the myth, I would gladly have traded some eye-candy for some passion and complexity in the acting and the dialog (Fishburn, Mc Diarmid, Yoda, and to an extent Christensen excluded), but I'll take what I'm given for the sake of what I think is possibly THE defining epic myth of the late 20th century."
3123,10,The Saga is Complete,(There are no big spoilers in this review. Simply facts that we all know are going to happen)
3124,7,"No movie will touch the first trilogy, so enjoy this great film","While reading through the countless reviews that gave ""Sith"" less than 5 stars I can across one that asked ""Why do people give this movie 10/10?"" The same can be said for the people who give the movie a 1-3/10. While it certainly isn't as ""good"" as the first three films, Episode III is easily a great movie and should be looked upon as such. The acting is the most obvious downfall: Hayden Christenson may have looked the part (brilliant portrayal, physically) but his love scenes with Natalie Portman were lacking. However, the acting of Ewen McGregor and Ian McDiarmid (who was stunning as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine) make up for this."
3125,9,Great action movie,"As a senior I enjoyed this movie immensely. Yes it has lots of action and wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 10. I believe it brings all the stories together. Even had to come home and watch Episode IV again. Episodes I, II and III may not be as good as the original what we call the originals IV,V,VI but viewers have to remember it is usually the first ones we consider the greatest. We have a tendency as an audience to compare too much enjoy the movie the special effects are great and the characters bring a closer to the story. Natalie Portman was not in it enough, Christian I thought did a good job and of course there was Yoda you can never get enough of the ""Master""."
3126,7,Did it's Best,"Now If only this film was made a long time ago in a galaxy far far away then it be better. in fact, It be better if all of these were made a long time ago. And for godsakes, there were only a FEW good actors in this film. I love the action, I love the effects, I hated the crappy Dialouges that do not compare to the original ones, these ones just...stray. And then there is the acting....what the hell? But maybe it was the writing, that could be it. Still, was better then Episode 2 and darker then any of the others, well sort of. I am having hopes though for Indy 4 though. If George Lucas plans on making another film, he better be original."
3127,10,Revenge Of The Sith,"*WARNING*CONTAINS SPOILERS* Star Wars Episode III is a fantastic movie.Since 19th May i saw Rots 10 times.It happens 3 years after the Geonosis war.Anakin Skywalker becomes Jedi(Only Jedi not Master).He becomes so close with the Evil Palpatine who reveals to Anakin that he is the Sith Lord the one they are looking for.He also tells Anakin the story about Darth Plagueis ""Wise"".Also Revenge of the Sith is very dark and sad movie.I cry when Anakin kill Mace Windu and when Padme dies.I vote ""10"" because Rots gave me what i want.I wanted saber duels,I got them.I wanted to see Vader in the ""old"" black costume,I saw him.So for Rots i can say only one thing,It Rocks!!!"
3128,10,Revenge of the Sith reigns supreme across ALL galaxies!,"Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith really turned around the way I looked at the prequel Trilogy. After Phantom Menance and Attack of the Clones... while not BAD movies... I had very high expectations for Revenge of the Sith seeing as how this was the final Star Wars movie we'll see (by Lucas' words). This was the full birth of Darth Vader, the assault against the Jedi, and of course: Anakin Skywalker Vs. Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar. From the battle in space to the final blow by Obi-Wan, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I was blown away from start to finish, and my faith in George Lucas was returned and he made up for TPM and ATOC. The battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin rivaled the Battle of Helms Deep and Minas Tirith from Lord of the Rings... and they were epic battles. The swordsmanship as they battled through the fiery chasms of Mustafar. I was also impressed at the fact that Anakin did the Force choke against Padme... Darth Vader was Truly born! Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is one of the best movies I've ever seen... and I've already preordered mine for November 1st. ROTS will forever be honored and appreciated."
3129,6,Not the worst star wars movie,"Still has cringey dialogue, poor directing, and an overuse of CGI, but more fun action sequences than episodes I and ii. Lacks tension and is ridiculously overrated among star wars fans but worth a watch for the opening space battle over Coruscant and the Tatooine sunset."
3130,1,Why did you ...,Star wars revenge of the Sith was the absolute worst film of all time.Anakin is a freak in asshole.I can't believe you killed of Mace Windu.He is the the best Jedi in it and why did you make Genaral Grevious a coward.He would have been a clash Sith and why did you kill Count Dooka at the very start of the movie.You could have at least kill him at the end of the movie and how the hell did Anakin survive being burned by lava.He lost his two legs and a arm.He didn't have any real arms or legs.
3131,10,Great movie!,"This movie was really great! I thought it was even better then the old movies, and from now on I think this will be my favorite Star Wars movie. I even thought it was better then The Lord of The Rings.. Reasons for why I liked this movie: 1: I thought the acting was better then in episode 1 and 2 (especially episode2). 2: I thought the effects were better. 3: The movie really got into me, sometimes I was angry, and sometimes almost afraid. 4: I thought Lucas did a very good job in making everything fall into the right places, considering this episode is between episode 2 and episode 4. 5: I liked the darkness and loneliness over the whole movie, it was very sad, but thats exactly how this movie was supposed to be. 6: I loved the scene where Mace Windu fights against The Emperor. It was a very tragical scene at the end, but very well made. I was surprised over how good Mace Windu was, I would never have thought that he would have won over The Emperor, which he actually did, until Anakin showed up.. I also liked the scenes with Yoda fighting against The Emperor, plus a lot of other scenes, of course. Anyway, I thought this was a great movie, and I will probably see it many, many more times..."
3132,9,The movies are now complete and on a higher level.,"I think this (EpIII) is one of the best Star Wars movies. Having seen Episode I,II,III now the ""older"" IV,V,VI, are even better. Because you know what happened. I found A New Hope always a bit slow paced, but now having seen the prequels, it's much better."
3133,1,Sorry--this movie has more holes in its plot and direction than Normandie Beach on D-Day,"The wooden dialogue--understood, given the dreadful, 3rd grade level script; and the totally implausible situations--the fight on the lava flow with its ""flaming"" conclusion was a real hoot!--make this one of the worst SciFi films I've ever seen."
3134,10,Things Goes In order,No matter how hard you try in your heart to save the Jedi world thing goes all in order as you seen in Episode 4 1977 Young Luke skywalker .<br /><br />people die and betray Jedi world but this episode is Predetermined.<br /><br />MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.
3135,10,The Saga and the Force that never fade away,"With excellent visual effect, sound effect and wonderful music, this movie is totally very good, but there is some problems about the story, it can't told me why Anakin turns to the dark side. However, Christensen, Portman and MaGregor did a great job, and also Lucas. ""The saga is complete"" was the tag-line of this movie. Yes, it was complete, so unforgettable. From the first Star Wars saga released, 28 years passed, we still love the saga. Why? Because of Lucas's imaginary. Robots, star fighters, light sabers and the Force, I will never forget it."
3136,10,Star Wars Revenge of The Sith.,"This movie has a great plot a great story and an even better character arc for Anakin i love they George Lucas made hayden play him as a moody but heroic Jedi, and i love the way they did the battle between General Grevious and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Also the battle between n Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. This movie is the best out if all 3 prequels. It's the best because the plot is great and the battles and the duels there will never be another movie like it. I also loved the way that they showed us Anakin's Procedure and how he lost his limbs as we were never told during the original trilogy. The only down is i wish they had shown more if the Jedi Temple Raid because the Jedi Temple Raid was one of the best scenes along with order 66 in my opinion."

The one down of this movie is that i wish they had Showed more of The Jedi Temple Raid, As the Jedi Temple Raid scenes was one of the best along with order 66."
3138,8,Worth Watching,"Just got finished watching this film. The effects were stunning, the story was riveting, and to be honest, this is a movie that overshadows the original trilogy visually, and makes me realize the kind of story Lucas was going for. Do I prefer the original? Of course, but now, for different reasons. I will not reveal what goes on in the movie other than to say, it is dark, it is worth watching, and it does wrap most things together. It's worth catching a glimpse, and I think it brings a nice accompaniment to the Trilogy. There are some nice fan moments, there are definitely some humorous moments, but overall it's more about the experience. This movie is a well told story, that finally shows the full extent of the betrayal of Anakin Skywalker against the Jedi. And it shows just why he wore the mask of Darth Vader. An exceptional movie, way to go for everyone involved. "
3139,10,my all-time favorite movie ever in the history of my life! LOL,"i could probably write forever and forever on this movie, but I'm short on time and I'm sure you are too. this movie gives you everything that you want! it completes the entire star wars collection and give you and infinite understanding of how everything is the way they were in the other movies. the performance was spectacular! i completely emphasized with Hayden Christiansen's character, as well as Natalie portman's. after the movie i was in actual awe. i was thinking about the movie for the next three days.......i was sad for hours and hours after movie. i probably sound like one of those crazy star wars fiends, but I'm not i didn't even see it on opening night, i didn't dress into a Jedi costume, and i don't even own a star wars poster. but this movie is a masterpiece that completes the greatest epic of movies to date. i was 15 when i saw it and i have probably seen it 30 times since, i still feel the same emotions when i watch it, and i watch it with the same enthusiasm as if it were the first time, although i do say the next line. lol. my favorite movie, George Lucas...my hero,.....you're awesome and we owe you for giving us such a masterpiece of art!"
3140,9,Revenge of the Sith - An Emotional Thrill Ride,"The movie was an emotional thrill ride that didn't stop till the credits. I don't think I took a breath till it was over. Lucas was true to the original story, and made me into a fan all over again! The story line was pieced together nicely to tie into Star Wars IV A New Hope. The acting wasn't always what it could have been but a vast improvement from the last film. The fight scenes and special effects were very well done, which was expected. I am also glad to report that the special effects blended nicely into the story and did not detract or compete with the story in any way. Overall this film was extremely well done! Thank you Mr. Lucas :)"
3141,10,Money and Time Well Spent,I rarely have gone to see a movie in its first run. 
3142,10,The Saga is now complete with a great movie!,Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith was a great way to finish the Star Wars Saga. It is definitely the best of the prequels and definitely one the best in the saga. 
3143,9,This movie is fraught with the ferver of untold millions,"This movie kicked butt...in fact, it kicked more butt than the butt that it failed to kick, which leaves the majority of the butt kicked proper and that is better than average. When I see this film It makes me want to wet myself with excitement and that has not happened since I saw ""A fish named Wanda"" This movie is better than ""Wanda"" because there are lightsabers in it. If Wanda would have gotten stabbed by a lightsaber than perhaps that movie would give this one a run for its money. But she did'nt and so it does'nt. If you have not seen this than you should because once you have then you will understand. This packs more thrills than throwing a sack full of kittens into rush hour traffic (just kidding, that is still more fun than this movie). Watch this film while wearing a diper, its that good."
3144,5,better in small bits,"The film was a very engaging in its last thirty minutes or so. Unfortunately, the first 2/3 of the film was very, very dull. There seem to be an attempt at creating drama and story telling here but it didn't seem to go very well. Partly due to the cheesy dialogs and choppy editing. Characters seem to appear out of no where for no particular reasons (like the kid Jedi who saved Jimmy Smith's character at the end), and the acting sometimes is laughable. Didn't any one wondered why Natalie Portman's character wore a full dress gown, with beads, and have her hair done up while she lay in bed sleeping? If it wasn't for the great score and appealing effects, one may dearly regret sitting in the theater and wait for the better ending part."
3145,9,totally objective,"this film was amazing. the best of the six in my opinion. anyone who criticizes the dialogue should stop and think for a second. these films have never been about the dialogue. it's always been a little hokey from the beginning. what's so great is the story, the action, and the special effects. i loved the original three. episode 1 had some good moments. overall i thought episode 2 was a waste. lucas ended the saga on a high note. episode 3 delivered big time. the battles were of the best in the series. the special effects were still breathtaking. don't dwell on the dialogue. the story came full circle. he was as thorough as two and a half hours would allow. i loved it and i think time will show that this is going to be a classic."
3146,7,Ehh.,"I saw the flick at midnight with family and friends. I even let my 12-year-old daughter stay up to see it with us. At the end, we talked about the experience: Midnight screening. LOTS of goofy fans in costumes. Evil looks at the joker that asked if this one had Picard or Kirk. Incredibly loud, obnoxious people in the theater who catcalled every preview and then became utterly reverent when the film started."
3147,9,everything you had to have,"First off my very first childhood memory is of seeing this film at the drive in in my parents Oldsmobile I was 4. I had to hide behind the bench seat when Vadar came out. This Space Opera has truly shaped my life. Having seen it completed, it is almost as if I can set my childhood afloat and move onto some sort of adult existence. Anyway...."
3148,,My disappointment,"After watching the film Revenge of the Sith,I think that the movie is quite boring and ridiculous.I've never watched anyother episodes of Star War,however,based on this film,I would say that the Star War Episode is not as great as it is supposed to be."
3149,3,Visually boring ... silly story,"Yawn... Very silly indeed, from Mr Lucas. George has lost the plot, but then again he did nick the idea from Kurosawa in the first place way back (The Fortress), so like a lot of people perhaps has no originality in him ... I hate to say it but the story is stupid, bordering on the ridiculous...at no point in the later films have we been prepared to hear about General Grevious, or even Count Dooku...not dissimilar to throwing in that idiot Darth Maul. The only redeeming factor is there is no Jar Jar Binks...thank the midichlorians for that ... The unbelievability factor has sadly got larger with every film (number 2 was the best ) not anything to do about aliens , just the tenuous plot connection between each film ... Not big and not clever... Ohh well... egards Fitvideo"
3150,10,Revenge of the Sith....best ever!,"I went and saw Revenge of the Sith this evening, and I have to say that it is easily the best of the Star Wars episodes. In fact I'm thinking it's probably the best movie I've ever seen (I was pretty much overwhelmed by what I saw tonight). The acting is very good, Hayden does an unbelievable job, he's just plain awesome, as is Natalie Portman, and so is the guy who plays R2D2 (what a cool job that would be!). "
3151,4,Just as bad as 1 and 2,"I think that most people enjoyed this movie just because it was the tying-together point for the entire star wars saga. The acting was cardboardish at best; the scenes with Padme and Anakin were just ridiculous. However, I don't believe that the problem lies with the actors, they are all actually quite good; its their lines that are terrible. The script writer should lose his job before he ruins any other movies. The movie's special effects were of course top-notch, but they lack the sense of space combat realism (yes I know that's an oxymoron) that the first 3 movies had."
3152,9,I loved it,I really liked this movie. It was much better than the previous ones with jar jar binks and the silliness that went with them.
3153,3,"Nice SFX, corny dialogue, wooden acting, poor story","I really can't understand why anyone over the age of 12 would consider this to be a good film. I'm certainly not a film snob and don't think that all films should be high art but this was such a bad film in so many ways; the dialogue was laughably bad and I've seen better acting at my local amateur dramatics society. Lucas seems to have a knack of taking great actors and forcing them to give completely wooden and lifeless performances. I don't think it's possible to write any spoilers for this film because it just goes through the motions with no twists or suspense; we know where it is going to end and what has to happen for us to get there and it just plays out on-screen in a straightforward manner with no attempt to add anything new or inject some tension or passion into the storyline. I could almost see the checklist being ticked one item at a time until the list was done and the film ended (with a cliché that even parody writers have tired of). The special effects were nice but, once again, completely lacking in tension, passion, and drama. Overall, I have to give the film 3/10 because it was better than the last two instalments of the series but that's about the only positive thing I can think to say about it. Can we please just let this tired series die in peace now?"
3154,10,The Greatest Character ever...........,"Darth Vader is the greatest Character ever created. A pure master peace. A time to behold but also a time of sadness for their will never be anything ever like it. This tragic but triumphant, is truly the GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.(not LOTR) Generations have celebrated this classic of good vs evil and now it has come full circle. Episode III has proved it self worthy of going side by side with Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi. Seeing this movie truly brought me back to my youth and made me believe. Do yourself a favor. Go see this movie. Purchase the other ones and thank George Lucas for this gift of fantasy. Thanks George."
3155,8,A fantastic conclusion,Superb! Makes up for The Phantom Menace completely. Only a few minor points:
3156,7,Better but still flawed,"Not the best of the bunch, maybe even out of the first three episodes. Certainly nowhere near as good as the last three. Still it is Star Wars and I did enjoy it. To sum it up I would say that this movie has great visuals but both the story and the acting could have been better. Here is my grading of all the Star Wars movies."
3157,6,Not Disappointing. Finally.,"Oh, it's better than Episode II, all right, and it's going to hold up better than Episode I, but let's be perfectly clear: if you delete the special effects and just work with the story arc, the characterization, and the acting, this is at best fourth on the list of the Star Wars sexology."
3158,9,My Favorite out of the whole series including the old ones.,"This is my favorite Star Wars movie out of the whole franchise. The build up to this was great, and the special effects were done a hell of a lot better than Episode 2 in my opinion. Everything in this movie worked. The Story, the action, the characters. Everything was done so well, and can easily be a rank 8-9 film in my opinion. This is the closing point to my review for this trilogy and of course there will be a spoiler."
3159,9,Sith IS the best since Empire.,"1977 Star Wars captures the hearts of instant fans worldwide. Creating one of, if not the most, influential Sci-Fi film ever."
3160,3,The worst ever,George please stop making movies.
3161,4,George Lucas screwed this one up,"What was good: -Anakin on fire -Anakin's charred remains -Most of the dialog -The slaughtering of the Jedi -Most of the end -The appearance of the Tantive IV -Grand Moff Tarkin -Opening space battle (eccentric, but interesting) -When Anakin pulls a lightsaber on the children"
3162,5,Disappointed,"This is the first Star Wars movie I considered walking out on in the middle of the movie. Couldn't embrace Anakin's character and feel that Hayden Christensen was a poor choice for the role. The reasons for Anakin's turn to the dark side are weak and you just want to slap him for being a spoiled brat who can't see what's really going on. Lucas got so involved in a big production with amazing special effects that he failed in character development. The last 30 minutes seemed rushed, as if they were out of time and money. I felt that there were inconsistencies in the story between this episode and the ""first"" Star Wars. Episodes IV through VI were so much better. Too bad."
3163,9,The point of the entire Star Wars Cycle,"The Star Wars Cycle is a depiction of how Democracies and Totalitarian States are both unstable, and how the one form leads to the other."
3164,10,Totally Redeeming,"This episode completely redeemed everything that was unsatisfactory from the first two. Darth Vader's evolution as a character is great and believable, all the cast does an outstanding job, the movie is action-packed, the soundtrack is continuous and superb, and it ties in perfectly with the originals. I can't think of a better way they could have done it. All the build up from the first two leads in well, and for once Anakin is a character that people can sympathize with, but at the same time be filled with hate. There probably is not a second of the movie where you are left to lounge back in your seat; there is always something happening. General Grevious, even though there was a lot of hype about him, and it seemed as though he might be an ""evil jar-jar"" and would detract from the movie, was worked into the plot well and does not take up a major portion of the movie, but just shows even better how Palpatine is influencing Anakin in a large-scale scheme. I think this one will be the one great one that people remember of the first 3 episodes, hands down."
3165,9,Will Kenobi show Anakin who his daddy is?,* INSERT WARNING HERE * Went to the premier at midnight and was not disappointed.
3166,2,Why does Lucas insist on directing?,"The story was there. Some decent actors were there. The money was there. The technology was there. But there were a couple of facts that inconveniently ruined this movie. Fact one: although Lucas is a great story writer, he is one of the worst dialog writers/directors ever to disgrace the medium of film. If he had just recruited a co-director to actually coach the actors and tweak his painfully awkward dialog, this could have been the movie that actually matched the quality of episodes 4-6. Second fact: Hayden Christenson is not a good actor. Sad but true, it was hard not to laugh at his performance. The other actors in this episode bravely try to wring some believability from Lucas' hackneyed script, but Christenson doesn't even try. Sad."
3167,10,True Star Wars Bestowed!,"The Saga is (finally) complete. Every piece of the Star Wars puzzle is now in its place and the world that came to birth at the dawn of the 80s fulfilled and bestowed to its rightful place as the most enchanting, most visually pleasant story ever to be told in a movie."
3168,,Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith//the best movie ever,"I like this film because it is really amazing how one movie can fill you with so much emotion. It is actually better than I expected. In parts of the film I just wanted to yell at the movie scree, ""No Anikan, Don't do it!"" but then i reminded my self that i was in a cinema. At other parts you just cant help it but cry because of the sad things that happened. "
3169,10,This is just completely.................. POWERFUL!!,"In the original trilogy we saw the amazing story of a young farm boy turn to the savior of a galaxy. How he triumphed over all the odds: a massive empire, emotional demons, and a lost father. The original trilogy brought us to a world of fantasy, war, and compassion. George Lucas really brought the world a new imagination."
3170,10,A terrific achievement,"First off, allow me to say that i refuse to be one who unconditionally feels that a movie is brilliant because of it's subject matter and not the film itself. Yes it is true that i love star wars, it is also true that i loved episodes 1 and 2, but no matter how much i enjoyed episodes 1 and 2 i was able to see their flaws and understand why most would not like them. "
3171,10,The Best Movie Ever!,"This movie was the best movie of 2005 and it is definitely the best out of the three new movies. I hope that they will make an episode7,8,9 too. George Lucas had talked about making another three but its not official. I hope that star wars never dies and that the stories about it will live on forever.It is the greatest and most revolutionary saga of all time in my book."
3172,6,star wars maybe stop wars,star wars? stop wars. well as a young boy i stood i line with my ticket & my mum & dad waiting for the best sci/fi film ever made. i am talking of course about episode iv-a new hope and a few long years on & much done i went to see revenge of the sith with a 1/2 day off work booked & again ticket in hand. as soon as the credits rolled & the familiar 20th century fox sign appeared it was time. but..... alas its all cg & badly acted---- how did manikins' descent to the dark side happen so quickly? how was the emperor scarred thru lightning but in the previous movies scared already? questions with no answers. this a badly acted Mich-mash which does not tie the story up well all the magic of the earlier movies taken away in an instant. still gripes aside it is an average film but once again george lucas is a genius when it comes to making movies but a clutz when it comes to scripts. maybe i'm too old to appreciate this now as a special & magical time was had by all in 1977 when the first film was released.
3173,10,Im in AWE,"This is by far the best star wars movie ever made. It has the second best star wars character, the first is obviously spock. I loved the part were Luke SkyWalker looked into the Lightsaber and it extended and killed him. After that the Empire won. Chewie died of humiliation. It was a great movie."
3174,9,it will blow you away.,"the best of the six. cant wait to see it again next week. the only bad thing was the sad thought that there would be no more made. I hated TPM and have always dreaded that the following 2 would go the same way, but this really is the old Star Wars back to form. gone are the mickey mouse characters and now its down to some serious story telling. there are some harrowing scenes at the latter half of the film but without them you wouldn't get the real impact. sure there are some corny moments, but even the original Star Wars back in '77 had them. make sure you empty your bladder before the film cause you'll not want to leave. enjoy! PS. Spot the CGI of a young Peter Cushing (aka. Grand Moff Tarkin) near the end overlooking the construction of the death star."
3175,5,the end of an era....and a good one at that,"i want to be the first to outright say, i loved it. i didn't think any of it needed work, and it by far surpasses my expectations. lucas did a superb job of leaving the typical star wars humor behind after the first half hour, and creating an endearing storyline. i was concerned about numerous loose ends being tied up, but none were left undiscussed."
3176,8,finally emphasis on the story and screenplay,"finally a star wars film which concentrates on the story and not just on the special effects. before beginning the star wars original trilogy George Lucas had consulted with the master of mythology: Joseph Campbell and read his book titled ""hero of a thousand faces"" which follows the hero's journey through all the myths across every nation on earth. a common path which makes the hero look deep within himself to find answers in the world outside personified by all the heroes of every epic tale ever written. this one proves that lucas's talent at writing is still spot on. no wonder that the star wars trilogy first and now this final film are going to be the stuff of legends for years to come. Anakin's journey towards the dark side is filled with insights into his inner being instead of just a brainless outer fight with only special effects to keep us interested. this one makes us feel for him as his struggle is part of all our lives as we struggle to stick to the right part. making him a villain but one we can understand and respect. the awe effect instead of just a bad guy. way to go Lucas."
3177,10,Great event though!!!!,when people say the fans don't know what they want its true. Everyone else reviewing this will give it crap because it isn't like the originals even though it is. The first star wars were just as trying to be humorous true the old movies did it better but this movie is still excellent.
3178,10,"Superb, More Than Just A Film..","I believe that (as usual) George Lucas has done an excellent job telling his story, in a way which keeps you gripped and takes you through a wide array of different emotions."
3179,8,"A Solid, Sometimes Poignant, Albeit Messy Conclusion","Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is a film is a film that truly strives for greatness, so much so perhaps that with only a two hour running time it was inevitable that the film would fall short in a number of areas. The film concludes the story of Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the Sith lord Darth Vader, while simultaneously showcasing the Republic's full transformation into a terrifying Galactic Empire."
3180,9,What a movie!,"I really appreciate the Darth Vader path toward the dark side. It scared me and made me really deep into the film. Great work for George Lucas who told us a really good story. OK, it's a Star Wars movie, but in this panorama of returning ideas and poor new themes, ROTS put a mark on continuity as well as fresh ideas and I think this will not be appreciated only by fans. The movie is a bit weak on the opening scenes, but, as time goes on, the Dark side make his way into the film and into the people watching it. Very very good the parallel scenes between Anakin and Padme, joint by a similar destiny as all couples. A very good movie for all fans and for new fans."
3181,6,"Good, but better","From the opening 20th Century Fox logo, the movie hits the ground running, proving once again the CGI capabilities of ILM and the thrills they inspire. However, unlike the first two films, where spectacular effects were layered upon complicated, contrived and sometimes dramatically vacant scenes executed with some of the worst performances in memory, there is solid story telling here. And that's the difference."
3182,7,Decent movie Spoilt by poor ending,Well what can i say.This was probably never going to live up to the hype that surrounds it (just like the other two prequels)but if you put the hype aside then yeah i though George Lucas had done a pretty good job in ending these chapters of the saga and seeing Anakin turn in Vader.He made it out to be that Anakin was not really that bad a person and the choices that he was making was for the good of himself and padme's Future. The only thing i thought was that the film ended too soon after and missed out on some golden opportunities. well worth the watch for anyone who has any interest in star wars at all not only the fans. Bottom line is if you liked episode one and two then you will probably not go away disappointed.
3183,3,Thirty Years Of Fan Loyalty Down The Drain,"I was working in a video store when this sorry piece of crap came out on DVD and I just wanted to tell customers to run, don't walk, away from this movie. I've been a Star Wars fan from the moment I first sat alone in a movie theater when I was 18 years old and saw the opening scene of A New Hope. I saw the original trilogy so many times over the years I could only be described as a Star Wars Geek and proud of it. George Lucas took it all away with the last one and I'll never forgive him, I feel like I've lost an old friend. I came out of the theater fuming, ""but Princess Leah remembered her mother!"" and why did we have to watch a graphic close-up of Anakin being burned almost to death? that was disgusting, no one needed to see that. I guess if you have to wait almost three decades to continue your saga you're bound to lose the feel of the originals. A New Hope had all the thrill of a great western, fairy-tale and adventure flick all rolled up in one great movie. There was all that humorous dialog, poor wimpy C3PO, R2D2's spunk and Chewie who didn't much care for the smell of garbage. Empire went a little darker as sequels do and explored some of the past and future for characters that we actually gave a hoot about, and Jedi was a huge crowd pleaser. Even back then Lucas would goof up with the dialog now and then; give Leah an upper-crust British accent, then have her talk like the gun-totin' fearless rebel she was. Have Luke say something stupid like ""I'll not leave you here, I've got to save you."" But we forgave him back then because we were rewarded by a rousing adventure with the promise of future episodes. Everybody was so busy grumbling about JarJar when the real problem with Phantom Menace was the untalented kid Lucas cast in the lead. I guess it was easier to pick on a CGI character rather than a child but was Haley Joel Osment not available because Jake was cute but.. yikes. And why was Anakin's mother tied up in a tent all by herself beaten half to death in AOTC, was this the only reason the Sandpeople kidnapped the locals? And let's talk about the birth of Luke and Leah in this last debacle. Robot mid-wife says something like ""Sir we have to operate now if we're going to save the babies."" Next thing we know poor little Padme is hooked up to some kind of birthing contraption and is crying out in pain while the robot is doing something down there that produces the babies. This is how they operate on women in the delivery room in this space-age galaxy? what, run out of anesthetic? I was the most furious about the closeup shots of a burned Anakin, that was completely unnecessary. I waited a couple of weeks for the images to leave my brain before making a final decision but Star Wars was dead to me, why would I keep the rest of the series when there was no way I would buy that one? I sold off all my Star Wars movies and I feel bad for people who wanted to share this series with their children only to find the last so graphic it required a PG13 rating. Shoulda' just tossed it; into the garbage chute Flyboy!"
3184,4,Strike Three Mr. Lucas!!!!!,"Well the big wait is finally over. The STAR WARS saga is complete...and it turned into a complete waist of time. After suffering through the first two numb skulled installments of this new trilogy, I was hoping like everyone else that George would make up for it with a truly memorable finale. Much to my non-surprise...he didn't. REVENGE OF THE SITH is just more of the same stiff acting, wooden dialogue and wall to wall digital effects that look, well, digital. I pray for the day when somebody puts a model ship in front of a blue screen! The only saving grace in this two and a half hours of dreck was, as usual, Ewen Mcgregors classy performance.Its amazing how he manages to rise above all of the crap. The other plus was of course the mighty Yoda. I smiled every time he was on screen...and snored the rest of the time. Don't get me wrong. This is still better than ATTACK OF THE CLONES, but getting a root canal would top the experience. And what about Hayden?? Well, I won't bore you with what would be a long winded shredding of his laughable performance. Lets just say that I will never see his face behind that mask when I watch the classic trilogy!!! And as for THE BIG MOMENT...when Darth Vader threw his head back and howled ""NOOOOOOOO!!!!"" after learning the fate of Padme, I almost howled myself...in laughter! I cried aloud ""Thats not Darth Vader!!! Stop the madness George, the joke is over!!!!""...."
3185,7,A bit disappointed...,"After hearing how positive most reviews were, I guess I was expecting too much. I agree generally with our Finish friend who had a few hours jump on us Yanks :)"
3186,9,Don't believe the hype; go see for yourself!,"I didn't know what to expect having read the con's and pro's in the user comment section. The con's however seem to break it down to the same points: star wars sucks; weird aliens suck, star wars acting sucks... Well I'll tell you that if you go see this movie yourself you won't be disappointed. It's a very solid movie that has everything a movie needs. It takes you to a different world that seems very real and tells a story that is brought to the screen so well that it touches you deeply. If you don't like this movie you're probably a fanatic yourself. In my opinion (and having seen the original movies afterwards again as well) this is the best Star Wars movie and it deserves a rating over 8.0!"
3187,5,"Not bad, but not great","The latest one ain't so bad. Not on the same level as the originals, but not the complete shyte of Ep I & II. Nothing really jumped out at me as spectacularly wonderful, but nothing particularly jumped out at me as spectacularly crap, either. There were problems with the acting (Christenson & Portman), but the special effects (the opening scene) helped balance it out."
3188,8,Great Movie? Yes! Corny dialog? Yes! Should you care? NO!!,"Without a doubt, this is the best Star Wars movie in many many years. After the first two ""prequels"", I was ready to give up on George Lucas, but Episode III really delivers - period. Just sit back, let yourself go and have a great time."
3189,8,YAY! I have faith in humanity again!,"I had fairly low expectations for this movie, seeing as how I didn't enjoy the first 2. However, I thought that this movie was pretty good. I had lot's of nerdy moments for me, references to the other films, and of course the end. That action was well done, and there was a better dynamic between Obi-wan and Anakin. Also, Yoda was cool, I appreciated how they took a page out of LOTR's book and mad4e him more expressive. However, Yoda, ever a paragon of wisdom, did seem to give some horrible advice. The dialog needs work, as usual, and can be downright painful in some spots, but it could've been worse and was delivered decently. The acting was somewhat better, but some scenes that could have been very emotional and moving weren't. Still, I didn't come out a bitter, twisted, ranting loony so it's better than the first 2!"
3190,3,"by a 12-year-old, for 12-year-olds","The dialogue is Wooden. The special effects are implausible. The plot is childish. There's no acting, because none is needed. This project is Devised by G.Lucas, i.e. famous immature mind, for, not so famous, but equally immature minds. This is Hollywood at its dumbest and, not surprisingly, at its most profitable. It is hard to believe that men and women over 18 will gladly pay $20 to see over two hours of meaningless conversation interrupted by occasional sword fighting. When I was 11, my parents took me to see ""return of jedi"" - loved it then. But now, when I see it on TV, I fall asleep watching it. The point is - when you're a kid, you enjoy kid's stuff, but when 30 and 40-year-olds give it two thumbs up, that is just sad. Today's grownups, haven't really become older and wiser."
3191,6,Not bad for an action movie (might contain spoilers),"The movie was substantially better than Episode 1 and 2 but still lacked enough shear acting talent to be great. Sure, it's an action movie and maybe sub par acting is to be expected. Critics say that the acting is far better than it was in episode 2, especially by Hayden Christensen who appeared less whiny, but the acting between him and Natalie Portman felt wooden. Part of the story is supposed to be these two characters and the children that they have, but the lines were so clichéd and forced. "
3192,5,Pull the curtains away from your eyes,"Contrary to popular belief, Lucas has not redeemed himself. Episode 3 reminds me of Elvis Presley's comeback in the 1970s. People were just so happy that he was back making decent music that they praised it as brilliance. They said he was back to his old form. When in fact, they were in serious denial. The same is true here. Yes, EP 3 is a step up from the last two star wars movies... but it's still not a good movie! I'm not trying to change your opinion of it, everyone's entitled to like it if they so desire. But what follows is my take on the film."
3193,7,"Yes, its as good as it should be...","Well got to the midnight screening last night, after sitting through way too many trailers we finally got to see those famous blue words, anyhow."
3194,9,A Great Comeback,"Well I have to admit ""Revenge of the Sith"" was not the movie I was expecting it to be... I was expecting a rather drawn out story with mediocre acting + those great light saber fights (which is why I started watching Star Wars int he first place) which had recurred in the past 2 movie (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones). However Lucas finally did it, the story and the acting has intensified (though not flawed) giving a brilliant ending to the trilogy (excluding IV-VI of course) and setting up the next movie which is ""A New Hope""."
3195,7,The Film I have been waiting for since I was 8yrs old!!,The original Stars Wars Trilogy have a place in the hearts of millions of people around the world. It is maybe because of this that the OT is put unfairly onto a pedestal above the new trilogy. Many of the criticisms of the new trilogy most definitely apply to the OT.
3196,9,The force is with final Star Wars,"With ""Revenge of the Sith"" director George Lucas does a fine job of tying together the old and new trilogies of the Star Wars series. This film is definitely the strongest of the most recent three, and measures up nicely with Return of the Jedi, though not quite as strong as ""A New Hope"" or ""Empire Strikes Back""."
3197,8,obvious sequel potential,Saw the new george lucas movie today. really good. better than his last two and certainly better than the one with the duck.
3198,8,The Best Of The Prequels,"May Contain Spoilers! After the Phantom Menace & Attack Of The Clones (Fell asleep 2nd time I watched in cinema), I was looking forward to Revenge Of The Sith with more than a hint of concern. After IV, V & VI I wanted to see the conclusion of the story. I'm glad I did! A number of the story lines that link Attack & New Hope together are resolved. We all know that Anakin becomes Darth Vader. We all know Luke & Leia are Anakin's children."
3199,10,the best movie of the new trilogy,"I saw this movie on Thursday afternoon and I must say that this is easily the best movie I have seen all year. I think it is the best star wars movie since ""empire"". this movie is visually stunning and the action sequences are awesome. the action starts up from the very beginning and doesn't let up. the set designs are awesome as well. the city of corucant looks like a future new york city or something like that and the music score gives the movie even more emotion during some of the action sequences. The dialogue is a little hokey at times especially when anikin and padme are together but then again the duologue between anakin and padme never was that great to begin with. and yes jar jar has a brief appearance but it only lasts about 30 seconds so he doesn't get a chance to become annoying.yes anikin does some pretty awful things after he goes down the dark side of the force. but on the bright side it has some awesome light-saber battles. -SPOILER ALERT READ AT OWN RISK- I thought that the light-saber battle between Yoda and palpatine was one of the best I have seen. The saber battle between obi-wan and anakin was just as good. Even Mace windu got to have a saber battle with palpatine. my favorite part of the movie was seeing Darth Vader. you also get to see Luke and Leia being born and you see the death star in early development. my only complaint is that you see all the characters from episode IV 3P0, R2-D2, Vader, Luke and Leia (although they were just babies) and chewy are in episode III the only character you don't see from episode IV is Han solo-END SPOILER- I think the reason this movie is so good is because it gets back to what the star wars movies are all about and that is a sci-fi action movie that has to do with the choices we make and the consequences of those actions. the first two (episode I and II) didn't do that. The first two tried to be more than what they were and that is why I think they didn't do as well as this one is going to do. The first one was way too obvious( young anikin skywalker had midiclorians that were off the chart and the council feared that training the boy would result in grave danger, Well Duh!) and the the second one was a love story(it's kind of creepy too if you think about. after he leaves tatoonine padme is the closet thing he has to a mother for about 10 years and then they fall in love). the third one gets back to the emotional conflicts and political conflicts. because the first three were a political conflict between the good guys and the bad guys. You had Vader and his boys who had a dictatorship and Leah, Luke and Han thought a democracy would be a better way to go. and episode II mirrors the ideals of the first three. you also get to see some cool dogfights in space which the first two were seriously lacking. I think it meshes perfectly with the fourth one. I say that because after I saw episode III I watched episode IV and it works really well. this is one movie i definitely plan on seeing again."
3200,6,'Sith' barely makes it past the satisfaction level,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005) Starring Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Frank Oz. "
3201,7,The Hidden Truth!,"Wow! Saw REVENGE OF THE SITH, and I'll tell you, this has some really great stuff in it. I was blown away, and completely enjoying this film, until I was slapped in the face with yet ANOTHER George Bush jab. So now, George Bush is Darth Vader??? "
3202,9,Awesome end to an awesome saga,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith truly allows the saga to out with a bang, and what a bang it is! From the very beginning we're swept off into action, and considering how much ground Lucas still had to cover he did a remarkable job; nothing feels rushed or overdone and the important pieces of the puzzle all fall neatly into place. There is a VERY good balance of drama and action here and the fight scenes are among the best ever shown in a Star Wars film, not just for their lengths but also for their choreography and effects. The film's visuals start to edge quite a lot towards Episode IV (aka the original Star Wars), effectively allowing this movie to achieve its goal in connecting one trilogy to the other."
3203,10,Good enough to see multiple times,"Well, in the two weeks or so Episode III has been in theaters I have already seen it twice. That alone says something."
3204,7,Solid conclusion that could have been a bit better,"I'm not a Star Wars enthusiast (i.e., nerd) so I'm not a purist by any means. But I was a bit disappointed in this movie, in how Anakin's turn was portrayed so dispassionately and uncharacteristically. It seemed contrived and could have been executed better."
3205,10,Awesome,"Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith This movie was freaking awesome! Oh my gosh ignorant people said that it didn't have a real plot to it but it does they're ignorant. It's really good and it's a really cool awesome movie...ya know what i mean n like go watch it it's like a must-see! that part where Skywalker got burnt i felt bad it was sad to see Obi do that to him. Also, the Yoda parts were so awesome! especially when he came in to see the Sith lord and the guards were killed just by flat THUMP from Yoda's force power! yeah! It's a really good movie because it actually does have a lot more meaning than just fighting and action like some other pointless movies...This movie is also important because it shows how Skywalker becomes evil and that is important. I felt so bad when Padme died they did a really good job on making sure the watchers could feel everything in the movie..you know what i mean? like you could feel the moment and what the characters were feeling...star wars all of them are really good!"
3206,9,Return to form for Lucas with Episode III,Story: With the clone war still raging. Anakin Skywalker becomes torn between ideals.
3207,6,good but disappointing,"I must admit I was a little disappointed with the new STAR WARS movie. I guess my biggest criticism is that it seems to be terribly unfocused. The problem this time isn't Lucas' usual problems, dialog and acting. I wouldn't call the dialog or acting great, but like Ep. IV I think it wasn't embarrassing and served the story. The problem this time is usually Lucas' strengths as a director, structure and editing. We have these great scenes of Palpatine trying to seduce Anakin, which are inter-cut with Yoda and the Wookies, or Obi-Wan fighting Gen. Grievous. What purpose does this serve, none as far as I can tell. Lucas spends so much time on the Wookies and Gen. Grievous it means that the end of the movie feels like its been cut down. There is potential for some powerful stuff there, which really isn't because it feels so short. Lucas just dosen't give it the time to be powerful. Like I said, I'm disappointed. Its not a bad movie per se, but tell you the truth, I liked Ep. II better on my first screening."
3208,6,It could have been better,"OK, the special effects were great. But the story could have been better. There were things that just didn't really worked. I thought it was a little strange that Anakin didn't know that his wife was pregnant, even though she was about 9 months pregnant. I thought it was also very weak that they let the main enemy in the second movie die in the beginning of this movie. It just isn't spectacular."
3209,9,Perfect wrap-up for the saga,George Lucas has done a great job satisfying the fans (even though) some would say he did the opposite simply to sound cooler than they actually are).
3210,10,Wow! A great way to bind the two trilogies.,"This is by far one of the best Star Wars movies ever, I liked it even more than Return of the Jedi. Before I saw this Empire Strikes Back was my favorite, but now it is a toss up. The movie has only been out for a week and a half and I have already seen it three times. Every time I walked out of the theater I just wanted to walk right back in. It surprised and also made me happy that Hayden Christiensen finally learned how to act for this film. He gave a very good performance, far better than what he did for Attack of the Clones. Going along with the performance aspect of the film Ewan McGregor gave an outstanding performance as Obi-wan Kenobi. When he delivered the line ""You were the chosen one!"" tears came into my eyes. In conclusion I just have to say I highly recommend this film for people who are fans and who aren't fans. Finally I hope that when George Lucas sees the success of this film I hope he makes the final trilogy."
3211,9,What a relief to finally see another good Movie in this epic Series,"Lucas finally dug down deep to his core and made a good movie(unlike the Episodes I & II. In those, he was trying to please everyone with Jar Jar, and just dumbed down the movie. Also, the first two contained way too much action and not enough stuff based on the books, if you can even stretch to say they were based on books. Luckily, Revenge of the Sith breaks the Mold of the first two."
3212,8,ILM reigns .......,"Completed the saga has been with the release of this movie. Happy to see that got a rating of 8.0/10 it has !! Well, sure one thing is.....compared to its predecessors criticized lesser this movie has been !! Coming to an end the lightsaber-fights, the galactic travels, the much hyped CGI Images are. But the fame of STAR WARS - failed to resurrect the image and reputation of the sequels, the prequels have. Why ? Many reasons there are - possibly : 1. People's change of interest in movies. 2. People's static expectation out of STAR WARS. 3. Cast & Crew / Acting (of course). 4. Expecting Darth Vader = Adolf Hitler. 5. Expecting Leia = Padme, Kenobi = Han, Luke = Anakin ( aahhh.. no love triangle here is !!)"
3213,10,Absolutely Breathtaking,"""Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the Sith""  Written & Directed by George Lucas"
3214,8,"Lucas ""Strikes Back"" with ""Sith""","Congratulations to George Lucas and the cast and crew of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith for finally bringing to us fans the prequel that we have been waiting for during the past 6 years. Revenge of the Sith is not only a significantly better movie when compared to Episodes I and II, but it also stacks up well with the movies of the old trilogy, and provides a wonderful bridge between the lackluster Attack of the Clones and A New Hope."
3215,10,Great way to finish the Star Wars Saga,"I loved this movie from start to finish. It is fairly fast paced as it had to tie up several loose ends and set up the story line heading into episode IV. Lots of action and many ""dark"" scenes especially with Annakin and the younglings. (That was very dark!) Yoda was great as always and we even get to see the planet from which Chewbacca came."
3216,9,I liked it,"Among the six movies, this one ranks third in my book, behind Episode IV and Episode V."
3217,7,This has saved the Franchise,I pride myself on being a sci-fi buff but I have had the niggling feeling that after the commercial success of the first movie I had been swept up in the popular & commercial hysteria of the franchise and not on the basis of any serious critical acclaim. I had stopped watching DVD's of the movies and it was fast disappearing off my top 10 list.
3218,8,Thank you Chewbacca!,Just seen Episode 3 after 27 years of waiting. 
3219,6,Starwars Episode 3 - Revenge of the sith,"This film is not on Par with the originals, do NOT be deceived. How Annikin is polluted to the dark side isn't by any means justified. He foresee's his wife dying at child birth, so he decides to surrender all his morality and ideology to betray 15 years of tuition in Jedi religion to the fullest."
3220,9,Great Movie!!,"As a Star Wars fan, I was disappointed with both Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. I guess I just expected more and there just wasn't enough substance to overlook Jar Jar in 1 and the awkward courtship scenes between Anakin and Padme in 2. In all fairness, these movies were merely setting the stage for the final act so they would never be able to pack the same punch as the last of the prequels. But like many of you, my disappointment wasn't going to stop me from seeing Revenge of the Sith! This movie more than makes up for any disappointment I felt after I saw the first two prequels. What a fantastic movie - fast paced, decent acting and dialogue, and most importantly, a great story which wasn't overpowered by the spectacular special effects. I thought Anakin's slide into darkness was very believable and the last scenes with him and Obi-Wan were very powerful. In fact, I can't think of any other scenes in any of the Star Wars movies that would even compare (Vader revealing his relationship to Luke in Empire Strikes Back is second in my opinion)."
3221,9,Easily the best of the first three,"This movie is easily the best of Episodes 1 through 3. George Lucas' dialogue writing for Anakin and Padme is still a bit subpar, but the action is still as crisp as ever. Hayden Christensen's acting is still a bit subpar as well. I truly believe that Ian McDiarmid(Palpatine) steals this movie out from under the entire cast. He plays the movie as a legendary snake-oil salesman going for the gold medal. The lightsaber duels are fantastic. The humour in some cases goes a bit far, but it's still funny. Artoo Detoo also steals a few scenes as well. This movie ties everything together, bringing it inline with the classic trilogy we all know and love. Keep your eyes peeled for several in-movie treats, as well as a cameo by the fantastic actor that played ""Scorpius"" in ""Farscape"". All in all, a real treat of a movie."

3223,10,Everything you've been waiting for...and more,"Although the setting of the new film is framed by the existing lore of Episodes 2 and 4, Lucas delivered all that could have been hoped for, in addition to everything that was expected."
3224,8,Almost but not quite,****SPOILERS****
3225,8,Shake yourselves people,"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan (the first movie came out when I was 9) and I understand all true fans have very high expectations for this series, but come on people!!!! THey're Just Movies!!! I have read post after post on this site that has lambasted George Lucas for everything from meglomaniacal control of the movie's script to his gratuitous use of too much CGI."
3226,10,An Awesome Film in the Prequel Saga,"I loved this film out of all the prequels! I loved the end journey of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of the Empire. This movie basically bridges the way to 'A New Hope' and I am hoping for the T.V. series which shows what happens between the two trilogies. This movie is the bomb, above all levels! I love the original trilogy and I seem to be bored with the prequel trilogy. Basicallly, in all sense of the words, 'Phantom Menace' was absolutely horrible. 'Attack of the Clones' was hilarious to the fact of the screwed up love attraction between a Senator that seems to never change in age, height, and weight, with a twenty-year old at 6 foot, 1 inch. A disappointment with the action in 'Attack' nevertheless a mere stupid plot with only special effects to tell the story. I believe that the special effects were the last hope for Lucas's film. But this film ruled with such distinction and the first time ever, a plot. This story contains character's you could relate to in every sense of the word. The tragedy of the fall of Anakin Skywalker creates a tear-jerking experience only some witnessed. This film is the first film 9Of the Prequels) I've seen in theaters. I was in a theater with a huge screen with stadium seating, by the way it included surround sound stereo, which is so loud. This film was the best choice to see in theaters. In ranking of the entire saga: "
3227,10,"How can people be giving this 7 stars, let alone just ONE!","Now I have your attention... This is a superb film. The story, the acting, the special effects and don't forget VADAR! People are bashing the film solely because they are Lucas haters, haters that have lost respect for the man after eps I&II, but even the haters have to admit that this film is EXCEPTIONAL."
3228,,"Please Read This Review, Now.","People constantly trash on this movie for understandable reasons. It is certainly not a perfect movie, and George Lucas clearly had two examples (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones) of what not to do with this movie, and yet he still made plenty of mistakes. Although, this movie does have some great moments when you actually feel emotions towards the characters, and in this movie, you get to hear Hayden Christensen not whine about everything every 16 seconds. This movie was very liked by me, and if you think this is a terrible movie, well, honestly I do not blame you, but re-watch it sometime soon, and appreciate the good parts of the film. Most say it is only good because it is dark. Sure it is a dark movie, but I believe it should be appreciated for not being a pile of Jar Jar Binks'. "
3229,,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith - EMC's Review,"Before we start this review we need to expand upon a major problem that Episode II caused for this film: the relationship between Owen Lars & Anakin Skywalker. So in Episode IV: A New Hope there's a scene where Obi Wan Kenobi speaks to Luke about his father. He says things about how Uncle Owen didn't like the fact that Anakin became a Jedi and thought him reckless. This scene doesn't make sense because there is no indication of this in Episode II, when the two meet at Tatooine, nor is there a scene where Obi Wan ever meets Uncle Owen, so there's no way he could know this much about the two stepbrothers. But at the end of this film Owen receives the child of Anakin from a guy he hasn't even seen before in his life (Obi Wan Kenobi), and willingly takes him in. MAJOR PLOT HOLE. Anyway, with that little mess clarified let's move on with this review of the last prequel of the Star Wars Saga. After two of the most disappointing films of all time (for some), people's' expectations for this film were extremely low. No one even cared if they'd seen Darth Vader at the end of the trailer, after the previous two movies you didn't even trust your own judgment! But to everyone's surprise, this film improved an enormous amount, with favorable reviews across the globe. So you thought, hey maybe it'll be good, and it was! The opening scene was so action packed you ignored the fact that it was all CGI! It introduced General Grievous and had that neat light saber duel where Anakin beheads Count Dooku from an order he should have resisted by the corrupt Chancellor. Now, an opening scene is very important in any movie, it can be as simple as a feather falling down on a guy's shoes, setting the tone of a gentle though inspiring story (Forrest Gump), though you can't make out exactly what the point of this opening scene is, you still find it enjoyable. The script improves at the slightest but suffers from a similar problem pointed out in our Attack of the Clones review. Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi share some cutesy talks about their previous and exciting endeavors we didn't get to see, again treating the audience like fools! The dialog between Padme & Anakin is so bad you start to wonder if George Lucas only did these movies for visually inspiring action scenes that can sell toys. With this film the first few scenes with Anakin and Padme are so badly written you can't wait for like Obi Wan or Yoda to pop up on the screen and talk about an upcoming battle or something. The clones in this movie are just awesome to watch, some of the battle scenes on that Utapau planet are amazingly realistic. It's cool how they introduce a Wookie planet but they didn't need to shoe-horn Chewbacca in here just to sell more merchandising products. A great thing about this movie is Chacellor Palpatine and his seduction of Anakin Skywalker into becoming Darth Vader, although we question why a seemingly good guy would straight up murder children just to save Padme. He has good motives though: he senses Padme will die at the birth of their twins, Luke and Leia, believing this will actually happen remembering his mother and how he wasn't strong enough to save her. It's also cool to see how purely evil the emperor can be. John Williams is best here as the musical composer, the final light saber duel between Anakin and Obi Wan is emotionally gripping and truly powerful, with music perfectly capturing that Epic feel. But this one is sort of packed with unnecessary light saber duels, like the one between Yoda and Darth Sidious. In episode VI the emperor looks down upon light sabers as weapons of Jedi Knight, we thought that he was so powerful that he didn't even need a light saber to protect himself! The scene where Padme is choked by Anakin and everything leading up to that is great! Order 66 might just bring a tear to your eye and as a whole this film will leave you breathless! It's a tale of triumph, loss and a new hope... Out of the six films this one stands fourth, proving difficult for us at EMC to rank it, as we love all of these films but hey, if they have to be ranked, they have to be ranked..!"
3230,9,Is 'Sith worthy of Star Wars?,"Reviewing Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith can be tricky. The Star Wars trilogies aren't just movies. They're modern folklore. Characters from the films are household names, and are thus immortalized. Whether you're a die hard fan who waited on a long line to see The Empire Strikes Back 25 years ago, or a new aficionado being drawn to the mythology, watching the Star Wars epics evokes a different experience for every person; audiences are so diverse in devotion and age that it hardly makes sense to nit pick at plot inconsistencies or improbable events and physical situations. Even special effects aren't worth talking about; most viewers know they'll be cutting edge. It seems more useful to criticize the interaction between characters and how the he viewer relates to them- this is after all what we tend to remember long after a movie had its run in the box office. And so that is what my review focuses on. The duologue in ""Sith"" is true to the Star Wars films, no surprises there. Most of the cast is excellent. In particular, Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi Wan Kenobi is nothing short of amazing when you consider that his character has aged several years since the first prequel. His persona as Obi Wan is so convincing that one could be fooled in to thinking that Alec Guiness' performance in the original Star Wars was inspired by McGregor's instead of the other way around. His character is also believable and consistent, both in acting and action. Rather than go through the whole cast I'll get to the point by contrasting this character with Anakin Skywalker. This role is the most important one in the film because it is necessarily complex and will transform into the most well known figure of Star Wars lore. Lucas certainly had his work cut out trying to wrap up this transition from benevolent hero to super villain in two hours and 26 minutes- all while telling the rest of the story. There were several problems with his approach. For one, inconsistency- like arguing that killing Chancellor Palpatine is not the Jedi way- and then killing children only a few scenes later? Another problem is Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin. It just lacked the depth his character needed, that of a man becoming increasingly desperate, his will weakening to the point where he loses his judgment and ultimately succumbs to evil. I think this is only somewhat Christensen's fault. The problem here seems to be with coaching and direction; if you're going to spend loads of time and a gajillion dollars on production, why leave out acting? Finally, during the climactic fight between Obi Wan and Anakin, I couldn't really sense the drama because I was distracted by a furiously paced sequence of light saber battles ending in an ultra cool monolithic backdrop of volcanic environs. After the characters cheated death several times in all kinds of ways during the sequence it almost seemed humorous that Obi Wan would tell Anakin to forfeit- because he had the higher ground. I think Lucas needed to take a lesson here from.... himself. I remember being in awe during Return of the Jedi when Luke fought Vader while the Emperor watched. Three strong performances by three great characters was a magical experience where the battle balanced the scene instead of drowning it with special effects. OK, enough with my criticisms- er tough love. Believe it or not I do think it was a great movie and worthy of its place in Star Wars history. It was a treat to see the care taken to make sure the final scenes looked like what we remember seeing a long time ago in a theater far, far away."
3231,8,As good as the original three,"A vast improvement on the dross that Lucas put out the last two times. This film does live up to the original three. The epic nature of the film is there and the special effects are, of course magnificent. Having said that, however, R2D2 jumping around to entertain children Lucas appears to be trying to gather a new fan base in a similar way to the Jar Jar Binks nonsense of the last two. He appears oblivious that his fan base is all grown up and wearing XXL jedi outfits. The humor of the first three was touching and personal, this is just moronic. The instances are thankfully much fewer than in Episodes I and II. The main weakness of this film is the dialogue. I enjoyed being immersed in the story but found myself at times thrown back to reality by conversations that were so stilted that it made me pity the actors who were forced to say them. My wife's comment was that, ""it sounded like it had been read off the back of a bubblegum packet"". There was not a lot that I could say to disagree with her."
3232,9,George Lucas finally did it... right.,"*Spoiler Free!!* George Lucas has finished the greatest movie series in the history of cinema. Revenge of the Sith fills in all the holes, answers the unknowns, and should leave any avid Star Wars fan feeling complete."
3233,9,"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...","I have no idea what Batleh is talking about!!! This was a great movie!!! The special/visual effects were top notch. The stunts were done perfectly. It was a good script. Okay, so there were a few cheesy lines, but lots of movies have those. The score was exceptionally phenomenal! I even bought the soundtrack!! Believe me, I REALLY like the movie if I buy the soundtrack! Ewan McGregor delivered the role so seamlessly, it's almost like he WAS Obi-Wan. Natalie Portman did a good job too. You actually think that her heart's REALLY breaking at the end of the movie. And Hayden Christiansen's acting definitely improved! Sure, he still had his non-believable moments, but there were far less than in Episode 2. Over all, I give this movie a 9.8. If you want to know what a REAL 1 star movie is, go watch Napolean Dynamite!"
3234,2,Really??,"My background : I was 10 when Star Wars came out and have been a fan ever since. The 1st episode was over obvious about aiming for the kids with Har Har Binks. It was quite a relief to see he got the point and diminished his role. Let's start by saying the acting was stiff and boring. I'd also like to quote Robot Chicken Star Wars : I'll tell everyone what a whiney little b*tch you were about Padamame, Panda Bear or whatever her name was... Pretty much sums up the role of Anikin... a spoiled little brat wah wah wah!!! I wanna be a Jedi or else I'm taking my lightsaber to the darkside!!! I thought of the turmoil shown by Harry Osbourne's father fighting his Green Goblin alter ego that was at least some type of attempt. Sadly we got a steaming pile of nothing! Let's not forget the final dialog of the film ""NOOOOO""! OMG!! I was stunned and in disbelief asking myself this is it? this the how the end of episode 3 is ends? really?? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"
3235,10,It's the BEST of them all!,"Today I saw the best SW Movie of all: REVENGE OF THE SITH. I think, this was worth waiting 28 years for. It has great Special Effects, great Acting and tons of emotionally touching moments."
3236,10,BESTEST MOVIE EVER!!!,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER I LUV LIGTSABERS FIGHTS AND CGI FLIPS AND LAVA!!! OH MY GAWD LOOK A ROBOT WITH 4 ARMS HOLDING 4 LIGHTSABERS AND THEIR SPINNING!!!! WHO CARES ABOUT ACTUAL STORY AND CHARACTER ARCS I LIKE LAVA!!! AHHHHHHHHH
3237,7,"Ouch, got CGI in my eye--- possible spoilers","The long anticipated Star Wars prequel, ""Episode III: Revenge of The Sith"", was pitched well as the film that binds the old and new films together. But it still lacked that depth that existed in the old Star Wars films."
3238,8,The Redemption of the Prequels,"The first two movies of Star Wars' prequel era were not at all great. People were losing hope on George Lucas' decision making and ability to create good and iconic stories he wrote in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. The prequels were doomed to be forgotten and left out by even the most hardcore Star Wars fans. But then, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was released in the year of 2005."
3239,10,A perfect conclusion for the saga,Revenge of the Sith shows the dark side of Star Wars in a way we'd never seen before with perfect interpretations from Hayden and Ewan. We now see the tragedy of Anakin/Darth Vader complete and the rise of the empire.
3240,10,Excellent Movie,"This movie was amazing. The acting was fantastic, special effects were perfect, the music went well with every scene, the story was great yet sad, and most of all enjoyable; George Lucas did an excellent job. "
3241,9,"Short and simple...the best since ""Empire""","I'll keep this short and simple. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" will always be my favorite because you see Vader at his best. But ""Revenge of the Sith"" has moved it's way up the my second favorite and by far, destroys the previous 2 prequels. It has the action we had been asking for and was missing previously. It was dark, but still had a few moments that made people laugh. The slow parts were a necessary lull in the action before it ramped back up again. Still a little weak dialog but not much. Lines were out the door and for just reasons. I suggest that if you're new to all of this and your wondering what all the hype is about, at the very least watch the first two prequels, then go and see ""Sith"". You'll then understand the phenomenon that is STAR WARS. Loved it !!!"
3242,5,watchable,"OK, the last 2 were so horrible one might give it a ten just because it was watchable, which it was. did it compare with the first 3 films, no. This film was all cgi, the actors were horrible, just there to complement the graphics. The plot was useless and the directing was centered on complementing the graphics with the actor's, the other way around makes for a good movie(LOTR)."
3243,10,"excellent, real force","George lucas is guy that knows how to make good movies, and bad movies too. Revenge of the sith IS A GOOD, VERY GOOD (like master yoda would say)MOVIE, is probably my second favorite, intense action, great performances, and a well written story that connect you with this characters. I know i'm a great star wars fan, but this movie gotta be one of the years best, i am very excited too see the next academy award, revenge of the sith could really won one or two (make up?gci?)and i will love too see an Oscar in hands of a star wars character (palpatine?). The dialogue is, ..better (honestly i liked it, sometimes). The action sequence of the beginning must be in the top five of the most exciting action sequences of all time, really awesome. George, thanks for giving us a fantasy far from this world, for presenting us wonderful characters and to lets us follow Luke and Anakin's adventures in that galaxy far, far away."
3244,9,episode 3 rockz,in the final installment of the saga this movie shows the end of anakins journey to the dark side. this movie has all u could ask for. action romance and drama. the special effects on this movie are breath-taking it seemed so real.i nearly cried when i walked out of the cinema realizing that was it no more waiting for the next star wars movie to come out. i was happy that now i had seen all the movies and i can still watch them over and over again if i had enough money and i was born earlier i would have gone to all the premiers but i still enjoyed seeing this one.it was a bit darker than the others with awesome music to fit the mood.i would suggest this movie for star wars fans and people who just wanna see a good movie. i would not suggest taking young children as some scenes are violent and quite gruesome but it still kicks ass.
3245,10,A visually and mentally satisfying film,"This film, like someone previous to my entry wrote, is far better than the first two in that the story really comes alive. I thought Hayden Christiansen was amazing in this film, although for me Ewan Mc Gregor still steals the show. It had an epic quality about it that made you feel shell shocked leaving the cinema. It really is a big huge blockbuster, no expense spared where special effects are concerned! I never thought I would become a star wars fan, but in recent years I have watched the films and realised just what a cinematic accomplishment they are. I don't think there will ever be anything quite like it again. I am a huge fan of George Lucas, so on behalf of myself and all the Star Wars fans on here, we salute you."
3246,9,my favorite of the star wars movies..,The good: ewan McGregor as Always does a great job..
3247,10,An amazing movie.,"For a fan of Star Wars for thirty years, Revenge of the Sith was a must-see. I had done my fair share of research, spoiler reading, script downloading, book reading, etc for this, the epic third episode in one of the most amazing series of media, that I believed I was prepared for what George Lucas would throw on the screen. I was concerned that there would be images that my kids would fine disturbing, so I opted on bringing the ten year old (him being my oldest) and the two of us set out."
3248,9,More than a good movie...it makes the rest of the series better,"I'm sure everyone by now knows that this movie is vastly better than it's two predecessors. As I write this, it has already made $270 MM domestically, so in all likelihood you've seen it already, too. As I've been thinking about the film, though, I want to add some comments that make me appreciate this movie far more than I expected."
3249,6,"8.0??? Oh, please...","I'm really sorry, but movies like this one are made only for the fans...the real ones, that is. I was never a great fan of Lucas' films but i wanted to see this one, just to get an ending for this enormous commercial hype made by LucasFilms. The movie itself is mediocre I would say, 80% of it is CGI! Of course, it's that kind of movie where usage of CGI is inevitable but in this case, it's excessive. Story...? Okey, I'll bear with it...although I think that Anakin's ""transition"" to the dark side is way too ""short"", I mean...he switches side in 5 minutes, somewhere in the middle of the movie...and the whole point of the movie should be it, or? Acting is terrible...Ewan McGregor deserves a credit, he is always good, Natalie Porman as well. The rest? No, thank you. I am sorry, fans...don't want to upset you...but this is not movie art...this is modern CGI art with one little bit of the story hanging from it. It is not enough, not for 8/10 if you ask me."
3250,10,Greatest Star Wars of all time,"This episode of Star Wars is the greatest we have ever seen. From classic star wars humor to the intense action the original trilogy only wishes it had, Revenge of the Sith brings new light to the prequel trilogy like never before. The plot is so intense most viewers fail to see it even after 3 times of watching, the entire prequel trilogy has a plot behind the curtain that blows any franchise away in terms of keeping the audience in the dark. Until you have seen everything chronologically (including the clone wars) through the prequel era, only then can you fully appreciate the intense scheme Sheev Palpatine has in store for taking over the galaxy single handed. It's been over 10 years since this movies release and it's been branded a classic. Be ready for the ultimate star wars film that will knock your friken socks off..."
3251,10,The Best Movie in the Series,"'Revenge of the Sith' is the EXECUTION part of the trilogy, where everything is developd and now, we are to see how everything transpired into, sadly, the darkest chapter in the series - the rise of the Empire, the end of the Jedi Council, and the rise of Darth Vader."
3252,10,Revenge of the Sith is just Awesome,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. What else can be said about this film. George Lucas is a true Master. Best of the first 3 films. Good storyline, incredible effects. It's the kind of movie you can watch 100 times and still get excited about. Very happy with the closing of the gap between episode 2 and 4 did a fantastic job. Didn't extend it like other filmmakers that want the saga to continue and add nonsense. There was plenty of comic relief without adding of funny characters. Star Wars will break every box office record set until now and will be a true test for any new great film to meet (only George or Steven have the force it takes)"
3253,8,"A great film, no doubt.","Frankly, this is a great movie. Like most movies, it has flaws. However, many of the problems in the previous two films have been fixed in this one. One thing that clearly puts it over Attack of the Clones is its acting. Ewan was great in the previous film, but is even better here. The same with Samuel L. Jackson. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman have vastly improved. Thanks to James, you can feel Vader's pain as he destroys the medical room. Ian is great, as usual. As far as acting goes, this movie has no problem. However, one serious flaw is the portrayal of General Grievous. His constant coughing is something I can stand. However, his terrible accent is endlessly annoying. Also, after seeing the Clone Wars micro-series, I was pumped up to see Grievous in action on film, but was let down by the fact that he is killed by a single Jedi. In the end, this movie is not the best Star Wars movie, but I definitely place it before the two prequels."
3254,10,Exactly what was required,Just have to say...
3255,10,Episode III: A Spectacular End to a Childhood.,"Episode III has been one of the most anticipated films of all time. The saga is now complete. What do we do now? I am 25 years old and my first introduction to the galaxy far, far away, was when my father brought home our first VHS system, also included was the original 20th Century CBS/FOX copy of ""Star Wars."" From the opening moments of the imperial star destroyer filling the frame, I was hooked. Not only because of the great story telling and wild imagination, but I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: become a filmmaker. With the release of Episode III, I found that sense of excitement again, but it's too late. In a perfect world, I would have experienced that sensation with Episodes I and II. Not to say I hated the first of the prequels, in fact I enjoy them. But Episode III was the story and action I was waiting for. The great return of Darth Vader. Spoiler Alert: The only complaint I have about the downward decay of young Anakin was that he doesn't become truly evil. A word which has been driven into our minds since Obi-Wan's speech to Luke in ""A New Hope."" Anakin does commit some brutal acts, but not how I expected. Spoiler Alert: Anakin's fall to the dark side mirrors what any of us humans could go through. All of us make bad decisions forced out of love. I was surprised to see Anakin turn evil in order to save Padme from ""certain death."" I wanted to see Anakin forget all he knew, and only care about one person, himself as ruler of the galaxy. Spoiler Alert: When Padme passes on from ""losing her will to live,"" Darth Sidious informs Vader that he killed her in his anger. Outraged from the news, Vader belts out a horrific cry that shatters everything around him. I wanted to see prior to that, Darth Sidious informing Vader about his current state, i.e. explanations about the infamous Vader costume. And only because Vader doesn't fully understand the transformation, I wanted to see Vader violently confront Sidious. Almost a thing like, ""what have you done to me."" That sort of thing. And in a feeble attempt to save his own life, Sidious could persuade Vader to take out his anger against the galaxy. The film manages to downsize Vader's evilness. We know him as a horrific figure in the night, not a love stricken sissy hidden beneath a mask. And the screen time Vader is actually present, way too short. I only saw these things because as a follower of the films, it's what I wanted to see. As the film goes, the pacing was unbelievable. Time flew by and I was once again transported back to my childhood. The dialogue was nicely shaped up. The only dialogue I cringed at was Padme's delivery of ""Hold me, like you did by the lake on Naboo."" Other than that, excellent come back from Episode II. The fights were as stellar as one could hope. The infamous Anakin vs. Obi-Wan lived up to the hype. I only wish Lucas left in the original running time of 25 minutes, inter-cut with the Sidious vs. Yoda clash. The montage of the Jedi slaughter was amazing. John Williams' score really surpassed the previous ones. The new track, ""Battle of the Heroes,"" is simply perfect. On May 19th, my childhood ended, but no regrets. I could only wish to create such an incredible force (no pun intended) as Lucas did. I heard a rumor that when Episode III is released on DVD, it will include six new scenes. I could only hope for a re-release with the added scenes sometime down the road. Overall, Episode III was worth the wait. Wish it could have been longer, a 3 hour running time would have been a great way to go out. The film is a worthy entry into the Star Wars saga. I only hope it conquers ""Titanic."" If any film could, Episode III is it. 10 out 10, way to go Lucas. All I can say is,"" thank you."""
3256,5,Graphics and special effects great; couldn't hear the dialogue in the movie due to poor music/audio mixing. Disappointment.,"I am a big Star Wars fan, but was seriously disappointed with this film due to the fact that the music took precedence over the dialogue. My husband and I had to strain to hear what was being said, and repeatedly had to ask each other, ""Did you hear what they said?"" hoping the other person could fill in the blanks. I love John William's music scores, but wish that whoever was in charge of editing would've noticed that the music was far too loud, and the dialogue was way too soft. I would've also enjoyed more verbal interaction between characters...but I realize that Star wars is strictly fast pace, adventure, and it's history shows that it doesn't require much dialogue to keep the audience's attention."
3257,8,"""Sith"" is a success even measured against classics.","Normally I tend to give sci-fi movies automatic credit for just being in their genre, but Revenge of the Sith stands alone as a great piece of cinema even when measured against the classical epic films of the 20th century. Not being a hard-core Lucasophile, I came at the movie from a fairly objective space and I found that of all Star Wars episodes, this one does the best job of communicating Lucas' overall philosophy - that we are all simultaneous mixtures of good and evil and ultimately we must achieve balance internally to be successful individually. Further, it seems plain to me now that Lucas believes this concept of balance best secures the future of humanity. Through the whole series it seems that Lucas is clarifying the old adage that ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely"". By showing the ambivalence and confusion in Anakin in this episode, Lucas succeeds in showing how dangerous it is to make permanent judgments that define others as either ""good"" or ""evil"". Besides the quality of the film as a vehicle for setting the philosophical base for Star Wars as a story, Revenge of the Sith is remarkably entertaining and suspenseful with an ideal mix of logical and emotional appeal. One of the most important symbols in this episode for me was the moment when Obi-Wan, arriving to face Anakin on his hellish headquarters planet, sheds his robe as he exits the ship to reveal his (pure) white garb beneath. At this moment it becomes clear that his ultimate motives are unselfish and will forever be at odds with those of his hitherto-beloved apprentice. My only major disappointment is with the halting and awkward dialog and the fact that not even this fine cast was able to overcome such maudlin ramblings as those of Skywalker and the queen. Finally, I am impressed with Lucas' judicious editing - this episode is the only one that did not leave me even once looking at my wristwatch."
3258,8,Star Wars is back 70's style,"All I can say about this movie is wow. I went to see the movie at 12:01 am on Thursday morning with my dad and friends. Needless to say we were all ecstatic. When this movie started it started with a bang. This movie will be known as the renewal of the great director George Lucas showing that he skills he had almost two decades ago. This movie will also be known as the most intensive action of the series. What this movie lacks just like Episodes I and II is dialogue and once again Natalie Portman and Hayden act like they are kissing manikins. The way all the actors are acting it's as if they are not flying through space on a rescue mission but on a studio sound stage in Australia. But the action scenes made up for about half of that. The other half was the shear thought of seeing Darth Vader. When I saw him come onto the screen I felt goose bumps start spreading all over my arms and the hair stand on end on my neck. I felt like I was five when I was first amazed by the arguably most famous villain in all of entertainment. Even my dad who was 20 when the original came out was amazed. He lost all faith from the last two but it warmed my heart when I saw his eyes glazed over during those magnificently choreographed scenes. He went to see Return of the Jedi at 12:00am on May 25, 1983 to see an ending to one of the greatest mythological stories of his and my generation. He has never forgotten that night for the past two decades and as I see the beginnings of that greatest mythology of my and his generation I have a feeling I'll share this experience with my son some two decades from now. Thank you master Jedi Lucas and as corny as it me be May the force be with you all."
3259,7,Possibly the best Star Wars yet!,"In 1977, I was looking into the movie theater for something to watch. I found the only thing that was playing, Star Wars. But it was sci-fi, and I wasn't a big fan of sci-fi. But my mom said it got great reviews, so I saw it and I was amazed! AMAZED!"
3260,9,the prequel and almost thirty years ago,"i have to give this movie a 9. i mean its star wars. i came out even before i was around. my mom took me to the second and third before i could even remember. then i went to all the prequels with either a girlfriend or someone else. i believe the first two were really stalling out till anakin turned to vader. my favorite parts are the yoda fights. i always like yoda, so wise and talking backward he do. i do feel the parts of jango and boba fett where under played and could use more information. in the original they did a great job with describing and introducing jabba the hut. which i could have cared less about. only good thing to come out of that was the meeting of boba fett. which is and will always will be only of my favorite characters. you get to see a great transformation of the emperor, which we all have been waiting for. wheres yoda when you need him? we meet chewy, and last but definitely not least we see the transformation of anakin to darth vader. he truly must be the chosen one for the dark side, because after a beating like that, someone must be looking out for you. not even or god is that merciless. all and all, its the best of the new star wars. leads use right into the original, just wish they went more into darth vader and the dark side."
3261,9,"lousy light-sable fights (shame on you, Sam Jackson!)","ROTS finally delivers what most of us wanted, but what I still can't understand is why all light-sable fights in II and III are so terribly choreographed? Sam Jackson has three Jedi-knights accompany him to arrest the Sith Lord, and within 3 seconds all three of them are dead. And then Sam gives one of his poorest performances ever battling Palpatine. A classic example of miscasting a great actor. Even the battle of the heroes was overdone; again too much emphasis on the effects (the background) and not on the drama. It seems the classic battle between Kenobi and Darth Maul had a standard so high, it couldn't be repeated."
3262,9,the falcon in this movie,i know some of u people think that the should have showed the millennium falcon but they didn't your wrong ha ha ha okay if you want to see it when they are coming after killing count Duke and they are coming in the nice spaceship not the half spaceship that is on fire.look at the bottom right and you will see the millennium falcon landing . so you are thinking oh Han solo i driving it.No he is only 5 I'm pretty sure he doesn't have a permit to drive it yet. i think Lando's father is driving it.then Lando gets it then Han solo wins it.so thats just a little star wars trivia for you and for anyone who reads this tell your friend make u look like a smart guy
3263,8,He Actually did it...,"After 3 years of nail biting, it finally arrived. The (middle)conclusion to the Star Wars saga. Episode I and II, were no good, ergo the nail biting. There has been a lot of speculation and dread that this third and final film (so far), also would fail. Personally I think it started of bad, but after 15 minutes I was completely consumed by this story. I even think it improved the original SW films. It gave a better understanding of how evil Darth Vader really is and how corrupted he is and why."
3264,8,Sith - a problem,"I got to see Sith last night as one of a lucky few here in NZ, the first time zone to see this fantastic movie."
3265,10,A fitting end to an amazing legacy,"I was fortunate enough to get to see the midnight showing in my hometown last night and it was *amazing*. The fighting scenes were incredible, the action kept me on the edge of my seat, the emotion just flies off the screen from every character (though some of the lines are a bit cheesy), and Hayden Christensen is so very hot...especially when he's evil..."
3266,10,i like it,"Well...first I have to say that I've always been a fan of the saga...so I think we all know that acting was never the main reason why People loved star wars.. How many academy awards did star wars 4, 5, 6? Received for best acting? (None)...it was the characters and the story That made us dream. Well at least for me...so I think this last movie Is great because it has all the magic of the star wars saga...Hayden Christensen and Ewan Macgregor do their job...the CGI it's awesome...and I did felt Heartbroken to see Anakin turn into Darth because of the lies he was made to believe I really like it the character that Lucas made as Anakin skywalker it was full of great intentions and know I understand why in the end Darth Vader in episode 6 still has a beating heart inside when he saves he's son Luke...thanks Mr. Lucas"
3267,3,A lazy effort...,Revenge of the Sith is best described as a lazy film.
3268,10,Star Wars ROTS,"I saw the movie. It was great. Goerge Lucas really tied the movies together. It has action, romance and of course a tragedy. The movie picks up were the Palpatine is kidnapped and Anakin and OB1 go to rescue him. Great sound affects and overall good story line. Padme and Anakin are in a situation where all things go nuts. If you like a mystery this might be the movie for you. I also read the book which enabled me to understand the Movie better. It gave hits on why the droids are so important in the movie. When did Palpatine start with his ""ideas ""for the Republic. Why Luke and Lea ended up where they did and so much More. To good not too see. Even worst idea not to own. This is a keeper."
3269,6,Lucas should have not directed the movie,"Overall pretty disappointing - the movie lacks soul for a lack of another word. Hayden Christensens performance was abysmal, wooden and flat, he was not a credible Anakin. The whole movie was based around him and his journey but his journey was quick and easy with not much inner torment - a real actor was needed to bring out Anakin and Darth Vader, Christianson failed and that ultimately causes the movie to stutter along. Natalie Portman was mediocre in her role, not helped by the poor chemistry between her and Christensen. Grievous was underused, a mere accidental bystander swept into the movie, who was he?. Christopher Lee got virtually no screen time. Chewbacca made a token appearance what for? for the rabid old school fans? it was pointless to the direction of the movie A lot of pointless visual extravaganza like the opening sequence that didn't help the overall plot and direction of the movie, just self serving ostentatiousness. Yes George we know you and you little team at ILM can create some phenomenal graphics but associate it, connect it with the overall direction and spirit of the movie. Movies are about good acting and logical flow and good plots with ""chemistry"" between the lead actors. This movie has too much chopping and changing, snippets of scenes that barely set up the movie abound, it felt the whole movie was going through the motions, the tension build up was missing in action and the final transformation into the suited Vader was hollow and anti-climatic. Movies were the supporting actors Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor completely outshine and dominate the supposed lead are unsatisfying. The former two are the only two actors in the whole movie the gave a decent performance. Samuel L Jackson is not a jedi, he has been terribly miscast in all three films. Things change, in the 70's and 80's Michael Jackson used to make good music and George Lucas used to make good movies. Things change... George is one from four, a mere 25% in directing StarWars movies 1,2,3, were weak only 4 was great and and seems in retrospect a directing fluke. 5 and 6 the best two in my book were directed by other people. Perhaps he should have taken a back seat and let a real director handle things"
3270,,too much crap,"Too many monsters, too many toys. All those digital effects look as phony and obvious as the zipper on the Creature from the Black Lagoon's costume."
3271,2,Bad movie possible spoiler I am not sure,This is one of the darkest pieces of crap I have seen. Well deserving of the pg13 rating. It is the worst of the 6 movies. There is nothing new or uplifting about the movie. I did not get the feeling of hope I did at the end of Empire. I should have realized this when the theater I saw the movie in wasn't even 1/4 full. I left the theater disappointed in a way because the movie could have been better. I kept hoping for some expanded vision of the force that we have seen in all the other movies but none of the themes hinted at were expanded upon. It is long and monotonous with one light saber fight after another. Also there was 25min of previews before the movie started. This is a movie that could have been told in about 30 min. I will say this I can see it does tie the movies together. I would suggest waiting until the DVD comes out to see this movie.
3272,7,Faineant,"In this day of over-hyped, over-marketed, media blitzing campaigns for movie debuts, it is often challenging to discern what will prove to be a worthwhile watch. "
3273,9,movie was great but not better than the original trilogy,"This movie was a fantastic movie. The sound made you feel as if you were really there. The special effects were awesome. The acting was great! Dialogue was much better than I and II. I would recommend people to see this movie, but I would watch it in order. I would watch 1 and 2 and then this and then the original trilogy, because some things in this movie are spoiled because you know that the event is going to happen since you have seen the original trilogy. I believe that the stories are better for the original trilogy, but that it was a good idea to add on to them. This movie really helped me understand the whole thing a lot better. One thing that I especially liked about this movie was that there was a surprise around every corner and you couldn't guess what was about to happen. Also, I liked how they still had the opening summary like they did in the old movies and some of the music was the same. The CGI however did give a special touch to the movies that were not there before. I think it was a good idea to use CGI in the Star Wars films because they are space-age and seem to be in the future. I would not use CGI in Indiana Jones 4 for example because it takes place in the 1930s and it would not be the same without real live actors being there. Although it is rated PG-13, I think it would be okay for a 10 year old to see. It is a little bit gross with some lightsaber action."
3274,5,Exactly what we expected,"George Lucas' third prequel to the Saga of Star Wars proved to be no different than the preceding prequels, Episodes 1 and 2. The script was poorly written and the acting (aside from Ewan McGregor) begged for help. You can only compare soap opera star Hayden Chritiansen's mumblings to Chris O'Donnel and maybe Keifer Sutherland. The quintessential Jedi Knight is still viewed by most people as Alec Guiness, with his British accent and his distinguished parables. So why did Lucas decide that it's okay for Christiansen to blend words together and say ""gotta, kinda, hafta,"" and my favorite, ""a whole nother?"" Since when was ""nother"" a word? Granted, Aniken Skywalker is supposed to be an angry teenager in episode 2, but one would hope he'd have come of age grammatically by episode 3. Unfortunately, the internal conflict that everyone knows is supposed to tear him to the dark side in more or less ridiculous and his love for Padme is nothing more than a word in the script; Nor does Nathalie Portman contribute much believability to the relationship that is supposed to be the epitome of love in the early galaxy."
3275,10,WOW! the best film in the WORLD!,this film is the greatest film i have ever seen. I've seen all the films millions of times. the original films were much better than the newer one star wars episode one and two. even that i was not even born when the original films came out and my mums was'not even born but i loved them. i was over exctited to see the new one in 1999 and i was good but different than the old ones and the second one 2002 i didn't like it very much it was good but not as good as the others. when i heard that this star wars movie is fantastic i said lets go and WOW star wars episode 3 revenge of the sith kick my other favourite film lord of the rings return of the king in the butt. Yes there's a couple of useless dialogue but apart from that the effects have come a lot since a 'new hope' and the action scenes where Brilliant and George Lucas has brought star wars as better than before you will not be disappointed by this action pack masterpiece of a movie.
3276,5,So near...and yet so far,"A dangerous amount of ink has been spilled over Lucas' final installment in the great space-opera saga, and across the world bashers have argued fan-boys in a universal struggle that fittingly mirrors the galactic struggle of the jedi and sith. But for all this, ROTS remains a quite average film, failing to capture the magic of '77 but wandering slowly in the right direction. By all accounts, the dialogue and acting is very sub-par. Anakin and Padme's supposedly passionate exchanges provide more mirth than many of this year's top comedies, with chestnuts like Padme's fevered exclamation ""Hold me like you did by the lake at naboo!"" The poor acting that has plagued the prequels is again on show, with Christensen doing little more than looking melancholy and yellow-eyed (He's got a scar on his cheek and he's wearing black! You don't reckon he's turning to the dark-side?!) Even supposedly talented actors like Mcgregor, Portman and Sammy LJ come across as bland. As in TPM and AOTC, the cast treat Lucas' inane script like Shakespeare, destroying the sense of fun of the originals (this could probably be something to do with the omnipresence of the jedi in the prequels. However cool lightsabers are, it must be hard to write entertaining lines when your main characters are austere warrior-monks) It is indeed a case of ""You can write this s*** George, but you can't say it"" However, did anyone expect anything different? The film is good in comparison to many of its contemporaries, tripe like Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"", but it cannot live up to the expectations of millions of Star Wars fans whose hopes were realistically destroyed with the first appearance of a certain Gungan exile. Revenge is in my opinion easily the best of the prequels, with old Mr. Plot poking his head back around the door towards the end. But it is bloated with needless CGI, seemingly video-game style sequences (Anakin even tells R2 at one point to shoot a droid in the eye, which all gamers will recognize as a baddie's hidden weakness) While the lightsaber fights are spectacular, they are seemingly two a penny. It seems one cannot drop a fork on Coruscant without the familiar laser-swords being drawn. Revenge of the Sith is, i believe, a symptom of the modern blockbuster disease, upstaging its cast with bangs and shiny things and putting pre-school rubbish in their distinguished mouths. Yet I cannot feel that Lucas must carry the blame for what he has turned his creation into, with the joy, love and danger that went into A New Hope replaced by lots of money and legions of CG artists."
3277,5,What a waste of time,"We knew where we came from (Episode II). We knew where we was going to (Episode IV). Lucas just needed nothing except writing a nice movie!! And he fails completely. We can't understand how Anakin moves from a hip-hop Jedi to a Dark Master of the Force. Yeah he loves her wife (by the way, he really does it?) The love story is not fully explained. The travel to the dark side is not fully explained (How can he kill children as a regular mission for his master when a few minutes ago he was hesitating about everything?). Obi Wan jumps the hyperspace a dozen times for achieving NOTHING. The storm-troops are top-sadists. There's a sight of real cinema when we see Anakin's frightened , the black mask approaching his body, facing his personal jail. But Hayden Christensen is not David Prowse and the magic disappears immediately when he stands on his mechanic feet... just like anyone else in a cheap disguise. The best of all? Jar-Jar Binks appears a few seconds. 5 of 10? Yes, because there's the greater technical talent on the movie, but the worst respect for a nice story in the script."
3278,8,Episodes III and V were the only good ones,Does anyone else out there think that episode iii (revenge of the sith) and episode v (empire strikes back) were the only good ones in the whole star wars saga??? 
3279,6,Is SITH an anagram on purpose?,"This film was almost entirely devoid of any emotion, passion, or vehemence. I believe the dialogue between Anakin and Padme went something like: ANAKIN: ""You're so beautiful."" PADME: ""Only because I'm so in love with you."" ANAKIN: ""No, it's because I'm SO in love with YOU."" ????????????????? :( This is the kind of sheer genius writing and acting that had better get Hayden Christiansen an Academy Award!!! The plot cheeses up in every direction in order to make the sextet of movies fit perfectly into a nice little package.The visual effects are captivating, and the CGI is much better integrated into this movie than in the previous Episode II (I still believe muppet Yoda is inimitable). The movie overall is entertaining and is probably worth the ten bucks to get the movie theatre experience. At least now all superfans can merrily rest in peace knowing that the originally mesmerizing Darth Vader used to be a whiny melodramatic brat."
3280,10,It was amazing!!!,"This film is by far the best in the saga! I love it so much. The whole film from the title to the credits is superb. The soundtrack is amazing as well. The acting is much better than episodes I and II as the characters seem grown up and if anyone has already seen it, wasn't the dialogue between Obi wan and Anakin powerful and believable on the landing platform just before the duel! Thats another thing. The Duel. It is so fluent and for the most part believable as it is acted at the speed its shown. The space battle at the beginning rocked and was something no one has yet seen in a Star Wars movie. Capital ships against each other rather than small dogfights witnessed in the other films. Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christienson seem to gel better as actors as do their characters in the film, well until the end. You haven't lived until you have seen this film!"
3281,7,A True Aristotelian Tragedy. Superbly acted by Christiansen.,"Though certainly not on the same level as the original films, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith a great film. The film was packed with all of the things that make watching movies so fun- action, emotion, humor-its a blast. The film was engaging and thought provoking. The film is an Aristotelian Tragedy because it depicts the downfall of a basically good person through some fatal error or misjudgment, producing suffering and insight on the part of the protagonist and arrousing pity and fear on the part of the audience."
3282,,Powerful story if not the acting,"I have been a star wars fan for a long time now, I was there with everybody else waiting in line to watch TPM and AOTC and was disappointed with both. Although I didn't voice my opinion to much knowing that George Lucas still had to deliver his most prized installment, that being the birth of a certain dark lord. This was always going to be the film the rest of the new batch of films would be judged on. I thought at first it was guna be lie the other two ( no heart ) but good reviews and word of mouth changed that."
3283,10,Awesome Movie!,"Oh My Goodness, I loved this movie! I grew up on the old trilogy and hating Darth Vader. This movie completely changed my outlook on everything. The special effects were awesome. I usually lose interest during the light-saber battles, but not this time. This is all Anakin's story. Seeing his torment on screen and watching him make choices that would forever seal his fate was amazing. Hayden C. really drew me in this time (unlike with ATOC). All the questions I had from the Old Trilogy were answered. And, I can never hate Darth Vader again. For every time I see him in that black suit, I'll always know that Anakin is inside. This movie has turned me into a complete freak about Star Wars. It does not disappoint."
3284,4,This Could Have Been Great....,I can only imagine what it must have felt like to have waited years for this to be released and then to have your hopes dashed to the rocks below upon viewing this super-slick and over hyped grade-C production.
3285,3,"Better than the other two, but not good.","There are some good fight scenes, but in my opinion it was too weak as a movie to stand up. There were some glaring mistakes throughout, and the fight scenes, though good, were spoiled by the fact that you knew the outcome beforehand. To be honest, I nearly fell asleep during the swathes of political nonsense that runs throughout this film."
3286,8,why? you were the chosen-one,"I'm seeing these series in these days and i realize why people don't like the last three films. I agree this view. Because they are really insufficient in comparison with the original series. For example, they have less battle scene except the last one. Especially the second film ( Attack of the Clones) is very bad, because it dwells on Anakin and Padme's love and i think it is boring. But the last film ( Revenge of the Sith) is as good as the original series. Disappointingly we see transformation of Anakin to Darth Vader. We know the end of the story, but we don't wanna believe that Anakin ,who the little cute boy in the Phantom Menace, is Darth Vader. When i was watching these films , i always saying like this : why Anakin? Why? You were the chosen-one. Obi- Wan and Qui- Gon were trusted you. In my sight,if any film can be felt like this, it is good. Finally, if you love the original series, you must watch these films. Because they complete everything. After you watch these films, you want to watch original series again and again."
3287,10,"Episode III, thank you, George Lucas","Finally after all these years, almost all the questions had their answer. Excellent, shocking, brilliant. From the beginning to the end there is not even one single second that is not properly used, and enjoyed. Ewan Mc. Gregor has show a brilliant performance, visuals are perfect, sound and music too, but the story and how the energy and feelings of every spectator flows during the whole movie, is the very key to success. From every single word to the last detail, an absolute piece of art. I use to remember the statement that says ""God is in every single detail"", well, here is an example for that. Thank you very much, Mr. George Lucas, it seems that, in the end: ""the circle is complete"", and I am happy now. Best Regards, Gonzalo Savogin"
3288,7,Calling Dr. Spock,"I'm a heterosexual American male born in 1971 so I'm part of a group of people that has a difficult time knowing where the ""real"" world stops and Star Wars begins  but damn. I guess it's my fault for thinking about the story and not just enjoying the movie. But it frustrates me that the catalyst for the fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of Darth Vader is the lack of a good ob-gyn and some decent prenatal care. I know a C-section scar may have marred Padme's lovely, lovely abdomen, but a killing spree isn't an appropriate response for a concerned husband and expecting father. What would have happened if she had trouble losing the baby weight? Darth Vader was a tragic hero on par with Othello, and with this movie George Lucas reduced him to O.J. Simpson."
3289,7,"The best of the prequels, but still incomplete & lacking in parts","In Episode III, George Lucas obviously has changed his game plan, and improved enormously from the wreck that Episode's I & II were. He still fails to recapture what he had 25 years ago, but this is definitely not a complete failure. It succeeds in filling most gaps, and finally adding some emotion and character development, and definitely is entertaining. Where Lucas fails, unfortunately is in some of the most important parts, which definitely effects the film as a whole, which is disappointing. ***SPOILERS*** ************** The biggest problem occurs halfway through the film, where Anakin fatefully turns to the dark side. Until this point, the film was doing very well portraying in a somewhat realistic way, exactly how Anakin started to fall. But then it drops. In one sequence with very little dialogue, Anakin betrays everything he has been trained to believe, commits himself to the emperor, and becomes Darth Vader. This was a surprise, since in the scene preceding it, he is sick to almost the point of vomiting, once finding out the emperor is evil, and tells Mace Windu this, so that the emperor can be brought down. This is the largest failing point. The ending was also equally unsatisfying, surprisingly when the suit is put on, and Darth Vader says only 2 words which the Darth Vader we know would actually say. After they are spoken unfortunately, he continues talking like the whiny Anakin from Episode II, which left me upset. So those are the two largest pitfalls the movie suffers. ***END OF SPOILERS*** ********************* In whole, the film is a success, and definitely the best of the new trilogy, but it still definitely does not measure to the originals, but is still as I said a success, and worth your time."
3290,10,Closure to the Saga,"First of all, anyone looking for Academy-material acting or writing in a ""Star Wars"" flick will be disappointed. The love scenes are a step above the disastrous, groan-inducing lines from ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002), but still lack chemistry. But no one expected better from an action saga. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is possibly the most emotional of all six films. We all know that Anakin (Hayden Christensen) turns to the Sith and betrays the Jedi. We all know that Obi-Wan and Yoda survive the birth of the Galactic Empire, that Palpatine becomes emperor, and that Padme dies, but gives birth to twins. We don't know how or why these happen. The film opens right with Obi-Wan and Anakin plunging into an epic space battle at the heart of the Republic. From there, the film grabs you and doesn't relent until the Jedi heroes crash-land on Coruscant. The film hardly slows down, however, before you know it, the identity of the Sith Lord behind the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious, is revealed. Obi-Wan and Yoda are elsewhere leading clone troopers against the Separatists. Several Jedi attempt to thwart the Sith, but fail, largely due to Anakin. Anakin falls to the Dark Side and never recovers. ""Order 66"" is executed by the clone troopers and Anakin, now Darth Vader, in one of the saddest moments in the saga. The movie cuts to all across the galaxy, to see clones (who look more and more like stormtroopers) turn on their Jedi leaders in the midst of battles. The film only gets sadder from here. Vader murders a room of Jedi children, Obi-Wan watches a newly quadriplegic Anakin burn in lava (declaring that Anakin was his brother, that he loved him, to which Anakin responds ""I hate you!""), Palpatine gives Yoda the electroshock treatment, and Vader turns on his pregnant wife. All in all, a very good movie, poignant, depressing, and triumphant all at once."
3291,10,Revenge of the Sith is that damn good,"Episode III is so good that this one may possibly be my new favorite star wars film. return of the jedi holds that mantle at the present moment. this one moves at such a fast pace you can barely catch your breath. we see the demise of count dooku, jump to anakin's corruption, the trooper betrayal, the battle on kashyyyk, and everything else that leads to the final battle. the movie is 2 hrs and 26 minutes long, but it felt like a 90 minute movie because of its frantic pace. of course that's a good thing. and the tie-in to episodes iv-vi are amazing, if menace and clones disappointed you, this one sure as hell won't. in all, it is definitely in the top 3 best of the star wars saga."
3292,10,Great Movie,"I do not understand the amount of animosity directed at this film. I agree with many, that episodes 1 and 2 were a letdown, but Lucas has come back in fine form this time around. In my opinion, this is the best one since The Empire Strikes Back (though Jedi comes pretty close). My only gripe is some wooden dialog here and there, and overuse of effects loaded action sequences. Ian Mcdiarmid churns in an all star performance as the conniving Chancellor Palpatine. Hayden Christiansen, though not perfect, was excellent as Anakin Skywalker, and has improved as an actor since Episode 2. Samuel L Jackson , on the other hand, plays Mace Windu as if he were reading q-cards. After viewing the DVD, I highly recommend Lucas reinsert a deleted scene involving Amidala confronting Palpatine about ending the war. Not only does it portray tension between the Chancellor and Portman's character, but also builds up a mistrust of Anakin towards Padme. The force is strong with Episode 3. Too bad it the magic wasn't there with Episodes 1 and 2."
3293,9,"unbelievable.unreal, best prequel EVER!!","this movie rocks!!! i know there are many of you saying its never going to be as good as the original 4th,5th and 6th episodes.your argument is flawed for a few reasons: 1) its not in competition with the old ones, it works in harmony with them"
3294,5,I wanted to love this but I was disappointed,"Before seeing this I was really excited. I saw 2 of the originals in the cinema as a child, Return of the Jedi as a treat for my first communion. ALONG time ago. And I LOVED them!! So onto ROTS, Why didn't I like it?"
3295,9,"Every film has annoyances, but as a whole it was fantastic!","Before I talk about ""Revenge of the Sith"", let me just summarise the previous films. Lets face it TPM and AoTC were not the best films I've ever seen but still they gave me moments and glimpses of what cinema is all about. How many other films would you see people taking pictures of the initial screen when the movies starts? Then you hear that sound...oh that sound..you remember when you watched the first Star Wars a New Hope - that music gets to you. How many films do you hear the audience (adults we are talking about) scream and yell ""Aaaaaaaaah !"" when Yada's shadow appears before meeting Dooku. Then you hear Doodu say ""Master Yoda.."" and Yada replies, ""Count Dooku"" - (People are still yelling at that point). And then you realise that Yoda is going to fight...with a lightsaber. ""Noooo - Yeessssssss"" I thought I was going to wet myself. What about the Pod race, and the fight between the Jedi's and Darth Maul. Brilliant! "
3296,7,will it go on ?,"i saw the episode 3 last week .i was quite exciting in the cinema . though in my opinion it is 7 only ,i still expect the next one .it is full of fantasy,imagination and attractive characters.i like it."
3297,,The force is not strong with this film!,"Sorry to all those who loved it, but i have to say that it was by far the worst of the 3. More cheese than a stilton factory, appalling acting, terrible screw up with time lines and too much reliance on CGI. I actually found myself dozing off during the first 1/3rd of the film, and then wondering what time Batman started and whether it was worth leaving now and going to that. I think the only real saving grace to the film was the big lightsabre battle between Darth Vader and Obi Wan, ending in the creation of the Vader we all know which was pretty cool. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't that bad a film really, but so not up to my expectations which made it seem worse than it was."
3298,5,"Darth Vader is here, finally.","Overall, the movie was boring. The special effects are amazing, the scenes of planets and war are pretty; but the story, the dialog, the light-saber battles, and even the acting were flat. The ending is made intense by the grotesqueness of the final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin. And, of course, the ""birth"" of the suited Darth Vader is something that will make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. Those few minutes make Episode III somewhat satisfying. Other than that, the movie could stand to be much shorter. It relies too heavily on CGI and beautifully rendered land and cityscapes. The story is not in any way complex and most charactersbesides those already established in the original trilogyare not very developed. The dialog is far from exciting, everyone seems to resort to ""one-liners."" The final conclusion is, this last installment fits perfectly with Episodes I and II, but it is very far away from the brilliance of the original trilogy."
3299,10,A must-see movie for anyone who loves a good movie.,"The cinematography in this movie is simply breathtaking. I felt that I was visiting diverse planets in a galaxy far, far away. George Lucas is the master of creating richly appointed sets. The space battles were huge and you would have to step through frame by frame to fully take all the action in. I have already seen the movie twice and will be seeing it again tomorrow. This is definitely the movie of the year and there is nothing else out there that can hope to come close to the power and beauty of this movie. George Lucas has again raised the bar by which all movies will be judged. The full star wars saga comes to an end finally after 28 years. I have been raised in the star wars universe. I enjoyed it as a child and now I am enjoying them with my children. Sometimes you have to recapture your childhood to fully enjoy the movies, but this final movie should be enjoyed by any adult."
3300,10,Spoilers thar be...great film,Saw it; loved it.
3301,8,Better than the previous 2 but still a little weak from the first two in OT,"Possible SPOILERS CONTAINED!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good movie, better than the mediocre Phantom Menace and the Over top Attack of the Clones. This movie had more substance. They were no needless side plots and the chemistry between Portman and Christiansen (though still not exactly magnetic) was better than the previous joke of a romance on Attack of the Clones. Ewen McGregor is an extremely talented actor and he is Obi wan. He is what makes this movie what is."
3302,5,Not that great.,"This film wasn't as great as I espected. First of all, we all knew what was going to happen and Lucas just made it has we espected, a trilogy where Anakin becomes Jedi, falls in love with Princess Amigdala, is turned into the dark side and has twins. Com'on Lucas haven't you got anything else to offer? With all that money couldn't you hire a decent script-writer? I mean, each episode had to be a story in itself and seriously this episode had less plot than ever. What makes it interesting is the last 30/40 minutes when it starts linking to A New Hope, the rest is pure trash. The battle over Coruscant in the first minutes was uninteresting at all, the dialogues between Padme and Anakin where absolutely boring and the conversation of Anakin was just so stupid. Hey, what do we do with Count Dooku? Just kill him in the first scene. 'Woo Anakin, do you love me? Yes but I have to save you from dying so I think I will turn to the dark side'. But never mind, hey don't worry if you didn't like the plot, here is ILM to save the day, just look how good the digital effects are and enjoy."
3303,9,the grand finale for the greatest saga of all times...,"When we were growing up, we were astonished by the achievements of young Luke Skywalker fighting against the evil Darth Vader, his nemesis, his total antagonist, but above all things his father. Luke Skywalker accomplished what his father could never do, where Anakin failed, Luke aroused as a true Jedi Knight, an in the end we could see how Anakin took along with Darth Vader and the Emperor the dark side of the force and vanished it for good. In the end he really brought balance to the force. In the revenge of the sith we look back at young Anakin Skywalker going trough the same tests his son had to, yet within a world full of life and corruption his heart made the worst of the choices losing everything he had been fighting for in the process, losing his friends, his wife and his own soul. Our antihero gave his own soul to evil to become the most powerful warrior, yet the dark side of the force could never give him what he wanted. It would be his own son who doing everything he couldn't do that finally let him understand the true meaning of the word Jedi."
3304,9,Watching with my 9 year old son was way better than the first time,I know all the reviews say that the prequels aren't as good as the original first three and I agree. But they are still darn good! Massive thumbs up to GL for bringing it all together. Love the development of the Sith story and the continued exploration of the Force. Yoda's counseling session with Anakin and the sad turning to the Dark side of our hero. Holding on is being greedy and letting go of what you love is the only way to stay true to the Jedi path. Real life gems. 
3305,7,"Best of a bad bunch, very enjoyable!! *Spoilers*",I think we can all agree that the first two prequels are very disappointing and are worse than average but for me this film makes up for them. A very good Star Wars film by Lucas and the best part is that we get to see Anakin Skywalker turn to Darth Vader. Also the acting is much better than episode 2 but it does seem to suffer with the same problems when it comes to dialogue and the writing was still stale and the comedy between Obi wan and Anakin rarely works but the story is a lot more interesting and Ian Mcdiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine makes this movie even better. Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker is better in this movie than the last especially when he turns to the dark side but he still doesn't do a brilliant job. At the end of the day Revenge Of the sith is a good Star Wars movie and far better than the first two and it is very enjoyable.
3306,4,Beware the Dark Side,"The Dark Side of the force has finally consumed George Lucas as he presents the crucial bridge to Episodes II and IV. Critics are raving about the movie but excuse me if I seem a bit indifferent to them. To sum it up, Episode III over-promises and under-delivers."
3307,9,Star Wars vs Star Trek,"As you may know, the Episode VII of Star Wars, ""The Force Awakens"" is going to be released at the end of this year. For that reason, I decided to watch all the films again. Moreover, I watched other films with similar plot. That's the reason why, today, I'm able to compare,in my opinion, two of the greatest science fiction films about the future of humans in the universe. These two films are: Star Wars""Revenge of the Sith"" and Star Trek ""Generations"". The universe has always been a mystery to humans. Nearly everyone has wondered how life could be in space. However, only some gifted directors such as David Carson and George Lucas have been able to explain how the future in space will be with these brilliant films. Both films have many similarities. First of all, the setting in both films is the space and they include memorable shots on invented cities in new planets and inside space ships. The films are action- packed. You must not miss a minute. They are absolutely exhilarating and the powerful special effects make scenes visually convincing. Although both films were blockbusters, Star Wars ""Revenge of the Sith"" has remarkably higher visual quality. That could be because Star Trek ""Generations"" was released years before. Star Trek is disappointing in terms of photography. The images sometimes lack definition. Moreover, make up and costume is better in the Star Wars film. The Star Trek crew only wear a simple red, blue or green suit. In Star Wars, costumes are more complex. A great example are the soldiers costumes or even Dark Vader's helmet. Furthermore, the soundtrack by John Williams in Star Wars was award- winning. In addition, Star Wars includes more moving scenes. I remember one which involves the main character that was particularly touching. However, in my opinion the acting is better in Star Trek, which includes many stunning actors such as Patrick Stewart. To sum up, both films are worth-seeing and if you like science fiction and fight scenes I would recommend both films. Nevertheless, Star Wars is definitely more gripping and the special effects make it even more convincing."
3308,10,As good as Empire Strikes Back!,"I just saw Episode III and had to write a few words about it. I want to begin by saying that I hated Episode I and had given up hope after the slightly better but still mediocre Episode II. Now after seeing Episode III I am so excited that I am having trouble sleeping! I would even go so far as to say that it is as good as ""Empire Strikes Back""."
3309,10,A triumph,"There seems to be a culture of venom towards the ""prequels"" (which indeed we should stop referring to these movies as prequels as the six-movie sequence is complete - how about simply ""star wars""?) - I hated Jar Jar Binks in the first movie, along with most other cinema-goers. Revenge of the Sith is a culmination of ALL the Star Wars films, rather than a mere bridge between AOTC and ANH. I was pleasantly surprised by the ease in which the movies are joined; the rebel ship from the beginning of ANH is used in several scenes at the end of ROTS; the birth of Luke and Leia; even the necessary, and rather graphic construction of Darth Vader in his familiar black costume."
3310,8,The only worthy addition to the Star Wars prequels,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is the climax of the six Star Wars films and storywise it wraps them up very nicely. The story in this movie and the storyline for all of the Star Wars movies is absolutely awesome! The descent of Anakin to Darth Vader is the culmination of 30 years of pop culture and Lucas gives us a good plot. On a side note, the dialogue in this movie can get utterly ridiculous especially with the love story between Anakin and Padme. George Lucas is horrible at writing dialogue for his actors but he has created one of the best stories ever with these movies and seeing it all get wrapped up is very satisfying. This is a must for any Star Wars fan! If you have never seen the original trilogy before Lucas had access to CGI then watch those first three movies to get an idea for the background and risks that went into making this space opera into a reality and I think you will enjoy the culmination of all six movies!"
3311,9,A Great Way To Round Off A Great Saga,"Though Revenge of the Sith is a great movie, I don't agree with those who say that it is loads better than the first two films. TPM and AOTC were good films, though admittedly boring at times and ROTS follows in exactly the same steps. Pretty slow opening 30 mins but after that, it's rip-roaring action. The montage of Jedi's being murdered is not only spectacular but saddening. The scene before Anakin and Obi Wan fight is heart-breaking too and this great film is rounded off by Obi Wan's ""You were the Chosen One..."" speech. A piece of genius by Lucas. Overall, a great film that despite first 30 mins, makes you want to watch again and again. Oh and one more thing, NATALIE PORTMAN IS HOT!!!"
3312,9,A must watch!,"It's a great movie second best to empire strikes back I feel like a lot of people rate it bad because they have not seen the rest of the series and they don't understand what's going on or who's the weird mask guy, And why is this relevant but weather your comparing it to the other movies or rating it on its own it's a great movie. And it's also great to see how anikan the great jedi turns evil but I also find it weird he murders the kids, when after this takes place they concentrate all they can to find kid jedis to turn then evil. But it is a must watch movie along with all the other star wars movies."
3313,,What has happened to the magic of Mr. Lucas?,"Dear George Lucas, What exactly have you been doing since 1983? Surely between then and now you could have hired a decent scriptwriter. Just what is it about your presence that reduces such a fine crop of actors to mostly rather bad actors? And what exactly possessed you to think that Hayden Christiansen could actually act? And that he could actually seem more romantic than a peanut? Yes, you can make pretty CGI star ships and yes, Yoda looks real, but pretty battles and real-looking aliens do not an 8 movie make. The first hour of this film was inexcusable and painful to watch. The dialog sputtered and stilted like a bad high school play, a fact which could not be ignored despite the profusion of testosterone-driven explosions. The last hour was tolerable and made me feel some empathy for the fate of the characters, I give you that, but it was no where near the caliber of what you are capable of. Mr. Lucas, I hereby proclaim that, for the above crimes, you shall be forced to leave your Ranch and return to live in Modesto until the end of your days!"
3314,7,"It's a solid film, but definitely overrated in my eyes","This film's alright. It suffers from many of the same flaws as the rest of the prequels, but its definitely alright."
3315,10,"From Action to Acting, This Movie Deserves the Ten I'm Giving It","Amazing. This Star Wars Episode III is the best of the prequels and does great credit to the Star Wars saga. The plot is well written and performed. Hayden Christensen is convincing as a torn Anakin Skywalker and Natalie Portman works alongside him well as Padme. The best performance is given, however, by none other than Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. He just transforms himself so well as the movie progresses. The only flaw I find in the movie is that very little is tangible. Everything is computer effect. Its frustrating to see when comparing the new Star Wars additions to the original trilogy. But nonetheless, this movie stays true to the original storyline and has some excellent action sequences that really support my decision to give this movie a ten."
3316,10,Great story!!!,I was really impressed with the storytelling in this episode. The acting was much better as you actually felt so much more for the characters than the previous two.
3317,9,Best of the prequels by far!,"For me, this was a very good star wars movie. A lot of Jedi vs sith fights. The choreographies were amazing!! And we always talk about the bad acting of hayden christensen but am i the only one who loved his performance? Lucas chose the perfect guy for anakin's role. And at the end, the battle with obi wan... It's amazing! Great actors, great battles, great story. And the end is fantastic. After "" a new hope"" this is my best star wars! Its not the opinion of all the people but i really loved this movie. It was much better than the other two of the prequels. If you didn't see it, you should watch it now! The final battle is just so amazing, and ewan mcgregor is just perfect in his obi wan role!"
3318,9,"i think it's great,but...","I LOVE Starwars, and i was waiting just like millions i think for this finale, and i loved it and saw it twice in Theatres.but what is wrong with Dialogue?,George Lucas written episode V i presume, and it was great !!, the dialog's could've been much better if Reviewd."
3319,10,"George, 10 thumbs up!",19th May 2005
3320,8,powerful you have become master Lucas,"STORY *no spoilers* It was directed by Lucas and story writer is also Lucas (and what did you think?). He had very hard job with this episode. Most of people agree that first episode was good (or bad) but they all agree that it didn't reveal much of the story. Second one reveled more, but the hardest task remained for episode 3. He needed to show us how and why did Anakin turn to the dark side. He done very good job (and thankfully to McDiarmid's acting who even turned me to the dark side). He put all the peaces together and you will never fell that he put something cause he had to just to match with old trilogy (even better, he explain some things that he didn't have to). It's also one of the most fast-paced episodes. I would recommend the movie for 13+. You all know what can light-saber so to the man. One of my favorite comebacks (someone who isn't a fan of Lucas's movies may not notice that) is that Lucas sense for humor is back and it's the best (good all Indiana Jones sense for humor). "
3321,5,Poor acting,"Overall this film feels like poor theater with cool effects. I don't get the feeling that the actors believe what they are doing. I found that Yoda was the best actor, the only problem is that he isn't really an actor, he's computer animated! That tells some about how far computer animation has come, but sadly also that the real actors weren't good. Only Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine can walk away without shame. "
3322,10,The circle completes with a PERFECT movie.,The circle is complete! 
3323,10,One word: Phenomenal,"George Lucas has made a brilliant masterpiece with this movie. Not only does it live up to the standards of the original trilogy, but it surpasses them. Episode III is without a doubt the best Star Wars movie in the entire saga."
3324,3,"Pardon the rant, but...","...to say that Sith is the best of the Star Wars prequels is as easy as saying that the Godfather part III was the worst of the Godfather series. This does not mean that Sith was a good movie, and as a movie fan I am disgusted to see this movie ranked (at the time of this writing) between the timeless classics: Witness for the Prosecution and His Girl Friday. I've had qualms about rankings on IMDb before, but this made me laugh out loud. Has the whole world gone crazy? Granted, Sith is a huge box office success, but it is a poorly made movie. There, I said it. Lucas has tarnished his own name with these pieces of trash he calls movies. Can someone say hire a writer? The script was not just every day bad; it was Sci-Fi Channel original movie bad. Episodes IV-VI were classics because they were fresh, new, fun, and inventive. They had a certain levity about them that let you forget that they were not the greatest things ever captured on film. The same cannot be said about the new films. Lucas took a fun plot and made it too serious. It was the light fun feel that let you get over Mark Hamill's acting shortcomings. Hayden Christensen is a bad actor made worse by a terrible script. You can't have a Hamlet seriousness and deliver Scooby Doo lines. No offense to Scoopy Doo. I was ashamed to be a Star Wars fan every time Christensen opened his mouth and delivered an absolutely horribly written line. This movie truly lacked everything that is required of a movie deserving a spot on a best of list. That this movie falls anywhere on this list simply proves that there is no accounting for the public's taste."
3325,10,Brilliant movie!!,"Episode 3 was such an excellent movie.. personally i liked it way more than the classic trilogy.. Though i love the classic trilogy, the classic trilogy was too slow-paced - just like the lord of the rings - to beat this final instillment of StarWars."
3326,1,Do not take your children to see this!!!!,"Shame on George Lucus for taking a brilliant saga, and spoiling it for the family. I am deeply saddened, and troubled by the carelessness and irresponsibility of filmmakers in this day and age. I revered your work, Mr. Lucas, and I am appalled to see you of all people turn to the dark side."
3327,9,And so it ends...,"I just got back from seeing Episode III and I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. To be honest, I hated Episodes I and II. Not that I am one of those fortunate enough to have seen the originals in theater. My first experience with Star Wars was when I was 5 or 6 and they released the special edition Trilogy. But, I was immediately captivated nevertheless. Harrison Ford instantly became my favorite actor and has been ever since. They were just so huge in scope. The subtle humor was just so well done, and the characters were just so human. A true epic."
3328,9,The Force is quite strong with this one,"To watch this flick, gave me chills at times. Chills of overwhelming joy that is. Not just for fan-boys and fan-girls, (although that is the point isn't it) episode 3 successfully ties in all six episodes into a solid, and cohesive story, paralleled only by the LOTR trilogy by Peter Jackson. The only flaw I noticed in regards to this...here's a spoiler, was Anakin's Frankensteinesque entry into the world as Darth Vader. Other than that I have nothing but positive remarks. Mace shows his true potential, in a battle with Palapatine, and Anakin comes off as a truly great Jedi who becomes a truly ""great"" sith. For fans of the franchise, seeing it more than once becomes a kind of necessity in order to take in the breadth and scope of what could be the best installment, in line with Empire Strikes Back...that however is merely a personal opinion. See this movie if you are a fan of Star Wars in general, see this movie if you've never seen a Star Wars movie."
3329,9,The Best Out of All of the Star Wars Movies (even though A New Hope was the classic)!,"I went to see the movie the Saturday after the release, I had never been so excited about a movie in my life, except maybe one of the Harry Potter movies, or maybe the 1st prequel to the Star Wars trilogy. "
3330,10,Best Star Wars Flick Ever,"Is this the end of the Universe? The Star Wars saga is coming to an end. And talk about ending with a bang. This movie had everything and more that the Star Wars franchise needed. Saber fights, space battles, an evil Jedi slaying sextroped android, the abcents of that son of a bitch jar jar, you name it. This is what episode 1 and 2 should have been like. Plus, it had an awesome ending. Two men, formally the best of friends, end up being worst enemies. And on a sad note, will this be the end of Star Wars as we know it? No more pointless merchandise to buy,no more long lines of people in front of the movie theater dressed as sand people and stormtroopers. But, now Star Wars shall end in greatness here, just as it did a long time ago in a galaxy far far away."
3331,8,I recommend the third installment of the trilogy to all fans.,"I was most pleased with the outcome of Revenge of the Sith. The result had already been established with the first trilogy, (4,5 &6) but it was most interesting on just what would propel Anakin to the dark side of the force. I was very disappointed in Attack of the Clones. It lacked the emotional attachment that I was so looking forward to seeing. That attachment was for the most part, resumed for the last film. Many critics of the trilogy were appalled by the acting in all three films and in spots you could say that about all 6 films. The character of Anakin Skywalker is one of the best creations in film history. I was not at all disappointed in any aspect of his rise and fall. I received the best gift any film can give a audience member, a response of emotion of my own. Thank you George Lucas for giving me that feeling."
3332,10,Powerful Stuff,"We all expected it to be good, but how could the audience be prepared for awesome experience that was to come. Yes we expected light sabres, great special effects and possibly some fairly wooden acting. But what we got was a emotional roller-coaster which has never been present in any other Star Wars film. There were tears all the way from the point were the Jedi are cut down to the closing scene against the twin suns of Danuine."
3333,10,Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Overview,"The long awaited, Episode III has finally hit theaters, and those who call themselves Star Wars buffs, wont be disappointed. In all respects, its easily the best of the prequels, and I'd also put it behind The Empire Strikes back. The emotion, intensity of the movie were portrayed quite well, and the fight sequences were simply mind-boggling. By far the best choreographed action to date in any Star Wars films, and for good measure any movie in the past five years. The action, drama, and how Episode III ties in to the original films is done flawlessly."
3334,10,grand,"the people who whine about this are silly. the first three episodes had odd dialogue, 'stilted', or even silly. This is the first star wars movie in the same vein as a Greek tragedy...it brings anakin to the heights of success, and then destroys him in the depths of hell. It grand to watch...it has plot, character, and is in the tradition of all the star wars movies. People who dislike this one would have complained when a new hope first was shown. I think that some critics merely have nothing better to do than to whine about the movie. if they applied the same standards to the original trilogy as they do to the new one...they would find all the same complaints with the addition of poor special effects. Essentially, I enjoy movies...many people apparently enjoy complaining."
3335,9,Random Thoughts from a Self Proclaimed Star Wars Nerd,"The movie was amazing. Definitely more intense, decidedly darker and more gruesome. I would say this installment could easily be in the top two or three. It had wonderful FX, great use of characters- Jar Jar got two seconds of completely silent screen time, Chewbacca's charisma and wookie friends carried a scene, Yoda hasn't been this cool since Empire Strikes Back (all animated but wonderfully convincing and complex with several *great* moments), R2D2 was really cool too. Lucas didn't rely on their recognition value alone, but made good use of them in the plot development. Even C3P0 wasn't annoyingly over the top as he usually is."
3336,5,"Darker, better than Eps 1 and 2, but still poor","Left the cinema very let-down. Yes, it's better than Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, but not a patch on the original trilogy, and not a patch on the Lord Of The Rings trilogy in terms of characterisation and scripting. I fully accept that Star Wars movies have all had cheesy scripts, but the prequels have had awful scripts, and ROTS is no exception."
3337,10,The magic is back.,"After 2 mediocre outings Lucas comes back with a ridiculous tour de force that is on par with A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Yes my friends, this is even better than Return of the Jedi."
3338,3,George Lucas f***** it up (spoilers),this gets 4 stars only for the special effects. Acting is unbelievably bad and the script unbelievably idiotic. One can leave the first and the last 10 minutes of the movie but the rest needs to be redone.
3339,10,It Was the best Star Wars film!!!!!,"I think the film was Brilliant,The Special effects were overwhelming and i thought the acting was superior to the human race. The only bad thing about Star Wars was that, i was expecting to see Darth Vader a bit more instead of about two scenes. I really found the film excellent and if you ask me i think George Lucas done a brilliant job in making this his final film . I have gone to the cinema a few times to see Star Wars i just can't get bored of the film and hopefully you can't either and GO AND SEE THE FILM YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!! The fighting scenes were spectacular and i have never seen anything so good, The film was really good, I did not think anything was rubbish about it"
3340,10,So emtional,"Easily the greatest Star Wars film, All the events leading up to this movie has been an emotional rollercoaster. I still cry myself to sleep every night thinking about anakin's turn."
3341,10,it was so emotionally powering,"StarWars is so emotionally powering and it was just so intense and so strong!!!!! The fight scene for ani vs obi-wan was long but it was worth every minute of it. Also parts of the movie was very confusing but I got it cleared up. It wasn't as long as I thought it would be. The other ones were longer. I thought that it was really sad when mace windu died he was like a hero and he had to die like that. But there's many other things that was really good. I thought that Hayden was a very good sword fighter and so was ewan, but stayin to the point Hayden was a very very good actor. So thats all I have to say about Star Wars and if you haven't seen it then do it."
3342,6,"In order to spoil a plot, there would have to be one.",Let me say first that the special effects and computer graphics are without peer in this movie.
3343,8,Go see it!! Do it!! Do it now!!!,"Apart from the obligatory wooden acting.. Lucas has pulled it off. It is well worth the movie ticket and the queues. For sci-fi and general movie fans its an historic event. The way the old and the new are fused is fantastic.. allowing both for the imagination of the viewer to take hold of where and why things ended up happening the way they did. The ending is really broadly scoped, ideal for lots of post-movie discussion. The spfx were fantastic, and once again Lucas pays tribute to his roots. The characters hold their own considering their future is mapped out for them, and everyone should see this movie simply for Yoda. This movie is why we all intuitively love Yoda!! Three cheers for George, he delivered! May the force be with him!"
3344,10,One of the best movies I've ever seen,First of all: I really don't understand how somebody can give 1/10.
3345,5,Funniest movie you'll see in a long time,"I'll admit that I haven't enjoyed the last two atrocities George Lucas produced, and having seen Ewan MacGregor's reticence to give this movie his seal of approval I wasn't expecting much from this one."
3346,5,So much is lost in all the computer animation,"If the original Star Wars trilogy were a real documentary, the new, mostly animated Star Wars trilogy is only an overdone non-fiction reenactment."
3347,3,An Abomination,"This film, the one that could have fixed all of George Lucas' mistakes in Episodes 1 and 2, is far worse than either of those films. To call this finale a 'dissapointment' is a gross understatement. A tragedy of Shakespearen proportions has been turned to trash. Those of you fooling yourselves into thinking this film is a satisfying conclusion need to take a step back and look around: George Lucas has walked all over us, and he's taken what we love for granted. We all believed in this story, and we all deserved a lot better. Instead, we've been given a lot of blinking lights, stale acting, boring action, and a load of half-baked politicizing. The film's actors lack the chemistry of those who preceded them, and the heart. This film is a waste."
3348,4,Luke must have cried when he saw his parents being portrayed so badly!,"Are you people joking? I understand that the latest movies that come out are always ""great"" hits in the popular world, but has anyone that rated this movie as above a four ever taken a film class? I agree- the movie is entertaining. Hey- I love to watch the little love scene between Anny and Paddy in episode II evolve. It is sweet and nice. But there is more to a movie than its entertainment value. Intelligence!!!! The film was written poorly. I'm sorry, but it was. Episodes 4,5 & 6 were awesome and were THANKFULLY missing all the over spoken cliché's that plagues episodes two and three. Christianson has no chance at being a good actor in these movies and ends up looking as good as Reeves in the Matrix (Or Daniel Radcliff in his latest ""Potter"") Yes! I thought that was bad too."
3349,10,How a Star Wars Film is suppose to be,"This movie is great compared to the new ones after Disney took over. To this day I still get an eerie feeling in my stomach seeing Anakin transfer to Darth Vader through Palpatine. The dialogue isn't the best but that is the only problem with this movie, and I wouldn't even call that a problem watching these new movies. This film is the best one of all of them!"
3350,10,Tremendously satisfying conclusion to the Star Wars saga,"First off, let me state that this film is clearly the best of the new trilogy, and, at times, achieves a power and grandeur matching or even superseding the best moments of the original trilogy. The moments of greatness, especially late in the film, are what make this film truly shine, even above films that would otherwise be considered ""better"" films."
3351,10,The end is the beginning is the end...,"After two mediocre movies,Lucas took it personally and this time went deeper into characters and their emotional conflicts. There are some problems in slite details(Haiden plays better this time,but he could do better with the emotional conflict-transformation to Vader). The political climate, instability and social changes are now clear and visible, characters walk on a thin line and anyone can understand how a bright shining hope can be turned through positive feelings(love and care) to Darth Vader. The visual effects are the best by far(as expected), but this time they serve the script(the surprise). They help in the creation of the darkest atmosphere we've ever seen in a star wars film. The whole film is like a Greek tragedy:it has ""mercy""-watcher commit themselves with the hero, it has ""fear""-they feel sorry for what happens to anakin and transforms to Vader while Padme dies,and finally comes ""clearance"" with the birth of the twins and the new hope. To summarize: I never felt so black and heavy before as I did after watching this film... Nikos *The three details of ancient drama are:""eleos"",""phobos"",""katharsis"""
3352,10,this film is really good,"i think this is a really good ending to the saga, the fact that Padme died was not good though she is my favourite character but i suppose they had to kill her off as she isn't in the first 3 movies. they linked everything in really well with the sequels with Luke going to Tatooine Leia going to Alderaan, the Jedi going into hiding and the death star being created, it was very well thought out. I though the Mustafar duel was excellent it was brilliantly directed and the moves were brilliant. i thought they way he had turned to the dark side to save padme was sweet but wrong, because that is what made her die. It was really sad when Sidious broke the news to Vader and he screamed 'noooooooooooooooo' is was really sad and you could tell he was hurting he had lost him mum now his wife. overall i think this is a really good film, recommended to anyone."
3353,9,Prequels redeemed!,"In a very powerful and moving cinematic finale George Lucas closes his legendary Star Wars saga. Revenge of the Sith combines great acting, beautiful special effects, and an enthralling story to bridge the Lucas' two trilogies together. Revenge is a great improvement from the previous two films which were considered dry and dull by many fans."
3354,10,A Fans Perspective,"In the simplest terms, with the most convenient definitions; this is the best film I have ever seen. But let me tell you why. I require movies to generally entertain me, draw me in and shake me about a bit - it's meant to be a visceral experience when at it's best. Revenge Of The Sith is all this and more."
3355,9,Anakin completes his transaction to the dark side in a thrilling yet saddening end of the star wars saga.,"I think this was THE best SW movie made. I would have to credit it as a joint effort of cast and crew. Starting of with G.Lucas who did a splendid job directing. Burnt Anakin was an amazing scene fortified only by splendid make-up artistry. As to the choreographer, KUDOS to him, the Anakin-Obi Wan fight was amazing. John Williams outdid himself with the music. And the costume designs were comparable to Vera Wang, Christian Dior AND Versace (if they designed for aliens, that is)."
3356,4,"Technically and Visually Marvelous, Otherwise Terrible","I purchased this movie on DVD to avoid having to go to the theater to see it. I really enjoyed the first three Star Wars movies but the last two were a big disappointment. I had high hopes that this movie might redeem George Lucas from the doldrums of mediocrity. Sadly, it was not to be so."
3357,10,A miracle for the eyes,"I watched episode I and episode II and I didn't like them as much as I expected. Besides, I don't like how Hayden Christensen acts, but in this film, he surprised me! I appreciate his character (even though he had already been defined in the two previous films) and the way it is portrayed. <br /><br />The reason why I gave the film a 10 is because in never boring, I never watched what time it was and the battle scenes were perfect."
3358,8,The Prequel Savior,"Honestly, i'm not a fan of the Star Wars Saga, but episode VII and this one are the only ones I truly enjoyed. Watching this film after the tragedy of episode I and II made me feel a lot better, I see a way better character development (especially in Anakin) and a more concise narrative; so I give this film my approval."
3359,10,Love it!!,Iv'e never seen a star wars film apart from episode 1. This movie sums it all up. I'm now a huge star wars fan and Hayden's role in this film is brilliant. He carries Anakin's emotions into great detail and it shows on screen. Natalie Portman is excellent as Padme and this shows as well.You can see Anakin's struggle against fighting off the dark side and this is a credit to George Lucas. Any star wars fan has to see this movie and its just the best film I've seen all year even though i only went for free popcorn. Me and my brothers can't wait until its comes out an DVD and i think everyone should see this movie. If you don't like Star wars then at least give it a shot.I thought it was rubbish until i saw this movie now I'm hooked! 10/10 for me a real good ending for the series.
3360,3,Don't bother,"Yet another in a line of let down's. Maybe our expectations were too high from the masterpiece of the original trilogy. To give credit where it's due, the special effects were great. But as for a believable storyline. Anakin Skywalker, being trained by to of the greatest Jedi's in Obi Wan and Yoda, is so very easily led over to the dark side? He's had what, 7 or more years of training by the top masters, and it only takes a 5 minute conversation with the Senator to convince him to turn his back and go over the the dark side? Talk about a disappointment. And to make it even more unbelievable, Yoda, the arguably greatest of all Jedi's, can't sense a plot against the Jedi order that involves, oh, well, MILLIONS of weak minded stormtroopers? I'm embarrassed to say that I spent my money to watch this movie, but I did."
3361,10,The film that George Lucas had to me,"I cannot say another thing. I thought that the 99 Lucas would give a great film to us. It failed miserably. My hope returned to grow the 2002. It was not a setback, not even a bad film. But it was not what hoped. Now the 2005, the Revenge of the Sith, finally give back the universe to me Star Wars that I knew. A place where the adventure reigns, where the heroes are heroes because they are not soft indestructible, but who move the faith and the belief to them in which create correct. It is the film that Lucas had to me. I pardon its two previous errors to him. I make the peace with the bearded man and can say that the last part of Star Wars is a great film."
3362,10,"Very Good, With Some Flaws.","I really have to say that this movie was indeed what I expected it to be. After all, there wern't any surprises, we knew that Anakin ultimately turns to the dark side of the force, and that George Lucas would again, for the sixth time, make a mint off of his beloved Star Wars Franchise."
3363,8,Epidode 3 successfully completes the saga,"Finally! The caliber of Star Wars I remember as a kid is back. This time, though, the bad guys win. The story of Anakin's fall is much more compelling than his rise in the first two episodes. Although his romantic scenes with Portman are a bit weak, Christiansen does a believable job as the dark lord of the sith. Ewan McGregor stands out in this episode. He and Yoda(one of the best performances even though he's digital) make for interesting characters as they try, unsuccessfully, to stop the republic's transformation to an empire controlled by the sith. Palpatine's seduction of Anakin makes you want to scream at him not to listen even though you know the outcome in advance. The Vader/Kenobi battle on the lava planet is everything it was built up to be. Applying the Jedi code that Anakin could not achieve, Obi Wan walks away from his horribly injured former friend. As Yoda told Anakin earlier in the film, "" Learn to let go"". Vader's Frankenstein like emergence in his new form was a bit much but overall it was a great film experience. Everything falls into place to set up episode 4. kudos!"
3364,6,It's over at last,"There's no sadness, just relief, the cash cow is nearly dead. Don't let apologists give this movie a pass, it's rotten right down to the core. It's an over-marketed fast-food restaurant, even giving out cheap plastic toys."
3365,6,Lucas redeem thyself,"After waiting 20 years and seeing Phantom Menace I, I was so infuriated at the wooden acting, lame plot, stupid Midicholorian story (sorry kids, doing good and being just just won't cut it for the light side, you just have to have the right genetics), and the abhorrent character of Jar Jar Binks."
3366,8,"Revenge of the Sith, was sheer brilliance","In 1977, along came a film known as 'Star Wars'. It changed the face of Hollywood and how! The trilogy was brilliant, all 3 and it was a long wait of roughly 16 years before the prequel trilogy cam across the screens. in 1999, Episode 1 of Star Wars disappointed fans all over the world.Then came Episode 2, The reaction ? Even worse than the first episode. All the fans expected the same from the third and final film of the epic saga. Revenge of the Sith, we hoped would be an enthralling ending to the saga. But once the film started in the Cinema , everyone was hooked. The acting MUCH better than the first 2 episodes, So were the effects and the action. The transformation of characters was brilliant, and also story. After the film, we all felt that it was indeed a fitting end to the saga. I couldn't believe it was all over. The Star wars fever hitting the theaters just before it's release. Now it was gone. Revenge of the Sith - a Must see for all Star Wars as well as NON - Star wars fans. "
3367,9,The force is strong with this one,"After going to the midnight showing of ROTS I ended up being late for extremely late for work this morning and missed a lunch meeting with my boss, but I don't care it was sooooooooooo worth it. Mr Lucas has really delivered what we were all hoping for, a Star wars movie worthy of the original trilogy. I'm not going to bang on about the story or which parts were amazing all I can say is go see it as it make TPM look like the Barney the dinosaurs big adventure. Its one big none stop roller-coaster ride with some of the best fight scenes to date and a beatsy storyline which ties everything together nicely."
3368,10,Best film in whole series,Hello there...just realized that this movie has same meta score like Infinty War...and i don't get it...why so many people hate prequels.. my opinion is that most of the people don't like when evil win... but let's be honest in real life good not always win like in the movies... I'm sick of this good guys always wins...that just doesn't happen...
3369,10,Falling in love for a Jedi,"Thank you George and all your DREAMTEAM for being full of passion for this kind of history. Thank you Hayden, I really got shock when I saw you.....for many, many & many reasons,, you really do it great.Whe're on the edge between the true and reality living on this world, but I really believe that we're so close. I remember on the 70's -80's more of the movies, music even the way we wore jeans and t shirts looks like if we came from the space.I was a little child when StarWars begun, but be sure that in my future my grandson and his descendant will know you. I hope one day you can read me :), my best regards and keep in touch Monika"
3370,10,Revamping Star Wars,"After the bitter disappointment of The Phantom Menace and poor scripting in Attack of the Clones, Star Wars is back with a vengeance. The dark crimson tone displayed in this episode resembles what was marvelously portrayed in Episode V. George Lucas has made amends with the fans creating the second best episode in the saga next to The Empire Strikes Back. The movie looks magnificent, the image the sound, the special effects are great, and yet again another enormous display of talent by John Williams. And the poor acting that tarnished the two previous movies has been greatly improved with very convincing performances by Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson and even Hayden Christensen. The only one who wasn't up to par was Natalie Portman whose acting seems emotionless and utterly fake. It's a shame that a few key sequences were a little rushed, but overall it's a great movie. I recommend it to everyone, especially to Star War Fans, they'll love it."
3371,9,Lucas brings it full circle...It was impressive from start to finish.,"I must admit I was skeptical before entering the premiere, ""could Lucas pull it off"". Thankfully he did! As another viewer suggested this movie has good flow. It starts off exciting and visually appealing and takes you through the emotions that turn Anakin to the dark side. Christansen, and McGregor both have emotional scenes and you feel for their characters. In other words, you can become absorbed in this flick! To add to the interest factor, we saw this movie at 12:00am and waited an unexpected 3 hours to see this movie premiere in Lucas's home town of Modesto. We were tired and a little irritated before entering, but by 2:00am the atmosphere was much different. Cheering in the theater....who would have thought it!"
3372,10,Adventurous tear-jerker,"Quote - ""A trap! What do you suggest master?"" ""Spring the trap."" Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are all outstanding. Ewan McGregor playing the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker's mentor. Although he is worried that his apprentice is deeply troubled he is not willing to accept that he is not what he may seem and as a result he acts too late. To some, Hayden Christensen was not what they expected and a little bit of a let down while to others he fit the picture of an awkward boy battling his emotions. head over heels in love his inner conflicts are vast and dangerous. Portman plays Seneter Amidala, a young woman deeply in love and thus going against her initial instinct- 'It won't work' As everything becomes too much evil forces step in and make things worse. they mess with Anakin's head. His desperate love for his wife and his premonitions of her death plus his uncontrollable anger lead him to make decisions that one day, many decades later, he will regret. All up this movie is a real tear-jerker as the Jedi fall to the sith and epic battles take place. Anakin's fall and the desperateness of Obi-Wan who won't accept his padawan's darkness made me want to jump through the screen an hug and tell Obi-wan that everything will end up okay. Alas, that is impossible but every time i see the movie to me, it becomes real. A classic for all eternity."
3373,10,"By giving us answers we so much wanted, Lucas saved his trilogy!","Hello! Few weeks ago, I wasn't one of the big fans of Star Wars. After being a bit disappointed of how the first two episodes turned out, I was curious to see how Lucas would finish his trilogy. Hopefully it wouldn't be as bad as TPM or AOTC. Thank god, he has reviewed is directing 101 book. "
3374,10,"A Great story, well-told","It is impossible for me to comment on this movie without looking at the series as a whole. With this movie, all the pieces fall in to place and the story comes full circle. Despite the fact that pieces of some of the movies didn't work and other pieces were fluff seemingly added to sell toys to little kids, I left the theater after viewing this movie thinking, 'wow, what a great classic story!'. Much like a Greek epic or a Shakesperean tragedy, the underlying story grabs us and transcends the time and place where the story unfolds."
3375,10,Another excellent addition to the name of STAR WARS,"Torn between loyalty to his mentor,Obi-Wan Kenobi,and the seductive powers of the Sith,Anakin Skywalker ultimately turns his back on the Jedi,thus completing his journey to the dark side and his transformation into Darth Vader."
3376,8,The best SW in this new Trilogy,The best Star Wars in this new Trilogy
3377,10,I'm the biggest fan.I have everything ever,"this is the best this is the best I'm the biggest fan no matter what anybody says I have all the star wars stuff.everything i bet you don't have some things because i have some one of a kind things like cells from animations and stuff like that etcetera.Id kill for George Lucas, Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, frank oz, Samuel L Jackson, Natalie Portman, and all the other characters which i cant think of now as my hands hurt because of the extreme force speed I'm writing also I'm a real Jedi master don't believe me? don't have to but I'm the biggest fan and you cant prove me wrong.not ever if someone ever does somehow ill simply overtake them again as Quick as that ha!I've made my point.thanks for reading my gibberish of truth!and May the force be with you all who read this******"
3378,10,star wars episode three revenge of the sith,awesome awesome awesome! this is the best movie i have ever seen i have seen all the star wars now besides from return of the Jedi this is the other best movie if you have not seen this you have to because this is the one where an Anakin turns to the dark side and becomes Darth Vader.Vader gets severely burnt and you find out who adopts Leia but i wont tell obi wan and Yoda 
3379,9,Its a brilliant film for what is what inspired for,"Anyone complaining about the films wooden acting really only set themselves up for disappointment in the first place If you went to this movie expecting to see something akin to a Ben Hur epic or shawshank redemption then what were you expecting? This movie should be taken on its merits and for the epic trilogy it is, a movie inspired by Saturday morning serials ala Flash Gordon and so on Sure there's one or two moments in the film that make you want to cringe but its not because its bad acting but because thats what this movie is. This movie gave me tingles inside, warm little fuzzy feelings. This sure is as dark as I heard everyone say it would be I certainly am glad that George Lucas was inspired by Saturday morning serials to make his films and not Ben Hur or Gandhi but it sure sounds like thats what some people were expecting to see In any case, Georgie has done lucasfilm and himself proud, don't go to the cinema expecting an acting classic on par with Laurence of Arabia and you might just enjoy it even more"
3380,6,Confirmed! Directed by Committee!,"Back in June, just after this film was released, I went to see it once in the theatres. Just for that ""wide screen"" effect. The action was good, but not great. The effects were fantastic, as one would expect from ILM. The characters and plot, though, as continued from the previous two films, were just as wooden and disappointing. I knew that only with the DVD release would I have a chance to understand just how George Lucas does what he does (or doesn't). The DVD does not disappoint in this regard."
3381,6,Worth the Watch,"The film has its ups and downs. The main story line is good but is abandon regularly for either sub plots (which are usually pretty good) or pointless scenes. Many lines are delivered awkwardly and sometimes have nothing to do with the actual plot such as the line about the sand. However, it does develop a lot of motive for anakin as he becomes Darth Vader. I am a fan of the prequels. There not as good as the originals but they're still good and add some good character development. Overall, could be better, could be 30 minutes shorter, but it's still worth the watch."
3382,10,A triumphant and brilliant return for Star Wars,"Said to be the last Star Wars movie (although with it's success who knows where the franchise will go), George Lucas knew that nothing short of a breathtaking spectacle would be expected by Star War's adoring fans and movie aficionados alike. It was no secret that this movie would see Anakin Skywalker turn to the dark side, but the real draw of the movie would be to learn what made him turn and to try and understand his plight. We immediately plunge into an action sequence and the movie doesn't mess about in grabbing our attention. Senator Palpatine has been captured by General Grievous and yes, it's up to the Jedi to rescue him. Once more Skywalker and Obi-Wan are charged with mission impossible, but their guise and powers are far too strong to be denied by Grievous' army, and soon they work their way to where Palpatine is captured."
3383,9,Thank you George Lucas.,"When i sat in the theater, waiting for the opening crawl, I was practically hysteric. I had been waiting like a lifetime for that day. And it was finally there."
3384,9,Tremendous,"This movie is, at the very least, a great visual film. The film Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith acts as a bridge between the original trilogy and the second trilogy, telling the story about how Anakin Skywalker, the ""Hero With No Fear"", became Darth Vader, ""Dark Lord of the Sith"". It also gives many different facts that would otherwise be overlooked. The long-anticipated Star Wars film, which hit theaters around the globe on May 19, 2005, was the highest-grossing film of the year (After ""The Chronicles of Narnia""). The battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin was the best visually enhanced scene I have seen in my life. All in all, Star Wars was terrific."
3385,10,wow,"This movie was waaaaaaaaay better than the first two in the new trilogy. Hayden Christensen does a lot better acting in this one than in two. Ewan Mcgregor is always great. Portman plays Padme like always, pretty good."
3386,10,A New Hope?,"After coming back from a mission to save the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) Anakin(Hayden Christensen) is told his wife, (Natalie Portman) is pregnant.Which therefore leads to the nightmares that Anakin had of Padme dieing in child labor(died giving birth). Stepping up to the Jedi Council the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine nominated Anakin to join the Jedi Council, but he was rejected.This upset Anakin feeling like the Jedi council was holding him back from something. The only one who was there to comfort young Skywalker was Chancellor Palpatine. For the move Chancellor Palpatine pulled the Jedi Council was supicous and told Obi-WanKenobi(Ewan MeGregor)to tell Anakin to spy on the Chancellor, but Anakin was appalled by that asking of him, to him that wasn't the Jedi way."
3387,10,This is good acting. Lightyears beyond Spider-Man 2,"Yes, while some of the prequels have been a bit uneven at times, this movie is an awesome effort I must say. Finally we have some good acting in a Star Wars movie, and I am including the first three which if they came out now people would still be stuck on the acting, Which we all know has never been great. Everyone in this movie does what actors do they make the character live according to the director's vision. Remember it's Lucas' vision, not your's if you didn't like the way he brings HIS characters to the big screen, then write your own script and see if you can get it made into a film. One more thing I must mention is that this film should be on the Top 250, case in point; it has the same overall rating as Spider-Man 2 with almost 10,000 votes more(and the acting in that movie, was just bone dry and stupid at times) I don't think the webmasters at IMDb are being fair to this movie at all."
3388,10,A phenomenal must see.,"Revenge of the Sith was absolutely excellent; the best of all the Star Wars movies to date. The special effects were spectacular, with some scenes having almost a 3D effect. I mean I felt like I was right there with them in the thick of it. It was very exciting and exhilarating, in that the pace of the movie was balanced in the tempo leading up to the climax of the ending. I was also impressed with the transition of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. Honestly, in viewing Attack of the Clones (even with his dark moment) I didn't see how he was going to pull it off, but he did so in a most magnificent fashion. Two thumbs, and big toes :-) way way up for this one. George Lucas is excellent in finding raw talent for his blockbuster productions. I can't imagine this really being the end, Mr Lucas is much too innovative for that, or maybe that's just wishing thinking of a hopeful film buff."
3389,10,Loved it but why did the,"I loved the movie it was awesome the best one out of the last 3, but hated that all the jedi's died like punks, i mean they let 3 clone warriors shoot them in the back with out never even knowing it was coming, however a 10 year old jedi killed about 10 of them before he got it. don't want to ruin the movie just wished the no name jedi's in the movie would have put up a better fight. it is a must see hope it passes the sunken ship (titanic) on the all time list go see it to make sure it does. it is full of action and at the end of the movie it all starts to come together. I will see it again and recommend it to everyone. go see this movie you will be happy and then you will recommend it to all of yuour friends."
3390,8,"Not great acting or great dialogue, but still a very entertaining movie","This is probably one of the few movie where I can say that the main character's acting left a lot to be desired, and the dialogue was a little boring at times, but I still want to see this movie again, if not more then once again. Hayden Christiansen(sorry for the spelling) just isn't believable at times, and I think you would want to have the most vital character in both trilogies be believable. I think corny would be another word I would use to describe him. But, Ian McDermid, Sam Jackson, Ewan McGregor, and even Frank Oz(I was glad that Yoda didn't do quite as much backwards talking as in Episodes I and II) helped make up for Hayden's shortcomings. "
3391,10,Best Emperor Stuff Ever,"In addition to the six Star Wars films being about the life of Darth Vader, it's also the tale of how Palpatine gain and then instantly lost his great power. You may hate the Ewoks, but most of the Emperor's lines from Jedi are classic. It's ashamed that 'Hollywood' hates George Lucas so much, because Palpatine should have won a best supporting actor Oscar for Episode III. The story he tells Anakin of his former master is outstanding. I think the line, ""Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueous the Wise?"" is my favorite part of the whole film. Of course the battle between Anakin and Kenobi at Musafar is amazing and ""My little green friend"" kicks some butt as well, but the acting of Palpatine. That's the crown jewel for me. When he says ""Do it"" or ""Leave us"", he commands the power of the 'voice' from Dune. When he grins, it's so perfectly evil yet charming. The way he plays weak and then still has ""Unlimited Power"" left in his tank. His light-saber technique is cool as well. All and all, this has got to be the best Emperor stuff ever. Don't you agree?"
3392,10,Qui-Gon Thing At End,"What was the thing Yoda told Obi-Wan at the end of the movie about Qui-Gon? I sort of missed it! Awesome movie!!! Saw it @ 12:01AM Thursday, May 19th!!! One my personal favorites already! Never got sleepy! I'm seeing again next Saturday! Another question, Did James Earl Jones do the cheesy yell at the end? Another question, was it Hayden Christian in the Vader suit? "
3393,9,The Perfect End To A Perfect Saga!,"Years ago there were a lot of people thinking ""what has Lucas done!!"". After the excessively annoying Jar Jar Binks, dialogue that could have been written by a three-year old, and the midi-cholrians, fans across the globe were shocked by what the creator had done to one of the most beloved franchises of all time. They thought it couldn't get any worse. They were wrong."
3394,7,Quite possibly the best film i've ever seen,"my title says it all really. i don't care what people say about it, how it has tacky lines or how anakin's move to the dark side was too quick, this, in my honest opinion, is a masterpiece. the first two prequels-- they were good films (TPM being the better) but weren't a patch on the original 3. Then Revenge of the Sith comes along, and, as another commenter said, proves they saved the best till last. The opening battle sequence, from the two jedi fighters gliding slowly over a couple of a republic ships to Greivous' ship crash landing in coruscant, has got to be the most thrilling opening/war sequence in a film ever (sorry to all those saving private ryan fans) the lightsabre duels (especially yoda/emperor and anakin/obi-wan) were unbelievable. and i personally felt anakin's move to the dark side was quite well done, and also showed that he was a truly loving person- to do all that to save his wife and baby(s). In short- if you're a star wars fan or not, you need to watch this film. it annihilates the quality of I and II, and even beats return of the jedi (my 2nd favourite)."
3395,10,Return of the Sith,"He did it! After 2 prequels that left many fans underwhelmed, George Lucas ended the Star Wars series with a film that's fits very nicely with A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. It's that good. Nearly every fault that could be found with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones has been addressed. Better acting (Hayden and Natalie actually seem like a couple in love, Ewan McGregor nails many of scenes with a dead on Guiness impersonation, and Ian McDiarmad is the perfect over the top villain), better pacing, more intense drama, a Jar Jar that is seen and not heard, genuinely funny comic relief by R2, and last but not least, the birth of Vader. It's as good a bridge to A New Hope as we could have hoped for."
3396,9,it's all about force and power!!,"i have seen it twice ,and the ending is exceptional.Though i wanted them to go on about the Jedi dead being immortal ,and being able to interact with the living.At the end of the movie though i knew what was happening i was almost hoping for ken-obi to reason with Anakin .The fight ending duel between them reminded me of ""highlander end game "" the fight between the McLeod's , Duncan and Connor.It was also refreshing to hear Mr Jones voice again and not in a commercial. I was pleased with this episode as i was with all the others people disliked episode 1 and 2 i do not really see why.it well deserves to be in the top #250 .Hayden did a good job i just doubt he will be any good in any other role but that is the chance you take when you play a iconic figure it is what most people will remember you for like the mentioned highlander movie and the guy that played Connor McLeod Mr Adrian Paul."
3397,10,Unbelievable!!,"Best star wars in the series, in my opinion. The fight scenes....crazy awesome, and the movie ties the whole thing together so well. Hats off to Mr. Lucas! I was going into this movie with extremely high standards and thought there was a good chance to be let down. The movie exceeded anything I could have dreamed up on my own. I thought the music was good, but i think that could have been a smidge better. It was not bad, there was just a lot of room for a new, monstrously intense orchestrated song. Nonetheless, a must see for anyone that has not read the books and need some closure to the center of the story!! p.s. no i did not read any of the books...the movies fulfilled me with this brilliant series of events."
3398,7,Great way to end a great film series,"I took my grand son to see the final film at the cinema as at 8 years old he is just about old enough to enjoy the full sound/visual effects of a modern multiplex,I was not a great fan of the prequels so far,having been lucky enough to watch all three of the original Starwars at my local cinema as they came out and only seen the DVD versions of the Phantom menace and Attack of the Clones,whilst we both enjoyed the film I thought that the political element did take up huge amounts of the running time and more battles would have made the experience better,The best bit was when I set up a screening of the original Starwars (A new hope) on my home cinema screen when we got home and my grandson thought it was so cool that I had the next episode already!"
3399,9,"Great movie, yo!","I think Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith was as good as it was going to get. I loved it. It tied all the strings together...well, almost. The whole Yoda telling Obi Wan Kenobi that he could learn to talk to Qui Gon was not in the last three movies. I've read books in which Qui Gon did talk to Obi Wan, but not in the movies. I think that at the end when Anakin...err...Darth Vader screams in anguish, the camera should have done something different. The camera should have gone through the breathing vents where Vader's mouth should be, in through his head, and into the brain. There you would see Anakin standing and screaming in anguish. It would have portrayed the pain a whole lot better. Vader's scream is rather puny."
3400,9,Comedy Not SF,"robots with no head that need to talk, that general robot that is seriously ill ... come on ... it would be OK if i was 12 years old ... the movie started OK with special effects and stuff it was OK but as soon as i saw those talking robots i said ... OK i'm going to eat this ... it's a big production i must see it like everyone ... the came that robot general that was sicker than a real person ... i had enough ... plus i was arguing with a friend of mine about it ... he was trying to convince me that i can't understand this kind of stuff ... please ... this movie is PATETIC ... it was OK 20 years OK ... this is the way that they saw the future back then ... but ... for god's sake!!! ... this is 2005 ... How Hungry Can You Be For Money???????!!!!!!!!! i consider this movie an insult to a decent person that payed to see a good SF."
3401,8,Liked it for what it is,"ROTS is a nice conclusion to the legacy of Darth Vader and Luke Skywaker. While wrapping things up and answering some questions for the viewer, the things that made the original movies great, were a bit hooky but added some nostalgia. The kids will probably like this movie as there is enough action to keep them entertained, but the melodrama in many cases can really slow the pace of the movie. As far as acting goes, the veteran actors like Ewan Mcgregor and Samuel L. Jackson unfortunately shows the lack of skills and depths of the new comers like Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, but hey Mcgregor and Jackson were green once too. It seems Christensen was playing the part just like Lucas would have been telling him to, but he really needed to move past the Lucas idolizing, and in time he probably will. Overall have to say I liked the movie for what it is, a conclusion to 30 years of questions about who is who and how they got to be where they were."
3402,9,Where the Mobius Loop Begins,"I loved it. If the film could take human form I would overlook the unlikelihood of its existence and give it a big hug. In a lot of ways the things ""wrong"" with this movie are the same things that are ""wrong"" about Return of the Jedi, questionable dialog, stiff acting because of the questionable dialog. But nit picking is a waste of time. The heart is there. Reviewers often review themselves, and when the criticism is loud and unfocused and angry it may be, in part, that one is so attached to the feelings caused by the initial viewing of IV, V and VI that anything else can never bridge the gap of expectation. Corny parts, bad dialog? Name one Star Wars movie without them. P.S. Anakin got what he had coming to him."
3403,10,"Good, Bad, and YES -, we LOVED Hayden C and Natalie P.","Yes, I agree with Frankenstein comments, lack of believability that Ewan McGregor would just calmly walk away, etc. Yoda's brown pantsuit was too funny. Little English Jedis were somewhat odd, but fighting scenes rocked! As to romance/love - I talked to a bunch of women, and we all agreed that although some of Hayden's and Natalie's lines weren't the most original, the way Annakin caught up with Padme in the beginning and how he held/visually devoured her was pretty much a believable sequence for those of us lucky women who've had a partner as such. So, if you are a guy, fast forward to the fight scenes. If you are a female, then you just watch that scene where they first meet up. A movie for guys and gals 2 b sure. Play it on a big screen with volume turned up!"
3404,6,Revenge of the Sith - Mistakes,"Mistake spotting and movie loving are two separate areas which just happen to share common ground. 9 mistakes so far, and no doubt many many more to come..."
3405,4,George Lukas need director Jedi trainning,"George Lukas needs Jedi training to direct again This movie seems to be made thinking just for the upcoming video game, and the merchandise products. The plot it's full of cliché and predictable phrases. The childbirth scenes in Annakin's nightmare are pure crap as they are the unique ""strong"" reason for Annakin's to betray the Force. The ""Herodes"" scene of the little boys massacre it's condonable and unjustified, and I noticed people got tired because the oversaturated CGI scenes."
3406,10,One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is a movie many have been waiting for, for a long time now."
3407,10,Sith is the SHIZNIT!,"I shall give no spoilers before their time. ""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,"" ah yes, and it seems like just yesterday I saw ""A New Hope."" First off let me say I have read reviews where people have called Hayden's performance, stiff and wooden-like. In my opinion you can either be wooden or not wooden, but what wooden-like is, well let's just say I need Jedi training to figure it out. This dude can act people. He is playing one of the most vicious villains in cinema history. A villain whose soul is tortured. A villain who only cares about three things (see Sith to find those out, though if you have seen any of the Star Wars movies, you will know what those three things are). Do you want him doing the happy dance of Naboo? You know the one they do when tortured souls are wooden-like ... well, I guess you do. "
3408,9,I just saw this yesterday!!!!!!!,"I have been a Star Wars freak ever since I was three years old, watching Luke Skywalker kick butt in Episode four, so I was so excited to see the last and final piece of the Star Wars saga completed."
3409,10,this will be the best STAR WARS movie ever,"I won't spoil the movie, but in George Lucas last STAR WARS movie, is when Anakin goes to the dark side. I'll just say that he loses a lot on the path to the dark side. You get to see most of the characters from the old trilogy in this movie. And best of all, you get to see Darth Vader, and find out who Darth Sidius is.But if your favorite character's are Jedi's, this will be a very sad movie for you. Just don't bring little kids that get scared very easily.If you're a STAR WARS fan(like me), then you MUST see this movie! It is the key to all the rest of the STAR WARS movie's. It tells you who the mother of Luke and Leia are. It tells you why the two twins had to be taken away from their father. But most importantly, it tells you why Anakin went to the dark side. Either, he had a reason to go to the dark side, or his uncontrollable anger made him want even more power. The only way you can find out is when you see the movie."
3410,10,"All i gotta say is ""WOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOO""",EXCELLENT !
3411,8,Roman Republic-Empire = Star Wars III?,"This movie has a striking resemblance to the Roman Republic. A Republic that through Julius Caesar, and later through Octavian, became an empire. The republic was governed by a senate, with two consuls (three in the case of Star Wars' galatic empire). Octavian was saddened by the loss of his Uncle, just as Anakin had lost it when he realized Padme had died. Both found solace in ruling an empire. The Roman Empire was founded on the basis that the Senate would be maintained carrying out only a ceremonial role, this was a reference made in the movie by Jedi and by the Emperor in some instances. Both involved epic wars for control of power, in Rome's history that included a naval battle at Actium between Octavian and Anthony, in Sith, this was known as the Clone Wars. A blend of lightsabers, a war for power, and the creation of an empire of the ages; a ""unique"" combination... Yet, old ideas can still make great movies, and basing a movie on the past doesn't take away from it's greatness. It is just an interesting comparison..."
3412,6,Sith goodness and tragic greatness,"May 19, 2005-----1.52 Lucasfilm logo. We all cheered."
3413,8,"star wars, da bomb!","Star Wars Epiosode 3: Revenge of The Sith is awesome, thrilling, great, sweet, and ends the great intriguing saga of the Star Wars series.You either love it, or hate it, I personally loved it, the best in the series. Warning!! Don't take your kids if they are under 8 years old, or if they aren't mature enough to see pg- 13 movies. Star Wars isn't so bad except for the over-excessive violence, and intense images. i took my 2 kids, age 9 and 12, to see it and they loved it!Anakin's turn to the dark size was done very well as well. it's interesting to see how technology has changed over the past 30 something years.look for the amazing cgi and the great details that you may not see, ex.,THE MILENIUM FALCON in the background, or the director, George Lucas in the background at padme's funeral.hope you see the movie, and enjoy!"
3414,10,My favorite Star Wars Episode,"I love the depth Ep.III gives to the saga. Suddenly, I care about Vader? That was a jump I wasn't ready for. And forget all u haters who say Hayden ruined Stars Wars, this was Lucas' vision from the get, so deal. Yes, Anakin is whiny and self-absorbed, isn't that perfect fodder for becoming a Sith? I'll admit that even I have problems w/ Natalie Portman's performance as Padme in this one, she stunk up the screen, but I try to overlook it.(like overlooking the blood from a saber-wound in A New Hope) Any SW nerd will tell ya, these aren't just movies and tie-ins, this is Life! Again, this one is the best of all the movies, and if you don't find yourself blubbering like a baby at the Jedi massacre then there is something seriously wrong with u."
3415,10,Lucas has Redeemed Himself and then Some!!,"Like many of the fans of the original Star Wars Trilogy I was severely disappointed in the first two ""prequels"" George Lucas offered up to the many fans of the Star Wars series. I am also sure many of us where skeptical of what the final installment would bring to our beloved Star Wars. Well I am glad to say that George Lucas will do more than restore your faith in the force.....he'll make you love it again."
3416,7,Episode III one year on...,"After watching ROTS for the first time last year I immediately wrote a very applauding review and gave the film 9/10. Here 14 months on and just having watched it for what must have been the tenth time, I feel suitable to deliver as fair and balanced an opinion of the film as ever am I to give."
3417,10,Lucas re-captures the power of the original Star Wars,"A long time ago in a childhood far far away, an eleven year old boy sat in amazement watching the new movie Star Wars. After that, all other movies had to deal with the fact that they were second rate."
3418,10,Best SW movie of all.,"i just loved the film,i don't care about the acting,i never saw good acting in the OT except for MR Guinness so ill not complain about that.the development of the story is just great,Ian Mcdiarmid performance was just awesome and this has to be my favorite movie by a long shot except for ROTJ that is the only other movie that can actually be a match for revenge of the sith.the way that everything happens,i always thought that anakin was just some greedy man who wanted more for himself no matter the cost,and ROTS comes to enlighten us that he wasn't at all like that.the movie is the perfect combination of Drama,action,and emotion that you can possibly feel in a SW film.if you never felt anything resembling sadness in the other 5 then you have to watch this one !!."
3419,9,The Best Star Wars,"I've always been a fan of Star Wars. And I HATED the prequels... but this changed me. I was expecting to walk out of the theater disappointed, but man I wasn't. It had everything I was hoping for. Good FX, epic on every scale, good story, and some of the best action ever put on film. George Lucas restored my faith in him... ************* spoilers***** ************* Now my favorite part of the movie is it's PG-13 rating. And it earns it. (yay). Like, for example, Mace Windu has a lightsaber to Palpatine's throat. Anakin walks in. Palpatine is using the lighting attack on Windu, which he backfires with his lightsaber. It hit's palpatine right in the face, thus showing how his face got so scarred in it's graphic glory. As Mace is ready to deliver the final blow to Palpatine, Anakin slices of Windu's hand, and Palpatine finishes him of with a full blow to the face with his powers, flinging Windu out the window. **************** end spoilers**** **************** Jus' a little darker? Yeah. But that shouldn't stop yah. The final battle REALLY stands out, but I won't spoil it for ya. "
3420,10,"Thank you, George!","Finally, George Lucas has made a Star Wars film worthy of the name. The last two were disappointing for me as I really did not care for the characters at all. After this one, I left the theater feeling sadness. This movie is the best by far of the new trilogy and perhaps of the entire series. During the second movie, I really did not like the way Anakin was portrayed. He just seemed to be a brat, and that did nothing to help me understand the character. In this one, he is more human and likable. For me this makes his downfall that much more tragic. The acting is enjoyable, if over the top sometimes. I like overacting in certain movies, and this is one of them. The visuals are top notch, as we expect from a Star Wars movie. The plot is a no brainer, but do we expect a cerebral tour de force in a summer blockbuster? If you are a fan of the original trilogy, then this is the movie for you."
3421,10,"Overall, a great ending","I used to hate Star Wars. My cousins were obsessed with it. The day ROTS came out, me and my cousins went to watch it. And I loved it."
3422,9,Very good end to the saga,"I left Episode III without the feeling of lingering disappointment that was with me after I & II. The key to this Star Wars is that it is well-paced and we shift seamlessly back and forth from action to back story. The acting and writing are far superior to the first two with Hayden Christiansen doing an outstanding job as Anakin Skywalker then Darth Vader. The pulse of the film though belongs to Ewan McGregor who takes over the screen as Obi-Wan. The action of course is first rate and is plenty to go around. We see 5 light saber duels including the epic almost half hour long fight between Kenobi and Vader. This film answers all the questions and ties everything together beautifully making you want to pop in the original as soon as you get home, which I did and it is a totally different movie experience for me now. I felt like i was watching a New Hope for the first time."
3423,10,is the best movie ever,"revenge of the sith is the darkest of all star-wars and in my opinion the best movie ever created!!!Hayden Cristencen played awesome and the battle of the heroes between obi won and darth vader was the best of all star-wars along with the final battle in return of the jedi...the graphics and the effects are stunning the music like all star-wars gives the epic tone and the moral issues that are risen are more than enough to make you rethink your life!!!revenge of the sith connects perfectly the old star-wars with the new ones so as soon as you see episode 3 you would like to see episode 4.i the most people i have asked think star-wars are better at the order of 3,6,5,2,4,1"
3424,9,Almost reaching the dizzying heights of Original Trilogy greatness,"I haven't been on the edge of my seat for ages in the cinema, but star wars delivers yet again. this film is a return to form for George Lucas, and even those that found episode one and two annoying have something to enjoy here. Anakin's decent into the darkside is both emotional and exciting. Although the Chemistry between Padme and Anakin is still a little fishy, its the Anakin/Obi wan dynamic that is truly inspirational. Emporer Palpatine steals every scene that he's in and Mace Windu gets the ending that Sam Jackson always wanted, not to go out like some punk. Its great to see the star wars saga go out with a bang."
3425,8,Truly a underrated gem,"now,i personally HATED The clone wars,and LOVED the phantom menace,for obvious reasons,but when the third,and final movie was released,i saw it with my father,who is a fan of star wars as well,and i honestly have never been so sad as to see the star wars movies end. the movie is one of the best(IMO)'star wars movies since the original saga(Ie.., 4,5,6) and a very great beginning to the terror known as darth vader. i instantly connected with obi- wans bond with skywalker,as he never wanted to have to fight skywalker,instead wanting to kill palpatine. to wrap it up,Revenge of the sith is a very great ending to the anakin skywalker series,and a great start to the Luke saga."
3426,9,Revenge of the Sith,"I remember as a child, my brother, cousin and I would play Star Wars at my grandparents house. My cousin and I would be ""Leia"" (I know there is only one...but we were young...LOL), and from one minute to the next my brother would switch alter egos between ""Vader"" and ""Luke""...Little did we know back then that it would lead to a love and passion for the saga. ""Revenge..."" is in my opinion far better than ""Phantom..."" and ""...Clones"". I was thrilled from the beginning credits to the end. With one exception. That's why I rated it a nine. But the story was excellent, the plot was excellent, and the characters were great! I would most definitely see it again, and again, etc...LOL! Can't wait to have a Star Wars marathon!"
3427,10,star wars fan 4 life,whats ya mean its OK to be a Star Wars fan again?!?!!? all the movies were excellent! beyond expectation! Mr Lucas is a master of the imgaination! a grand master in fact! how many people have these movies inspired? ask yourself . just a quick thanks to cast and crew for all their efforts >. you all rocked !!!!HOOOOYA!!!!! and i cant wait to see what else the star wars universe has to reveal! MR LUCAS may the Force be with you always!!!keep up the good work!!!! a fan 4 life!!!! Eric Frey p.s. Mr. Lucas thanks for these films you brought together 2 generations of my family ya helped bridge the gap between me and my step father with a new hope and gave me and my children something to share for a long time to come THANK YOU MR. Lucas!
3428,10,Absolutely unbelievable...,"After waiting over four hours to see Revenge of the Sith yesterday, I was justly rewarded with an emotional overload. This film is simply unbelievable; Lucas has overdone himself this time."
3429,9,"Awesome, to put it simply.","When I went to go see Episode 3 I expected it be ""good"" but when i got done seeing it i was blown away. Everything about the movie is done really well: the action, the plot, the drama, the characters, even the ACTING has gotten a lot better than previously.(yes, even Hayden Christienson.) Probably the only thing that could have made it better was if 3-CPO turned out to have force powers."
3430,9,It could be better,"Even if Episode III is a good movie and makes fans please, you can feel little disappointment after you watched it, if you have greater expectations about the movie like I do. I mean, I love Star Wars universe. I love all the movies, even the new trilogy. They occur in that universe and let us see more Jedi, young Obi Wan Kenobi, rise of the empire and introduce us Qui Gon Jinn, Mace Windu, Count Dooku. In the new movie, you will see more visual effects, but less character development. There are weak spots in the script and romance between Anakin and Padme is really cheesy. IMO, the plot of The Knights of the Old Republic video game is better and more emotional. You know, Lucas knows the movie will be watched and break the box office records whatever he does. Anyway, at least acting is better this time. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid's acting incredible. And Natalie Portman is her best in the trilogy. I'd like to see more Samuel L.Jackson and Christopher Lee, but the plot doesn't let this. IMO even though Hayden Christensen acts better, he is still the weakest link. By the way, Lucas said that this movie is dark and emotional. Unfortunately, it's not fully right. I suggest Lucas watching Blade Runner, Alien, Escape From NY or any David Lynch or David Cronenberg movie to see what the dark is in the Sci-Fi. Anyway, at least there's no Jar Jar till the final scene and he doesn't talk. I give it 6 points and add 1 point because it's star wars and 1 point for great acting, because there's less time for acting, but they are trying to do their best. (8/10)"
3431,10,The best of them all,"This movie is by far the best of the prequels and is as good as or better than episodes 4-6. While I have never been a Star Wars nut, I really enjoyed this film. It is literally a Shakespearean tragedy set in a science fiction world. If episodes 1-6 had never seen the light of day, Revenge of the Sith could easily stand on its own as an engrossing character study of a great warrior hero who slowly and tragically descends into the implacable grasp of evil. The irony of it all is that Anakin is driven to such depths of iniquity out of love for his wife and his instincts to protect her. The evil Palpatine is a combination of Othello's Iago and MacBeth's Lady MacBeth, drawing Anakin into his evil web of treachery with a combination of lies, flattery, and empty promises. We cannot help but feel sorry for Anakin as he, his judgment clouded by recurring nightmares of his wife's death, allows himself to be manipulated into becoming Palpatine's protégé, and, eventually, sees all that he has held dear vanish before his very eyes."
3432,9,A great motion picture triumph,"George Lucas, in his first three movies, did fantastic and with the first two prequels, he did excellent. But with this third installment in this second trilogy, he has reached what these first three movies were to show, how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. All six movies are a great achievement in movie making history. This movie brings us all back to when, 28 year ago, George Lucas came out with his first STAR WARS. That same anticipation and excellent that we felt in 1977 we felt on May 19, 2005. It is the connection of the original ones we loved so and the new ones that add a great new story to the old. Even though it is over, STAR WARS will always live in the hearts of the true fans like myself and the history books."
3433,8,Did Lucas save the franchise?,"Last night 18th of may, i went to see the Belgium premiere of Ep III... at 0.01 am... I was among the first Belgian peeps to see the first public viewing and i have to say, i felt honored... Not only is the Star Wars franchise one of the biggest franchises of all time... This would be the movie that would link the new trilogy with the classic one, finally our questions would be answered. But was ep III worth the viewing? Lemme first say that ep III is still not a perfect movie. The effects are great most of the time, which was to be expected but the acting was awful, now i expected Hayden to be crap, again, but this time around, even Nat portman, Ewan McGregor and even Ian mcdiarmid couldn't convince me. They looked so fake, what wasn't the case in the previous two installments. It surprised me. The story itself does solve the missing pieces of the puzzle however, anakin switching from the light to the dark side was executed in an unbelievable way.. They should've given it a bit more time, now it really is like this... light one minute, dark the next..."
3434,9,Unexpectedly Awesome,"It was with a certain apprehension that I went to the theatre in order to watch ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"". Much like many of the ""old farts"", I couldn't personally relate to EP1's Jar-Jar Binks and 30-min long Pod race; nor could I enjoy the poorly written and acted dialogue in EP2."
3435,3,Thank God this crap is over with!! Star Wars is way overrated!!,"Lucas's uncreative attempts to cash in on probably his only number one blockbuster was very profitable, but kinda sad, but i will admit that i can't deny it is a dominating force in the sci-fi movie world. And now Spielberg and Lucas want to bring back the geriatric Indiana Jones??? Are you freakin' kidding!?!?! First of all, what happened to Spielberg's vow to never do a sequel? does that only apply to everything, but Jurassic park 1 and 2 and all the Indiana movies??...some vow. Not to mention Harrison Ford is set to reprise the role, is he even athletically capable? He is in his sixties for pete's sake! I know he is in good shape, but i would be very disappointed to see Indiana come back and trade in his whip for a cane. Point is...Star wars is just done to death, and i hope it is over but kudos to those loyal geeks living in their mothers' basements still getting off to this junk."
3436,8,"Great Fun, but glaring errors...","Contains Spoilers!!! Padme dies! Anakin is Darth Vader !!! This movie was misnamed -it should really be ""Darth Vader Begins"" "
3437,,The best Star Wars movie,"Although I expected Ep3 with anxiety I had some low expectations because I didn't love the other prequels. Not that they were soooooo bad but after you have watched eps 4,5 and 6 it's not enough to notice how great the special effects are in order to be impressed. But when I saw Revenge of the sith I was absolutely stunned. At first I thought it was just because of the magic of the cinema view and thought that I have to watch it some more times and to sleep over it if I want to make a better assessment. So I did. And I still think it is the best of all the six Star Wars movies."
3438,10,awesome,"I loved this movie. I saw it at midnight opening night and then woke up and watched it again at 11:30 in the morning when the theater opened again. It was even better the second time! There is just so much to see that it will take at least 3 viewings at the theater to see it all. I am a huge Star Wars fan and this movie probably ranks behind only A New Hope in the series. This is the must see movie of the summer. The pure visual spectacle alone is worth seeing it twice. I have never seen anything like it in my life. I rate this movie a 10 and anyone who gives it less than an 8 is just not a true movie fan. This movie does exactly what it set out to do, finish the circle. Sith does a great job of leading right into A New Hope. I would suggest going home right after the movie and watching A New Hope. I can't wait until this hits DVD as a 6 movie set!"
3439,10,The Force is with this one....,"The Star Wars franchise is one of the greatest cinematic achievements to date. And, in my opinion, this movie hasn't let the great name down! Capturing George Lucas's magnificent vision and emotion, this film was touching and incredible, as far as special effects go. A very emotional look into one of Hollywood's most feared villains ever: Darth Vader!"
3440,7,More machine now than man,"There's a good line in Return of the Jedi: ""He's more machine now than man"". Obi-Wan is, of course, speaking of Darth Vader, but he could just as well have been Alec Guinness speaking of George Lucas. Lucas simply seems more at home with machinery than he does with people. He can conjure up truly eye-popping battle sequences, but when it comes to two people in a room talking, he just flounders, becoming what some critics call ""medusa director"": Turning his actors into stone."
3441,9,My goods and bads of E3! (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!),I'll briefly tell you what I liked and disliked about E3.
3442,6,"Disappointed, I AM (still)....aka, Revenge of LARRY KASDAN!","Let me start by saying that I am a BIG Star Wars Fan; I recall (when I was a small kid) actually catching the ORIGINAL Star Wars at the movies and being COMPLETELY blown away; I ended up seeing the flick @ 19 times IN THE THEATRE ALONE, when it came out way back when."
3443,10,The experience of imagination,"The Saga ends here...and what a final it is. Seeing this movie was probably the best thing I've done this month. Not only the tension of watching a great movie was present, but also that feeling of a complete chain."
3444,10,What A Film!!!,Star Wars Episode 4; a filming masterpiece. George Lucas is discovered. 
3445,7,"The cheesiness was disguised, but disguised beautifully by the visual power of this ultimate movie experience.","The ultimate summer movie experience! ""Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith"" was fuelled with so much excitement, emotionality, intensity, darkness, and ""epicness"" that it's almost impossible to not feel the grand-scale size, massively huge vision, and powerful visual George Lucas approached this film with. There are times in this film where it's almost hard to handle the dramatic, and riveting moments that immensely build-up and setup the stories of the old and classic ""Star Wars"" films. It is definitely a fantastic popcorn blockbuster that is one of the best theatre experiences a viewer can have. It does sound pedestrian, however, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is just ""SO INTENSE!"" Lucas couldn't have done more in the delivery of the film."
3446,10,One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made,"Wow. What a fantastic ride. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made. I loved everything about it. The dialogue, although cheesy, was much better than the other prequels, as was the acting. The action scenes were some of the best I've ever seen put on film. I wasn't sure what to expect when I first went in to watch it, but I came out of the theater with my jaw hanging by my ankles in amazement. The Final Fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin was simply breathtaking. General Grevous was easily the coolest villain since Darth Vader. This is by far my favorite Star Wars film."
3447,,Worst Star Wars villain ever.....,"I must say when I watched Star Wars 3 I thought it was terrific, however the new ""villain"" ruined my appetite for the rest of the flic."
3448,10,Best since Empire......hands down,Anyone who is a true Star Wars fan will love this movie. If you don't you're not a true Star Wars fan regardless of what you claim. I personally liked the prequels but this film blows Episodes I and II into a parallel dimension. George Lucas you are an incomparable genius. Hayden Christensen you finally proved to the world that you are indeed a talented young actor. Ian McDiarmid you gave audiences a reason to fear Palpatine once again. Ewan McGregor you are Obi Wan Kenobi just like Alec Guiness before you. And to the rest of the cast...thank you for giving audiences a film to remember. Two thumbs up; five out of five stars. Go see this film. It's worth the eight bucks.
3449,8,General questions,Answer me this. If Anniken and Obi Wan were as close as brothers. Why didn't Obi figure out until the end that Padme's kid was from Anniken?!
3450,7,George Lucas still cannot write or direct actors,"fantastic fight scenes and CG, etc. "
3451,10,Thank's George Lucas !!! THe revenge of the Sith is the best .....,"excellent!!!! thank's a lot god bless Lord Lucas....The best star wars of the Prelogy .... Lucas is back and the force to be with him... Ewan mcgregor, hayden and natalie portman is very great actors, The last episode close very good, the saga.... thank's for all, thank's for the most powerful movie of the new generation...... I'm a big fan of star wars and I love the first trilogy but the last episode is amazing.... NOw the entire saga is complete and i'm so sad...... please mister lucas, encore with the episode 7, 8 , 9 ;-) I'm so very exciting now!! now it's time for the Americans people to see the episode 3, tomorrow the darkside is back for the last time"
3452,10,The Force is Strong......Again,"everything about this movie has surpassed my expectations. after the disappointment of episode one and the improvements of episode two, i thought that this will be either even better or much worse. but it is amazing and, in my opinion, the best star wars film ever made together with Empire. from Hayden Christensen's acting (which is still not perfect but thats not what star wars is about), to the effects and the nostalgia when old loved characters re- appear, this movie is just the perfect ending to the greatest saga cinema has ever produced. George Lucas said years ago that he is planning on making nine star wars films, three set during the Empire, three set before and three set after! after seeing this masterpiece i am more than willing to agree with the people who shouted ""encore"" in the cinema and say ""bring it on George"". Star Wars will never die or be forgotten and even when our kids are growing up, i hope they will still be able to see the magic and feel the Force....if you haven't seen it yet go and see it! if u have seen it go and see it again!! and may the Force be with us all!!!"
3453,9,Excellent finish to a great series of movies!,"I loved this one. Episode I was fun because it was Star Wars again, but overall, I thought it was just OK. Too much JarJar and the business that Darth Vader built C3PO was just plain silly. Episode 2 was much better."
3454,7,A RoTS Review,"The reason why I gave Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith a 7 because of a couple of inconsistencies, horrible acting on the part of Hayden Christensen (as always), and a below par performance on the part of Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson. Also because I found some of the things they did in the movie rather annoying such as the excessive use of special effects and the killing of of certain characters too quickly for my liking...also not to mention the fact that Grievous, I found, was possibly the stupidest character ever invented for Star Wars. For my full review of Revenge of the Sith, please go here: http://blogs.starwars.com/shadekeiko/1 It contains mega spoilers, so beware! I urge you all to see the movie before reading my review."
3455,6,Not as good as it could be,None of the new movies have been that great. This one is better than the last two but not that good. Like the last two the acting was as bad as can be. The dialogue was bas as well...
3456,10,Now Complete,"I Couldn't be more satisfied with this film, all loose ends were met, and now the story is complete. No questions arise at the end of the movie, that arise in others as in plot, "" I don't understand this"", ""what happens to so and so"" , etc etc. The only complaint that i might have is about the little kiddies in the few front rows of the theater, causing a bit of a stir while battling out their ten man light saber duel. However, the adolescent side of me, I must confess, did want to join their little entourage, and show them the dark side hehe. As far as the story, Anakin, I don't blame you. Great film, a must see if you're a star wars fan, or even a sci-fi fan."
3457,10,Great job Lucas!!!,"I love Star Wars III, and I really think it connected all 6 Star Wars perfectly. I have heard that people are probing George to make Star Wars 7, 8, and 9. I hope this is true, yet I believe that Star Wars is also fine just the way it is. I also feel that Hayden did Wonderful on his acting, and he made the movie what it is. Natalie and him seem like they would be a cute couple. They fit each other, and I know Hayden likes shorter girls. It is amazing how Perfect Lucas pulled of adding three more Star Wars. No other director could have done that. I believe that the force is strong with him. :). My favorite star wars is I and III and 6. Not that I have anything against II, 4,and 5 but it seems the most crucial to the story is 1 and 3, and six too. I love Ewan's acting too. Natalie doesn't have much that she gets too say, but she is wonderful, especially in the pretty yellow/pink dress she wears in II."
3458,8,One of the Best Sci-Fi Films Ever!!!,"I like Revenge of the Sith because it has the most action besides the fight above and on Endor during Return of the Jedi, the scenes involving the Chancellor and the Clones betraying the Jedi was shocking, and when the chancellor, who is actually Darth Sidious, sends Anakin, his new apprentice, to kill the Separatists, which was just as shocking, the movie also has epic fight scenes, such as between Anakin and Obi-Wan, Grievous and Obi-Wan, Yoda and Sidious and the battle on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk My favourite Star Wars character has to be Plo Koon, who was blown up in his starship I recommend you watch The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones first!"
3459,10,Haunting,Awesome! A haunting tragic story with great action! It's a story we all grew up with - it explains it all -- how very cool over 30 years. I LOVED IT!!! Growing up with Star Wars I was never all that keen on DV - the rogue Han Solo was more my taste. But now? Anakin/Darth Vader is such a compelling character. I'm just in love with him! Great Job Mr. Lucas!! PS - I do wish there were a couple more scenes showing the hows & whys of the closeness of the relationship b/w Anakin & Palapatine - it would have been a little more believable that Anakin bought the line about saving Padme. - however that would've added another 10 minutes of non-action dialogue.
3460,9,a very good movie,"i was quite annoyed by the 2 bitches sitting to the side of me who were chatting away when the movie started. however, the movie was really absorbing and the chatters from them two became a distant rambling."
3461,10,STAR WARS Episode III REVENGE OF THE SITH is the best movie ever!!!!,"If you like this movie, then read this comment! If not, then please do not read this comment. If you found it helpful, please contact me and tell me how helpful it was. This movie was the best in the history of movies!!!!!! Also, all the STAR WARS movies are the best but STAR WARS Episode III REVENGE OF THE SITH beats them all!!!!!!! For those who have not seen it, it is a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!! No movie can beat this one!!! No director has or ever will make a movie better than George Lucas!!!! Special thanks to George Lucas for making these movies, especially Episode III!!!! He has inspired me to create my own STAR WARS style script and movie! Once again, THANK YOU Mr. GEORGE LUCAS!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way, my favorite characters are: all of them. If you have not seen it, then get some tickets and go see it!!! ""Remember, the Force will be with you. ALWAYS.""- Sir Alec Guinness (19??-2000) as Obi Wan Kenobi in STAR WARS Episode IV A NEW HOPE"
3462,1,CRAP CRAP CRAP...need i say more?,This film is the Epitome of s**t. 
3463,10,Simple the Best,"Revenge of the Sith is simple the best it may overtake Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back after a few more viewings, the movie has action, drama, comedy, love and betrayal there's loads to see and on first viewing I was a little overwhelmed as a fan but for the casual viewer it might not be as bad. when I heard there was going to be so many Lightsaber duels in the movie I was worried but there was no need to be because all the duels are great and are different as well, I was also pleased to see some of the clone wars which of course show off the brilliance of ILM with the best CGI I've seen in a long time. Revenge of the Sith is very Dark at times but that's needed to tell the story of Anakin's turn to the Darkside but for kids I think most can handle it. so are there any bad points not really other then some dodge dialogue which there's very little of but Star Wars isn't Shakespeare so overall this movie is great and a must see for everyone."
3464,9,"Good movie overall, worth seeing","Although the movie has clear continuity problems (Sith/Jedi powers to move objects are sometimes available, sometimes not), overall this is a good movie. I especially liked the psychological war Jedi vs Sith. Good versus Evil at its best, and maybe one of the few movies to unveil and back up both parts of the war, showing their motives and even in a way leading us to sustain the negative character (Anakin). A bit of a mind breaker in a way, if love can lead you to the dark side. Do not miss this movie especially if you saw the other 5 parts (even if you may have not liked them). Seeing how things developed to be so bad as they were at the beginning of part 4 is quite heart breaking, starting from a pretty normal situation (as it was at the beginning of part 1). This is, I think, a lesson for real life democracies."
3465,10,You ARE the chosen one!,"The Saga is complete. Yes, yes it is, after fans watching, some in horror, some in glee, the past two Star Wars films the series was set to come to a close, with the biggest suspense building, how did Anakin Skywalker, the young, powerful Jedi become a fully armoured Darth Vader? Episode III Revenge of the Sith held the answer, and it did not drone out the reason, but delivered it in a brilliant film, worthy of the Star Wars title."
3466,,It was such a sad movie....,"The way Anakin falls, Padmé's death, the babies relocation, the death of the Jedi. Everything seems to come together. It saddened me so much to see Anakin break Padmé's heart the way he did. Obi Wan's speech at the end was so heartfelt. Anakin (Darth Vader) does brings balance to the force when he kills Sidious in the end. All in all everything was superb. But if you need to know... Sidious' Master just HAD to be Anakin's father. (No other way;-) )"
3467,10,WHY?!! **spoilers**,"Look I liked Revenge of the Sith, but why, dear god, why did the birth of Darth Vader have to be so lame? I mean, when he first breaks off of the ""operating table"" after he turned into Darth Vader, and after he heard about Padme, he yelled the lamest thing possible, the all too common melodramatic: ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" For me it made the movie much worse, although I believe George Lucas redeemed himself for two crappy prequels, and I really enjoyed this film, the whole NOOOOOO! thing just stained the movie for me in some way. And although I'd like to believe that's my only problem with the movie, I wasn't a huge fan of the dialogue, I'll admit it was much, MUCH, better than the previous prequels, it was still bad. "
3468,10,That was the best movie,"I think that was the best Star Wars movie I have seen so far. I liked the other movies too, though. I am a big Star Wars fan, and I can't wait till I can see it again. My best friend is also a big fan. Whenever we are hanging out, if we see anything of Star Wars, we have to look at it. I have every Star Wars movie that is on Video. I heard you were planning to make Episodes 7, 8, and 9. I hope you do. I want to see more!!!! I think you did a great job with this movie!!!!! I saw another movie with Natalie Portman and she is definitely my favorite actress. I love Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGreggor in this movie!! Those 3 are my favorite characters!!! I hope that movie comes to DVD or VHS soon! I really want to see it again."
3469,7,Revenge of the Sith (ROTS) is a movie of two halves,"Revenge of the Sith (ROTS) is a movie of two halves, the first is scattered with poor performances and terrible dialogue, while the second is much improved, with some real character and emotion coming to the fore. Still, there is nothing in this movie that comes close to Luke's anguish at finding out who his father is in Empire Strikes Back. There's also nothing in this movie that comes close to creating the sense of joy that accompanies Han Solo's return to the fray at the end of A New Hope or the sadness you feel for the Ewok's in Return of the Jedi."
3470,8,Lucas redeemed . . . somewhat.,Did it live up to the hype? Has George Lucas redeemed himself for the atrocities known as The Phantom Menace and The Clone Wars? Did it really tie up the loose ends? Read this review to find out.
3471,10,Greatest Action/ Romance Movie seen in years,"I have been a big Star Wars film for awhile, and I have enjoyed Episodes One and Two but both were missing something big; the heart of the film. This movie is the best of the first three, keeping good action but it also has a heartfelt plot; Anakin is not sure if the dark side is the right or wrong side, but is convinced by Palphatine that he can save those he loves if he joins the Sith. In the end of the film, a visually amazing fight scene occurs between Anakin and Obi Wan, which results in Anakin becoming wounded and fully transforming to the dark side. The film was visually amazing the whole way through, you felt the connection between all the characters, and the dark theme provided a new experience for star wars fans. Even if you don't like star wars, this film cant be missed."
3472,,"Scenic, dashing, vibrant... but not like the Star Wars.","The first fifteen minutes of the movie it seems to me it's a Star Wars parody. It's too fast, too simple, too scratchy. I'm waited some better from George Lucas. Some classic and perfect Star Wars story. But it wasn't that. I'm sorry this, because I have seen all episodes, and the first three episode - I think - to gone wrong. Probable, I'm waited more? Because when I've seen at first time the Star Wars (in 1982 - I was twelve), then it was our first real miracle!? We was Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader by all summer, year by year, and we waited the next episode. So I think we didn't trust any continuation, because there was begin and end of this episode. Of course, it is a good movie, it's uncontroverted. I like the Star Wars, before and I like in the future. Or it is the future? Or it is the past? Or it is just simple the Star Wars? Yes! It is!"
3473,7,Parts better than the whole,"The beginning battle and fights scenes are good. But the first third of the film up until the first act turning point is weak and closer to Episode II or I. After that when Anakin begins to 'turn' it starts to get good. However, the stronger tragic parts (where I actually felt some swelling of real emotion for the first time in these new episodes) are let down by the weaker parts. Plus, the ending doesn't feel conclusive enough - the film just ends. Empire manages to avoid this problem by building up to the conclusion better but still leaving just enough pieces hanging and unanswered questions (such as is Darth Vader 'really' Luke's father? and how will they rescue Han Solo and the love story turn out?). "
3474,9,Anyone else catch this?,"As Anakin and Obi-Wan take the shuttle to the Jedi temple, in the VERY bottom of the screen flying out of a docking bay is a YT-1300 (same model as the falcon, COULD be the same one)"
3475,9,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that the last Star Wars was much more emotional than ones past, or any of them for that matter. It was much more light-hearted at times, I even gut-laughed a couple of times. I was also surprised to be overwhelmed with emotion at times. This movie had much more serious subject matter at times, but still managed to not be too serious (which plagued the previous episodes). Absolutely loved this one, the only reason I didn't give it 10 stars ...awkward dialogue...mostly due to the writing and the fact that Hayden Christenson is not a very good actor (although they did their research to find someone that would resemble Luke)...But overall...pleasantly surprised...:)"
3476,8,Review of Star Wars Revenge of the sith,"Star Wars episode three: Revenge of the Sith is bigger and better than the previous two Star Wars movies, with breathtaking battles, tragic tear-jerking moments, grim and gore and a little comedy to bring together the story of Anakin's journey to the Dark Side. Prepare for the movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of the Vader suit appearing on the big screen once more."
3477,7,"Good movie, not the best","I watched this movie on opening weekend. I enjoyed it a lot, but I guess I must think differently from most Star Wars fans. Those I talk to seem to have a great love for the movie I liked least, which was ""The Empire Strikes Back"". I liked Episode I and I loved Episode 2, which was and is my favorite. This probably comes from my Political Science background."
3478,10,"Misread, may have been","It was with extreme apprehension that I entered into the world of George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Episode I left me brutally scarred; Episode II, disappointed but hopeful of a brighter future. I had faith that Lucas would pull through for this one."
3479,10,Looking Back on SW,"I love star wars. They are my favorite films of all time, and yes even the PT. what some people seem to forget is that star wars was sprung from afternoon serials like Flash gordon we fantastic happened every day at five. and star wars was just that, only it was fifty percent more, and mind blowing. The PT had their share of faults, but come on, can you really judge lucas? He made a great trilogy, and then he made a slightly, in my mind very slightly lesser trilogy. The OT was fantastic, just how can you defeat it? lucas made the goddamn thing and there are still people pissing on his doorstep for the PT even when he made the OT just the same. These are great films. they are films of vision, they may not be ""important"" films, but to some they are, so quit your nagging. As per revenge, it was exceptional, AS USUAL IN STAR WARS, the thing was just so damn tragic and beautiful, it was wonderful and the most part, it was more star wars. it was more of that galaxy far far away that we grew up in. and hell, all of you whining supposed super fans, you try to build a pop culture phenomenon and live to tell the tale. George lucas, for those who love both PT and OT, we salute you!"
3480,9,"As good as Star Wars ANH? Not quite, but still great","The expectations for this movie were sky high, not just for casual Star Wars fans like myself, but for the many Star Wars freaks who have been so disappointed over the past few years with episodes 1 and 2. I will say that this movie does not disappoint....too much."
3481,10,Episode III was the best one of all.,"I am a big fan of Star Wars, I have been watching it since I was little. I watched Episode I and II in theaters and recently watched Episode III. It was definitely the most emotional and most intense Star Wars I have ever watched. The way it captured the original elements of the movies, but somehow escaped that boundary by putting a more emotional theme. By building a sense of relationship with these characters, you feel for them like you know what they're going through, such as everyday problems with life and love.The climax of the movie was the final battle, especially in the end there was so much intensity when the battle was over and the Vadar mask was put on. I nearly went into tears when that happened and realized it was all over."
3482,9,Guess who's back... back again...,"Amazing. Truly amazing. The FX were awesome, all the questions(almost all, anyway) were answered, and we got to see him again: The D-man. Yep, Darth Vader."
3483,9,22 years was worth the wait for a pre-quel worthy of the name!,"(WARNING - SP0ILERS CONTAINED) There is a lot to like about this film, certainly those looking for special effects and lighting fast, intricately choreographed fight scenes will be blown out of their seat. This film is hands down the most visually stunning work to ever hit the big screen (if this indeed the curtain on the franchise, Mr. Lucas left nothing back in the barn). As great as all that was, what makes this film great are its re-capturing of the soul of the original trilogy. Once again we have the compelling characters, riveting story line, and inspired performances that the previous 2 efforts so sorely lacked. True, this one being so closely linked timewise to the original picture provided a frame of reference that made it much easier for the fan to throw himself into, but it took more than that to re-capture the original magic, which this film clearly was successful in achieving."
3484,9,See movie before reading this!,"Ah, the special effects. Ah, the magic of John Williams' score. Ah, the brilliant and intense hairstyles on Padme, what a hairdresser she has in addition to her interior designer...was her makeup artist out sick this week? "
3485,10,One of the best movies ever made,Revenge of the Sith is probably one of the best films ever made.
3486,9,A good ending to a great series,I am a die-hard Star WArs fan and after being disappointed with Attack of the Clones I was a little worried about this one. But my worries were not needed. Revenge of the Sith brings a good closing to the story of Anakin Skywalker and the birth of Darth Vader.
3487,6,So Much Potential,"This movie blew away the first two, no question about that. I also greatly enjoyed it."
3488,8,Noticed,"I've noticed that women in general liked the movie more than men. I think women liked that there was more of a love story in there than the other ones. I also thought it was a great movie, however it can not surpass the IV V and VI. It was also much better than I and II. The first one was horrible and the second was good but didn't give me the feeling of ""Star Wars"". There wasn't any Jedi on Sith action and that doesn't feel like ""Star Wars."" That's why this one was so good, it had those epic fights they wanted to put in the episode II but it still had the saber fights and lots of them. The two trilogies were connected by III and it was nice to see some familiar faces."
3489,10,Revenge of the Sith,"This is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen. George Lucas is a freaking genius. This movie answered a lot of questions and connected the prequels and the originals very well. Every one said that Hayden Christensens acting in Clones sucked, but he totally redeemed himself in this one, he did an awesome job in Sith, which is the movie he was actually hired for. Natalie Portman acting was not so great, but the movie made up for that with the lack of lines for her and everything else that went on in the movie. I have also decided that one of the major reasons that the movie is so great, is because Jar Jar said a grand total of 2 words, and they were said so subtly that most of us didn't hear them. This is the greatest movie made since Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980."
3490,10,Thrilling Movie,"it's just perfect, well maybe there are some point that are not that good, but the global movie is great , it thrills you, you want to know where darth vader comes from, you see how the movies, the trilogies come together, you feel the story, it's such a big drama....the good turns bad, you feel sad for him because you think about his life without happening all this mess, how happy he would be if any of that happen ( his move to the dark side). It has a few moments that are amazing, the dialogues, the images, everything, they are very intense. Besides of the spectacular visual effects, i've never seen so far a movie with such quality in the digital shoots, perfectly done that helps the story to be more exciting than any other star wars film 10 out of 10."
3491,10,Great action sequences combined with a great story,"The final piece to the Star Wars trilogy couldn't have come out any better. George Lucas went all out on this movie to create a good amount of action combined with many other great scenes which basically showed the Palpatine's/Emperor's final part of his plan coming together. For those who have not watched this movie, a evil leader who has been plotting for years comes to power by means of deception, corruption, and betrayal. "
3492,10,Bring the Violence! (Spoiler free),"There are and will be so many reviews on here, I will just write this spoiler free and straight to the topic of my interest. Lots of living creatures DIE!! That's all I asked for and my wish was granted. I was getting so sick of droid only deaths because Lucas wanted to cater to young people as well as adults. I was 10 when ""Jedi"" came out and I remember being bummed when those two ewoks were running and got blasted and one died. However, that ""kept it real"" because in war, living things die. The new Star Wars movies were becoming the A-Team and GI Joe cartoons, where there were tons of battles, lots of shooting and no one dies.(Gungans don't count) Bah Humbug! Georgie Boy comes through, FINALLY. I promised to make this spoiler free, so i will stop, but know this...DEATH, DESTRUCTION and EVIL are very present in this film! ""Thank the Maker!"""
3493,9,Fan Review,"I must say that I pity any Star Wars fan who does not like this film. It is fantastic! 'Revenge of the Sith' is such a huge improvement from 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' it is unreal. The dialogue is much less formal and more natural, with no Shakespearian atrocities such as, ""I am haunted by the kiss you should never have given me"". This really does feel like the Star Wars film we dedicated fans have been waiting for. "
3494,6,so done,"The most I can rate this movie is 6.5 stars, and I know every Star Wars fan will yell at me, but let's break this movie down:<br /><br />There were really good special effects and some nice scenes, but the thing was that it just lacked plot. <br /><br />The acting wasn't so good, for one thing. There were way too many and way too long fights. Likewise, the characters were nowhere near likeable and the plot is a bit too predictable. (Not at the beginning, I mean when Anakin first starts meeting Palpatine.) There's also somewhat of a lack of common sense. Jango Fett intelligent but his clones the biggest, most gullible dumbasses? One jedi manages to defeat Sidious but 3 of equal ranks failing? A cyborg that survived so much dying from a simple blaster shot? Somebody surviving being BURNT ALIVE TO A CRISP, and Obi-Wan apparently sympathizing Anakin but not bothering to put him out of his misery? And Padme still in love after Anakin behaves like a completely mentally high douchebag, and managing to give birth while frigging DEAD? ARE YOU KIDDING IM SO DONE"
3495,10,"Revenge of the Sith is not as good as the originals, but the best story wise","I went to see it at 12:03am last night, and I must say, I thought I knew what I going to see in the film and man was I wrong, it was just flat out UNBELIEVABLE! what an amazing way to sum up what took almost 30 years to tell, I have never been so surprised, and so blown away by a film in my life, and I can tell you people right now that this film belongs in the IMDb's top 250 and I know it will get up there, and George Lucas in my opinion proved without a doubt that he is an amazing Storyteller... And I wasn't all impressed with Hayden Christensen in Attack of the Clones, but he stepped up in this one, I truly think this film is what people will remember as Hayden's most memorable role... I lost count of how many times as I watched the film that I remember feeling so glad that finally I am learning the story, but at the same time I wanted more, kind of greedy.. lol, I have been a Star wars fan since I was 3, and I celebrated my 23rd birthday on St. Patrick's Day this year, and last night one of the things I wanted to live to see, I saw, and I have never been so thrilled and excited to see such a memorable and without question, AWESOME piece of film-making... Lucas, may God Bless You and thanks for the amazing memories!"
3496,9,Wow,Here's my opinion: This was way better than Episodes 1 and 2.
3497,4,I guess that was the best they could do...,"Well the movie started off more humour than any of the others but then its stopped real quick. The love story in was so dull I can't see how Natalie portman decided to be part of this. The random battles and take longer than needed but the transformation to Vader was the biggest let don't with mace about to finish the lord sith the ""weak"" lord sith WITH LIGHTING COMING OUT OF HIS HANDS begs for anikin to save him for hes is weaking.yet this is the man who is to show him the powers of the dark side but hes to weak to kill mace windu. and how anikin gains the name Vader is just dumb I shall call you LORD VADER, RISE how do you come to the name lord Vader i mean stupid no story to the name or anything. the last battle is OK to watch but you have no real feel for any of the characters. Yoda gives up like in a split second to hide. Vader and obi wan fight for a while and talking how they were brothers etc but it wasn't moving. Then padme dies of a broken heart, The parts that i hated the most were the cop outs:"
3498,6,"surprisingly great , fans will not be disappointed","after years of waiting, the final episode in the great star wars saga finally arrives and what an arrival it makes. being a large fan of the older trilogy and not very fond of the prequels I wasn't sure on the direction revenge of the Sith would take."
3499,10,Brilliant,"come on the dark side. Nice star fighter Anakin!A brilliant movie. Star wars is a great movie that everyone can enjoy. I hate their taste in aliens, though. Anakin rules! Yoda drools! Darth Sidius is SSSSSOOOO ugly! This movie is the best out of the series. Love scenes... Okay, not the best but the fights make up for it EASILY. Sidious = ruthless I mean he told Anakin to cut Dookos head off and Dooko was his apprentice. Surely he could have two, break a few rules. Now Yoda... from a daft old (Really old) bat to a fighting acrobat! HOW? General greivous with four arms cool! Some questions by lots of people. Star wars is a strange but fantastic."
3500,7,Terrible acting but sums everything up well!,"The first hour or so of this movie isn't very exciting at all. A lot of terrible, corny acting throughout the entire movie. Great Lords of the Darkside being defeated like nothing. The movie was missing suspense. Though it does have some really cool effects and shows a lot of new cool ships and people. A lot of unexpected stuff. It seems like the movie was just thrown together. I think Lucas might have lost his enthusiasm in the last three. If you are a Star Wars fan I suggest you go and see this movie. It will answer all of your questions you have. If this movie was properly done, it would've been about 5 or 6 hours long, and you can't really expect that. If this movie didn't explain so much about all the other movies and put all the pieces of the puzzle together I would have rated it about a 3."
3501,8,Star Wars Ep3,"Excellent film. The space space battle at the beginning was fantastic. The fight between Dooku and Anakin was Great. The ""Invisible Hand's"" crash was stunning. Obi-Wans and Grievous was fantastic. The death of Mace Windu was surprising. Anakin killing the ""Youngling"" was sad and a bit sick. The Effects of order 64 was incredible. The fight between Yoda and Sidious was different and a bit funny. Obi-Wans and Anakin's Dual was the BEST movie scene I have ever seen and would like to see it without the Yoda fight during it. The death of Padmi was extremely sad. The special effects, music and story where fantastic and a worth addition to the Star Wars saga. But there were several things that annoyed me. I expected A lot more from Grievous and the love scenes dragged on to much but they where not as bad as the ones in ""Attack of the Clones"", Obi-Wans puns where Really BAD and Yoda's backwards talk relay annoyed me near the end. I also noticed a few things, 1: they liked cutting of peoples arms e.g. Mace Windu's, Anakin's and Dooku's, 2: Padme can run well for some one who's over 6 months pregnant and finally sticking with Padme her pump grew and shrank A lot. Even With these few bad things the movie was one of the best I've ever seen."
3502,5,"The Masses are Satisfied, the Fans - Disappointed.","Before coming to the movie theater, I decided to watch the last two episodes (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones) to be in sync with what's going on (yes I'm a Star Wars fan-not a fanatic, but respectful of the series). When I came to the theater, I was filled with great expectations for the final episode which would end the great saga-The Revenge of the Sith. Unfortuantly, after coming out of the theater, I felt disappointed not in the movie, but in myself that I held such high expectations for the movie. I don't know why, George Lucas decided to realize this movie with a motive of satisfying the greater masses, rather than his (I would think so) own dream of making the last episode, the most emotional and memorable of all. There was a lack of building up towards the fight scenes, no emotional release during the battles (because there was no emotion-no catharsis), which I enjoyed so much earlier(Episodes 2,4,5,6)."
3503,5,Where were all the British Guys that were in the first 3 Star Wars??,"Every character that had anything to do with the Death Star and the Empire in the first three movies were British actors (Which was awesome) It gave an air of upper class superiority to the Empire. ""Don't frighten us with your sorcerer's ways Lord Vader"" and ""You rebel Scum!"" In the last 3 prequels all the characters associated with the Empire were ridiculous looking CGI aliens and puppets. Like those locust looking aliens who were building the Death star in episode 2 or all those freaks in the senate. I'd rather have Peter Cushing than some weird looking CGI creation. I wanted snotty British actors playing the villains in all these prequels and was sorely disappointed that even in the last movie, ROTS, we only get a two second look at Grand Moff Tarkin. Where is the transition between this and when Tarking gets the cojones to say ""VADER, RELEASE HIM!!!!"""
3504,10,4th Best Star Wars!,"As much as i would like to give Episode III a full 10 stars i just can't. The movie was amazing but in my mind a ten merits no if's and's or but's about the movie and there was a but, the emperor. That and they let me down on the fact that i thought the dark side followers are resilient warriors who don't give an inch but the emperor was begging to live. Just a bit disappointing. I mean come on its the emperor the Dark Lord. Other than that this movie rocked my world and its a sad day that no more new star wars movies are coming out. But it was a heck of a way to end it. The fx were just mind blowing esp. the opening sequence and the characters, vibrant, lively, and wholly enjoyable. Its superb! *********"
3505,10,Major milestone in Star Wars saga,"This movie wares the term ""movie"" rightfully: It truly moves the viewer. And in a wonderful and exciting way it ties all the loose ends in the saga and bind them together to a harmonic whole structure. ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" describes the path to the dark side and at the same time the way (and perverted art) of political manipulation and manipulation as such, represented by Chancellor Palpatine (played by Ian McDiarmid). Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) see through Palpatines motives and recognize him as Darth Sidious. He passes the knowledge on to Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the knowledge spreads to Master Yoda (voice by Frank Oz) and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). Yet Anakin indulges himself to go down the path of the dark side in order to save his wife Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) from dying. She is pregnant with their first child and Anakin has in nightmares similar to the ones he had when his mother Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August) died some years earlier ( see Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones) seen that Padmé will die when she gives birth to their child. But this is but one of many facets in this colossal filmed mosaic. Go and see it, and watch the other five ones in the saga as well. If you do so you might find that Anakin Skywalker is not only the axis of the saga, but at the same time he is a Faust figure. Like Faust he represents the modern human being who confronted with overwhelmingly obstacles - here in Episode III the possibility of an early death of the love of his life Padmé Amidala - turns to seductive and destructive mental tools and the possibilities connected therewith. In this context it is the dark side of the force which leads to selfishness and black magic, as it is later shown in Episode IV and V where Darth Vader kills an Admiral through the skills of the dark side of the force. In Goethes 'Faust' John George Faust is redeemed through that he never is satisfied with the circumstances of his life even into the moment of his death. Therefore Satan loses his bet with God and Faust can die with peace because his lust for life and his curiosity towards life itself never stops. His devotion to never stop learning and to continue to ask crucial questions to everything that surrounds him and the situation of his life saves him. Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader is redeemed through the help of others. He is redeemed and saved through the love and trust of his yet unborn son Luke, and beyond his death is forgiven by Leia (see Episode VI) but that is another story. Conclusion? Episode III is a 'must' to see together with the other episodes!"
3506,6,Only for SW fans - non fans will HATE it,"Special Effects/Scenery/Costumes - Grade: 9 Lucas Arts has always been tops in these areas. The effects and scenery are gorgeous as always, and what you would expect from any SW film. I deducted a point however for two reasons. First, the scenes are reused over and over in this movie, some even being borrowed from previous films. Also, some of the costumes are obviously a ""guy in a costume"" quality. That is OK though, as it fits in with the costume design throughout the series."
3507,,George Lucas's vision realized,"Many people I've talked to say ROTS is the best of the Star Wars films, and with good reason. Besides successfully bridging the prequels with the original trilogy, it has a fulfilling plot with fantastic imagery. Die hard fans will feel the ultimate suspense of witnessing Anakin Skywalker spiral towards his terrible, inevitable fate. Memorable performances by Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, and a particularly sublime, slimy Chancellor Palpatine by Ian McDiarmid. If not the best Star Wars, then the most emotional and empathic of the Trilogies. Throw in inspiration from The Godfather, contemporary reference, and John William's most haunting soundtrack since Schindler's List, and you get Lucas's masterpiece."
3508,8,Episodes 7-9,"George can't do any better than this film. The film's great for many reasons, but could have been soooo much better. George just isn't a good director. The horrible writing in certain scenes is almost unbearable, especially compared to the poetic nature of the first trilogy. People are just so hungry to see something different in theaters after the previous 2 episodes that they jump for joy that this film has something other than pure trash in it. Don't get me wrong, this film is epic, but ""Star Wars"" deserves more. Hopefully Mr. Lucas will let go of his ego and allow other, more talented directors to bring the fabled episodes 7-9 to life. We can only hope..."
3509,10,Get ready to be blown away,From the second the film starts you are drawn in till the very last frame. As soon as the film finished I wanted to watch Episode IV and did. Finally the story is complete just wish there were more really. Ow and the effects ain't half bad.
3510,7,Wasn't to impressed.,"This movie was better than the second, but way to predictable. Growing up a Star Wars fan I was excited when the production of Episodes I, II, and III were starting. When I saw this movie on the 22, I was disappointed in Mr. Lucas. There was a lot more action then Episode II, but they were way to predictable. In Episode I Mr. Lucas did a GREAT job keeping us on our seats wanting to know what happens next. But in Revenge of the Sith, we knew everything, I actually dosed off a couple of times. If someone asked me to see it with them again, I would, just as long as I'm not paying for it. I believe it was a waste of six bucks and should've waited to see it when it came either to the dollar theater or on DVD. Another plus about this movie is that Hayden Christensen did his best job of acting in this movie, no offense to the kid or anything, I watched Hayden ""grow"" from his TV series ""Higher Ground"" and he has definitely improved. The graphics were a lot better and it was quite a bit more ""realistic""."
3511,3,Its just a bad movie overall,"OK first i should establish that I'm huge star wars fan and I've disliked they last 2 star wars movies George Lucas has made, and I still think this one is bad too. I will give it to Lucas that this movie has a great story and it ties well with the original movies except for few plot holes. But this movie has so many other problems that the story doesn't even matter. First off the dialogue in this movie is absolutely horrible. I mean it is really bad so parts its seems almost unbearable. Second who hired these actors they all pretty much are terrible except for Ewan McGregor who is still not that good but definitely outshines all the other actors. Finally the fight scenes are either way too long and boring or short and badly done. So overall this is no comparison to the originals but its is slightly better than the last too."
3512,10,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,"I personally just watched the SW movies this years, so unlike many fans, I don't have childhood blindness or anything. I watched the movies (in their 2004 edition and in this order: 1 to 6; which makes more sense) and I obviously adore STAR WARS now, thanks to the PT. Had I watched only episodes 4-6, I probably would've hated it. Because Luke is just like Sora from KH a wimpy character who becomes a hero *not that I hate Luke or anything, nevertheless, just like EVERYTHING in episodes 4-6, it's already been remade in other shows/movies too many times over the years*. Plus, I loathe the character of Leia, and I wished GL didn't have to make overly victimized (her planet is gone, her father is the evil, blah-blah-blah, no thanks that does not appeal to me as woman). Plus she showed more emotions to her crush being taken than the annihilation of her home planet –WTAF?– and her character didn't even have to be a Skywalker, it was a last minute thought on GL, so why couldn't you let that thought sink and never look at it again!!? :/ Anyway, I prefer the PT over the OT, gasp all you want, but in the PT we had actual story, real battles, and emotions people, EMOTIONS!!! Now, I'm not saying the PT are perfect –heh, hardly– there is that one thing that I'll never respect GL for: R****m, which I believe it harder in AOTC than any of the other movies."
3513,8,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith (Review for all ages),What a movie. I saw it and will see it again for those of you who are wondering what to think about the hype. Its a great movie. 
3514,2,Don't WASTE your time,"If you really want to WASTE your time go back and watch the second installment of this testament to bad acting, bad writing and bad directing (Lucas maybe you should just lay around on your ranch all day instead of wasting everyone else's time). Am I disappointed? You bet. I thought it would at least boost up my disappoint after Episode II, but alas no such luck. There was one thing that was at least consistent throughout all three new films, and that is the bad acting and writing. Without the success of the original three films, these would all have been thrown away. It's a good thing that those were made first. Lucas writes great stories and has some incredible concepts but when it comes to scripting them, he needs help. I do appreciate the effort, but it goes without saying that if you can't write, get someone else to write it for you. Am I a fan of the original films? Yes I am. But did that have an effect on how I viewed these? No it didn't. They are just altogether bad films."
3515,8,Gravity,"When in free space, there is no gravity. However space ships seem to have gravity, otherwise no one would stick to the deck. Therefore, to stick to the deck there must be artificial gravity that pulls you to the deck. My question is this, if the space ship rotates 90 Degrees, so that its stern is pointing down and bow pointing up, would every one slide down the deck? Answers on a past card please... :-p Other than that, I enjoyed the film. OK the script was a bit dodgy in places and everyone laughed when vader took his first breath but hey, this is comic book stuff. I must say the lighting seemed a bit dim, maybe it was my cinema."
3516,10,Great Star Wars movie,"Possible minor spoilers. (nothing anyone shouldn't know before hand) Wow, what can you say? This was a great way for Lucas to wrap up the prequel trilogy. Great story, great special effects (who would have doubted that?) and out of the three some pretty decent acting (at least I thought). It was great. I loved it. I saw it at midnight and I'm seeing it again today."
3517,8,Spectacular but Anakin is not given enough motive to turn,"ROTS is spectacular and of course irresistible for any lifelong Star Wars fan. I became a huge Hayden fan on his debut in AOTC, which I loved for its romantic plot line. For me it was close to a modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, two young lovers whose love is forbidden by circumstances beyond their control.(I was shocked to see so many here who are so critical of AOTC.) But. This movie totally fell apart for me when Anakin turns to the dark side. He is not given enough motive to make this pretty sudden, totally complete turn to the dark side. Padme should have died first, and in some fashion it should have been because of the Jedi-----whether by something they did do, or something they failed to do."
3518,8,redeems the 2 before it but still has a few problems,"This movie was definitely better than episode 1 and 2 nowhere near as good dialogue wise to episodes 4-6, the special effects for this movie were amazing and Lucas really did make the connection between the 3rd and 4th movie. here are the pros and cons."
3519,10,The best film of the series!,"I can not believe how incredibly good this film is. Better than Empire even. There was not one moment that I was not totally 100% into. Even the romance was well delivered. The acting, the script, everything was the best of all the films. I cant believe Hayden is being criticized again. I can understand the reviews of his performance for Attack of the Clones, but in this one he is simply awesome. My only criticism was the quick demise of Dooku. I wanted more banter from him before his end. Watching Palpatine fry was the highlight, closely followed by ""the duel"" and the battle of Kashyyk. Yoda was a triumph (his affinity with the Wookies was truly heartwarming). Artoo is in rare form. And Vader, I felt soooo sorry for him. ""Noooooo"" I chocked back a tear, it all felt so claustrophobic under that armor. Ewan was superb and Ian McDiarmid really is the Emporer. I cant fault this film after the first viewing and I am confident it will stand the test of time here after. Well done George, you nailed it!"
3520,7,Movie Review and Sith Pin,HI: The concept of the movie was fantastic but I have never seen such horrible acting. Poor Hayden and Natalie were just awful. I have seen Hayden's other movies and I know he is capable of way more than this. Did Lucas make them terrible on purpose. Even Samuel Jackson was awful.
3521,10,The Star Wars Epic,The Star Wars Epic: A review of STAR WARS
3522,9,Best of the recent movies,"""This is ho democracy dies, to thunderous applause!"" These words were still with me after exiting the theater where I had just seen Revenge of the Sith. When George Lucas had said he would be releasing the back story of Anakin Skywaler, I was a little leery about how it would work. After Episode I, I was ready to write the new Trilogy off. Fast forward to 2005 and we see the results of Lucas's hard work. Episode III made even some of the older films (dare I say it) look bad. Pure and simple George Lucas does an excellent job showing Vader/Skywalker's fall from grace not out of rage but misguided love. The same love that Drives him to the Darkside is the same love that he eventually kills by turning. Padme loses all will to live. And thus is born the greatest (arguablly) villain ever."
3523,9,bad reviews for this film stink! ignore them!,"after i saw rots i got home and watched 4,5 and 6. A bowl of cereal and 10 cokes later i thought to myself why the hell did i do that?...i'll tell you why, rots kicked ass! a good analogy my friends, hold out your hand and you have 5 fingers, each finger representing 1 of the 5 previous star wars films... but after rots you may now clench your hand into a fist, a fist to represent the now complete star wars saga.The film does not deserve any crap thrown at it, its good, how good compared with the others is up to you!.. but i tell you this much, star wars has been the best film at my cinema all year, i challenge the ""bad review skunks"" to go into a cinema right now and find me a better more entertaining film, in the good old days anyone rating this film 1 would have been shot. I'm not going to talk about the plot, script, acting, smell or whatever because that decision is yours and i cant make your decisions for you, but if your reading these comments..fighting with yourself whether or not to go see it because of the negative reviews and pondering whether its makes you a geek to spend money and sit in a big room with complete strangers watching a star wars movie, i say go see it because its better then anything else out right now and if your worried about being labelled a geek take a leaf out of Darth's book and get yourself a cloak!"
3524,9,What a Drama!,** SOME SPOILERS AHEAD **
3525,10,An Epic Ending,"What an end to the best saga of all time. Everything about it was good except for the laugh out loud dialogue between Anakin and Padme. Although that was hard to watch, it quickly redeemed itself with the fantastic story, special effects, action scenes, and the last 45 minutes of the movie. I went to the midnight showing in Milwaukee and the crowd couldn't get enough Yoda. But everything he did was worth cheering for especially when he enters in Palpatine's office.(the Red Guards) Ewan McGregors acting was terrific and Hayden played Anikan very good and very dark. This will stay as my second favorite Star Wars movie, right behind ""The Empire Strikes Back."" This movie had funny parts that didn't include stupidity like Jar Jar, like R2's tangle with the Super Battle Droids. Anyways check it out because you will not be disappointed!"
3526,6,My take on star wars revenge of the sith.,So farewell to star wars. This is the third film in the six part star wars series and fills in all the loose ends that had been created by the previous 2 episodes.
3527,10,words cant express how .....,Really words can't express how much I love this movie I was really on the edge of my seat when I saw this movie and it also brought down a tear to my eyes I have been a star wars fan all my life Episode III brought it home all the way it was like a missing piece put in If you haven't seen the movie go see it after you read this I really really advise you too best movie of the year for me second would probably be war of the worlds ...... Back to the movie of what I was saying my grandfather went with me to watch star wars he even loved it now he wants to see all the episodes the movie is great i would give it 10 thumbs up if I had 10 thumbs .....
3528,10,Best Movie of All TIME!!!!,"Being a huge star wars fan, I can say from experience that this is by far the best Star Wars movie to date. I really don't know how some people can trash this movie so much. It has everything, action, drama, etc. The transformation from Anikin to Vader was perfect, and easy to understand also. The Padme story was carefully executed and perfectly done. And i can say that the battle scenes (obi-wan vs anikin & obi-wan vs grevious) were amazingly done. I could nearly tell that grevious was CG at all. Lucas has done an excellent job at closing the Star Wars saga and giving all it's viewers a lifetime of memories!! Long Live Star Wars!!!"
3529,10,The best movie this year,"I just saw Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the sith Friday and I thought it was the greatest movie this year it contained some great action and adventure with out straying from the story line. The movie also contained some great twist and summed up dearth Vader/ anikan skywalkers start and turn to the dark side as well as how he became the man behind the mask. The movie also summed up great in my opinion, it ended on board a empire star ship with the sith lord and his apprentice Darth Vader standing next to him viewing the construction of the 1st death star. but is still stayed on story with how luck and princes laya came to be and how they were split up. The movie also showed extremely well how the galactic empire came to be. Whene the movie ended I felt a great deal of pride and satisfaction in the movie and ran home to see the next movie (a new hope). I strongly recommend going to see this movie it is truly the best movie this year."
3530,7,overall fair,"It was a good connection movie, but I thought it was not a good as the others simply because it had a very dark theme. I know it's supposed to, but I thought it could have had a bit of humor in it, or even ONE PERSON could have had a sunny disposition. However, it had AWESOME special effects. The movie did a good job of connecting the second and fourth movies. I understand a lot more now, although parts of the story agree with I did not, in the tongue of Yoda. Some people I know thought the story should have ended before it did. I do not agree, the ending did most of the connecting between films. Without the ending, I would have never known certain things that I will not state here. The movie was good, overall, but certain things drew my rating down to a ""fair""."
3531,8,"Great Vader, Bad Anakin","Have just watch the worldwide premiere of Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith. It wasn't great but compared to the lacklustre Episode II, this concluding instalment at least offer a glimpse of the old Star Wars calibre."
3532,10,Oh my...Wow!,"This movie is a must see!!! Perfect in every way, it wraps up even the tiniest details that might have flawed the transition between Episode III and Episode IV. Visually the movie is as stunning as anyone could have imagined, but on top of that, the movie has depth that cant be compared with any of the remaining ""Star Wars"" movies. I am not hesitating when i say that this movie might even rival ""Empire Strikes Back"", which in many eyes is the best of the lot. Gone, are all the misguided childish ambitions that were so obvious and superficial in Episode I and II (even though I still enjoy both of them). Instead Lucas dives deep into the ""Dark side"" of the franchise and has created a horrifying, yet fascinating tale of how the young ambitious Anakin Skywalker so tragically becomes the very thing he as a Jedi has sworn to stop. ""Star Wars Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith"", might in time be the very centerpiece of the Star Wars franchise... who knows? I saw the movie at a 3 am screening and at 6 when the whole thing was finished this morning, i didn't care about getting home and getting to sleep... no, i wanted to find out when I could see it again, because this is one ride you wont want to miss out on!"
3533,10,Movie made me cry. am I alone?.. *spoiler*,"I finally understand Anakin's initial motivation... and seeing how he felt rejected by the council, but given the world by Palpatine. I wanted to see more after the movie was over... i felt as if there needs to be an episode 3.5. I know this is the last Star Wars movie...but I would easily love to see more of Darth Vader. Also, I was sad that Padme was killed by Palpatine's treachery."
3534,10,Makes up for the blunders,"One of the first things that crosses your mind when looking at the advertising for a movie is the question as to whether or not it will live up to the hype. The first two movies of the prequel were, in a word, disappointing. After so many years of waiting for additional Star Wars installments, it was sad that the first two movies couldn't live up to the story set out by the truly first three of the series. But then, its hard to imagine what Lucas could have done to live up to the expectations that the original trilogy created. ""Revenge"" makes up for the disappointments of previous episodes. It ties things together and answers questions that were created by things that didn't seem to make sense (like Obi Wan's comment after finding R2 that he didn't recall ever owning a droid before or Yoda's seeming revelation that ""there is another"" as Luke takes off in ""Empire Strikes Back"". It is action packed, and filled with intrigue that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the movie. Lucas must have had this in mind when he first set out to do Star Wars because it is by far the best of the prequels and quite possibly the best of all 6. With any hope, he will at some point agree to complete the full 9 that he promised after the first one's success. I remember standing in line for hours to get into see the first Star Wars in 1977. It was worth every minute of the 4 hours I stood in the sun. And I, like many others, did it over and over again. Long ago, in a land not so far away, a writer and director took the world by storm. And he has again proved his worth. May the force be with you."
3535,10,The Ultimate End of a Saga,"I have to say this has been an extraordinary journey. This movie has put together every single question one would ask. I was not impressed with Phanton Menace or Attack of the Clones, but far be it for me to say.....Revenge of the Sith....is by far the best there is. It equals the feeling Empire Strikes Back gave you the first time you saw it. The darkness overwhelms you.The hatred that begins to grow throughout the movie is something that is so powerful and yet goosebumps overcome you.It is a beautiful thing.:-) In closing I do have to say....Even if you are not a Star Wars Geek(like me), I still would recommend this movie....Once you see it you will want to see all the rest of them. Thank you George Lucas for giving us this movie and putting to rest this glorious Saga we have followed for many years."
3536,9,Awesome MOVIE,"Now i've seen a lot of movies, sad, action pact and funny. I can safely say that this movie contains all of those."
3537,10,Does not disappoint...,"When the announcement of the new trilogy was made, the first thought that came into my head was ""The final movie had better not pull any punches."" Some may argue the movie makes Anakin appear to soft, but in actuality the movie deepens Anakin's character and shows the viewer what Luke saw in Darth Vadar. I admit i was disappointed with the first two, but I high recommend ""Sith"" for the stellar opening scene, Anakin's transformation, and for the breath-taking battle at the end between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The movie does not receive at 10 because of the under use of Natalie Portman's character. Samuel L. Jackson continues to show the viewer why he demanded a purple light saber, and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine shows exactly what evil is in the Star Wars universe. The ending scene is exactly as it should be, not to uplifting but certainly not depressing. The movie restored my faith in the franchise and showed George Lucas has not completely lost his mind."
3538,,The Best Star Wars Movie Ever,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot. This movie is the must see event of the past 10 years, possibly more in my opinion. It was amazing. Star Wars fans will love it, regardless of some terrible writing on George Lucas' part, he needs to hire a different writer who has a bit more talent than him."
3539,8,Better than Jedi,"On first viewing in 2005, Lucas' sixth Star Wars epic looked like a welcome return to form after the depressing embarrassment of his turgid (almost unwatchable!) Phantom Menace and clunky (only marginally superior) Attack of the Clones. Seen again for a second and third time, Sith is clearly a movie unjustly shut out of IMDb's Top 250. Amazingly, the poorly scripted, Ewok-plagued Return of the Jedi continues to poll alongside The Big Sleep, Wizard of Oz and High Noon! Yes, Jedi has some great moments (Jabba's asphyxiation, the Emperor's arrival on the Death Star, the speeder bike chase!) but, for my money, Episode III outpaces its patchy 1983 ""sequel"" in almost every department. At no point does this movie slacken: from its thrilling, vertiginous opening space battle to the passionate, skilfully composed light-sabre duel on the lava planet. And with the story darkening, adult themes to rival those of Episode V once again creep into what are...supposed to be just kids' films? There could even be said to be acting! Ian McDiarmid lets rip with another terrifically camp performance as Palpatine (the seduction of Hayden!) and shows us, as he did in Jedi, how sensitivity to intonation can elevate even the most sophomoric dialogue. Christensen is better (or just older?). And Lucas at last manages to coax a passable performance from McGregor, who appears to shrug off his boredom with the green screen experience. But what really makes this movie is Lucas' direction over the closing half hour. The simple inter-cutting of Anakin's Frankenstein-like reconstruction into Vader with a hospital sequence of Padme's death giving birth to the twins, shows a lightness of touch and broad Old Hollywood emotionalism missing since the truly classic Episodes IV and V. The last line of dialogue is 3PO uttering ""Oh,no!"" before we cut to iconic images of Padme's funeral, a first glimpse of imperial TIE fighters circling the Death Star, and baby Luke's delivery to Uncle Owen and Aunty Beru under the binary Tatooinese sunset. Oh, and let's not forget John Williams...quietly reprising almost every Star Wars melody including, for a few exquisite seconds, the lovely ""Padme's Destiny"" in counterpoint to Vader's ""Imperial March"". A minor-key classic?"
3540,8,two questions,"1) How does Yoda know Anakin is now Darth Vader instead of Lord Vader? 2) Why didn't he say: 'Don't make me ""destroy"" you' instead of ""Don't make me kill you""..."
3541,9,Completely enjoyed this film,"I am sitting here ant 4 am after watching this film for the first time, my plans for the day consist of watching all 5 Star Wars movies and watching it again tonight. The film was all that I expected it to be, as it tied up all lose ends that I could think of. There were a few problems I had with the movie, however; just when you would see just how evil Vader had become, it was edited out, the acting was lacking but not so much as some troma pictures I will not mention here. Lucas tried to mix a violent change and a love story together, and failed on that front, but completely succeeded in nicely wrapping up what I know call the second holy trilogy (the first being A new hope, Empire strikes back, and Return of the jedi) You also see bit parts with a old trilogy fav. Chewbacca, and as small as his part is, it brought a smile to my face. All in all I really enjoyed it, but if you haven't seen the other 5 movies, I highly recommend you do, as a lot of this film will make absolutely no sense to you."
3542,7,"It was great, not the best, but great.",This movie is just about everything I could have hoped for in the prequels. It is by far the best one out of the three and even surpasses A New Hope. This is definitely a movie that I want to go see again.
3543,10,"Lucas, you have proved that a prequel is not all hype","Once I saw Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (both the original and special edition), i was wondering when George Lucas would ever make Episodes 1-3. When I finally saw a trailer, I was so excited. The movie was so hyped during 1999. There were a lot of expectations...it was so hyped that the movie was exactly that=hype. Mediocre acting (most especially Jake Lloyd), bad dialog, and a movie too long to focus on one thing-how Anakin meets Obi-Wan. Episode 2 was also hype. It focused too much on a love story that was absolutely going nowhere."
3544,9,Groundbreaking! and I am not even a big Star Wars fan.,"The critics who have given the movie mediocre reviews are not paying attention to what they should be. They talk and write about poor dialogue when they should talk and write about how George Lucas has taken special effects to the next level and created a fictional universe with unparalleled imagination and creativity. If you are wondering how good the special effects are, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy's special effects pale by comparison--and they were superb in their own right. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is unmistakably a high-tech summer action blockbuster, and if that is not what you are looking for, see something else. Those of you who do want to see a summer blockbuster are in for a real treat. Do not focus too heavily on the acting, not because the acting is bad-- which it certainly isn't-- but because you may miss the amazing backdrops and scenery. The amount of obviously painstaking detail that went into creating each setting is amazing. The fact that each shot only lasts ten seconds before Lucas cuts to the next equally impressive and creative setting is astounding. And this continues throughout the movie. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not a dull story with very good special effects. It is a very engaging story with groundbreaking visuals. Now that the Star Wars saga has ended, I hope George Lucas moves on and continues to do what he is clearly the best at."
3545,9,Now the Circle is Complete...,"The third film in each of the Star Wars trilogies seems to be about redemption. For Return of the Jedi, redemption came to Luke Skywalker's father, Darth Vader. In Revenge of the Sith, Vader's father, George Lucas, is redeemed."
3546,9,the force is definitely with this one,"the long wait is over, the expectation level had been climbing for the last month, reaching fever-pitch on Monday at the London Premiere in Leicester square and am i disappointed? No, not one bit. George has redeemed himself largely for Episode I and Jar jar Binks. I am finding it difficult to say anything bad about the film, small things like how easy Dooku was killed, how slow the jedi council cottoned onto Palpatine being evil, but really they are small details. Overall i really enjoyed it even knowing what was to come, none of the things i was expecting i was disappointed at. The best character was definitely senator Palpatine, he was just so deliciously nasty it was great. The quality of the cgi has much improved since Attack of the Clones which was easily outshone by LOR espiecially Gollum, but characters like Genereal Grievous were excellently done and it did not look like a cartoon anymore. Incredibly, i thought the acting was sound throughout as well, Hayden Christianson is much improved and they all looked much more at ease with the star wars thing. The ending was brilliant as well, Darth Vader as we all know him, the naming and hiding of the twins, many of the links into A new Hope were there, not over done, just right. I'm off to see it again soon."
3547,7,The best of the Prequals,"I was very excited to see this movie after I first saw the teaser trailer in the movie theater. When I saw it, it had definitely lived up to my expectations. The movie follows the story of the rise of the empire, and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen)'s fall to the dark side. However, I really think that if you haven't seen it, it shouldn't be on your top 5 of your list of movies to see. Lucas has become a very bad writer, a ""love"" scene with Anakin and Padme (Natalie Portman) really shows that Lucas cannot write romantic dialogue. Also Hayden Christiansen is an extremely bad actor. Ian McDiarmid brilliantly portrays Emperor Palpatine, who convinces Anakin that Padme will die in child birth, and the only way to save her is to turn to the dark side and acquire new powers that will stop her from dying. Natalie Portman (Padme) and Ewan Mcgregor (Obi-Wan) both play their parts really well. The best part in the movie is the final battle at the end. One last thing is that the movie is extremely long: I think it's almost three hours. All in all, this is an average movie that is fun to watch, but not a very good quality movie."
3548,10,The best of the six,"I gave my comment a spoiler alert just to be safe; but honestly, it's a prequel, nothing is really spoiled for the true fans. This fan lays to rest any disputes about whether or not George Lucas would screw it up. As a die-hard fan (border-line fanatic), i viewed this movie with such scrutiny i brought a jeweler's monocle to the premiere just in case. I have to say that Lucas outdid himself with this one. He tied up all the loose ends. He explained why Yoda and Obi-Wan were the only Jedi that were for sure alive. He explained why C-3P0 had no recollection of the Jedi and the Skywalkers, and R2D2 did. It showed how the Emperor became so malformed from the dark side."
3549,9,"very good, maybe the best","Okay, so there's a lot of people who have problems with this movie. First, I will address two common criticisms I have come across. Then I'll offer my own criticism, but then take it back and conclude with a rather audacious claim. I apologize if my thoughts ramble a bit."
3550,10,"What a movie,child friendly as well","I have just watched the movie with the family,2children aged 4 and 10. They enjoyed it as much as me,The movie is back to full on action just like 4,5 and 6. It also answers a lot of unanswered questions such as how did Anakin become Darth Vader,What happened to all the Jedi and how did Luke finish up on such a remote planet. I have talked about action, the movie starts with a battle and it just doesn't finish right up to the end. In my opinion Mr Lucas has done his homework on this the end movie of the six, he has given everyone what they wanted lots of good fighting as well as an excellent storyline If your going to watch a movie this weekend this is the one."
3551,8,This Is The Chosen One!,"I absolutely love this movie. I definitely want to see it again. Since the summer of 1977, ""Star Wars"" has been a part of our culture. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a worthy contender for the greatest Star Wars film of all time. In addition to a great plot, this movie will visually amaze your eyes. It is not like any other action movie you've ever seen before because it's all taking place in outer space. The action in the movie is exceptional, and will continue to amaze you until the last second of the film. If you want mesmerizing visuals then ""Star Wars"" it is. George Lucas took us to many beautiful ans strange new worlds. The visuals are stunning and the story is so touching."
3552,7,Forgettable,"And the prequels end with this sour taste, the missing opportunities of what could be one of the best Star Wars histories."
3553,10,"Episode 3.5? CONTAINS VERY SMALL SPOILERS, but none the less.....","remember when Yoda says to obi, qui gon jin has been restored and will be doing a special assignment with you. THIS IS KEY, that was a setup for an episode away from the franchise but dealing with the matter with obi, qui gon, and probably Vader and Yoda and other people. This is gonna be a good movie depending on how much they work on it, but it has potential, use your imagination to give ideas to lucasfilms, I'm sure they would like some. My guesses are that they are going to have obi"
3554,8,"VERY, VERY well done Mr. Lucas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I am a fan of all of the episodes and when I went to see this movie a couple weeks ago I was expecting an incredible movie and that's what I got.
3555,7,"A classic? No, among the better Star Wars Movies? definitely!","Why it's bad: 1-Hayden Christensen's obvious intent to act but he comes off as either too stiff or too corny. 2-Some of the dialogue you hear leaves you like ""huh!?"" lines such as ""my powers have doubled since we last met"" Puleeese. 3- The climactic duel, as intense as it is, up until the finish, is too tidy and too expertly fought. Nobody gets scraped, get their clothes torn or burnt, nor suffer any injury. Anakin gets beaten with one swing of Obi Wan's light saber!? why not a few injuries that build up to the defeat. 4- Why introduce an interesting Villain like General Grievous just to have him offed so quickly. and if he's so devious, how come they don't show him kill any one. 5- a few plot holes that are just too obvious to ignore. Mind you, these might be due to my overall lack of knowledge of the Star Wars story plotting. If this is the case, please forgive. enlightenment is welcome. A- Why does Count Douku have his own Master kidnapped (Darth Sidious AKA senator Palpatine) It is not explained whether or not Count Douku knows that his master and the senator are one and the same. Even if he doesn't know, wouldn't a powerful sith lord like Douku sense his master's presence even if he is in disguise? B-when Mace Windu arrives with 3 other Jedi to ""arrest"" Senator Palpatine, why does the senator challenge them right away? I thought he was a smooth talker who seduced Count Douku and Anakin into converting to the Dark side. Why reveal your Sith Lord status all of a sudden after years of careful covert operation. C-Now here is the real kicker and one that just annoyed me. Why are the other 3 Jedi that showed up with Mace windu killed off so ridiculously easy? I mean it was laughable. I thought these were master warriors that trained for light saber combat since they were kids er younglings. We know Darth sidious is going to beat them and wind up dueling just Mace but come on, give them a little more play. Why it's good: 1-some of the slow paced scenes work, such as Yoda and Mace speaking on the presence of the sith. such as Anakin meditating on his eventual turn to the Dark side. (he's sitting by the window and yes, he's not speaking). and also The Senator/Sidious brainwashing Anakin. 2- but I think one of the best parts was when the Jedi were being killed off and you could feel the senseless betrayal, one through Yoda's hurt expressions and two, due to John Williams' melancholy yet poignant score at this time. 3- I wish that the conversion into Darth Vader would have been drawn out more and maybe give Vader some better ""first words"" than were spoken. but other than that, I was taken; the suit, the mask, the first breath. it gave me pleasant chills. Why a master story teller such as Mr. Lucas did not realize these little tid bits is beyond me. It almost gives me the impression the creators were like, well the plotting isn't perfect but it's got plenty of action and every body has been waiting for this one for a long time. Lets release it. Over all I enjoyed it, I bought the DVD and can't wait to show it to my son when he's about eight."
3556,10,Lucas goes out with a bang!,"Every scene seemed to be made for me, and my curious tastes. From the fighter battle of the opening scene to the coup of Palpatine (this movie was his, perhaps more so than it was Anakin/Darth Vader's) to the dramatic duel between Anakin and his 'brother'."
3557,6,"In no way, shape or form worth staying up 'til 3am for.","It's worth seeing, but don't go to any extraordinary lengths to do so."
3558,9,Action speaks louder than words,"Finally, George Lucas has put together a film that explains the story of Anakin's fall and the Jedi collapse visually without long pauses to verbally fill in gaps."
3559,10,Good job!!,This is one of my all time greatest movies ever. it sums up[ what happens between 2 and the 4th movie very well. the fighting scenes were excellent. good job making the movies!!! 
3560,6,Disappointing...,After all the build up the movie was a disappointment. The acting was poor and the story disjointed to say the least. The effects were great though - it's amazing how far effects have come in the last 30 years ;-).
3561,9,It's about time,"Now I'm one of the few who thought that Episode II Attack of the Clones was not that bad. Now it was only a 6 out of 10, but that is because they cut out so many scenes that would have made the movies so much better."
3562,8,this is a funny story with me,the funny thing to this story is i have never seen a stars film in my life.I saw this film the first day and the first showing they had in Connecticut. Mt girlfriend had free tickets and she asked me to go so i said sure. I thought the movie would be OK i dint think it would be one of my favorite movies of all time and i will admit i was lost in the first 30 mains but i caught on and the action was great and the drama was great too.I really hope all stars movies are this good because if they are I might become one of those star wars losers that dress up. or maybe not. I really recommend this movie to anybody and i mean anybody.So go see this movie and become a star wars geek
3563,7,Not exactly 'he did it right this time'...,"There is something wrong with this movie. In anticipation of getting rid of the ""Attack of the Clones""' memory many viewers rushed in to exclaim 'this time he did it right'. And really, without any prejudice, until the Emperor finishing Windu it was good (OK, apart from the hollow 'I love you's between Anakin and Padme)."
3564,10,Revenge of the Sith was pretty good...,"First 25-30 minutes were really good, i liked the droid humor. Then the rest of the movie was talk talk blah blah save your wife turn to the dark side blah blah no its because I'm so in love with you blah blah blah what have i done to i will do whatever you ask to killing younglings and then the last 50 minutes saved the movie. i liked the emperor a lot, but he looks different than he did in rotj and Hayden Christensen's acted a little bit better that line ""You TURNED her against me"" was pretty good. Love story still sux. ewan mcgregor seemed to be a younger clone of Alec Guinness and that part where Vader started breathing made the whole audience in the theater super quiet. The music was superb, where at the end of the movie we get to hear Leia's theme and the force theme. Overall good movie"
3565,7,Great movie,"I loved the movie and recommend this for all ages. if you don't think this is a great movie, then i guess you have no taste in star wars movies or movies at all. the plot was okay, i would have added more too it. my all time favorite parts to any star wars movies are the lightsaber fights. the end fight is great. when anakin does that huge flip over to a working pad on the lava, WOW! the lightsaber animation was great. i loved how they detailed it so their was a point to the end of the sword. i would have added more to the Yoda vs. Darth sidious part. it was too short. that going in and out of the anakin vs. obi wan parts was good, the anakin vs obi wan fight was great in length. it was fun in the theater for the first time to see it. i did research on it so i knew the history in between 2 and 3 so i knew what was happening, but my hands were shaking i was so excited seeing it. the opening scene was really good. i liked the flying and flying into the ship, it had a good ""Jedi entrance"" to it. star wars 3 was an over all great movie to watch."
3566,7,Definitely George Lucas' Marterpiece,"The conclusion to the tragic story of Anakin Skywalker ends with a bang! This heart-wrenching tale is definitely the most emotional installment in the Star Wars series. However, George Lucas has not worked out all the kinks. But his over-all improvement in every other department should be well noted."
3567,7,Acting...were was it?,"Definitely better than the first two, but please... acting better? No way. In the beginning both Hayden and Ewan act as if they are reading the script. (Lucas are you blind or deaf? How could you allow that?) Hayden becomes a bit better further along the movie but Ewan remains stiff. Sometimes he gives me the impression that Obi-Wan is mocking all the events taking place. OK, so you are a Jedi knight, some things are easier for you, but even when he has to be serious there is this inexplicable smile on his face. No, Ewan you disappoint me."
3568,8,Epic,This is my most favorite movie in the entire saga the fight sciences are the greatest fights i've ever seen and the soundtrack is amazing. The movie is overall just amazing. Best prequel and very underrated.
3569,4,"Better than 1&2, but far, far away from first trilogy.","After reading critics and comments on SW3, I was hoping for a great movie, to be compared with episodes IV, V and VI. But I must say it's quite a deception, even considering the fact that it's obviously different than the first trilogy. There is, again, too many special FX, but OK, it's Lucasfilms, and he likes FX, I know. (too many but nice FX I must say). But sorry, I still think it lost the realistic touch with all those CGI, it looks like Bug's Life or something (look at the crawling-colorful-mounted creature, looks like Monster inc). The script is, again, BAD, stuffed with cocky dialogues, and seems false and incoherent on the edges (made even worse with poor acting). I'd qualify it as a result of a ""prostitute"" movie which has 1 goal: seduce a wide, wide (way too wide) range of viewers. Except for the ending sequence (last 45 minutes), I think this is Lucas's homage to original Star Wars fans (should have been the whole movie though). Perhaps I was hoping too much, should have kept episodes 1 & 2 in mind. 9 out of 10 compared to ep. 1&2, and 4/10 compared to the original trilogy. And, I wouldn't pay more than 75$ CAN for the full Star Wars boxset. I bet it's gonna be 150$."
3570,6,This is NOT better than Return of the Jedi!,Saw the midnight screening an hour ago.
3571,8,my personal review,"After viewing the latest and final installment of the Star Wars saga, The Revenge of the Sith I found myself contemplating what I actually thought of the film. I have come to a number of conclusions, both good and bad. First, from an entertainment perspective, I found the film to be really enjoyable. By far, the action and fight sequences were better than episode one and two. The film did also answer some of my burning questions as to why certain things happened in the original series."
3572,10,ironic,"The best Star Wars film in my opinion. Please make a prequel of the prequels,"
3573,10,Lucas ends on High Note,"After what many would consider the two most disappointing movies of their lifetime, George Lucas has returned to form with the epic, dark REVENGE OF THE SITH. Is it A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back? Of course not. I think its time to stop kidding ourselves and realize that it was impossible all along for Lucas to make a movie that would sit along side two of the greatest movies of all time. Are there still problems with Sith? Yes, the Anakin-Padme scenes are tough to sit through and the dialogue and acting aren't quite top notch, but its such a refresher to actually want to go back and enjoy a Star Wars film over and over. Remember, this is our last chance to enjoy a new Star Wars film in theaters. Lets try to enjoy it."
3574,9,Let Downs,"Star Wars episode three is an amazing film and its the kind of film you can watch over and over again. But, like in all good films, there are a couple of things that were a let down. The biggest one is the over use of CGI(computer generated images). Through the film there was barely a scene without green screen. Also, some of the character cgi is rubbish. For example, in the Dooku fight when Obi Wan gets thrown across the room it just looks like some low budget film trying to imitate someone flying. Also it has the most disappointing fight in the saga. This is the fight between Mace Windu and Emporer Palpatine. This fight had the potential to be one of the best fights ever but it was ruined by the exchange between the stunt double and the actor who played Palpatine. When the focus is on the actor he is really slow, but when it goes to a long shot and the stunt double it rapidly speeds up. Despite this it does still manage to uphold the quality of the star wars films and is by far not the worst one. Also the quality of acting greatly improved compared to that in attack of the clones."
3575,4,Wow was I disappointed,"Alright. When Star Wars episode 3, Revenge of the Sith came out, I was definitely excited to see it. First off, the first two films sucked, but the hype over this one was much greater. And it was rated pg-13, the first of the films to be rated as such."
3576,10,padme pregnant and dying and then birth and then death,Why did anakin not go away with her he joined the dark side to save her instead he killed her and obi wan was seriously leavening padme on the ground dying if it wasn't for c-3po padme would have had to give birth on the ground or die pregnant and padme did not deserve to be murdered he could have just captured padme and make her give birth in the empire and the baby's would have had a bad life. Actually padme would actually be like star wars MVP because if it wasn't for padme Luke and leia would not have been born if it wasn't for padme becoming pregnant so padme was the real reason that the empire got destroyed so padme giving birth was the best moment in star wars because of Luke and leia
3577,8,Great,"This is the greatest movie on all the saga, although the 6 movies aren't exactly academy award material, this is the best of them."
3578,10,star wars episode 3,This is the episode that we've been waiting to see how Anakin turned to the dark side. Brilliant story line brilliant special effects that keep u on your seats.Fits straight in to episodes 4.5.6.Hayden Christenson makes a good Darth Vader and Jedi.Ewan Mcgregor obi -wan ken-obi is brilliant leading to Alex Guinness performance in the original movies.But the star of the movie was Ian Mcdiarmid Palpatine is well evil and Mcdiarmid does a very good job making him one of cinema's greatest villains.The battle between Palpatine and Yoda is one of the so many fights in this movie makes it a real treat and fans get to see a fighting side of Yoda.George Lucas has done a smashing job over the last 30 years giving us one of cinema's greatest saga's THE FORCE WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US
3579,6,Revenge of the Stiffs,"My My, young ScreenWalker, your powers in the dull side have grown strong indeed. Whoever directed this mess should report to the emporer / chancellor / senate / jedi council for immediate remedial training in DIALOGUE! This is the premier movie series of our time, and the acting looks like a training rehearsal in the screen actors guild, or a bad melodrama academy."
3580,10,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith is Great!!!!!!,"Considering I am only 15 and a half years old, I have seen every Star Wars film and I enjoy them all. Revenge of the Sith is great because it has sufficient action for example opening battle, hardly any love scenes(which annoyed me in Attack of the Clones), the "" mindless"" Clone Troopers executing Order 66 without any remorse or question, Anakin and Obi- Wan's fatal duel and many enjoyable other moments. I recommend you buy this on DVD, I certainly will!!!! If you're a fan of the Star Wars films or just like Action/ War movies you will enjoy Revenge of the Sith. It's a great film 10 out of 10!!!!! P.S to George Lucas and others in the film industry, Keep love scenes out of War films, especially Star Wars, that is why it is called "" Star Wars""."
3581,9,Near Perfection!,"Quite Possibly the best of the entire saga, definitely the best of the Prequel trilogy. Very Dark, a large departure from the last to of the prequel trilogy. This is what Star Wars was meant to be! It is not a movie for young children though, there is at least 1 scene that is a bit disturbing. Lucas did an excellent job with the characterization of this phase of Anakin, he is no longer the whiney little padawan, he is more confident and bold. Best part though is the almost total lack of Jar Jar in this film, and the time you do see him, he didn't have a speaking part. One of the reasons this is ""almost"" perfect is that yoda's speech seems to be forced, like GL was trying to make it even more noticeable that he scrambles his sentences."
3582,4,does not compare,"I am sorry kids, but I have to go against the grain on this one. Having enjoyed thoroughly the original saga (episodes IV, V, VI) I have just watched episode III and found it to be about 4/10."
3583,8,A Great Way To Finish Star Wars!,"The final Star Wars has arrived, and what a great movie it was. Revenge of the Sith no doubt beats all the prequels and shows us a great story, but also a sad one. Anakin Skywalker descends toward the dark side and becomes one of the most menacing dark lords that the galaxies will see. A tragedy about a man that only wanted to save his wife but fell prey to a Sith lord and let greed and power ruin him. Anakin was only on a quest to save Padme but when he gained the power he was looking for to save her, he wanted more and forgot the whole reason he was trying to attain it. He begins to believe everything the chancellor (Palpatine/Sith lord) says and doesn't even think if what he is doing is right or wrong. He becomes brainwashed and very narrow-minded. He loses his sight of good, justice, and truth. Ankain turns his back on all those he loved and becomes Darth Vader. ""The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader (Yoda). It's an excellent story on how a good-hearted person can become deceived and tricked by government or politicians and become an evil walking monster. This story represents the fall of a hero-a hero I believe we have all grown to love over the past Star War movies. Episode III has tons of action, good story, and great music (John Williams does it again!). The battle between Anakin and Obi Wan is perhaps a good enough reason to watch the movie- one of the best battles on screen. One thing Lucas could have done better was focus more on Anakin's fall to the dark side. I feel that he could have shown more of what Anakin was going through and perhaps show the real torture in it. I would have cut down some action sequences and focused more on that (Example: The beginning with the space battle). But perhaps in today's world, action beats story. Although for me, I would have liked to see more of Anakin's deterioration of good and to see how he becomes the evil being that he is in episodes 4,5,and 6. Acting was much better then episode II, especially Hayden Christensen (much better job!). Script could have been better, some cheesy parts, but it was still good. Overall, it was great movie. Looks like the force is back with Lucas (well done!)."
3584,10,lucas does it again,"This movie borders on the feel of the prequels at the beginning, gets it's own feel toward the middle, and at the end feels more like the original trilogy(only with more action and a more intense feel of the story) And dare I say this almost makes the original trilogy look dull! so much adrenaline rushing at the end of the film will make it seem as though the final films(4, 5, and 6) should have been more climatic and exciting to continue the legacy. this will almost look as though the series starts lame, suddenly excels and then plainly explains the end. having seen the path to the empire and the dark side, the return path to the light almost should have been more emotional and gut wrenching for the audience. It is definitely worth seeing at least once in theaters. "
3585,9,"Give credits where they are due: It's a very satisfying, entertaining movie","""Revenge of the Sith"" is a great popcorn movie that offers also some satisfying answers to the questions many of us had been curious about ever since the original Star Wars came out."
3586,9,.........just go see it then you'll understand the amazement that is star wars,"i'm new to this website so please forgive any mistakes i may make! i would just like to say that this film amazed me with all the graphics and little extras for the star wars boffins out there(e.g. millennium falcon appearance etc) is it just me or did anyone else see the ""flashes"" of darths helmet on anikin whilst he was fighting obi-wan?some parts were disappointing tho, especially the way we see padme go,sorry but she was medically OK so what da...?!!(OK so i'm just upset cause thats my fave character but still it could have been a bit more dramatic!!!)also i feel that the final turn to the dark side was a bit too fast and it should have been laid on for just a little while longer! i went a fair few times to see this on the big screen as just the opening scene alone was created so well its as if your there and that feeling will be lost when its released on DVD an all i have is my naff small TV to watch it on! well done george i think you've done amazing on this film!"
3587,9,It was almost the greatest!,"I really did love this film, and had much anticipation about it. The one thing that that kept me from giving it a ten out of ten was...Hayden Christensen. He was not convincing to me. I never felt that He became Vader until He was burned up and growling ""I hate You!"" to Obi Wan. The majority of the rest of the characters were compelling and believable. (Even your CGI characters) I feel that the actor who should have played Vader prior to being placed in the suit should have made me shudder just like he did when I was seven years old. It is still one of the greatest movies in my mind, but does not top my list by any means."
3588,8,GREAT Movie!,"I saw the movie today. It is so awesome! the action is great , the special effects are amazing, and Hayden Christensen is HOT! I mean really he is. who here agrees with me? those eyes, the hair, that voice of his, and that BODY! *faints*. I didn't think the acting was bad at all! I read in the newspaper reviews about it and they said ""bad acting"" I was like ""nuh uh!"" I loved the movie. My Dad on the other hand liked the movie but thinks Hayden is a BAD actor. he said ""he is such a whiner"" he can't stand him and he said ""They should have picked a better actor"" but whatever. all in all the movie is so good. If you haven't seen it, you should!"
3589,10,Simply amazing.,"I think that we can all agree that this installment of Star Wars was the best. Finally seeing what drove Anikin to become Lord Vader, plus with Lucas's brilliance and story writing and use of special effects, this movie takes the cake. I think that it was amazing. Just simply amazing. The opening sequence alone was great. I don't know about anyone else but I still just get so excited once that first word scrolls up the screen. I just hope that this isn't the end of the saga. And knowing Lucas, he'll keep us waiting another few years to get any new ones. We can only hope that we get to see an older, wiser Luke Skywalker train some young Jedi so that we can once again be filled with the fix of the drug that is Star Wars. I really can't say anything else but I know I'm going to see it another 50 times."
3590,1,My review of Revenge of the Sith,Ben Kenobi chops off Anakin Skywalker's legs off while their stumps burn with fire and his face melts in lava.
3591,4,Great effects but the cartoons had more dimension.,"George Lucas has said 40% of the plot material from the arc of the first three episodes was covered in I and II, and 60% was covered in Sith. This could explain why the first two movies moved so slowly and this edition felt so rushed."
3592,10,None better,This is by far the best Star Wars movie ever. It is not perfect but it is better than any other before it. To me the fights could have been a little longer with cooler moves but it was still awesome. I got 3 of my friends that never even seen the old ones to watch it. First we watched Episode 1 and 2 then the next day saw Episode 3 and they were blown away. They was so against watching them but they did and they loved it. so I gave it a ( 10 ). I hope they will send me a check for promoting it but I doubt it. If you haven't seen it GO SEE IT !!!!!!!!
3593,,Episode 3 - Lucas really outdid himself with this one.,"OK, so another Star Wars flick. I suppose we all knew what was going to happen, so we went to the theater with questions in our heads: so, how is he going to do it? No surprises. Anakin is ""taken by the dark side"" and soon feels hate against anything (not too well-acted emotions really). Then we have Padme appearing every now and then, almost singing the lines like she was in a third grade play. Then there's this almighty Sith master, who is great and powerful and so on, suddenly he is attached and mysteriously sort of diminishes in size and power. I mean come on, at first he could fight so many Jedis at once, suddenly he's having trouble with just Mace Windu. OK, so the guy is lying on the floor with Windu's light saber in his face and Windu says: ""Now I shall end this"". What's up with the squeaking ""No, no, no!""? I mean, does a dark lord really sound like that? OK, I suppose all that can be forgiven. But right after that there's a scene where Anakin has just helped kill Mace Windu and says: ""Oh no, what have I done!?"". Wanna know what his next sentence is? ""Yes, my master"". So he's freaked out and all about what just happened, he realizes that he's made a god awful mistake and... he just says OK, I'll go kill all the young Jedi and ya DA ya DA ya DA ya. And then it all ends like a sixties low budget TOS Star Trek with a classical Dark Vader screaming NOOOOOO when he hears that Padme is dead. The End. Boring. OK, let's go get a sandwich."
3594,10,Best movie erger!!,Because it had the best cast and fights...<br /><br />It also had a lot of good scenes
3595,10,Revenge....,"I am a fan of both trilogies and this movies has to be one my favorites of either one. OK the dialog is bad but Star Wars has never really had good dialog. The action is bad ass and the final light saber fights between Vader/Obi-Wan and Yoda/Sidious are masterful. About the only thing I did not like was how Padme was killed off it was pretty stupid ""There's nothing medically wrong with her but she is dying anyway"" then Yoda or someone says ""She's lost the will to live"" Anyway aside from that this movie rocks. I would have liked to see some more space fights but all in all what the movie had was good enough. I don't have anything else to write but the IMDb says I need more lines of text so I am just trying to fill up space."
3596,9,This movie was great,I saw this movie and it had a lot more than i thought it was a great movie. I didn't think there would be this much killing in the movie but there was it just showed how dark this movie was suppose to look for people watching it. I usually don't like the star wars movies but this one was great it had a lot more action i think compared to any other star wars movie. Episode one of the star wars trilogy was i think.
3597,10,Star Wars is the best,Hello my name is Marie-Julie. My birthday is on the 19 of April just like Hayden Cristensen.I think all of the star wars movies are the best movies ever. Especially episode 3. My favorite character is Anakin and the Darth Vader. But thats Anakin as well. I might be a movie star when I'm older. In about 2 years.Anyway Star Wars 3 is the best movie ever. I love it. I really like the part where Anakin gets burnt and turns into the Darth Vader.Also i really like the part in episode 2 where Anakin jumps out of the ship to catch the guy and Obi-wan says I hate it when he does that. 
3598,10,Best action in 2005,"From the opening 20th Century Fox logo, the movie hits the ground running, proving once again the CGI capabilities of ILM and the thrills they inspire. However, unlike the first two films, where spectacular effects were layered upon complicated, contrived and sometimes dramatically vacant scenes executed with some of the worst performances in memory, there is solid story telling here. And that's the difference."
3599,9,"overall, excellent","It was brilliantly done. My only criticism would be the terrible dialogue between Anakin and Padme during their romantic scenes... it was strained and awkward. No one talks like that. Either that or they have the most awkward relationship ever. Then again, Laucas's forte has never been romance, so its not the end of the world."
3600,10,The Perfect Three,"This movie is the perfect completion to a perfect trilogy! Even if you don't want to admit it these three newest films of the Star Wars universe are sadly under rated! As a film maker myself I know the difficulty of making a ""good"" movie, but I can't even imagine the horror of having to satisfy a billion movie meticulous nerds with a set of three perfect pieces! Lets face it maybe these three movies were not what you imagined they would be, but guess what your not George Lucas! The first thing that must be done in order to accept these movies is simple, stop comparing them to the original 4, 5, and 6! They are not the same film, George has changed since then so lets accept the fact that stand alone these films as a whole are great and no rating in the world can truly represent what these films mean to those of us that have grown up with the series, it is much deeper than a 1 to 10 vote!"
3601,10,The Best Star Wars Movie,"Revenge of the Sith is the best star wars movie, and it is great from the beginning until the end"
3602,10,"Anakin Skywalker is tempted by the evil dark lord of the Sith, Darth Sideous","Revenge of the Sith was a fantastic movie. While the Phantom Menace had a little kid, and Attack of the Clones had to much love, Revenge of the Sith was basically flawless, and it really makes up for whatever episodes 1 and 2 lacked. If you haven't seen this movie, then you have never lived properly. The lightsaber action is perhaps my favorite part - I admit the original star wars were good for their times, but this one enhances the lightsaber fighting so much that it makes the old movies lightsaber fights look boring. Episode 3 basically redeems George Lucas in my eyes after his less than perfect first two episodes. Great movie, and a MUST SEE for all sci fi lovers."
3603,,Revenge of the Sith - best star wars movie ever!!!,"If I can think of one word to sum up this movie, the first word that pops into my mind is FRUSTRATING! In a good way though, and all of you that have already seen Revenge of the Sith, I'm sure will understand."
3604,10,summary of main subject of the Series,"Reason of my 10 points is because of: (1) summary of main subject of the series (for me). (for me also) the main subject is; phenomenon of ""the choosing of 'bad' "" of 'Good Humans' even they are the protector of the ""good""... (2) the other subjects are all secondary things. (3) Even this movie is absolutely not the best of the Series especially as virtual etc. As a subject its a good summary!.."
3605,7,a pleasant surprise,"After the first two episodes, I went into this film with about as low expectations as possible. The first 20 minutes met these lowered expectations, as cheesy dialogue, illogic (if Obi-Wan can move heavy objects using the Force, then why couldn't he shoo away those little destructo- droids from the wings of his ship in the opening sequence?), vomit-inducing romance, etc. prevailed."
3606,9,The Best of the Series,"First off, this is an incredible piece of work - the special effects are truly amazing. But its the story that really stands out. Lucas has created a tragedy of Shakespearian vision. There are several moments in particular - Anakin intervening in the Windu battle, and the jedi temple slaughter, that have an emotional power that has only on occasion reared itself - at the end of Empire, and the end of Jedi."
3607,5,Just Okay,"I went to see this star wars movie hoping that it would be better than the last two. I'd heard that there would be less childish whining. That hope seemed to have been blown out of the water. There were also a series of story line holes that were altogether annoying. Anakin turned out to be a week minded little boy yet again. Heck, the Sith could have said, ""Hey join the dark side its fun"" and he would have done it. There was really no thought in it for him. It was an alright movie, but does not meet the standards the orig. Trilogy set. I went in with an open mind after hearing my friends rave as well, but the physics, and the story just had a bunch of glaring soar points, go watch if you want to see for yourself though :)"
3608,10,Logic:,"Big bad, big sad, big mad."
3609,10,Oscar 2006,"This movie is not for the Oscar, its for the fans, because we work so hard and we pay for a ticket to watch a movie or buy the DVD.The academy watch movies for free, they don't pay for watch a movie on the big screen, I hope you guys vote for Star Wars on the MTV MOVIE AWARDS. Only Lucas care about the Birthday of Darth Vader and complete the saga story and all the audence like the movie, this movie its better tha episode II. So we care about this movie, the academy does'nt because they don' pay everyday to watch a movie in a big screen, this movie is only for the audience and not for the critics and the Oscars."
3610,6,What its all about,After seeing this movie I wondered what the whole series adds up to. Is it about Luke and the events leading up to his adventures? Is it about Anakin Skywalker and his journey to the dark side and back? Or is it about another character altogether...
3611,8,A good final Star Wars...,I saw this movie the weekend it came out and I was very surprised by it. I expected to see a movie like Episodes 1 and 2 but Episode 3 was nothing like them. George Lucas made a perfect Star Wars film. It has lots of action with some great acting. I will be surprised if this film doesn't get a Oscar nod(mainly for special effects).
3612,1,Awful,"If that is a good science fiction film we are doom to see a long line of poor movies. It is so bad I had problem watching all of it, in fact my first attempt to watch it I stop half of the film, the second time I torture myself to the very end and I still think it is a very poor movie. A big package of special effects just for the sake of it does not make a good movie in my book. This Star War is only a commercial stunt to make millions but it will not make history of one of the good Star War. This film is like fast food, to much of a good thing is not necessarily good for you. This is my personal opinion and I know a lot of you are thinking otherwise looking at the rating but we live in a free world so every comment is important."
3613,10,Non stop action!,Still remember being blown away by this masterpiece in the cinema when I was 12 and I'm still blown away by it to this day! Hayden is the best Anakin portrayal and McGregor and the rest of the cast nail their Star Wars performances. CGI still hols up really well and the sound design is of course second to none! Peak Star Wars! Seeing Palps at his strongest and Mace finally getting in on the action is awesome. Not to mention of course the best Lightsaber duel in history from two of the greatest to ever do it. The emotion from scenes in this film are heartbreaking. Was beautiful to see Lucas's vision fulfilled. Just wish he'd have been the one to make 7-9 cos y'know... Excited to see more of Hayden in Disney stuff cos prequel kids are finally old enough to let him know how loved he is by the fandom!
3614,8,Fitting End To A Classic Saga,"I have just returned from seeing Revenge Of The Sith at my local cinema, and let me tell you what a finale it was! We finally get to see how (and why),anakin becomes lord Vader! The Birth Of Luke & Leia! The acting by all of the cast was quiet brilliantly portrayed. You could feel anakin's desire and lust for the ultimate power in the universe. Hayden Christianson has done very well in this episode (regardless of what other people have said in this forum). Revenge of the sith really has a lot of heart , you can really feel the sadness towards the end of the movie as the sith begin to rise and take over the galaxy! Mace Windu (Sam Jackson) was superb, Yoda (sensational to watch in his battle with Palpatine)and speaking of Palpatine, Ian Mcdarmaid gives an absolute knockout performance as the evil and manipulating Darth Sidious! Ewan Mcregor as Obi Wan makes the role his own. (He virtually becomes alec guiness as in the original trilogy) And the effects! They (ILM) have really outdone themselves this time!! So much of this movie to talk about, but so little time. Enough of me ranting and raving , just go out there and see it already!! As for me? I plan to see it again tomorrow!!"
3615,9,Lucas has got it right.,"The Force is with George Lucas, and he has saved the best to last."
3616,6,Star Wars is back!,"After two disappointing episodes, Lucas has now proved his worth and now shows us why he is regarded as one of the best in his job. Star Wars Episode III; The Return of the Sith, will eventually become the best film in 2005."
3617,10,Superb closure of the gap between episode II and IV,"I just saw episode III today and was overwhelmed how perfect it closes the gap between episode II and episode IV. Of course one should know all of the former Star Wars movies to understand the geniality of George Lucas script. Sure, everyone knows that Anakin Skywalker turns to Darth Vader but how and why was unknown for a long time. This movie tells the story of the transformation from a Jedi knight to a warrior of the evil Sith. The end of episode III is not a dramatic one but everyone who knows the following episodes will be touched by this ending (no, you have to view this movie, I won't tell you what is happening ;-) Besides the story there are a lot of really nice gags (at least in the English original version I saw) that made the audience laugh a lot. Additionally the movie seems to have some kind of political statement because of some analogies to events that occurred in our recent past (""Who is not with me is my enemy"" sounds very familiar). In fact the Star Wars universe was not complete until this movie and now everything is very clear and the story a complete one."
3618,10,Impressive...most impressive,"Sith Is as good as Empire. I never thought I would say that but here I am typing it in the IMDb. Now, I will have to see it a few more times on DVD, and want to watch it like I have Episode V. But Its safe to say that I will. I haven't been at a movie in the past 10 years that I can remember enjoying this much. They told the story perfect in this chapter. I would have liked to have seen more wookie scenes but understand that the movie wasn't about that, and it would have taken away from the main story of Anakin turning finally to the dark side. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. The way Anakin turns to the dark side is very plausible. I enjoyed how things were cleared up between things said in the first episodes IV-VI. The people who are giving this movie a bad review must want to pick apart anything. I'm sure the same people thought the Royal Tenabaums was the funniest movie of all time."
3619,8,I did not enjoy it,"In my opinion, it could be better... the elements of the film are in their place...The power of a film with this theme is to be able to put the structures together... A work in the galaxy genre, which is perhaps the only super interesting example of its own, should be able to answer many questions about How can it be used in different aspects and discourses between nations... This is a general criticism of this franchise, and in my opinion, the group of writers and directors could have looked at this issue very idealistically and in a new way.to introduce interaction between people in this world...in fact, the main discussion is that it will be better in the future works of this series Its continuation should be based on the fact that each group in this franchise represents a human group and introduce solutions for more interaction in our world. Just fighting in this movie is not attractive at all..."
3620,5,Did I see the same film?,"I'm confused. I saw the film and was stunned by the lack of quality. The print I saw was dark, murky and full of film flaws. The focus was off repeatedly. The framing was terrible. Often the tops of the heads were chopped off while we saw lots of shoulder tops. One classically bad cut went from a closeup of SkyWalker to a shot where he was hidden behind a pillar. Many shots were dark on dark, so the scene was over-lit in post, resulting in gray on gray. Honestly I've see better framing and focus every week on TV. Am I missing something? Also Yoda was not in the same league as Gollum as far as CGI characters go. Lucas can't match an Australian FX house?"
3621,10,impressive film,"I loved this movie, even if the dialogue suffered in places. The fight between Obi-wan and Anakin is the best duel in the Star Wars saga (though my favorite scene from all six movies remains Luke beats Vader in ROTJ). The story flowed, and I liked seeing a darker, more mature Star Wars movie for a change. My only complaint: James Earl Jones only got three lines when Vader finally donned the black suit and face mask. I don't know how Lucas could have fit in more lines though, maybe have Vader in his classic costume give a short monologue type speech before the ending montage (after that horrible ""NO!!!"" line he delivers as he does the Franken-Vader walk, the worst part of the film). Watch this movie, even if you hate the prequels. Give it a chance."
3622,10,"""anakin""","i like this movie expiable when Hayden act like Anakin Skywallker i really like from George Lucas to make another film maybe Star Wars 7,8,9 I like the idea of doing Star Wars 7,8,9 it may be focused on the story of Luke Skywallker when he is a master talking to the ghostly appearance father Anakin played by Hayden. In the third episode i liked when Obi-Wan duels with Anakin Ana Yoda with THe emperor The third episode i think that it will win a Oscar or tow i hope that George Lucas change mind About his ""betrayment"" of Star Wars not making another movie because it will hit the blockbuster of Hollywood and i hope he can choose good and talented actors like Hayden Christensen"
3623,5,Overrated,"Parts one and four are the only real original ones. People just assume that part three will be completely awesome, yet it isn't. Part three was overrated before it even premiered. Most of the people that see this movie already know what's going to happened, so the way the plot is presented is downright stupid."
3624,10,Best movie in the world so far,"When I went to the cinema to see this movie I was so nervous that it would'nt satisfy me. But O My God! That was so great. Every actor did a great performens (especially Hayden Christensen). The special effects was so amazing (as in every Star Wars movie). The Story was so well made, and almost made me cry. And I am not the type that cry over a film."
3625,10,"The Best and The Best together in the land of the Best, for which we all know""","This film is by far the best film that has been made up to this point in time. I think it is such a shame that this film is not given more credit, while those silly little boy godfather film get much more than they deserve. The fact the the godfather is so stupid help the greatness of this final Star wars edition."
3626,9,No doubt the darkest and most exciting of the Star Wars movies...Lucas at his best,"(SPOILERS INCLUDED!)This movie was amazing. The special effects, the storyline. Everything. The whole thing was quite tragic as well, especially the slaying of the Jedi council. The movie makes you feel bad for Anakin, but also feel the pain of the Jedi and the people who stayed true to the Republic. Mny critics said that the move didn't explain Skywalkers crossing to the Dark Side, but Lucas clearly stated it, I think. The bit at the end about Qui-Gon is something I am anxiously awaiting an answer to. Hopefully this and some other questions will be explained in at least one of the two upcoming TV series."
3627,9,Truly the best of the Star Wars Series,"I won't kill you with commentary, I just want to add to the number saying how good it was. Lucas redeems himself finally!! There was a few points in the movie where the dialog was poorly done. The scene of Amadala crying was very poorly acted, but with noting that the movie wasn't ""Perfect"" it was great. There is a certain feel to the original star wars that had gotten lost in the other movies in the series. Not this one! It's a roller coaster ride from the beginning, and reminds all of us why we loved the original movie so much. It helps flesh out the reasons Anakin slides to the dark side. My only beef with the end was that I wanted more. Darth needs a bigger part in the movie! Okay, enough said. Go see the movie!"
3628,10,A Perfect Final Middle,"I am engaged in an ongoing debate with my two sons, that I hope will last forever, as to whether Episode III is the best one yet. The more I think about it, the more I'm aligning with the Yes side."
3629,10,The best Star Wars yet,"I find this movie the best Star Wars yet, and I say yet cuz deep down I am hoping he will decide to write another or at least sell it off so someone else can keep writing. This story can go on forever and should. Return of the Jedi was my old favorite with Empire as a close 2nd, but this blows them away. Even though I knew what was gonna happen, I still couldn't wait to see how it happened. I was disappointed that General Grievous didn't play a bigger role, he is one awesome character. What do you think, should Lucas rewrite 1 and 2 now and take out lame ideas like Jar Jar, or spending so much time as Anakin as a young kid, I would have liked to see him go thru more Jedi training like Luke did. I can't complain though, Lucas is a master at what he does and I can't wait for the next Indiana Jones to come out. To all you Star Wars fans, this isn't the ending, just the beginning of a new Era."
3630,10,Maybe the best,What an incredible way to end the saga. Anyone who didn't love this movie either doesn't understand brilliant story-telling (not to mention special effects) or has predisposed negativity. 
3631,8,The Best Of The Newer Trilogy But It Lacks In Content,"By Far, this was the most intense of the three films. The second one could have been great had there been more duels and a bit more dark to it. The Dueling scene was nice and long, though, I didn't care so much about the platform Metroid /Mario video game-like platform jumping sequences mixed in. I would have much rather it was much more simplified (as it had started out)."
3632,10,Everyone that is commenting on plot holes or unbelievable events READ THIS,"All right the final installment for the Prequel trilogy has been released and with much fan fare and excitement many of us have gone. Now a week later as I log on and read reviews from people I see more and more of people going on and complaing about plot holes (there are some for sure) and unbelievable events or character inconsistencies (there are some of those also) but, there aren't nearly as many as people are thinking. Why? The fact of the matter is after the Original trilogy came out so many years ago a large following forced what later became commonly known as the Star Wars: Extended Universe. This include novels, some games, comic books and recently a animated TV show. While many will argue that the movies are the only true source that is infallible in the star wars. Recently Lucas has been directly involved with many of the EU universe novels and information. In fact the entire clone wars which it seems everyone seems to forgot has happened has changed things vastly since the last movie (AOTC). For example I have seen complaints of things like Anakin beating Dooku so easily, well yes the last thing the movies show since the last time we see them is the loss to Dooku, but the EU explains that from EP2 to EP3 there are 3-4 years of bloody war and victories including Anakin killing off Dooku's own Sith apprentice. Of course no one knows this because they only watched the movies. This is why the Star Wars universe is so amazing the movies are only the base of a huge universe of stories and information. So before anyone jumps on makes a review complaining why this plot hole is bad and so on, go read some EU and maybe read the Character Bios of all the major characters including their EU info at star wars.com (yes even the official site gives complete credit to the EU) So for those that though there were some major missteps go do a little research and enjoy the fact the movies are only the begging of a huge universe that Lucas only began."
3633,10,this was great,"This movie was and is great! I give it a 10! This movie was good with sound effects, music, and oh whats the name...well I'll just say it looks so real! It had the best fighting scenes and music and it was also very sad too(I was about to cry)! I think everyone should see this. I say, who would give this movie a 1? Who? I loved this movie, I can't wait till it's on DVD! Ihope people agree with me. But I guess, who wouldn't? The graphics are wonderful, even if it was some times a little dark, and I love music so I know when I say this movie has a famous musician, John Williams, he's good. But the new music was even better! So like I said, I can't wait to see it again!!!!! : )"
3634,1,Didn't Lucas watch the original?,"I guess I could have explained why I gave 2's to episode 1 and 2, but frankly, in my opinion, 3 was the worst."
3635,10,"""The force is strong with this one!""","All I can say is WOW! This movie surpasses all of a my expectations! A must-see for anyone, fan or not! George has outdone himself this time! I saw it at midnight, first showing! I'm gonna see it again this weekend, and I expect to see it at least 10 times! More than worth the price of admission! Not a movie for kids under 7 or 8 though!"
3636,,The Prequel's Revenge,"I'm sorry, but the above poster who detests this film is either confused or stupid. This was the BEST of the prequels, and proves that no longer can an average shmoe off the street rant: ""The prequels suck, the old ones were classics."" No. No. No. ROTS BLOWS ""Return of the Jedi"" out of the water. I'm sorry, but THAT film was a disgrace, in my opinion more so than ""The Phantom Menace."" Weak acting? Please. I'll admit that Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman wouldn't have been my first choice to play Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala respectively, but you can tell that these two young, INEXPERIENCED actors stepped it up a notch from the previous film. Just look at the scene where Padme confesses her pregnancy to Anakin. That's probably the strongest acting between the two of them. Aside from that, Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and ESPECIALLY Ian McDiarmid (Emperor Palpatine) are both superb in this film."
3637,10,"A great end to the prequel trilogy, episode 3 confirms Star Wars' position as THE best film saga EVER!!!",The sixteen year wait from Return of the Jedi's release was well worth it! Revenge of the Seth had EVERY-THING! From dramatically explosive beginning to its gripping end.
3638,8,"After 28 years, the final chapter has given us closure.","I couldn't give this movie a 10 mainly because of Hayden Christensen's poor performance. The story, effects, and all other actors were great but as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, Christensen was just plain...bad. He was very one-level all throughout the movie, when it would have been so wonderful if we, the audience, had truly seen his struggle within as he hovered somewhere in between the dark and the light side of the force. It was embarrassing too to see Natalie Portman trying so hard to get some chemistry going with him in their love scenes...it's not good when the audience laughs at something that is supposed to be tender. But those scenes are very few in this movie. The best acting comes from Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid. Both are very believable in their roles."
3639,8,"The Force Is Strong With The CG Effects, But Lacking In The Acting","The ""final"" episode of Star Wars is most definitely an improvement upon the other two prequels. The movie was well put together explaining Anakin Skywalkers descent to the dark side yet it was full of poorly planned dialogue, lack of chemistry between the two youths, and unconvincing acting on their parts. Whenever Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman were together on screen I cringed in anticipation of their poorly delivered lines. Fortunately the movie was able to overcome this inhibiting factor by throwing together an array of special effects and a brilliantly put together musical score. The action was the most amazing of any of the Star Wars movies, yet I still longed for the clever exchanges between Han Solo and Princess Leia which were mostly improvised by the actors, but memorable none-the-less. Though the love scenes were horrific, the CG scenes more than made up for them making Revenge of the Sith an interesting conclusion to the Star Wars saga."
3640,10,Revenge of the Sith,"I love Revenge of the Sith. It is my favorite movie, I watch it every day. I have the hole thing memorized. When i saw it in the theaters I started to cry,because it was so sad. Anakin is my favorite. He is so cool. I think he did a real good job!!! The fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin was the best part in the movie. The songs were grate. The best song would have to be Battle of the Herose. I have all the CD and all six star wars movies. I have them all memorized. I collected the toys to. I even have 4 light sabers. One of the is blue, i have Darth Mal saber and the other 2 are green. I never get tired of the movies!!!!!!! I have to watch it in a different room because my family is tired of watching it!!!"
3641,,Darths and the Sith through all 6 films,"Just curious to know if Lucas had the whole idea of there only being 2 Sith lords (one master, one apprentice) in mind when he made the first trilogy. At the end of ROTJ it's obvious the Emperor wants to discard Vader and take Luke on as his new apprentice, but in ESB, did Vader realize that this was the Emperor's intention? Actually, it was he who brought up the subject of converting Luke to the dark side during the hologram conversation with Palpatine. Perhaps they were both planning to betray each other. Or maybe the idea of there only being two Sith at a time hadn't yet solidified in Lucas's mind. I do find it strange that the word Sith is never mentioned in the last three films. And when Obi-Wan refers to Vader as Darth during their final fight, it seems odd that he would use that word instead of Vader or Anakin, considering Darth is more of a generic Sith title than a name."
3642,10,my opinion,"In my opinion this was a way better movie than either of the ones before it. ie. Clone Wars and Phanton Menace. It was very entertaining until the last second. I am saying this even when i am not a fan of sci-fic or fantasy films. G. Lucas portrays the plots and settings in such a way that you cant help BUT like it. The way you can see the transition in Anakin from good to evil is superb. I thought this movie was going to be a dud, since they would have to put some much information in it, for the transition in Anakin to take place, I thought there was not going to be any action or romance, however I am happy to say all the actors along with George Lucas proved me wrong. Its one movie you wont want to miss."
3643,10,Met my expectations...,"I have liked the movies for quite sometime, as had my room-mate. We went to see Episode III last night for his b-day, and were thrilled about it."
3644,9,Vadar had Obi Wan!,"First off Revenge of the Sith is definitely the best prequel. Lucas somewhat redeemed himself after making the disastrous Episode 1 and 2. Anyway, if Obi Wan hadn't gotten lucky AGAIN on Mustafar and had the high ground, I believe that Vadar would've destroyed him. The dark side gave him a slight edge in power, but Obi Wan is smarter and lucky of course. You'd think Vadar could have jumped a lot further than he did, but I'm thinking he was too drained at that point. I also wonder why Obi Wan didn't finish him off when he caught fire, that was really cold. Maybe he thought he deserved it because he killed the Jedi children? Another thing is I'm baffled that Yoda and Obi Wan didn't try to take down Sidious together, with Vadar not at his side it could have been done, otherwise it would have been suicide. Why wait 20 years hoping to convince Luke would do it? And to hide him on Tatioone of all places?"
3645,9,Fantastic,"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was old enough to work the VCR. Since the first films came out before I could go to the movies I only saw them on the small screen and was hooked. Watched them fairly consistently until 1997 when they were re-released. WOW...I could never have imagined how different it was to see on the big screen. I was a junkie after that experience. I have all versions of the movie...special and original edition. Enough of this, on to the movie. The movie does start out exciting, but with no music. (What the hell George?!?!) Star Wars score is the most important part of the movie. What do you think of when someone says Star Wars? Light sabers, storm troopers, and Leia in the metal bikini...sure, but that wonderful music is what sticks in my mind the most. After a good amount of action, it slows up a bit and gets mushy. Which is fine, but the acting of the part of Hayden and Natalie seem to have gotten worse since the last film. They really can't convincingly convey their feelings to one another without making it sound sappy. Palpatine does the perfect job of twisting all the facts to mold Anikan into his servant. The turn, the action, the music all comes together for the last 90 minutes of the film. Truly a masterpiece. Once I see it a few more times I will see if it outranks TROTJ. Go see it, you will not be disappointed!"
3646,10,Movie between 3 and 4,"Is there a possibility of George Lucas making a star wars movie in between 3 and 4? Star wars is the trilogy of Anakin Skywalker, and their is a lot of time that goes by in between 3 and 4. Another movie would be good, but is there any possibility of that happening? All the movies were great and i am looking forward to seeing another one. I'm just a regular guy just curious about what will happen next. IF anyone has any information or has any ideas reply to my comment. Again i just think they wouldn't leave a trilogy ending like it did. At the end of episode three, Yoda says that there is way to communicate will Qui Gon Gin. What is that all about? Does that ever happen?"
3647,8,I thought this was good!,"I thought 'Revenge of the Sith' was easily the best of the Star Wars prequels, but not as good as the original trilogy. However, the film tied up many loose ends for me. I had wondered how Anakin became Darth Vader, and this was answered spectacularly with the fight scene between he and Obi-Wan."
3648,10,Perfect with one flaw,"What film does not have flaws, right? Yet, what movie is more fun to be critical on???"
3649,7,Good - But could have been a lot better,"OK - so any self-respecting Star Wars fan will concede that Ep I & II were not exactly what we would have hoped for in terms of both acting, and story lines. Yep - all the nice CGI flashes and clever ""show-off"" material from the guys at ILM really impressed me. But Star Wars is more than visual entertainment...."
3650,7,Lucas returns from the dark side.,"First up  to answer the question asked by many who have yet to see this film  no, it doesn't suck. George Lucas has redeemed himself from the awful blight that was Phantom Menace, as well as having put together a story more engaging than Attack of the Clones. But it isn't perfect."
3651,7,Lucas' own dark side...,"I thought this last chapter of the six was the most surprising, but still not the best. Lucas had it better back in the days of Luke and Leah... Yes, He definitely screwed up with JarJar, but It's safe to say that He's redeemed himself significantly with the growing 'dark' factor of Episode II, and now with Episode III. I loved the way Dookoo died so early on in the film; something I wasn't expecting to see. Summed up, I really loved this last one, and I think Lucas did an excellent job. Not to mention Steven S. helping him with it... I thought that was a smart move as well. Lucas, I congratulate you for digging yourself out of a hole, and doing it with old fashioned way. You've got my vote..."
3652,10,Excellent,"I liked this movie very much because of the actors and the action in it. I found this episode of Star wars better than the others as it is one of the most important episodes. Any one who hasn't seen this movie should as it is very very good! Despite what others may say, Hayden Christensen plays Anakin extremely well. The visual effects are very life like, not like the later episodes of star wars where the machines look like cardboard. I also enjoyed this movie because this is the episode where Anakin turns to the dark side. The movie is a bit grim and depressing as Anakin's life falls apart around him. I would see this movie again and again as i will never grow board of it and its characters. May the force be with you."
3653,8,Worth the money!,"The first thing I noticed about this movie as opposed to episodes 1 & 2 was the relaxed way the dialog flowed out of the characters. They also managed, this time, not to come off as dry and flat. The actors finally hit their stride and created depth in their personalities. They played off each other much easier. You could finally see the bonds in the various relationships. It's too bad that this is the last movie because we'll never know how much better they could have got. The movie answered most of the questions which have lingered with fans for years about Darth Vader and other things. I expect that the other answers will come out when the DVD is released and you see some of the cut footage. Overall, this was worth the $8.00 I paid to see it. It was great entertainment!"
3654,10,Perfection,"I don't speak English well, but I can't keep silent. Tragic Anakin's destiny is tearing my heart. After that film, and it's truth, for some time I had no reasons to live... Ani is selfless, he always risked, bud saved Obi-Wan from death. He loves Padme more than his life. And all of his terrible actions, joining to the dark side of the Force were done only for her saving. Anakin wanted to protect his beloved, but fate was cruel to him...I can't think about it without tears. It is the greatest film! Perfect acting, special of Hayden Christensen. He is the best young actor in the world! I think ""Revenge of the sith"" must win in all Oscar's nominations."
3655,10,wow,"This film is great I'm a huge Star wars fan and this film makes all the others make so much sense. It shows how Anakin turns to the dark side and what happens to the other Jedi. Also the Lightsabor duel with Ani and Obi is wow. And the fact that Hayden Christensen is hot makes the film even better. I think that George Lucas is amazing. How does he come up with all these great Star wars stuff? And when we find out that that Anakin only turns because he doesn't want Padme to die is pretty cool. And Yoda's a great little fighter, but I thought it was so sad when Mace Windu dies, and Anakin kind of helps Palpetine kill him. But I didn't realise that Anakin also had his legs chopped off. I can't believe the way Obi-Wan leaves him to die, well i can because Anakin tried to kill him and killed loads of other innocent Jedi."
3656,10,The best of the series,"They certainly saved the best for last.I saw this at 12.00 am on opening day.I waited in line for 2 and a half hours with a group of friends to see the last Star Wars film and i was not disappointed.From the opening crawl to the binary sunset at the end of the film i was on a roller-coaster ride of action and adventure.Fast paced and superbly edited this film has some of the greatest action sequences i have ever seen,(and i have seen a lot).It was great seeing Chewbacca again.Like catching up with an old friend.Master Yoda has never looked as good as he has as he is battling Darth Sidious in the senate chamber in the ultimate good versus evil confrontation.And for all you Jar Jar haters out there he is in the movie for maybe 5 seconds.Overall i enjoyed it so much i saw it again the same day.Not to missed on the big screen."
3657,9,Great Movie - huge gap in the Story.,This movie is great and worth the see. It continues the Star Wars saga I have been following since I was 5 years old (I am now 15). The old movies filled my mind with amazing thoughts and feelings that the new films do not fulfill as much but this is worth the see if you are interested to see what happens before the old ones. This answers many questions unanswered in the old Star Wars.
3658,4,"With the first two,he didn't turn us,so with the third,he destroyed us!","With the final installment of his ""epic"" prequel trilogy unleashed upon a very suspecting audience,Mr George""Whippy Head""Lucas should do a Yoda&go into exile.Lacking in atmosphere,tension&general coherence,the film has you racing from one planet to another,trying to immerse you in anaemic action sequences involving characters that you should care about,but don't.The same goes for the ""love"" scenes.I share more sexual tension with my Vacuum cleaner."
3659,9,The one-liner for this movie,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) was a bringing together of all the sagas. It is a masterpiece. The story is tied perfectly. Can this really be the last Star Wars? I think one of the finest scenes is between Obi-wan and Anakin on the planet of lava flows. I understand that Spielberg and Lucas collaborated. What a team! Which brings to an important fact that a fine piece of art brings to the viewers. That being the one-liner. Every movie has a one-liner. That takes into account what society thinks is important. The one-liner the press has decided to take and therefore publish is ""If you are against me..."" is NOT it. The one-liner should be Padme's line, ""As Liberty dies -- there is applause!"" May the ""Force Be With You!"""
3660,10,The whole film was Amazing!!!!!,I thought star wars episode 3 revenge of the Sith was amazing. I know people saying it isn't as good as the original star wars but i have seen the original star wars and i think the the new ones are MUCH MUCH BETTER. Hayden was great at playing Anakin because he went from being nice caring Jedi and being in love with Padme'at the beginning then slowly getting more and more anger and darker so i think he was AMAZING and he is gorgeous!!! and i thought Nataile Portman was brilliant as Padme' and she got to wear all these lovely dress which she looked great in and she had real chemistry with Hayden which you could tell on screen. 
3661,10,Cinematic Masterpiece beyond audible description,"The final installment of the Star Wars saga is a cinematic masterpiece of extraordinary proportions. From the intense lightsaber duels to the comic relief of Master Yoda's one-liners, the film brings a sense of closure to many Star Wars fans around the globe. In the end, everything comes full circle. The progression of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side and the emergence of the beloved Darth Vader. The final duel between Obi-Wan and Vader is one of the greatest duels that I have witnessed to date in cinematic history. The fact that George Lucas made the films doesn't bother me, however I dare say that this is film is better than Episode I and II combined! See the film and live the saga."
3662,4,"Yoda with lightsabre: Check!, Chewbacca: Check!,","With this film it is impossible dismiss the disappointment at what this film could have been. George Lucas has proved with previous films that he can be a skilled story-teller, unfortunately here he seems to have forgotten what it takes to build a compelling narrative. What we should have had was great characters, mystery, suspense and tragedy. Instead we are treated to a rapid-fire barrage of scenes, in which characters come and go, plot-lines open and close and we finish with a 90mph dash up to the inevitable conclusion."
3663,8,Brilliant-Could be better,"I saw revenge of the sith at 12:31am at my local cinema Thursday morning, i am a huge star wars fan but i don't think there's anyone out there that cant say they were caught up in the hype and were extremely excited about this film. I went in with incredibly high hopes and thankfully for the most part the film did deliver. "
3664,8,Underrated because of the originals,"Not being that big of a fan of the star wars saga, I have to admit I was overalls impressed with this film! The special effects where great and the story wasn't half bad! Only bad thing is the cheesy acting and acting, which isn't as bad as people make it to be. I would give it 7, but the extra point is just for the light saver duel at the end, awesome! :) also the robots are equally as impressive, C3PO and r2 are as good as ever, with the funny quotes and interaction between the 2. I think this film is underrated in the sense that it doesn't meet up to the reputation of the originals, but if we leave them out of the picture and think of this film as a stand alone movie, I'm sure that you will find it is a lot better than you expected. Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who isn't a hardcore fan, because if you are you will be bit*n for ages."
3665,10,10 10 10 10,This movie is awesome. Absolutely the best out of all six. Its the only way it could have been. In the forth episode Darth Vader said we meet again and thats what George Lucas had to do. He had to make them meet and fight it out. This movie has a lot more than just epic battle scenes and war. It shows the truth of what really happen to Anacin. He was trying to save his wife from dying and pal patine took advantage of it and when the time came around Darth Vader had some much rage and so much anger that he couldn't control it. This movie is by far the best film ever created and it deserves to be because it had everything in it. Its the best. GO SEE IT!!!
3666,8,"Stop comparing, enjoy what's new.","Being a typical ""ninties-kid"" and a women, I couldn't help myself from falling for this one. As soon as I reached the IMDb-page I was blown away and chocked by all the slaughter that was done with the user reviews."
3667,6,May the Force sort of be with you!!!,"Well what can i say. I was 5 years old when i saw A New Hope and it was something of great magnificance that did affect my life and movies forever. Just watched Revenge of the Sith and thought it was OK. But thats it. Don't know what to say as so many questions are filling my head and although i loved the first 3 movies id consider myself not to be a Star Wars book of knowledge but a few things bug me....a) At the end the Death Star is half built and Luke is 0 years old. Luke is say 15/16 years old in A New Hope and the Death Star is still not fully operational!! Who was building it!! If it takes that long then the emporer must have started building it about 40/50 years before that!!!! Did Darth and The Emps stand there looking at it for 15 years waiting!! In which time Leia grew up and got the rebel alliance together!!! I think there must have been some kind of strike and the Death Star workers downed tools for a year or two! b)Anakin turned to the dark side because of a bad dream and c)Padme died because basically she couldn't be arsed!! Leaving her 2 'special' children to look after themselves after fighting her way through the first two films!!! Like i say i enjoyed it, I'm not a star wars buff or whatever but these facts annoyed me alittle so thats why I'm on here. And as for the dragon thing OBI-Wan rides on, please, don't get me started!!!!"
3668,10,episode three... the greatest effects star wars has had yet!,"star wars ep. 3 was the greatest movie i have seen! the special effects was the biggest improvements. in all my years of acting and being a star wars fan... i have never seen a better movie than this! i hope George Lucas had a great time fixing this movie up and if there is an episode 7, it will be as good as this one! it had everything to complete the series... the origin of Darth Vader, end of the trade federation,the destruction of the jedis(which was very sad), the end of the clone wars, the death of padme & and the birth of her children, & the rise of the empire. so if you see this movie i hope you think it was as great as i think it is!"
3669,10,I remember when I first Star Wars,"This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life!!! Long live George Lucas! He is a holy man! He will never die!!! I love all the Star Wars movies especially episode 3!!! Star Wars is the best! no one other than George Lucas could've thought of Star Wars. I remember when I first Star Wars 6 years ago. Yes I know, but I'm only 12. The first time I've ever heard of Star Wars was in 1997 when the Special Edition was coming out. When I was watching The Phantom Menace for the first time, i said, ""Mom, where's the guy that breathes weird?"" I was referring to Vader because I saw him in the commercials then I saw the movie. I WAS SO CONFUSED!!! The Phantom Menace was actually the very first movie I saw. I never went because I was afraid that the loud music in theaters would damage my ears. When I saw Star Wars, I was stunned when it finished. I got every Star Wars collectible their was."
3670,4,Missed it by that much,I've liked all the episodes so far. I was awaiting this one to see the package wrapped up with a nice bow.
3671,10,Hilarious,"EVERYONE should see Star Wars 3. I went to see with 2 friends and laughed all the way through it. Obi-Wan's wooden acting, R2D2's rocket pads, the fact that Padme died after because she gave up the will to live. But none of these hilarious incidents can even compare to Darth Sideous. The part where he MELTED. People said it was a bit weird but they were wrong. As he cried out, ""I'm growing weaker!"", I knew that Goerge Lucas was an idiot. There were other things as well. The fact that Anakin could could not twig on that Darth Sideous was telling him that he was a Sith. Not even when Darth Sideous started talking about his master, Darth Plageous the Wise! What was that!?!?!? There were other stupid things. In the final fight one Anakin's arms disappeared. Watch it carefully and see. What were Sideous and Anakin watching when they were talking about Plageous? It looked like a big ball of sperm. Chewbacca must be at least 60 now and the Death Star apparently takes 20-30 years to build, yet after it was destroyed for the first time it only took 3 years. I finish this review with the words, Goerge Lucas is worse than Ed Wood, and Ed Wood tried to make a good film."
3672,7,blown away,"For the 3rd or final installment of Star Wars, however you liked to view it, I must say it was fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat during the Obi-Won vs Anakin scene, & I felt a chill when we were shown the Darth Vader sequence. It left me wishing that there would be an episode 3 1/2 so we could see more of Lord Vader. I only hope to see George Lucas make another trilogy because i would be first in line. The opening sequence was awesome, it had everything this series has given viewers; laughter, great action and good light-saber sequence. I would say the only downside to these movies is some of the villains should be around longer. As with phantom menace, Darth Maul's character should still be somewhere in the fold, and now we are introduced to a General Grievous (nasty with a light-saber). I'm not sure I understand the constant coughing, he's a droid. All in all a great film, leaving you wanting more."
3673,10,The Coolest Star Wars Movie out of the entire Saga !!!,"Definitely without a doubt the best movie of the entire 6 episode saga. This movie makes visible all the stories we imagined over the years in regards to the fall of anakin and the Jedi. The special effects were faultless and the story was as we expected. Anyone who says the story was disappointing is talking nonsense, this is how we knew it would be and the music was definitely the best of the first three films. Without a doubt this movie will break all the records not only because everyone wants to see how the saga ends - but how no-one helps anakin when he needs help so desperately and how his eventual fall was only a matter of time. (I doubt it will beat the gross of Titanic though)"
3674,10,Hayden Christensen is lush,I think that this is the best film in world mainly because Hayden Christensen is a star in this. He is just so sexy! what else could you wish for other than a 24 year old six packed blonde called Hayden Christensen with luscious lips.This film is brilliant. I think the director George Lucas should make the other films as well because these films have been a success and then I will be able see more of Hayden Christensen too! He is an amazing director and should create the others too. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD because i am going to watch it every single day before i go to sleep and have sweet dreams after seeing my hubby Hayden. I really can't wait i'm so excited.
3675,10,Stroke of genius,"Coming into Episode III I had high expectations; I was not disappointed. This movie has the best writing of any of the Star Wars movies. The audience can understand the motivation of all of the main characters. The falling action of Episode III is outstanding. It perfectly sets the stage for ""A New Hope"". The movie was great, but it didn't feel right until I saw the end. Writers dream of creating an ending such as this. Darth Vader may the most thoroughly developed character in motion picture history. All three prequels center on how he came to be. The audience is made to see how he came to the dark side through his situations and circumstances."
3676,10,I Love Star Wars Episode III,"This was the best Star Wars movie of them all. It is very well put together. It's funny with all the irony and that you already know whats going to happen. It's a great ending to an awesome phenomenon. I love Hayden Christensen and I also love Ewan McGregor. The fight sequences are amazingly well shot. The graphics are by far the best i have ever seen. Seeing this movie made me want to watch the Star Wars series all over again. Did I mention that I love Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor. Some people said it was going to be a bad movie, but I urge you to go and see this movie at least five times. OK, maybe just once, but once you see it, you will want to go and see it again to relive the phenomenon that is Star Wars!!!!"
3677,10,"The tale of how Lord Vader came to be. His reasons, his back story all these finished off from the last prequels.","This film is truly great. This film defines the whole star wars series and has an emotionally depth which talk to you subliminally. Star Wars Episode III is the tale of how Lord Vader came to be, How lord Sidious came to be and how the republic fell into an age of darkness. I feel this film is the greatest in the whole saga because its the movie that defines what happens next in the originals. Also the Sith battles are amazing so many special effects that you believe it is real.Also this film establishes links between the originals but then ago so does each prequel but this film is mega. you can feel the anger in Lord Vader's eyes, you can see the sorrow in Master Yodas.This film also tells you why Darth turned to the darkside and you get to know the younger Obi-Wan a little better. All credit to the genius George Lucas who created the saga we know call Star Wars. The storyline and plot of this film is extremely intense and always keeping you on the edge of your seat, Terrible truths are discovered and terrible things happen but all this does is make you watch on. This is a superb film, a real classic which helped influence lots of new films today. Definitely worth a watch actually its so good I recommend you go out right now and buy the complete Star wars Saga so you've always got it up your sleeves. Truly Amazing."
3678,8,"A fitting end to the series, no matter how trivially silly it is","Star Wars is one of the most defining films in the history of cinema. It was both revolutionary and brilliant. The golden visual style and special effects amazed both children and adults. It had an appealing story with appealing characters, as well as quite possibly the most infamous cinema villain in history: Darth Vader. Spawning off of the success of Star Wars were two mesmerizing sequels, continuing the story and each one improving the visual style. But creator George Lucas's story wasn't through For another decade and a half, he lay silent, until ti was announced that Lucas was returning to the big screen with three prequel films. Fans were excited again. People waited in line for months before the first one was released. The Phantom Menace in 1999 broke several opening day box office records. But what fans got, they didn't like. It was hugely disappointing. ""Too childish."" some said. ""Lacks the spirit of the originals."" said others. One way or another, most everyone disliked this film (including myself.) Attack of the Clones, the second prequel, released in 2002, fixed some of the problems The Phantom Menace had, taking on a much more adult story and adult themes than Phantom menace tackled. But this time, George dug himself into a whole new hole. While it was met with a much more positive word of mouth, it grossed over 100 million dollars less than Phantom menace did. This time, people were calling Clones ""Too boring"" and ""Full of silly dialogue""."
3679,10,This movie is crazy good!,"Besides the whole movie being blurred by my tears (because it's so sad!!) it was CLEAR that Star Wars is THE best sci-fi movie I've ever seen. I HATE sci-fi or anything that has to do with sci-fi, but this movie just made my day. If you haven't seen it already, see it. It's crazy baby! I seriously suggest watching it over and over again. Just so that you get into your brain what an awesome movie this really is. I don't think that any of the other Star Wars movies even compares with this one. The only part that is nearly as good as this movie is ""Luke, I am your father."" O.K. maybe the earlier movies can compare, but I am still a firm believer that this movie was the best ever. Out of the Star Wars movies that is. thank you, and have a spectacular day!"
3680,6,"""I got a bad feeling about this....""",I was a kid when the first 3 (IV through VI) came out. I don't remember breathing at all during the final scene of the first movie.
3681,10,a mistake in the movie...,"Sorry about my English(I am from Serbia)...I loved this film,it has everything...but I notice one mistake in the movie:when Mace Windu and Palpatine fights,and when Mace kicked Palps,and when Palps fell down,his lights fells out window...and later,there is a well-known scene when Yoda and Palpatine have a light-saber duel...and the question is:how is possible that Palpatine have lights,when his lights is fall down out of window in fight with Mace Windu???Sorry for my English,again.Really,I wery love this movie,it is sooooo emotional,and John Williams is proved again that he is best in his business.And Ewan McGregor...I have no words to say,he is absolutely brilliant,and Hayden's act is way much better than in episode 2."
3682,10,Feel the force for the last time,"Forget about any mistakes or any not-precisely-well-made connections to the original trilogy. Just enjoy a wonderful movie. A movie which completes a saga. A movie which just makes you hold your breath and unite with millions of other fans. Just enjoy it on the big screen while you can. Movies should make you feel as if you are in the very place the movie is taking place. Please tell me haven't you felt in the room with palpatine and dooku and anakin and obi-wan. Haven't you felt that you are alongside obi-wan while he destroyed griveous, Did you not feel yoda's control and superiority fighting against sidious. Anakin's anger, Padme's pain, Obi-wan's nobility as if you actually were near them. Well when was the last time you felt that you actually were in the movie. Mine was 19th May. I felt the force for the last time."
3683,10,Star Wars Episode lll review Revenge of the Sith,"I rated Star Wars 10/10 because of many reason. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The graphics are unbelievable. And the choreography is the best i have ever seen. They keep good humor in it. PG-13 Makes the movie be able to be more tense and violent.The acting could be better, the dialogue could be way better. but the characters acting canceled the stupid parts.The acting was bad at parts, especially when padme and anikan have their ""love"" scenes. Yoda is better than ever. I am mad that MAce Windu dies. And all the ""good"" clones are really evil (that did not surprise to many people!) The part where anikan kills the young-lings was unbearable."
3684,7,Is Acting Nothing ?,"As the highly anticipated Revenge of the Sith finally made its appearance in my town, i was excited beyond comprehension! to see the final episode of Star Wars in theater was an experience that i had been waiting for since EpI. I was not let down by the S/FX music, plot, story line, and theatrical performance. When it came to the acting on the other hand, it seemed like George had grabbed a bunch of good-looking ""wanna-be's"" fresh from the garden with little to no experience. Their lines seemed chunky and overly dramatic. I'm sure a movie making guru like George was not going for this affect and i thought he would have realized that though the actors were sexy and modern they just weren't what he needed to make this amazing piece of sci-fi history.... none the less it was amazing and worth seeing again and again..if you love star wars that is"
3685,8,Birth of the Empire,"Just saw the movie this weekend and it's excellent for its genre. The thread in the plot where Anakin is lured by the dark side and turns into the evil George Bush is quite compelling. Kind of puts the other movies into context, like the ""Attack Of The Clones"", the exception being that the feeble minded clones are not controlled by blind religious fervor and unquestionable obedience to their masters/makers, only the latter is needed for the movie version. Also of note is how Palpatine Cheney gets control of the senate by deception, hypocrisy and underhanded actions and brings about the destruction of the Jedi's. And so the birth of the Empire commences."
3686,,Star Wars is Dead...Lucas Killed It,"The unbelievably childish dialogue, the awkward over-expressed acting, the faults in the storyline...thats pretty much all this film has to offer."
3687,10,Who couldn't enjoy it?,"Had it's downs, as all movies do, but the ups over compensated entirely. Had more story, better action, and over all the best content in the entire series. Can anyone justify otherwise? The love lines were, as before, not Shakespeare, but the development of Anakin into Vader was astounding. Most true Star Wars fans knew how and why Anakin received/wears the ""Vader"" suit, but seeing it for the first time; amazing! The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan (as most true fans knew was going to happen), was spectacular and amazing as well. And, to John Williams, your music is god; don't let anyone tell you different. Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith get 2 (and then some) thumbs up from me."
3688,5,Tries too Hard,Well I wasn't expecting much from this really after the Dire Phantom Menace and the truly awful Attack of the Clones and it's safe to say I got even more of what I expected.
3689,10,I found a HUGE mistake!! (SPOILERS),"In Episode III Padme dies right after giving birth to Luke and Leia, but then in Episode VI when Luke asks Leia if she remembers her mother she says she does have a few memories of her. How the heck does that work! She was adopted by Senator Organa and his wife when she was two/three days old. This is a huge plot mistake. I also noticed another, more minor mistake occurs in Episode III. C-3PO's lower's right leg (From the knee down) in Episodes IV, V, and VI is silver while the rest of his body is gold. And in Episode III the leg isn't silver, it's gold like the rest of his body. Also if you're going to see Star Wars in the theater, this is the one to see! It's amazing, but much more violent than the other five movies, so watch out with younger kids. All over I loved it, twas awesome!! But What happens to Anakin after his duel with Obi-Wan is really harsh, and painful-looking. There's also a huge duel between Yoda and the Emperor, obviously they both live because they're in the original three movies. However the scene is largely intense none the less."
3690,4,It's so bad,The bad:
3691,8,great movie,"I saw Revenge of the Sith last night, and i thought it was a great movie. Although there were some serious bits that were kinda crappy and some of the droid voices were really iffy and Hayden Christensen isn't that much of a good actor, it still pulled off something that i think we really needed to top off one of the best stories ever written. There were some unbelievably awesome sequences and Ian McDiarmid was absolutely brilliant. The CGI is just stunning, probably the best so far up to this point in time, they really outdid themselves. As soon as i left home i went and watched a new hope, and wow did it make it heaps better. These prequels really gave a lot of more emphasis and understanding of 4,5, and 6, and so when i watched a new hope, things such as obi wan and Darth Vader meeting again after about 30 years and seeing where chewie ended up and seeing what the skywalkers have grown into have been given a greater emphasis and i believe creates a greater effect overall. Its a must see, its a great movie!"
3692,1,from my point of view this film is evil,Bad CGI look absolutely ridiculousness<br /><br />Hayden christian cant act <br /><br />bad child acting from the kids in he Jedi temple made the seen too cheesy<br /><br />Natalie port-man dos'tn even let her kids watch this she was so bad at acting at the time <br /><br />bad script and terrible dialogue overall alongside the CGI and flawed storytelling and bad character development and motivation<br /><br />plot holes often in the form of fan-service Easter eggs that make the original trilogy combined with the prequels make no sense
3693,9,a non-Star Wars Fan review,"OK , I admit it. I haven't see all the Star Wars movies. I did see the first one when it came out in the 1970's. I was a kid and it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. There was really nothing like it back then. Now, there are hundreds of movies out each year with wonderful (albiet computer generated) special effects. This movie definitely surpasses anything I have seen. I never expected to like this movie. I really thought, given my limited experience with Star Wars, that I would be lost. But that wasn't the case. I did understand what was going on and why."
3694,7,Overall impression outweighs follies,"Episode III is yet another blockbuster hit for George Lucas. Unfortunately, the content is lacking, the acting is mediocre, and the reliance on a combination of visual effects thrown into a single scene detract from the great movie that it could become. By saying the content is lacking,it's saying that the movie seems to revolve too much around a couple in love, portrayed by actors that poorly deliver the already cliché lines that Lucas has written. In attempt to make up for this fault, it seems Lucas has amped up on a collaboration of eye-catching and powerful visual effects that leave the viewers too amazed to realize what is actually being said by the actors. On a more positive note, since a good majority of the movie is computer generated, lacking much diegetic sound, one must appreciate the work of foley artists. Also, the score of Episode III aids in taking away from the poor acting. It can then be said that the makers successfully covered up their blunders by use of computer generated animations and amazing sound effects. But because Lucas always manages to end with a bang, it seems to leave viewers with a good overall impression of the movie, a high concept film in respects-it exploits exciting and memorable endings along with a myriad of visual effects."
3695,6,"The Acting, Oh My","Plot and eye-candy aside, on the acting: Thankfully, McDiarmid and McGregor delivered solid performances and seemed to fully embrace the film's dark message. McDiarmid's portrayal as an innate evil was not overdone, but modestly tempered with a side of flare you'd expect an evil dictator. While McGregor's character seemed to carry the inner struggle likely found in a person in his shoes."
3696,10,This movie is awesome!,"If you are a Star Wars fan or not even a Star Wars fan and know the basic story line you have to see this movie. Truefully this is the best movie I've seen since Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I believe this movie deserves all the attention it gets. Hopefully it gets some nominations from A.M.P.A.S. See this movie as soon as humanly possible. This movie contained everything. Great acting, special effects and storyline. Star Wars: revenge of the Sith was also action packed from beginning to end. You can't get enough of this movie when you leave it you keep wanting more when you leave the theater. There is not even one boring scene in this movie. It is the perfect piece to fit the puzzle I've ever seen in movie history."
3697,8,"Its not a perfect movie, but it's Star Wars","I would just like to say something to all those who are criticising the way Anakin turns to the dark side. There is the way that people have imagined and think it to be, and there is the way George Lucas envisaged it, and that is the key - it's his baby, he determines the story and whether or not it fits the the fan's status quo, the fact of the matter is that Anakin has turned to the dark side, and now we know how, and I for one am grateful to have seen and enjoyed the final instalment of the saga. "
3698,9,"Review for Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of The Sith (published in May 25th issue of ""The Press and Journal"" in Pennsylvania, USA",Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of The Sith
3699,10,A different world,"Facts are facts. The Old Republic was a different place than the era of the Rebel Alliance vs the Empire. The Jedi of this time are far superior to that of the original trilogy. By ROTJ Luke has all of about 4 months of training under his belt. Ben Kenobi trained for nearly 20 years before he was even allowed to face the trials and become a knight. Kenobi is now a Master and Anakin is damn near that rank as well. So of course they are able to defeat Dooku with more ease than the last time they faced him. People were predetermined to be set against this film and I find that rather sad. It's a brilliant film. The love between Padme and Anakin is going to be a different love than we know. It would be like claiming to know what it's like to live the life of a film star when you aren't one. There's no way of knowing that you would feel the same way about everything around. Power changes people and Anakin has that in spades. And we are shown that Anakin's power has grown in that he lost an arm last time and now wins, fairly simple to see I'd say."
3700,10,All Tied in,"Not only is this movie and introduction to the most popular Villain there is but is also the introduction to his two children. George Lucas has finally given the old and young star wars fanatics the final pieces to a rather complex jigsaw puzzle. He leaves no stones unturned and no questions left unanswered. The movie keeps you hooked from the start and in typical Goergoe Lucas style the dialog was a bit chunky, but needed to be in order to answer all questions to the Star Wars Saga. Hayden Christiensen, and Ewan McGregor had one of the best fights I have seen apart from Yoda and Chancellor Palatine. Lucas has once again set a high bar for sci-fi movies, and I can't wait to see how the T.V. Series will turn out."
3701,8,Question: Why secret marriage?,"Seems as though some of the plot turns around the fact that Anakin/Padme's marriage is secret. I thought I heard her say that if anyone knew, she could no longer be a senator (or whatever) - but friends of mine are telling me it was because Jedi's weren't supposed to marry. I've NEVER heard anything like that in any of the movies. Besides which, clearly SOME of the characters knew they were married. I think there was a scene with Yoda warning Anakin not to get too attached to trying to save Padme, as it would put him on a bad path. So Yoda would have to have known about the marriage at that point. Anyway. . . does anybody know the real scoop on why the marriage had to be a secret?"
3702,10,greatest star wars film,the star wars movies have always and will always be the greatest set of movies on the planet. but revenge of the sith really completed the saga it was really the best of them all. i think it was so great because how it showed anakin turn to the dark side it was really great. the only thing i hated about the movie was padme dieing that really sucked. everything else about the movie was really awesome and if you haven't well then i suggest that you hurry the hell up and see it people. it is definitely the best of the 6 movies. i am waiting for revenge of the sith to come out on DVD and i'll have all six movies on DVD. hurry up and come out on DVD please!!!!!
3703,9,Quite pleased...,"After being SO disappointed with Episodes I and II (although repeat viewings have caused them to both grow on me), I was quite pleased with Episode III."
3704,6,This was not Star Wars as it should be,"This film is woeful for star wars, the acting was horrible, Darth Vader's ""noooooooo"" was ridiculous and cheesy, MACE WINDU shouldn't have died like that and how the hell did the emperor take out three Jedi masters and then get his ass kicked by one, The original trilogy is by far the best and George Lucas probably knows it, he milked the franchise for all it was worth, HE WOKE THE DEAD. This new trilogy should never have been made, General Grievous was supposed to be the greatest hand to hand combat fighter in the galaxy and he was killed by the mediocre Obi Wan Kenobi, I don't think i could be any more disappointed, I've seen it twice now and it hasn't improved. i tried to deny it but the truth overwhelmed me in the end, it was so bad i haven't slept in 3 days"
3705,10,Best Star Wars flick yet!,"I read a lot of reviews that dismissed the dialog, and the acting. First off, NONE of the Star Wars movies have ever been really exceptional when it comes to the dialog. It's part of the movies charm. If you don't like movies like that, you probably didn't like any of the Star Wars movies anyway. Check out The Princess Bride for better dialog. The action was AWESOME, the effects ground breaking, and the story; unbeatable! All 3 Prequals have been plagued by over-expectations. I'm saddened by the fact that there will be no more movies in the Star Wars series. It may be for a good reason, that doesn't mean I have to like it. Star Wars for me has been what REAL movies are! Another world that I don't get to experience in real life. Not simply a drama about everyday things. By the way, Yoda ROCKS THE HOUSE!! While other Jedi are somewhat slow to see the danger, Yoda moves like the Godfather of the Jedi he is!"
3706,9,Why they don't use it like it's real?,"At First Padmé is not playing well. Her eyes looks down and up again and again when she speaks to Anakin and others. That's really makes you feel that's she is acting. And when Obi and Anakin meet to fight in Mustafar, Anakin says ""You only try"" like he is the one or he is already Darth Vader. "
3707,10,Star Wars Legend,"Mr . George Lucas RULES! Yup, he's done it again!!! This guy knows how to capture people, tie them up in front of that screen, have them get addicted and be a loyal follower of his cult. When episode 4 came out, I wasn't even born yet. But since those movies got into my life, my life has never been the same. When i heard they were shooting the first 3 episodes, i thought they couldn't be able to catch the same spirit. Then i watched the first episode, it changed my mind completely. Along came the 2nd one, then i fell in love. Last one also didn't surprise me and there we go! This set of 6 movies the best things that have ever happened to Hollywood and movie world. I love all 6 of them and i always will..."
3708,10,I really liked it!!,"I have watched Star Wars movies since I was a little girl, over and over again. I loved them then and I really still do. I liked the first two episodes but they did not measure up to what I thought they should be. Specifically, I would have liked to see the movies develop the relationship of Anakin and Padme more, but that is just my preference. This movie is great!!! It exceeded my expectations and I really was pleased at how they developed everything and blended it into the original trilogy. I really would like to see the Star Wars saga continue, whether it be the remaking of the originals or a continuation of the original trilogy. The Star Wars saga is timeless, and that it's popularity can only increase."
3709,10,Revenge of the Sith is the bomb,"I have always been a big fan of the series. And have been anticipating the final installment for a while now. The plot outline we all pretty much already knew. But this was probably the greatest piece of filling in the blanks of a story in history. They used this film to set up perfectly for episode 4. The fight scenes were out of this world, and they brought everything to full circle. If your a fan of the series you will love this film and want to see it again and again. If you weren't crazy about the rest of the series this will be a average movie to you with a cool ending. I for one have been a Star wars fan since i was a little kid and loved the movie. and it supplied me with everything i was hoping for."
3710,7,"Bad Acting, Bad Dialogue, but entertaining","I'm not nitpicking when i say that i can't take hayden seriously as darth vader. His voice is still too soft and his anger is never really convincing. His constant glowering is also rather annoying. Padme, once a brave and determined senator and queen, has for some reason or another been reduced to that of some fearful woman who cant help herself. The only good acting was done by the chancellor himself, actually, very good now that i remember. This isn't intended to be an essay on the movie, so basically...Yes, it tied up loose ends and connected 3 to 4. Yes, there were awesome fight scenes. Yes, the plot is generally interesting, And yes, it was overall better than 1 and 2. But the poor dialogue remains and the casting of some west coast underwear model type of guy will forever tarnish what this movie could have accomplished in its search for redemption on the last two. Wasn't a bad movie, but it simply wasn't going to be one that is going to be remembered. Maybe my expectations were too high being a respectful fan of the trilogy. I however, believe the rating shouldn't be as good as what is being given right now..(8.2). IT's exactly like how ROTK is rated higher than the first two, even though the third one was arguably the worst of the three...interesting"
3711,10,Best of the six,"The greatest Star Wars of them all! It was almost perfect. Just another hour (give or take a few minutes), with more of the 'Darth Vader' side of the story, and the film would have"
3712,10,Read for fun,"I started to watch star wars when I were just a little baby and has always loved it. I think ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is by far the best star wars movie of them all but I hold this as my number 2 in my ""best star wars list"". I know lot of people don't like the new ones and about the two first i can actually agree with them but this movie is AWESOME! I mean like it is just great because this is one of few movies where there is always something fun to see, always! So if you haven't seen any star wars movies then watch them all! but if you only want to watch one I strongly recommend this one, one of the greatest film ever! "
3713,7,The Jedi...,"The original star wars have got to be the best and it is hard to beat that, but it was still a very good stopping point for George Lucas. At least for this series."
3714,6,"Best of I - III, but...","'Sith' is easily the best of episodes I - III, but none of them belong anywhere near the same class as IV - VI. I enjoyed 'Sith,' but I have the following criticisms: "
3715,8,Is the emporer really gone????,I just finished watching ROTS and was confused by something at the end. I cant remember all the names of the planets or exactly the dialog but this is pretty much what confuses me. 
3716,10,wow,"This film was worth the wait i have already seen it twice, Star Wars 3 answers all the questions connected to the other 5 films. In this Stars Wars your emotions are played with some what there are funny parts of the film and there are parts that are slightly upsetting, not enough to make you cry. This film is proper edge of your seat stuff, even though after watching the other 5 Star Wars film you will have a rough idea of what is going to happen but this film still has a wow factor about it, the fight scenes are brilliant, and there are parts of it that is quite unpredictable. Its sad that this is the last film in the Star Wars collection but i think if any more films were made it would be ruined and a bit like Jaws. (How many times can you kill a shark?)"
3717,,HBO Edit? (possible spoiler warnings),"I did a double take and thought that something was missing but Star Wars: Episode III premiered on HBO tonight and while the ambush of all the Jedi across the galaxy was taking place I felt that something was missing. Something cool. Something visual. And then it hit me! Did HBO cut out the ""goose-stepping"" scene where Anakin leads the clone troopers inside the Jedi Temple. The movie went right to Cody giving back the light Sabre to Obi Wan Kanobi and the rest of the Jedi slaughter and the first time we see Anakin again is right before he kills the younglings. Why, if one is going to edit violence do you choose troops marching rather than the actual deaths? I can think of a few reasons, but I would like to hear our thoughts."
3718,8,A little bit Flat to be honest,"The action was good, the fighting was good, it didn't seem quite a deliberate as the last one and therefore has a better flow to it. The way Anakin's choice was dealt with made me feel flat and I think that is the bit that's bothering me the most. It's a real shame all 6 were not made all together. "
3719,6,Why only a 6,"The second half saved it, the first half wasn't good at all... some graphics where so obvious computer generated it was embarrassing! And then there was the opening scene, I sought I was watching something for children below the age of 10 seeing the pink and ugly green lasers flying around. The worst part was however when Anakin decides to go the dark way, one moment he's still not sure if he will go that way then after he decides to take the dark path he's suddenly slaying children what was that about?! The second half however did give it a more mature feeling (the viewing age seemed to have gone from below 10 to lets just say older) I did like the bad vibe Anakin had when they portrayed him with his cape over his head. But overall it's still a film for children is my opinion and not for someone like me (34), there actually where a lot of children there"
3720,10,Best. Star Wars. Film. Ever.,"Wow. Now people will kill me for this but, best movie since Empire Strikes back. This movie grabs you by your pajamas from the very opening sequence, and when that Star Wars logo popped on screen and the theme music started, everyone in my sold out theater went freaking crazy, including me. Something I enjoyed was that when Anakin shows aggression, fear or hate, you can lightly hear the Darth Vader March in the background. Now, this movie is extremely depressing, mostly because Anakin was a good person and everything is slowly being ripped away from him. The poor guy was being torn in 3 different direction's. Ewan McGregor gives a powerful performance, especially in the final half hour of the film. The acting and story and special effects are all equally tight, but the story steals the show. Anakin is PULLED to the dark side out of a misguided act of love to save Padme, his wife from dying. He feels alienated from the Jedi, even his best friend Obi-Wan. When Anakin does something to protect Palpatine, in which you know the good man in him will be gone until ROTJ, you feel bad for him because he is being so deceived. Well, Hayden(anakin) does a WAY better job acting this time, and that will be my ending note. My favorite movie now. Seen it twice in a week. GO SEE IT."
3721,7,"The Force is strong, but Lucas lost the plot...","Minor Spoilers contained. (Are there any 'spoilers' left in this movie?!) No doubt 'Revenge of the Sith' will do phenomenally well at the box office. There surely aren't many people, who are even remotely interested in movies, who will want to miss out on not only the missing link in one of the most successful and popular movie franchises of all time, but also the chance to see the on-screen ascension (or rather, descension) of possibly the most iconic villain in movie history."
3722,9,Anakin Skywalker turning to the Dark Side,"Though I am not a Star Wars fanatic, I do like the movies. I loved the first three (Episodes 4, 5 and 6), and eagerly awaited the release of the first episode. I was hugely disappointed as the only things worth watching in that movie was the pod race and Darth Maul vs Kwaigon and Obi Wan."
3723,8,Film Review on Special Effects,Film Review 
3724,6,"Better than 1/2, worse than 4/5/6",***Spoilers***
3725,10,"A Great film, proud to be apart of the adventure.","Well, what can i say? The film of our generation by a long shot. This film had the visuals that could knock the socks off any other film. The lightsaber we're amazing and i mean probably the best i have seen out of all of the sags's. This is coming from a person who adores the original saga and looks at the new saga as some what inferior. I counted a total of 6 total lightsaber battles. But i don't want to give too much away."
3726,10,Whiners,"Attention everyone! I have just a few things to say, first shut up, and second the movie is great! I checked out how many people that had given it a good review and how many that had given it a bad review, not to surprising it had gotten good reviews from the general public, overall at least..... To those people who whine about that most seem to think it's a good film, learn to be tactical and diplomatic or else i will have to consider you to be utterly stupid! If you don't like the movie just say so, don't go around insulting those who do, that doesn't get you anywhere! As a person who is very well learned in most areas, i know it's strange cause i'm only 19, but i have actually gotten scholarships because of my speaking skills, writing skills and general learning so in some measure i do know what i'm talking about but i'm definitely not an expert, i am just surprised at some peoples reactions against the movie. Now keep in mind that i can perfectly understand why you think as you do, but i can take the things you complain about and show you why they're good. The dialog is the way it is because of the sources of George Lucas inspiration. I'm call myself a cineast, i collect Kurosawa films, old German silent movies and modern french, Japanese and American movies. As i have watched much old or if you want ancient movies i can see directly what George Lucas is trying to do. He is trying to recreate his childhood matinées with their stiff dialog which is very difficult to master. Also keep in mind that even though not all of the acting is meant to be like this, some actors aren't actually that good and when this is the case, it shows. Also keep in mind that not all people are fit to act in front of a blue screen, it's actually pretty hard. But this is not the case in the entire movie and i understand why those of you who don't know the old movie industry as i and some of my friends do can't see that, if i wasn't so interested in old movies i might also perceive this to be bad acting, i don't know..... As for those of you who are older and don't like the movies, i call it the loss of the inner child complex, you watched the movies when you were little but now that you've gotten older and ""more mature"" you can't bring yourself to like these movies, maybe because of that you haven't grown up with technology as todays youths or maybe because of sheer stubbornness i don't know. Or it might actually be so that i doesn't fit your personal taste, it's impossible for everyone to like a movie. But to look at the facts, the movie has gotten almost only good reviews, here in Sweden it has a grade of 9,34 out of ten from the cinema-goers and it's not that different in other countries either, in France it is the first American film to have so many visitors and the same for six other European countries. For you who says that it isn't deep, please! The inner conflict is magnificent, Palpatine aka Ian Mcdiarmid shows the emotional plot of the film with every gesture, every move and Natalie Portman plays better than any of the great female stars of old, well maybe not better than Ingrid Bergman and Liz Taylor, butt still! These movies are for people who still likes to imagine, people who are creative, as the special effects are creative and groundbreaking, so is the movie. So for those who complain about others giving it good grades, shut up, we've only seen something that you have missed or forgotten or just doesn't like......"
3727,9,This was a great movie,"I liked this movie a lot. I've only recognized one PG-13 item in this movie. I couldn't find anything else. Anyway, I think Tyranus/Dooku was killed too soon in the movie. And also, Grievous could've just coughed himself to death, but the reason they went after him was to stop the war (unsure if this was a spoiler or not. Either way, I marked this spoiler). My favorite parts would definitely be Obi-Wan vs. Grievous and Obi-Wan vs. and Anakin. I also liked the Star Fighter Chase scene when Anakin and Obi-Wan are on their way to the ""Invisible Hand"", Grievous' starship, to save the Chancellor. I give this movie a 9. All in all, I liked this movie greatly."
3728,10,Wow,"So there's a few moments of weak dialogue, we know what they are, and maybe the last word we hear from Darth is a bit comical, but the movie is gold and I love it and will see it many many times. It's a Star Wars movie and that's one of the highest compliments you can give to a movie. This is the closest I've ever come in a movie theatre to the magic of the original trilogy. There's raw emotion, some dazzling scenes, and an opening that's just fun. The moment of Anakin's transition is handled perfectly, it's a decision like so many that anyone makes. In a split second, he does something foolish, irrational, and he's condemned by that to a path which he can't escape. My only real wish for this movie would be an actual appearance by Qui Gonn rather than a reference to him. Well, thanks to George Lucas for great memories."
3729,10,This movie is a masterpiece,"This movie is simply brilliant. With a love story furthered from the previous saga in Episode II, and with all the action needed to satisfy any Star Wars fan, this movie captures the essence of what George Lucas has tried to portray for years now. This movie is what I feel the best out of the six, and it is a shame that we will see no more Star Wars movies. If George Lucas plans to make a movie like this with the name Star Wars discarded, you better believe that I will be watching it. After watching this movie I find myself humming the Star Wars theme song, and find myself wishing I was caught up in this world. With betrayal, love, action, disaster, and false happiness all enclosed in one movie, this film should go down as one of the all time greats. My recommendation is to watch Episode 1 and 2 if you have not (even though they are not close to as brilliant as this one). Thanks George Lucas, this one is breathtaking."
3730,10,Revenge of the Sith is a Masterpiece,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is simple a masterpiece it is up there with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back this movie has fantastic action with the best Lightsaber duels of the saga and great clone war battles which show off the brilliant CGI which will be the best you'll see this year I promise you but Revenge of the Sith is also very emotional I cried and got misty eyed many times like the slaughter of the Jedi and the birth of the twins and that is very unusual for me, so in conclusion I've seen this movie twice and I'm already planning on see it again and again if you have not seen this movie yet than leave your computer and GO SEE IT NOW."
3731,6,It was okay,"It was average. Definitely the best of the new ones. Left me with several more questions than answers. Still there was the ridiculous dialog, but you cannot fault the actors for that. I can not stand how Lucas brings in all of these new characters for just a few moments in the movie and kills them such as General Grevious and Darth Maul just to name a couple. Where was Boba Fett? While a character like Tarkin is not even really introduced in this movie. It is frustrating to think that this is over on such a note. These new movies could have been so much better. However I cannot complain too much about the last one. I shouldn't have expected so much out of it after episodes one and two. I guess my biggest problem is concerned with Padme. She was not supposed to die. How did Leia remember her mother when she was a young child? I wish the ending was longer. Poor James Earl Jones got the crappiest lines. The talent he has was wasted. I don't remember the Darth of old with such asinine lines."
3732,10,The lost link,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Star Wars is part of my life.I spent my childhood playing with star wars toys and watching those movies where the impossible became true.Star Wars is my generation's mythology. 16 years after ROTJ, the saga was back.The times were different,the people reactions,too. All we loved star wars thought that new movies could have been better. And i have to say that i watched TPM 10 times,but... I told my friends that Lucas had many things to tell us in Episode III,maybe too many... When i watched the teaser trailer of TPM in 1999 i felt like a 5 years old boy,then i didn't have that feeling again with the two prequels (although it were good).I didn't have that feeling ...till now."
3733,,"Anakin's ""Father""","There is a scene in Sith where Palpatine is talking to Anakin about Darth Plagueis being able to manipulate the force, and taught his apprentice everything he knew. I know they were talking of keeping someone from dying, but if he could manipulate the force, then couldn't Palpatine have created Anakin by manipulating the force to help conceive Anakin, therefore being Anakin's ""father""? It never really explains the whole father thing. Other than the prophecy. I dunno, also the Leia remembering her mother. I read the book the day it came out and when Padme died it surprised me because of the comments made by Leia in ""Jedi"" saying she remembers her mother. I figured the scene in ""Sith"" would show a moment where Leia and Padme make some type of contact, but there was none. Lucas just screwed up."
3734,5,Teenage angst,This movie has no flow.
3735,10,Darth Vader rises,"That familiar tune starts to play the titles start to role,Obi Wan and Anakin are in there fighters shooting."
3736,10,How can people give this movie any less than excellent?,"You all know that this movie is amazing, the only people that don't like it are probably the people that have shut out the newer movies completely because of their reasons, but just look how well they have Anakin go from the podracing kid to Vader. Come on people, what kind of lousy vote is this, we all know it is better than this sites average shows. You all may say that they ruined Yoda, or they made Anakin too powerful, but how can you make the chosen one ""too"" powerful, if it is his task to bring balance to the force. And for Yoda, yes we can all agree that the puppet was better, but I am sick of hearing people say that he is too powerful or he shouldn't fight because he says ""Wars do not make one great""... what would you do if you saw your WHOLE order get betrayed, or come under attack, you would all sit idly by and watch them die!? Be realists and understand the movie for more than its face value."
3737,9,Why does everyone say this is a bad movie?,"I just finished watching Star Wars Episode 3, and oh my god it was amazing!!! Seriously guys? What are you all on about?? This movie was amazing why do you knock it??? I admit it had its major flaws and very very laughable moments......"
3738,10,F-ing Brilliant,"Just saw it and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It was f-ing brilliant. Dark and disturbing, plenty of action with purpose. The Phantom menace was a disappointment and Jar Jar Binks was super annoying. Attack of the Clones was entertaining, and a definite improvement upon episode one. Revenge of the Sith is like an illegal immigrant with a leaf blower, sending the first two films to the refuse pile. You don't have to be someone who beats off to George Lucas interviews in sci-fi mags to enjoy this one. ............... ............... ............... ............................................. ................................................."
3739,10,The Force is with this Prequel...,"""Revenge of the Sith"" is by far the best movie of the Prequel Trilogy and definitely ranks among the best in the entire saga. That's right...its as good as ""The Empire Strikes Back."" "
3740,10,A New Hope,"In a time of most movies falling within the guidelines of ""moderately decent,"" ""Revenge of the Sith"" brings us back to the theaters, leaving us as much in awe as those who saw the original trilogy. George Lucas sets out on a journey to bridge the final gap between the original trilogy and the newer prequels."
3741,9,Excellent work,I just came back from the premiere from the 12:01 show and I'm impressed very well work done on behalf of Lucas tho some things were troubling like Grievous I have watched the cartoon and i wanted more of him hes Very Cool the Droid Army was reduced to a comedy act now not some cool silent killing army and the planet Mustafar seemed all to familiar to Mount doom in Lotr Rotk but I'm still pleased with this movie i give it a 9 two thumbs up my order of star wars
3742,9,Awesome Movie with some bad acting,"Thought the storyline was real awesome... just perfect. The movie though could have had some better acting... like with Padme who is shown as a strong woman in episodes 1 and 2 and then transformed into a dumb bimbo in episode 3. And the accent is totally different for Padme... she's got a cowgirl-ish accent all of a sudden too. And could have showed more of the dark force in Anakin when he turns to the dark force... the expressions weren't enough. Like I said... the movie could have done better with proper acting. The graphics were simply outstanding and breathtaking. I wanted to see more of General Grievous in action, but there was not much of him... he went out in one blow (lol). Overall though this movie kicked ass :)"
3743,,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith review,"What can I say guys this movie left a lot to be desired. Why? Well quite simply Vader wasn't Vader. Up until this point in time I envisioned him being this ruthless and powerful bad guy with no equal. Yet, when it was all said and done Lucas served up a surprisingly weak and clumsy big kid! You can't have great Siths like Maul and Dooku and then have Vader struggling with OB 1. I mean OB 1 couldn't carry the Counts (Dooku) cape! But hes making Annakin work? I don't think so. Out of respect for those who have yet to see the movie I won't go into detail but you get the picture. Don't get me wrong the visuals are second to none and the movie does have its moments. But thats the point , except for the first 15 minutes there is no sustained level of movie-making excellence from an acting/dialogue standpoint. The romance between Annakin and Padme are perhaps the lamest in cinematic history. Its nausea inducing. The dialogue is full of contradictions. Its frustrating saying this but when everybody sees the movie it'll be easier to explain. The most impressive characters are Sidious (hes in a class by himself in this movie). Hes followed by OB1 and Yoda. Samuel J.'s Windu, Padme, and Jimmy (why did you take this role) Smits were as wooden as Pinnochios relatives. This is no exaggeration! You'll see. All in all the movie was decent but the force wasn't with it."
3744,,agony of Darth Vader,"I just saw Revenge of the Sith yesterday, and although it's just a story, it's hard not to be touched by the events seen on screen. For me the point of the film (possibly the whole Star Wars set of films) is the transition of Anakin into Darth Vader. Anakin becomes twisted because he want's to protect the one he loves. I thought the transition was totally believable until the bit where he cut's off Samuel L Jacksons arm in a bid to uphold the Jedi way. He is distraught when the consequences of his actions become clear to him, yet he immediately gets on his knees in front of the evil sith lord/emperor. I didn't really get why he would do that, having been a good guy for so long. It's hard to hate Darth Vader after realising how he came to be and how he is so tortured. It seemed to me a very good but sad story. I'm going to watch episode 4 again now. I was about 5 when i saw it the first time, in a cinema that has since been demolished and is now a Mc Donalds."
3745,6,"Better than expectations, script and character psychology flawed",A beautiful example of how low expectations (coming off the previous two prequels) are distorting raters' opinions.
3746,10,millennium falcon :)),"here is really a useful hint . i saw the falcon on the scene right after the emergency landing sequence at the beginning , the one thats showing a big port where little ships are docking , at the bottom you'll be able to see the falcon . about the movie , what can i say , just brilliant ... once again , well done , thank you George and anybody who has done anything to do with the production of the legacy.... PS:i don't understand why do people criticize the dialogs , the characters etc. the funny characters , cheesy dialogs and partly bad acting have always been the facts of the star wars movies , we loved them the way they were . these are very good star wars movies . nothing more , nothing less .."
3747,10,Masterpiece,"This was a masterpiece of epic status. I was one of those fans that like Phantom Menace and I loved Attack of the clones. But this one is the best of the prequels. In fact, it might be better than the originals. Who cares what you think, this movie was f-ing hardcore and couldn't been done better. Yoda was, of course, bad a$$ as usual. And all the characters seemed to fit well in the movie. The action was superb and the light saber fights were amazing. The acting wasn't bad at all, as people make you believe. The dialogue, the story and plot were all pretty much done as best as it could've been done. The movie was also a bit sad and has a not so happy ending. In conclusion, to the people who didn't like it: I feel sorry for you, you heartless waste of skin."
3748,6,Moderatly disappointing,"Episode III was despite all my hopes, somewhat of a let down, but not as big as Episodes I and II were. While the movie remains very well made and the plot very well written, and even the characters acting their parts exceptionally well, the script lacked dialogue believable of a Star Wars film. To many times we see our heroes and villains saying and making gestures in ways we have never seen them behave before. For example, scenes when Padme explains she is ""Pregnant"" to Anakin face to face in a mellow dramatic scene to common in everyday movies and television shows. Additionally, the type of back and forth light sarcasm and humor in the beginning between Anakin and Obi Wan are just a few of the many dialogue errors, reminding me of a cheesy comedy film that is better off forgetting."
3749,8,Didn't you get what you expected?,Yet another comment...There is enough now on the film so mine are mainly about other comments.
3750,10,George Lucas is Brilliant!,"George Lucas has composed the greatest epic ever brought to this world. I have never been a fan of any movie with a lot of special effects,but star wars is the only exception. I love the writing of George Lucas most of all. To compose a story that can have people interested for almost thirty years is beyond the realm of any motion picture ever composed. In episode III the trilogy ends for fans, and the story is complete. Once again though, the writing and connecting everything together was utterly brilliant. I will always defend these movies because there will never be anymore like it. I hope everyone gets as much from this film as i did."
3751,10,Definite must See!,How hard is it to do a review on something without giving too much away? I am going to say first off that their may be a spoiler in here just to be on the safe side. I would have to say that if you haven't seen any of the first three star wars and that you are considering it...I would see the third first. Why do I like it? I think it is how George Lucas' weaves the entire story to tie everything (all six movies) together.
3752,6,destined for failure,"Lucas shouldn't try to direct movies for the mainstream. Unless he is willing to have assistance from other professionals like screen writers and established dialog editors. But please continue to make films George, just not anything over a budget of 100G."
3753,10,Great movie,"This movie is clearly the best of the saga. Not only because of the special effects the acting and the suspense but the light saber duels. Everything in this movie is perfect I give two thumbs up. What is my favorite part is the Anakin-Obi Wan duel lightsaber duel. Two words to describe it are fast and unpredictable, or should i say very very fast. After all is said this is a pretty dam good movie. My advice is to see this movie as soon as possible. Ewan, Natalie, and Hayden were all good in this movie. GOOD JOB LUCAS!!!!!!!! "
3754,10,"Great Movie-action,romance,drama,laughter,and sadness","It's a movie I can't get over. My brother's seen it five times now and plans to see it a few more! I loved all the movies! I also loved how it keeps you on the edge of your seat,yet it keeps you laughing. Like when Anakin killed the young children,I cried so hard people were looking at me funny!Completely and utterly the best movie I've ever seen! 900,000,000,000 Stars! Natalie Portman,Hayden Christian,and Ewan Mcgreggor all did such a wonderful job yet again! I'm going to see it a few more times and then buy the DVD or VHS.I'll probably show it to my children,and they can show it to their children and so on. It's a wonderful movie!"
3755,10,Dark Side of the force is here to stay,i loved star wars as a kid. i grew disenchanted with the new trilogy. i was prepared for another letdown.
3756,10,Fantastic Movie!,"This movie is the reason why I love going to the movies. You can always nitpick about any movie, but any complaints I have of ROTS is like complaining that Cindy Crawford isn't beautiful because she has a small mole on her face. The story for ROTS was engrossing, the musical score dark, and the visuals stunning. It really is great to see Lucas finally get the credit he deserves. He really made a great movie that will cement Star Wars in all of our personal mythologies. What an imagination and what a gift Star Wars has been. The only real complaint I have is that there wasn't more of the movie! What a wonderful send off for Star Wars. 10 out of 10."
3757,10,its a damn good movie,when i saw this movie i cried (the series was over )it was a great run but they had to end soon but star wars fans will not be disappointed in the DVD when it comes out i know i will not be but the movie was great i wet myself i mean the effects in this movie are damn good and if you haven't seen the other movies you should be shot George Lucas is the best damn Dir next to Spielberg but any way i highly recommend buying this i plan on getting at the midnight release at wall mart i and 100 of other star wars fans Will be there to get our copy (just some info for you this September i get to meet peter mayhew but any i recommend a buy on this and then in a few months they will put out the box set foe the first three movies witch i will also buy
3758,6,Great movie but mediocre acting,"The movie was entertaining. Unfortunately the acting was mediocre at best. Hayden Christensen can not act; his facial expressions did not reflect the emotions of his words. I have seen other movies with Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman or Samuel L. Jackson and their skills have shined. Quite frankly Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher were more believable and expressed better emotion in their Star Wars movies."
3759,7,Greatly connects the series!,"Better than I and II but original is the best. Sure, the visual effects is stunning.Don't blink or u'll miss. But the storyline is still incomparable with the original movies. call me old-fashioned but i prefer the set atmosphere. the movie is certainly very good action-wise, with edge of your seat thrilling star fighter battles , light-saber duels etc. but although being sci-fi, isn't as realistic and believable as it could be. think about it. if your enemy loses balance while jumping from his platform to yours, wouldn't u take the opportunity to strike him down while hes unprotected and not steady? but the movie pleases viewers anyway. i mean...fire,sound doesn't exist in space, but who cares? i would definitely not advise this to be a good children's movie, but they have something to look forward to as they get older. thank goodness there was no jar jar as well. just the fact he was in episode 1 made it a flop. the story tells the story very well of how Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and portrays his inner battles well...considering its Hayden Christensen, who was only chosen for the part because he looks mildly like Luke Skywalker. this is also one of those movies that has u thinking ""ahhh yes i recognize that...i remember that"" though this movie never seems to drift off the path of the main storyline, constantly telling the tale of the here and now of the war situation in the movie. at some points in the movie you may even feel a bit depressed by the scenes ur seeing, but if u see it through to to to the end it ends well. begins and ends well.it was also an enjoyably bonus to see the Wookie planet Kashyyk and getting a 2 scene glimpse of Chewbacca. also, the joy of seeing a light sabre battle was taken out, by the fact it comes so often its like a darn cliché'. and considering no-one really won the battles, except for the count dooku scene and the general greivous sccenes. mind you, those general grievous scenes were good though.it was also a shame to see all the Jedi simply being killed off by the clone troopers. not exactly what i had in mind. and another thing. there's probably sum answer to this, but i've never looked into it. why is there absolutely no mention of Coruscant in 4,5 and 6 when it is the basis of so much in the 1st 3 films. sure the senate was destroyed, but that doesn't explain the planets absence from it all. anyway, i still liked the originals best. probably because it had better actors.and because it was enjoyed by a larger audience, and so was designed for a larger audience than just these new age ""hip"" people who only want new actors with the latest 'greatest' technology...any way, it is not my job to convince u to like this movie or not, just to give u a different perspective to it other than your own. so see it if u haven't already seen it because it is worth it."
3760,,Rise Lord Vader,"Before I'm going to give you my comments, I'll have to apologize for my poor English(sorry, I'm Dutch). Anyway, I was very impressed about this movie. Especially after the most disappointing Episode I (God, I hate that Jar-Jar). Episode II wasn't that bad, at least that's what I think. Except for the poor acting performance in the disturbing love scenes of Anakin and Padme, the movie had a great story and some good action scenes. But it wasn't enough to bring back my old ""Star Wars-feelings"", which I lost watching Episode I."
3761,10,review,"FANTASTIC! The 2 hours and 20 minutes flew by so fast! There is so much detail within this movie. A person needs to see it at LEAST 4 times to grasp most of the details. Ewan McGregor did a FANTASTIC job as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He is the ""young Alec Guiness"" without a doubt! There are lots of emotions expressed within the film as well as comedic moments. Ties up the trilogy extremely well. A true ""Star Wars"" fan would shun the stupid critics and love this movie! I don't understand why the critics hate ""Star Wars"" so much. What is wrong with them? I swear, most critics only like so called real life movies with drugs, sex, and violence. Who wants to watch something like that when you can have a blast with a fantasy/science fiction/and or adventure movie? This movie deserves an Academy Award!!! It's about time ""Star Wars"" gets something for its creativity,technological advancements, etc! The Academy Awards owes the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" a lot of praise and Oscars!"
3762,8,Parallel with Bridge Over the River Kwai 1957,"Recently watched this again and noticed a parallel with ""A bridge over the River Kwai"" 1957."
3763,10,Revenge of the Sith,"Oh my! I can't wait to get this movie on DVD! Everyone should have extra movies in-between the 1st and 2nd so you won't have such a gap. That would be awesome! Then I could have all the movies and get more video games on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my! Al the other moves are awesome too! I don't know why people don't know about Star Wars! I think they are missing out, but that is just me!! This movie is the best ever, also the actors and actresses make the show dramatic, evil, cute, sad, good, and it has a lot of action in it, which makes it the best! My family always sits down everyday and watches Star Wars, cause it is exciting to watch and it's fun to play video games that teach cool stuff!"
3764,,"Where is the love, George?","""What the hell is a teddy bear doing in the middle of a Star Wars film?"" Up to that point, my brain had accepted everything. No reservations. I'd marveled at the magnitude of that very first Imperial Star Destroyer; the droids, Darth Vader, Leia's hairdo, and later, even Yoda's garbled syntax  I bought it all in buckets. And it wasn't only the characters that mesmerized me, or each new piece of hardware. It was The Force itself. Little did I know, at the tender age of 11, that this 'energy field created by all living things' would become the bedrock of my life's philosophy. It was, if you will, my introduction to the Vedic principle, an idea that exulted the power of the human mind, the virtues of self-effort, discipline, focus and stillness. These needed no explanation. Everything was in its place, exactly as it should be. So you can imagine my dismay, some years later, when I came up against midiclorians. Midiclorians? Why, George, would you feel the need to rationalize The Force? Probably for the same reasons you suddenly decided to insert a child's toy into what was, until then, a fairly sober and unsentimental Universe. It's the Dark Side, I tell you. (Or, at the very least, it was the point at which Mr Lucas lost his plot.) Since, however, we've been asked to believe many things even more anomalous than an Ewok. Beyond even Jar Jar Binks, there's the fact that in the original, Ben Kenobi hasn't even met the droids. ""I can't remember ever owning a droid"", he says to Luke's claim that R2D2 belongs to him. Senile dementia? From a Jedi?? Okay... okay... I get that the two series are separate. I get that. But not to the point where I can accept Yoda bearing arms, let alone bouncing around like a pinball on steroids. Most undignified! There's an irony in good fantasy, if you ask me. It has to be believable... Gimme back my X-wing models on strings! That, at least, was real! "
3765,10,The Origin of Anakin and Bringing Balance to the Force,Don't read this if you haven't seen it! 
3766,8,Spoiler: Merely when Lucas created the I-III series he killed the mist around Star Wars (IV-VI),"Spoiler: From the time being Star Wars amazed me with it's IV-VI series. Merely when Lucas created the I-III series he killed the mist around Star Wars. Just imagine. When we saw Series from IV-VI then force was a big thing, more or less a miracle. Henceforth we din't know who was/is Darth Vader, we know nothing about Luke's sister even that she exists. After series by series add on secrets revealed."
3767,6,"Hack work - competently done, but no genius here.","So, after the first trilogy was completed, what did George and the rest of us realise? Yes, the really interesting character wasn't the boy Luke, our cardboard cutout hero, but his immensely deeper, wiser and more evil father, Darth Vader. His story ends in redemption and death, but begs the question, how did he fall from grace and become a puppet in the hands of the Emperor Palpatine? "
3768,2,Holding out for the Special Edition...,"With a day to think it over, all I can say is (pardon my Yodaspeak)... disappointed I am. Weak plot with more holes than a ten pound block of Swiss cheese. Wooden characters, no humor, dialog ranging from forgettable to embarrassing. The best line had to be when Anakin lops off Dooku's hands and then manages to keep a straight face while spouting off ""I shouldn't kill him - he's unarmed"". Ya he's unarmed - you just cut his flippin' hands off! Was this Lucas' lame attempt to interject a James Bond-esqe one-liner? More likely, Lucas is just too out of it to make the connection, and nobody on the set cared enough to point it out to the big guy. Whatever you say GeorgeYou da man."
3769,8,More battles less talk!,"To start off the opening scene was a bit to much on the visual cortex! i almost went blind and sea sick! i wish he could have slowed it down a bit so we could take in the battle scene it was like he was rushing through the movie! The acting was horrible but didn't mind but why the rush in the battles, for us to wait so long and get 1 and half minutes of battles on Kashyyyk was real sad! Secondly to hype up the battle between grievous and obi wan then let them fight for 2mins was just sad! But all in all i found it sad that all the Jedi get killed at once by their trusted clone army! So More battle scenes, Less talk! Once again the acting was horrible, anakin was like wooden stool, hard and dull! Also palapatine was good also i wish they extended the scenes into one big battle on many planets because i didn't see the point of the cameo for chewbaccca? Also i wanted to see grievous fight a lot more than just removing the light sabers and having them cut off!"
3770,10,10 thumbs up,I give it a ten because it was totally cool and it is the best film ever of all Star Wars movie. I also like when Obi-Wan and Anakin fighting on Mastafar. Obi-Wan is cool also the best Jedi. I believe this film should win all the awards in the Academy Awards. This film should not be seen to little kids under 4-maybe 10 because there are scary and violent parts. I'm glad they have in rated PG-13 because of that reason. Also this film tells us the whole story why Darth Vader or Anakin turn to the dark side because it in the original Star Wars we were wondering who started the Galatic Empire and when Ben Kenobi said to Luke that him and his father were fighting in the clone Wars. We also look at Luke's and Leia's parents stuggles.
3771,7,3rd Best Star Wars Movie??,"Three decades after the director of American Graffiti hawked a sci-fi/western to disinterested film studio execs, George Lucas has finished Star Wars. Episode III is a highly enjoyable gatherer of loose ends in which there is no room for the comic/romantic light relief that spoiled ep I and II. Instead we are treated to lots of light sabering and the decent into badness of Hayden Christensens Anakin. The fact that Lucas was forced into a corner by story (this had to be about darth being born and major players dieing)has meant this movie has enough character and turmoil to save it from being a 2 hr effects demo. However its probably best for everyone, (the fancy dressed queues of fans included) that this sixth and third best star wars movie will be the last."
3772,8,This is a must see for all Star Wars fans!,Loved this film! Had all of my favorite actors and way better than the first two prequel trilogy movies! It had the same action as the old movies and then got better as I cried in this movie! This movie deserved some Oscars and golden globes and so on.
3773,1,Just terrible,"It's just really bad. The acting, the plot, the script and too many special effects. It ruins the rest of the franchise just like episode 1 and 2."
3774,10,The Perfect Ending,"Yes, while some of the prequels have been a bit uneven at times, this movie is an awesome effort I must say. Finally we have some good acting in a Star Wars movie, and I am including the first three which if they came out now people would still be stuck on the acting, Which we all know has never been great. Everyone in this movie does what actors do they make the character live according to the director's vision. Remember it's Lucas' vision, not your's if you didn't like the way he brings HIS characters to the big screen, then write your own script and see if you can get it made into a film. One more thing I must mention is that this film should be on the Top 250, case in point; it has the same overall rating as Spider-Man 2 with almost 10,000 votes more(and the acting in that movie, was just bone dry and stupid at times) I don't think the webmasters at IMDb are being fair to this movie at all."
3775,9,read this plz,"the only thing that mess the movie up for me was the hype before it came out, i saw the movie the week after it came out, and people were saying it was ""badass"" and these clichés about the movie ""the greatest star wars"" stuff like that, but it was a good movie the only that gets me mad that people don't appreciate the fact that most of the actions part were beautifully choreograph and the storyline filled in most of the plot holes, they just want to see action don't even care about that those battles are important parts in the movies and are the explain something more that just fighting, but it was a movie that u didn't really have to know a lot about star wars to enjoy it, it was for the fans and for the other people. i like that there was a lot of things that anakin had to go through that showed him having to decide between the light and dark force, i thought that was pretty cool, i wish the showed more wookie, and wookie behavior, tarrful should of had more lines,"
3776,9,"good movie, but had plot errors","i loved the movie, and i was excited that there was very little jar jar, or romance. but i did catch some of the plot errors. In the return of the jedi, when Luke asks Leia if she remembers her birth mother, Leia says remembers her mother, and that she was always sad. How could Leia remember her mother if she died while giving birth to her. Also in the original three star wars Obi Wan refers to Yoda as being his master, and that he was the one who had trained him, but wasn't it qui Gon that trained Obi wan? If anyone could help me figure this out, that would be great. The movie ruled, especially since you get to see R2 fight. I especially liked how Lucas showed Anakin turning to the dark side, i think the Ewan Mcgregor also did a great job of trying to look like Alec. The only character i didn't really like would have been Grievous, because he just annoyed me, but the four lightsabers was pretty cool. All in all i think this movie was awesome, but the plot errors kind of ruined it for me."
3777,6,Anakin to Darth is unconvincing,"While not as down on this movie as some posters, it does not live up to the hope and expectations for the final installment of a great movie series."
3778,,To much time between three and four,I think there was just to much time between episodes three and four. The babies are split apart and then all of a sudden they are in their twenties or something. I think there should have been more in between to show more structure of the two growing up and Vader and the Emperor establishing the first death star. Even if it was twenty years between three and four Obi won sure did age a whole bunch. He was probably in his thirties or so in three then like in his seventies in four.
3779,6,Lucas throw to the toilet SW,"It Sucked hard, they put all the things compressed, the plot was childish and irrelevant, the saber fights lame and extremely short like with Dooku and Grievous the Jedi slayer man. R2D2 can kick ass man! (lame and clumsy)it takes a couple of Jedis to take down a Super Battle Droid and that junk pile can easily destroy more than one, jeez people wakeup! Oooo and that Cody guy really stupid to know he even got a name darn! And whats with the ""express"" imperial officers and destroyers! and what with the dorky scene in the nursery: 'the boy name will be Luke, and the girl Leia *padme dies*' talking about schooler oriented film plot lines!!!!. DARTH VADER IN FULL ARMOR ONLY APPEARS BRIEFLY!!!! and the BIG Wookie fight lasts a few misery minutes, bah! to the hell with Lucas and you geeks!"
3780,5,"Next time in chronological order, please.","It could just be the money or the dark side of the force, that Mr. Lucas bother us with the new star wars trilogy. Besides it's okay for a popcorn movie, but if you known the first three movies, i mean part 4,5,6 and your brain don't stop working in all the special effects during the sixth movie, i mean part 3, it's a pity, because the whole plot is so predictable. And there are just a few silly dialogues that for star wars is so famous. But if they try to be funny in this movie, then i must say they do it not so bad. Next time Mr. Lucas, if you are planing another epic series please do it in chronological order. And if the dark side is that strong, i am sure star wars 7,8,9 will be follow."
3781,6,Tooooo much Blue Screen in Star Wars,"I don't want to be too harsh co's I love Star Wars too much but my interest in Episode 3 only really revived when they started using the old sets right at the end, there's just something about Blue Screen technology that kills it for me.......or maybe i'm just stuck in the past with 4 & 5..........the story line is great by the way P.s.........Who cast Hayden Christensen as Anakin, he has about as much on screen presence as our Clive Owen, totally dead! and the whole idea is he's supposed to be this amazing warrior who charms the pants off of everyone, then turns bad.....can't see it with Hayden........"
3782,7,Darth Poet,"Did you ever hear the story of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
3783,9,Ties entire saga together well,"In a nutshell, Revenge of the Sith was a bridge between the original trilogy and the 3 prequels. It was without a doubt better than episodes I and II in almost all aspects. There were a few things, though, that dragged the film down slightly, but if you can look past that, this is one of the best films out right now."
3784,9,Great.........,A fitting end to a epic franchise.
3785,10,A Universe in Itself,"When going in to watch Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, one would expect an ordinary blockbuster continuation to the Star Wars prequels. But one would be wrong. Episode III is a universe in itself. I was impressed by how emotions and events impacted the viewer. One can truly FEEL everything that happens, and that's something to be valued. The way in which the story resembles an epic tragedy makes it more classical and beautiful. But don't be alarmed; the action does not leave! And the special effects were done fairly also. The acting is acceptable, I believe. But what I love the most about this film is that you enter the movie theater as one person, and, after watching it, your universe has changed entirely. You learn in this film. You learn about everything; about brotherhood, love, pride, loss, betrayal, death, and the destruction of a Golden Era. About an end and a new beginning. It changes your stars... and your perspective of Star Wars."
3786,9,Still The Best Star Wars Movie to Date,"Revenge of the Sith was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw, and immediately after watching it I fell in love with Star Wars. And for that I'm forever grateful for this movie.<br /><br />To me Revenge of the Sith is the best out of the current 11 Star Wars movies. The movie is filled with amazing cgi, such as the heartbreaking battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan on Mustafar, the space battles are fantastic especially the opening battle over Coruscant. The movie is filled with memorable dialogue such as Palpatine's ""Do it"", General Grievous's ""General Kenobi"" and probably the most memorable of them all is Obi-Wan's ""Hello there"", which have all only expanded in popularity thanks to memes. The movie has an amazing story and no Star Wars movie from before and after has been able to top. The movie begins with Anakin Skywalker ""The Chosen One"" at the highest point of his life. He's got a wife who cares for him deeply, a child on the way (actually two, but he doesn't know that), he's a highly respected Jedi, and was granted a seat on the high Jedi Council. And from then on we see many factors that cause Anakin Skywalker, the arguably greatest Jedi who ever lived, become one of the most menacing antagenitis in pop culture. We see this transformation through the manipulation he went through from Palpatine, being denied the rank of Jedi Master even though he's on the Jedi Council, has the strength, respect, and knowledge of one. He's even already fully trained a padawan by this time. Lastly we see his identity crisis he has towards the end of the movie that turns him into Darth Vader. Although some people may criticise the acting of Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker throughout this movie, I feel like its at it's best. George Lucus even has said that Hayden's portrayal of Anakin was perfect and I agree with him. Hayden was playing a broken character, one who was lost between good and evil, one who would do anything to stop his wife from dying and then eventually becoming the very thing that kills her.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten older and have seen the rest of the movies I can see the beauty of how this movie turns into one of the most menacing villains and then when I rewatch this movie I feel a sense of joy knowing that Anakin will be redeemed by his son in Return of the Jedi."
3787,3,it was OK,"I watched this movie at a friends place, and I didn't like it as much as the others, it was a lot shorter, anakins acting still sucks, and considering the movie was mostly about him it was bad. like when he killed mace windu, hes like ""what have i done"" with little emotion, then he tells lord sideous(excuse spelling) ""ill do anything you ask, even after regretting what he did. but for the action it was pretty good, i still think Yoda shouldve killed something, he never kills anything, except a few droids, in any star wars movie. I never seen it in theaters which probably wouldve been better. This movie didn't seem to have as much effort and time as the others. a bunch of new characters were coming out of no where, and animal things. Like Greivius(excuse spelling again), the animal Obi-wan was riding, and the messed up clone troopers.(all I can remember) Most of the movie I never knew why happened, like how did senator palpatine(he didn't really but just saying since when did he get on board with the bad guys ship) get kidnapped?? When did the wookies get attacked, and why?? Why did Obi-wan have to kill Greivius and what was greivius doing? And for those who think anakin was a good actor should re-watch the movie and check it out again. thats all I have to say, I was pretty disappointed."
3788,10,This Is The Bestest Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this movie so much. Hayden is the hottest guy alive. This is by far the best movie ever. I can't believe Anakin turned evil. How dare him, he's still hot though. He became evil to save his wife and she died anyway. I hope there's gonna be a 4th episode. The special effects are awesome. The acting was perfect. The person who made the movie is a genius. Hayden is still hotter than ever. I cant believe Anakins wife died. Did I mention that Hayden is hot?I also cant believe that Anakin killed all those people. Even the young lings. Also how he helped in way kill Windu, (I think thats his name). This movie rocks."
3789,7,"Remember: When watching this movie, you are a 10-year-old.","What did you expect? The Shawshank Redemption? Did you really go into this movie expecting Lucas to redeem himself after the two horrendous efforts he put into Episodes I and II? Why did you watch this movie if you hated the other two? Why would you send more money to Lucas? Did you not know that he'd cram all of the story into Episode III because Episode II had none in it? Did you not know that it would only take 3 scenes to get Anakin to turn to the dark side, considering that it's a 2 hour movie and there was no build up in the previous two? Don't be so dumb-founded, of course all of that was going to happen. I knew right away that the new Star Wars trilogy was going to stink. Bad actors, bad dialog, annoying kids and annoying creatures (not just in the movie, but also in the movie theaters when watching it). I don't understand why people would dislike this movie for what it is. What this movie is, is something that many of you cannot grasp. You do not feel the power of this movie. The power of this movie comes from: light sabers and Jedi's. If you don't like light sabers and Jedi's, don't watch this movie. I happen to like light sabers and Jedi's, so I had a fantastic time watching this movie. It was a complete battle-fest: Yoda vs. Sidious, Obi-Wan and Anakin vs. Dooku pt. 2 and Mace Windu vs. Sidious (which ended in a double-teaming racist segment where Anakin Skywalker interrupts and chops off Windu's hand and Sidious electrocutes him to death).. Oh yeah, and the incredible light saber battle of Anakin and Obi-Wan on Mustafar (a LAVA planet). How could you not like this movie? Come on! We got to see Anakin burning alive after having 3 of his limbs cut off! I'm sure you've been dying to see that for all 3 episodes. ""I HATE YOU!!!"" pretty much sums up the awesomeness of this movie, and describes the passion, and the inconceivable power of: light sabers and Jedi's. Light sabers and Jedi's is what makes this movie worth it. Don't use your brain for this one people. Just ignore the bad dialog and horrible acting. Just think ""oh, Lucas must have been on crack when he came up with these lines"" and just forgive him and get over it. Take this movie for what it really is: light sabers and Jedi's. By the way, I was disappointed that Anakin didn't use a red light saber immediately after he became a sith... WHAT'S UP WIT DAT!? Once I became a sith, the first question I would have asked Sidious would be ""hey uhhh.... now that I'm a sith, can I use an awesome red light saber?"".. In fact, that would be the whole reason why I'd turn into a sith. I could care less about saving Padme, the color of the light saber is what really matters."
3790,10,Obi-one Kenobi and the Actor who plays it,Star Wars second trilogy is fine. One thing is not fine and it will never be fine cause now no one can change this.
3791,10,Great movie.Many unclear things but still great,"Great movie I liked it a lot,but the main problem is the story.I mean its way to romantic.Like why did Anakin went to dark side???Because of love.Me and my friends think that there gonna be a continue.Because.There are many things that haven't been told.For example.How can Kvi Gon Jin can still be alive.And some more.But one thing is quite unclear for me.It's the thing that Darth wader could destroy obi van.Right now.But why did he did just twenty years later.Anyway this movie is great ending of trilogy.And I'm waiting for next star wars."
3792,10,Great movie,"This Star Wars movie totally rocks. I don't what's people's problem with not liking it, but that doesn't really matter because that's only few. Besides why would such a bad movie get over 380 million in movie gross? Probably because a great number of people liked it duh. Beside a lot people like III Because they get to see Darth Vader again and that wookie that was with Han Solo in Star Wars IV,V, and VI. I'm sure there's a bunch of Darth Vader lovers out there. Anyway Star Wars III is really well made the acting is good, the graphics are outstanding, and the sound is awesome!!!!!!! All people who hate this movie and call themselves a Star Wars fan be gone."
3793,10,"Stunning, impressive, thrilling.....ROTS delivers!",The best of the prequels starts off with a stunning battle above Coruscant with Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi going to save Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous.
3794,8,Mixed Thoughts,"I came to this movie, like the rest of America, with great expectations. This movie did reach them, but i left this movie with very mixed feelings."
3795,9,the best of the saga,"Not because the last and the most technological one,but because the darkest and most touching -as it had to be-, The Revenge of The Sith is the best of the saga...The story writing had never been better,and there are no such annoying characters like the ""ewoks"" and ""jar jar"", that make the audience miss the point. This time George Lucas finally told what he wanted to tell from the beginning, and proved that this was not a movie of Luke himself, but the whole saga is actually a life story of Anakin Skywalker.All the fans thought that this movie had to be the most amazing and the epic one, and it is so.Perhaps we all wished that it would be better if we had been able to see Qui Gon in this movie,-considering the importance of him- or if only there were a scene of his talking.I think it is the only part that made me be disappointed."
3796,8,The Ultimate Struggle,"In Star Wars: Episode Three Anakin struggles between good and evil. His breaking point is continually pressured throughout the movie by his dreams and worries. Anakin dreams that the senator dies and the fear of losing her begins. This gives opportunity for evil or good to leak in. Some of the angles on Anakin are high angles to show how he thinks he can control the situation that he dreamed. Also, lower angles are shown of the senator to show the lesser power that she has over Anakin. The high key lighting shown on the Senator's face to show her innocence and low-key lighting is done on Anakin's face to show the evil that may reside in him. Their clothing is opposite too, along with the angles and lighting. The Senator is wearing a beautiful light blue gown, while Anakin is wearing a black robe. Once again I believe it shows the innocence of the Senator and the evil that lurks behind Anakin. These are great motifs of good and evil."
3797,5,don't do it any favours,"Sith ain't great, everything promised by the decision to make the ""original trilogy prequels"" eg, how? and why? were given in a short montage in the last ten mins of the movie, we know stuff from eps 3,4 and 5 and the deal was to to show us what went wrong, instead we get nothing new and no real turn to the dark side. and why not show anakin use the dark powers to save padmes life, just the sh*tty choke! i mean we all hate kids sometimes but instead of just randomly killing them why not make anakin believe that by killing them he can concentrate the force within himself to then save pad me, u could also use this reasoning to make anakin hunt and kill off the Jedi, becoming darker as he goes only to realise that when she does come back as a lifeless, suicidal zombie who then kills herself, and then in his despair have palpatine show up and kill him!!! get Owen in there as a bit of a rogue who settles down with anakins ex girlfriend beru, thats what i wanna see!!. but i fear that Lucas sold out to a climactic finish rather than show the Jedi's demise to the sith during the duration of episode 3, thats what we needed, but oh no we get ""order 66"" or whatever u wanna call it. I'm a good fan of star wars IE i like the movies. it was never suggested in eps 4,5 and 6 that anakin dies by the hand of obi wan and lava, Lucas could have been brave and changed the whole damn thing but no, why?$$$$"
3798,,Star Wars Episode III & The Struggle of good & evil,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith Cast: Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine) Hayden Christensen (Anakin) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan), Natalie Portman (Padme). From the opening scenes this movie shows the struggle between the forces of good and evil. Here, we find, Anakin (the student) and Obi-Wan (the teacher) fighting their way through the stars above, on their way to save Chancellor Palpatine from the evil Count Douku. We soon see Anakin taking orders from a new teacher Palpatine who is telling him to kill Count Douku. This is something that a Jedi does not do as they are protectors of the galaxy."
3799,8,"Good plot, bad acting...","Overall I liked. I think the story was one of the best, with the end of the war and Anakin's identity crisis/romance with Padme. However, I must say, the acting was terrible compared to the rest of the movies. The dialogue was cheesy, and Hayden Christensen was stiff as a board throughout. Then there's the matter of ""special effects"". They may have been amazing in the earlier movies, when they were used somewhat in moderation, but when you put them in EVERY FRICKIN' SCENE, they're not ""special"" anymore. Take it easy with the computers, I say."
3800,3,Disappointing!,"IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER! When dookoo died that could have been SOOO much better. The Anikan/obi wan fight should have been way more exciting. I enjoyed the lightsaber fight in the phantom menace more. The fights should have been a lot longer. Numbers 2 and 3 were both too much of a love story. Lucas should go back to what he did with the original three. Sure they had a small love story in them, but they were so much more exciting. Also, this movie should have contained a huge fight like the ones between the gungans and droids in episode one. one thing better than the phantom menace was NO JAR JAR! YAY! I think giving this movie a three is generous."
