0,7,Ghost of a Movie. Nothing more than a sociopathic superficial cash grab,"This film really is nothing more than an Advertisement. I'll admit the first time I saw it at the movies I thought it was pretty good, and i watched it another two times with friends and family over the course of a month before it finally left theatres. "
1,8,Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review(re-upload),"Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is a newest chapter in the long running Space opera saga, taking place 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening."
2,8,An Exciting Return to an Amazing Saga,"When I go to the movies, I aim to experience one thing: escapism. Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years."
3,,The force is Average with this one!,"30 years have passed since the events of episode 6 (beware spoilers ahead), but this film spends virtually zero time establishing the background to what has happened before, and from the very get go of one mindless explosion to another, this is an action packed let- down, with very shallow character development, re-hashed action sequences stolen from episodes 5&6 (father-son confrontations/death star finale), poor comedy timings and poorer dialogue (Finn asking Ray if she has a boyfriend), and really awkward character introductions, such as that first superficial meeting between old flames Leia and Han - really? And what about the new death star: bigger, badder, but in fact much much tamer and stupider, with the very same weak spots as the old death star, which makes you wonder if human evolution in 30 years (where the dark side is concerned), is in genetic reverse. Like most of the film, soft spots like this just felt like generic, copied from, and dumbed down fan service without much thinking in way of originality, substance, and credibility, which is what real fans of Star Wars and fans of good films in general wanted for this incarnation."
4,9,The Triumphant Return of the Star Wars Saga,"In October of 2012, almost five years ago next month, there was an announcement made in regards to Star Wars. George Lucas, the visionary creator of the Star Wars universe, struck a deal with Disney where they would acquire Lucasfilm for around $4.05 billion and that there would be a new Star Wars movie set to be released in 2015. This brought an immense amount of joy and excitement to me as a life-long Star Wars fanatic! For the first time in over ten years, I would be able to see a new Star Wars film on the big screen! From late 2012-early 2013 to several days before it's December 2015 release, I read as many articles I could about pre-production, production, what the movie would actually be about, whether or not material from the Expanded Universe would be the basis for the next trilogy, etc. With that being said, here is my review of the first movie of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens. "
5,8,Not perfect but an excellent starter for a future wider scope of the Star Wars Universe,Well first thing is its a whole lot of fun !! 
6,10,......TEN,A fantastic addition to the Star Wars series!
7,8,An exhilarating continuation of the Star Wars saga and an homage to what made it special in the first place.,"If there's any movie you should see in theaters, The Force Awakens is it. From the first frame you're sucked right back into the Star Wars universe, and that's probably the best part of the movie - it feels genuinely like Star Wars. Not a child-pandering political farce (The Phantom Menace), a melodramatic soap opera (I'm looking at you Attack of the Clones) or a CGI filled sensory overload (Revenge of the Sith anyone?). No, it's barebones Star Wars. Visually stunning, constantly engaging, and most of all, it's incredibly fun. There are a lot of parallels with A New Hope, like how we're beginning this epic adventure with vastly different characters and learning their stories for the first time. And it shares the basic outline of that movie as well from the monumental opening shot to its massive riveting climax. It's a blast from beginning to end, and especially exhilarating in a packed IMAX theater. "
8,6,"Watchable for nostalgia factor alone. LK, JJ, et al. should be ashamed of this script.",First the good (no spoilers here.)
9,9,"Something, something, something, Dark Side. Something, something, something, complete","It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced. That's the effect this movie *should* have on most (other than those who'd already decided they were going to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the Dark Side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note: THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels: we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a believable friendship/dynamic on screen like that of the Original Trilogy's trio."
10,6,Oh dear the Force is Weak With This one .,Oh dear what a disappointment ! 
11,10,Best Star Wars Yet - which will please both virgins and vets.,"How do you please franchise fans old and new while making a good, impactful and memorable movie? "
12,6,On a path of destruction,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved this franchise. Even episode 1, by far the worst in the series, had that ""star-wars feel"". Mostly thanks to great casting of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, awesome new dark side character and dual light saber. So despite extremely high expectations, the series wasn't ruined and effectively picked up in dark episode 3. Then Disney followed up with this one, with J.J.Abrams at helm, which once again rose the expectations. Well it's not good. Especially the casting and acting of younger stars. Even Harrison Ford and Chewy can't save this mess. It may be a blasphemy, but unfortunately Ford can't pull off ' ""the cool"". Sorry guys, he's a bit too old, so some action scenes look out of place. The casting of young stars was atrocious. Simply bad. Bad chemistry, Bad looks (ecpecially the Kylo Ren character), badly choreographed fights, Bad everything. On top of which, Abrams took the period as a remake of original which should not be touched! At all. Due to stunning (as expected) visuals, and a personal love to the universe, this movie can be watched, but if this awful trend continues, even special effects and millions of fans won't be able to save the series."
13,5,"More of a remake than a sequel, it relies on nostalgia and spectacle over actual characters and story.","In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening ""remember this thing""'s and ""this guy still looks the same but he's grey now""'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10"
14,,"Adieu, you scruffy-looking nerf herder","""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" opens with the franchise's iconic receding text, a bit of Pavlovian conditioning guaranteed to bring fanboys to arousal. Director J. J Abrams then takes us to the planet Jakku, where Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is acquiring a map which leads to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil), a powerful space wizard. Unfortunately Poe is attacked by The First Order, a military group which has risen from the ashes of a fallen Galactic Empire."
15,9,The force has awakened!,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'."
16,10,Star Wars is back with vengeance no matter what Negatives say.,"Too many people give this a negative because of ""rehashes of A New Hope"" Well A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back aren't even original to begin with. If we hate The Force Awakens for being unoriginal then use the same logic not only against the original trilogy itself but also Disney classics like THE LION KING. Negatives are also given because apparently Rey is a ""Mary Sue"" People don't seem to pay attention enough to The Original Trilogy if they don't think Luke resembles similar ways. "
17,10,Beyond Incredible! (Especially Compared To The Laughably Overrated Originals),"My expectations were very, very high for this movie."
18,10,A masterful weaving of the old and new,"Don't let the shrill minority fool you, Star Wars The Force Awakens is one of the greatest films ever set in a galaxy far, far away. "
19,6,A Monument to Mediocrity,"From the virtue signaling of social justice, to the cheap-jack plot-line which was easily discerned in advance, to the awful acting which evoked little but hooting from me, I was, as you can see, disappointed, and in some cases outraged. If you dare to join me, I will explain."
20,10,First Star Wars since 1980 that didn't suck!,"Don't mistake continuity of story and universe with ""reboot or rehash"" - This is a story that continues on from the end of Return of the Jedi"". We are not worried about The Force being explained anymore, we don't care - It's a mystery and back to being a mystery. It starts with a simple enough premise: The Empire was defeated and their end Death Star obliterated, but as always, in fiction as in true life, when old bad guys are killed off, new bad guys take their place."
21,6,JJ Abrams is overrated,"I was pessimistic when I learned JJ Abrams was going to be taking on Star Wars. While he was ""successful"" in the reboot of the Star Trek films, he seems incapable of directing a film without a contrived plot that is about as coherent as something written by a 5th grader."
22,10,Why are so many people DOWN on this movie???,Ten out of Ten against the negative whiny fan-boys. 
23,6,"Not too long, long ago in a galaxy not too far, far away... two guys, Larry and JJ, were sitting in an office trying to write a script...","JJ: I just can't crack the script, Larry. I can't."
24,1,"Reboot, Sequel, Prequel, Re-Imagining Rebrand. Welcome to the Modern Hollywood.","Star Wars movies used to be great. Remember that? Remember how they inspired a generation of loyal fans? Remember how they virtually saved cinema from terminal audience decline in the 70s? So scoot forward 40 years, and see the empty soulless rubbish lapped up by brainwashed Pavlovian audiences and critics. How much did Disney pay the critics for all those gushing reviews? Either that or the art of film criticism has been lost."
25,,The First Star Wars Movie that I will not Watch Again,Most of the problems have already been listed by other reviewers so I will try to be short. My biggest problem was the cast. 
26,10,"The top movie in the series (in other news, water is wet. LOL)",I saw this movie with my wife and I have to say this was even better than I ever thought possible!
27,9,An energetic space adventure,"When I came out of the theater after watching 'The Force Awakens' I never thought that I would have to defend it against haters. It seemed that the movie had taken its audience by storm: it was lauded as a triumphant return to form for the Star Wars franchise after lackluster prequel films. Now, a year later, people seem to have turned against it. It copied Episode IV, they say, it is manipulative and calculated, it is derivative to the point of repeating key plot points and characters."
28,10,A True Star Wars Movie,"I know this, among many other reviews, will just find themselves lost in translation with thousands of others. But that wont deter me from conveying how simply awesome this movie was. It was truly a Star Wars movie. To have just enough fresh material meshed so fluidly with the old stuff everyone loves is a truly amazing feat."
29,10,Star Wars The Force Awakens succeeds across the board!,"As I followed the production process of Episode 7, I was looking for evidence that they were holding to ideals hopefully wayyyyyyy better than Lucas' prequel trilogy."
30,6,Please Disney - don't do this again!!!,Why another less than superlative review? It's the movies I guess - or Hollywood. There is a good one planned shortly to make up - I promise.
31,10,"Ignore negative, neckbeardy, contrarian reviews. The Force is strong with this awesome movie!","This is a great movie. It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out raging nerds that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. "
32,6,"Nothing to see here, move along....",I cannot believe that a supposed Star Wars fan of a director would think that this story was worthy to succeed the originals chronologically. Not only was the story unoriginal but cliché as well.
33,10,"All Real Star Wars fans loved it, and clearly so did the average viewer. The inarguable facts (AKA the record-breaking box office) speaks for itself ; )","Before watching The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. However, I can safely say I am now a HUGE fan of the Star Wars universe!"
34,6,Episode VIII had better be fantastic.,"A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm."
35,4,"It is not a sequel, but a remake",Sad but true. When the opening credits filled the screen (Episode VII... blah blah) I was already grinding my teeth because the plot sounded idiotic. Then the huge star destroyer filled the screen. The fun bit is that the star destroyer had some sort of antenna or whatever at the front and it looked liked the ship was showing the middle finger towards the viewers. 
36,,"Didn't enjoy The Force Awaken's film, but really wanted to.",Star Wars: The Force Awakens...2015
37,10,Star Wars fans everywhere thanking god for FINALLY delivering a quality Star Wars movie!,JJ Abrams did a spectacular job of bringing back Star Wars. I still need watch it again so I can analyze the entire thing and not be completely engrossed (going to be hard to do) in the movie throughout the time I was watching it. 
38,9,Great,This movie is the perfect way to introduce Star Wars to a generation that was almost plagued with nothing but those god awful prequels.
39,10,Nothing like Original or Prequel Trilogy,"Star Wars The Force Awakens has a lack of imagination,it is anything but original and to me and my family ruined that feeling of all the other star wars films (including The Phantom Menace) if anything the only good thing about the movie is the appearance of the original cast (Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford) and the music of John Williams,but everyhing else makes me wanna immediately go to sleep or leave the theather.I think this movie failed to bring star wars back and I hope that the sequels are at least a bit better than this movie otherwise Star Wars might be over for me.This is my opinion and if anyone agrees with me is welcome."
40,10,Best after empire,This film is great! I have seen this movie 5 times and it never got old. In my opinion it got better!! It has a great heroin in rey and villain in Kylo and great action scenes and emotional scenes! Is Star Wars at its best the second best star wars movie out there! Go see it on a big screen with the volume turned all the way up!:)
41,7,Star Wars is headed in the right direction again,"Disney taking the Star Wars reigns out of George Lucas's hands is likely the single best thing that could have happened to the franchise after the controversial prequel mess. With the prequels, Lucas managed to take Star Wars about as far away from what make it work in the first place as was possible, destroying many of the great things about the original trilogy in the process. Effectively, Star Wars was dead...Lucas wouldn't have been able to pull off any future films, even if he would have been inclined to do so."
42,9,Great continuum to Star Wars saga (No spoilers),"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steps into a big boots and fills them honorably. The Force Awakens look, feels and sounds like the real Star Wars movie. It contains all the elements that made the original story so epic. It tells an epic story with great scenery and with fine action and adventure. The Force Awakens is like a reboot of an original story, but the same time it is clearly continuation to an original saga. The story and characters are written well. Actors and actresses get through greatly at their roles. No one feels lame or factitious. The story is clearly a tribute to Han Solo, but at the same time it brings new characters well present. Maybe only one thing is not perfect. The story serves background stories of some characters almost too easily and dish out them with no big surprise which made the original movie so epic. The original story was actually a soap opera of one family. There are some elements in this story too, but they are reveled almost too easily. Greatly the story leaves enough of loose ends, so probably we will get bigger surprises of the characters later at upcoming movies."
43,6,30 years since Luke Skywalker and the gang took down the Galactic Empire a far greater threat as risen in the form of the First Order.,"The moment they announced JJ Abhrams would direct the new Star Wars I feared the worst and my fears have come true. JJ Abhrams has done to Star Wars what he did to Stat Trek,make it a commercial success and nothing else. Star Wars is supposed to be more than commercial success...it's supposed to be more than special effects....it's supposed to be more than cheesy one liners which to be honest is not even funny.....it's supposed to be something that stays with you for a long long time,that's what episode 4 did to all its viewers. 15 minutes into the movie and we are introduced to the two new additions to the Star Wars universe who are going to take this franchise forward.But I'm sad to say for the 2 hours that followed you don't feel for either one of them.Imagine saying that to Han,Liea and Luke in episode 4!!! There is nothing wrong with the casting,it's the story that lets them done.They are just thrown at your face. The movie also suffers from major plot holes. They could have done anything with episode 7 but they ended up doing what all Star Wars fans feared just another film."
44,10,Star Wars fans win again,"I don't need to pathetically hyper analyze it to love it. It was brilliant from start to finish. Unlike the godawful Lord of the Rings films, which are completely unwatchable. "
45,6,Geriatric Attempt At Reboot,"You know, what bothered me the most when I saw this movie was I just kept feeling that ""Deja vu"" like I'd seen all this before. I had! In 1977 with Episode IV! It's simply a reboot, told with a few new characters, and a few ... geriatric ones, who probably shouldn't have been in it at all, except perhaps in cameo roles or some such."
46,1,Star Wars? More like Spaceballs.,Oh how I miss the style of that awful film called 'The Phantom Menace'.
47,,Soulless collection of recycled plot elements and ideas,"As somebody who grew up with the magic of Star Wars as one of the defining movies of an entire generation it pains me to see what has become of this galaxy far, far away. The story is a carbon copy of Episode IV. I was afraid of giving spoilers but if you have seen the original Star Wars then you already know much of this movie: Main protagonist flees from a desert planet with secret plans, they find a weakness to a super weapon and a ridiculously small number of fighters manages to destroy it. What else is there to say? The main villain, Kylo Ren, is a pathetic weakling with daddy issues controlled by some unimpressive CGI ""Supreme Leader"". The new main heroine manages to master years of Jedi training within days which is just the tip of an iceberg of plot holes. Nearly every five minutes or so I was wondering:""How did they know that? Where did they come from all of a sudden? Who are those guys? Why would they do that?"" Somehow, the writers must have sensed how deep, deep in trouble they were so they went for a cheap shock moment in order to evoke some kind of emotional response from their viewers but it was too little too late. This movie has a weak and unimaginative story. Sure, the movie looks nice and I liked the acting by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega which made me give the movie my final rating but I left the theater with this slightly nauseating feeling that I had just fallen for another Disney marketing hype. They tried to play it safe by giving fans more of the same with a modern twist. Maybe I expected too much but I had higher hopes than getting ""Star Wars: The forced awakening!"""
48,10,"Yes, it really is that good.",This movie does everything right. 
49,8,The Force Awakens but with a hangover. It's acting weird!,"Well, I've waited a bit to make any comments on this film, I thought I'd let my head cool off first, digest what I saw in the movie, before I go on ranting and complaining about what was presented to us. Maybe I got this wrong, maybe I was not supposed to watch a film which would be a logical follow up to the storyline of Episode 6. On the other hand, there are some other issues here, not depending on the movie but very important when it comes to how the movie will impact the viewer and it what way. "
50,10,Real Star Wars fans got the sequel we always wanted. Therefore (as always) I win......you lose X- ),"With this absolute epic, Star Wars.....is......back! JJ Abrams achieved a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger (Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, actual great acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaacs, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smart-ass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and bad-ass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe. JJ Abrams alongside Lawrence Kasdan wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did. The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better. As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart- pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions. John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old-school fans. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to greatness for the Star Wars franchise. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in an emotional, adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably ""the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament"". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest (I.E. laughably non-existent) flaws. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and an incredibly worthy addition to the franchise."
51,10,"All of the best parts of the Original Trilogy, with none of the cheese!","The film is easily the best written of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time in the series history). "
52,6,disappointing,"Although an enjoyable movie, there were certain parts that didn't live up to my expectations. The movie is inconsistent with previous ones in terms of how hard is to train as a Jedi, and how hard is to master the light saber . It used to take years..., remember when Luke trained with Yoda, while now people just pick the light saber and are able to fight already? These characters all looked like a bunch of amateurs as compared to the ""old"" masters. Then it's the light saber duels... which are quite boring, mostly look like some medieval heavy fights, in which you move slow because your weapons weights 30 Kilos! I also expected for the bad guy to be more of a man honoring his grandfather, but somehow, Kylo Ren looks like he just landed here from the Twilight series and gets humiliated in the final scene. By the way, no force push, no lightning? Where are the dark force features? Remember how elegant was Dooku when he dismissed both Anakin and Obi Wan in a memorable fight? As a SW fan, I can only hope that for the next movies, both good and bad guys get some serious training from their masters and give us some real fights."
53,10,Greatest movie of all time,"So, my opinion of this movie is that it is the ""greatest movie of all time."" WHY? "
54,7,Great addition to the Star Wars legacy!,Star Wars is back and in the best way possible! The new and the old cast are amazing ! I loved every second of it! One of my personal favorite movies of all time! I am very excited for the future of Star Wars.Such a phenomenal movie! The Force Awakens is definitely on my top ten.The force is very strong with this one!
55,8,"Chewie, we're home...","I really don't care what anyone has to say because I personally thought this film was nearly flawless. Sure, it's hard to say that it wasn't a clone of ""A New Hope"", but honestly, it's hard not to go back to old material. The Force Awakens was a thrilling and delectably exciting film that introduced us to fun and loveable new characters (BB8, I'm talking to you!), while simultaneously embracing the original characters. The film got us absolutely pumped for the next film which was an unfortunate misfire, but didn't matter at the time because of how good this one was."
56,6,Okie Dokie Popcorn flick,"Was the movie entertaining? Yes, moderately.."
57,3,Ghastly pile of politically correct horse manure,"And I thought Jar Jar Binks was the pits for this movie series. Jeeez, was I wrong."
58,,Star Wars the quest for more money,Horrible storyline: Thirty years after the destruction of the empire and our heroes have left the galaxy to founder. After their victory party with the meth addicted care bears our heroic foursome falls apart. They provided no stabile infrastructure and / or law leaving the society to fall apart. The first order is the new threat. Please come up with a new idea---stop ripping off the Nazis. Their massed meeting / launch of their attack was a copy of the Nuremburg rallies of the 1930s.
59,10,Is this the best Star Wars movie ever? Ummmmm Is the sky blue? Exactly.,I was absolutely sure this was going to be an epic failure after the horrible taste the prequels left us with. 
60,10,Far and way the greatest film of 2015!,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme."
61,10,"With the hardest job in the world, JJ Abrams... I salute thee","J.J Abrams has without a doubt constructed and delivered the best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. Better yet, the best Star Wars film after Empire. "
62,10,Everything we know and love about Star Wars,"I'll be honest, in the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly skeptical about his ability to do the film justice. But after finally seeing it, I was SERIOUSLY impressed! "
63,7,Star Wars became popcorn flick and that is sad,1.Lazy writing 2.blatant copy of Original trilogy
64,10,Memories Of The Past Attached To A Wonderful Film,"The Force Awakens is the illustration of an emotional moment for me. Whenever I watch it I feel ... something. An emotion that is very personal, dark, sad, yet very happy. This film was the turning point from being the optimistic, emotional mute, happy yet dumb kid to the anxious, critical, emotional yet still optimistic teen. So much of my personal thoughts and feeling where forced onto this movie. So much memories of drawing Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren from the trailers with my friends. So much memories of countless lunches just debating what the plot will be about and who the narrator was from the trailers is. It took over my life. Now at this moment in my life I was told to be more of a man. I had a strict rule with myself that no crying, no bad thoughts, no emotional things would be allowed in this body of mine. During my first midnight premiere, dressed up and pumped up. I cried for the first time I can ever remember. It all got released and it changed me. It's one of the most important moments in my 15 years of being alive. I also gained an interest in film that has never left me to this day. Oh and the film was amazing by the way."
65,6,Nothing special except the old gang,"If you were expecting something different and better, you will be disappointed with SW7, Force Awakens."
66,10,Abrams Wins.......Again!,I was lucky enough to see The Force Awakens on its release day and I'm glad to say that it was spectacular! 
67,6,A (near) perfect synthesis of old and new. This FEELS like Star Wars!,"This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying ""it's a remake"", or a ""rip-off"". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back."
68,1,Disney Sponsored Fan Fiction. The Force Awakens Is A Disgraceful Example Of Corporate Filmmaking.,"For those praising this film, "
69,,Horrific! By all means: avoid.,"During the opening few minutes of this movie, it looked like reviewers were right: this was going to be a fantastic movie! But by the 1/2 way mark, it was apparent all the positive reviews were bogus hype."
70,10,Loved it. Grade: A+++++,The original cast is back and fits in beautifully with the new crew. The CGI are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE.
71,10,This IS the sequel you're looking for,"Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. "
72,10,Top Two In Star Wars Movies (nothing else comes close),I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! 
73,8,Action overshadows the Star Wars universe story,"Yes, the action and cgi are good. Sadly the movie drowns in it and leaves no room for the Star Wars story. As some other reviewer already pointed out, yes it is a remake of part IV. When part I came out the audience was not happy, they missed something. How is it possible that one can watch part 4 - 6 every year, part 1 - 3 every couple of years and part VII once every 10 years? Same thing with all the other movies like Star Trek: the future begins, the Tranformers trilogy, the latest Avanger movies, when does one get tired of 2 hours only action, action and more action? This movie just does not have the George Lucas touch, it is another mainstream brave Disney family action movie. Part 4 - 6 had some pretty daring scenes, Leila in exciting cloths, this movie everyone is wrapped from head to toe, so damn brave it makes you sick. I conclude to say it's another victim of Disney."
74,6,Episode J.J. - The Force is still asleep.,"SPOILER ALERT: Plot points discussed Entertaining as a stand alone movie, but a huge disappointment for a remakequel. The purpose of this film is to sell toys and to sever all connections with the previous six movies and make it Disney Wars."
75,10,Blew my mind!,"I'm a veeeeery long-term Star Wars fan, since back in '77."
76,6,"unoriginal film, lame bad guy","It was like watching episode IV again. Another death star, but this time built on a planet. And even easier to destroy. What's next, a death galaxy?"
77,10,"New director, new plot, still the Star Wars I loved","You might have read other reviews, where a lot of negative feedbacks are given, most commonly you might see ""it was a reboot of its past episodes!"" (wrong and laughably again), or even more hilariously ""it was nothing like George Lucas' Star Wars films!"". But fortunately most people by now know that when there is a change of director within a franchise you can always expect the movies to have a lot of contrary, clueless whiny trolls crying about them. Though most tend to die off and go on with their lives the first few weeks after the movie releases.......at least all the ones that actually HAVE lives do ; )"
78,6,Star Wars could have been better,"After watching the 7th film of Star Wars, I came to the conclusion that George Lucas would have done better. It was good but it could have been better. Even I could have done better."
79,2,Star Wars: The Force is for Everyone Apparently,"Context: I grew up on these films. I didn't think the first trilogy was the ""best thing ever made,"" but the story was gripping, the material was fresh, and I couldn't get enough of it. Hell, I can still remember playing the pod racer game on N64 after episode 1 came out and every time I would race, would relive the stories in my mind."
80,,The Force Has Indeed Awoken,"We waited for years, and it's finally here. At 3 o'clock this morning I entered the cinema wide-eyed, full of hope. As was with many people's childhoods, Star Wars was a staple of mine, and to this day the original trilogy still stand as some of my favourite films. J.J. Abrams famously managed to reignite the Star Trek franchise with two fantastic films, so when tasked with doing similar to Star Wars, some people were sceptical, but nonetheless excited. The main questions is: did he deliver? Yes he damn well did!"
81,10,A Masterpiece wrapped in a Masterpiece wrapped in the best movie of 2015!,"J.J. Abrams has crafted a fantastic new episode of Star Wars in the classic style of the original trilogy, restoring competence, humor, convincing dialogue and acting, thrills, spills and chills. He has created new, likable characters that the audience can actually get behind, instead of be annoyed, disconnected and detached from, as in the widely-derided prequel trilogy. The film was (thankfully) crafted as the ""anti-prequel."" "
82,10,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!,"I usually don't do reviews but there is an overwhelming amount of bad reviews of people who obviously have too much time to write books about how bad they thought this movie was, but in my opinion they don't do this film justice by giving it these bad reviews."
83,10,Freaking amazing!,"I simply cannot comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review. It was, without a doubt brilliant. "
84,10,Brilliant!!!,"From the the intro to the very end credits, I had goosebumps all the  way. Ignore the hate, because this was the best Star Wars movie so far,  I can't wait for Episodes 8 and 9.  I smiled all the way and never had so much joy in a cinema before. This  movie gives you the Star Wars feeling we all love from the original  trilogy. I wanted to go to the toilet so bad, but I got so in into  movie I never went. The film is simply brilliant. It is not in anyway a  remake of Episode 4, they should try actually re-watching A New Hope.    I recommend this movie to everyone!"
85,6,An exercise in nostalgia and CGI,"After watching this film (and being relatively unimpressed by it), I went to Superstore to pick up a few groceries. Unexpectedly, the film's value hit me there, rather than when I was in the theater watching the film, as it was in the store that I became aware of modern film's propensity to market rather than to innovate. Pictures of Stormtroopers, Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren crowded the shelves, plastered onto Shreddies' boxes, Jam jars, Eggs, TV screens, clothing, toothpaste, organic chips, and even diapers. I realized that a two and a quarter hour exercise in bland escapism had managed to transcend the silver screen, embedding itself firmly in our everyday lives, from our diapers to our cereal. While I do find this rather abhorrent, I can't deny that it is definitely remarkable."
86,10,There has been an awakening... and it's wonderful!!!,Finally Star Wars is back in full force! 
87,7,Has to be the worst movie I have ever seen,"When it comes to this, it seems that there really isn't much of substance to this movie. Various things happen, a lot of commotion on the screen, but where do they ultimately lead? What is the bigger picture? Truth is that there isn't even a bigger picture. What we see, is all that is and it is nothing particularly exciting even if they try to mask the hollowness behind a bunch of explosions, shootings and other stuff. "
88,10,Superb Entertainment,"Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens was absolutely incredible. The theater experience was the best movie watching experience I have ever endured. It's worth the hype and so much better than the prequels. In fact, it's my favorite Star Wars film. The cast and characters, old and new, are all phenomenal but Daisy Ridley (Rey) stole the show for me. I have fallen in love with Star Wars all over again. Thank you JJ Abrams for a story that will live on for generations to come. Wow! Bring on Episode VIII! The greatest Star Wars movie of all time and the most fun I've ever had in the theater. I just bought it on blu-ray and will enjoy this film for the remainder of my life. "
89,6,Pretty Disappointing...,"I am not sure why I gave this a six. It probably deserves less. Maybe some of the acting was decent and at least there was no Jar-Jar Binks; although the stereotype Eastern ""grandma"" was rather painful (however, mercifully, she did not tag along)."
90,2,JJ does it again (and not in the good way),"You'll notice that SW7 only has a ""based on characters"" credit for George Lucas. That's because Disney decided to make it ""for the fans"" -- that is, a movie pieced together out of a sort of ""greatest hits"" of the other 6 movies, with nothing new whatsoever. We are, they suppose, not smart enough to absorb new plot devices, and will be perfectly happy to give them money to show us the old stuff over again. And based on box-office revenues they appear to be right."
91,,"If you think this movie is bad, the Force is With You.","Aside from the Classic Star Wars aesthetic that was very well incorporated in this new installment, there is really not much else to look forward to."
92,10,"Fantastic, lost for words!","Well, what can I say. First, let me state I'm 42 years old and a massive Star Wars fan. And if there's one reason why this movie is so fantastic, it's that I saw the same wonder and magic in my daughter's eyes that I had when I was a young boy."
93,10,Now THIS is Star Wars!,"This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in general. The movie is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and the beautifully written plot. "
94,9,The Force Awakens Review,When I went to the Cinema to watch The Force Awakens and I was really excited for the comeback of Star Wars films and the result was great one of if not my favourite film with Daisy Ridley as Rey being good. And return of Han Solo unfortunately he died Which was a shock when I watched it at the Cinema but overall great film With a great plot with the 1st Order and the Resistance I really liked Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. With his awesome mask and he was a different kind of character that you don't tend to see in Star wars at the end I thought the bit with Luke Skywalker and was a let down as I hoped to see more of Luke but it was a very good film to watch.
95,10,Now THIS is Star Wars!,"This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in general"
96,7,What were they thinking????,"The movie was wrong on so many levels, that it felt like watching a Rip-off of star wars episode 4."
97,10,Excellent Start to New Trilogy,"This was an unbelievable start to finish movie that was just the beginning of what we are going to see from another great Star Wars trilogy. The pacing of this movie was fantastic all the way through. I was never bored or getting tired of the plot. The characters really make this happen both old and new. Harrison Ford as Han Solo was amazing but the newer cast has a bright future. I liked the development of Rey and Finn and I am super interested to see where they are going next. I also thought that Poe was a great addition as well. If I had to pick a favorite character from this movie alone I would go with Rey. Her story starting as a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, relying on her own self to just survive, on to learning her importance in the war to come against the First Order was really well done. "
98,6,"Now pay the price for your lack of vision! - What we expected we got, for better or worse.","""Brilliant! A work of true genius! The greatest most thrilling movie not only of this year but of the entire century! A fearless and daring work that reinvents the genre and reinvigorates it and sends it launching into a new age! A triumphant masterpiece and a film for the ages that cements JJ Abrams as one of the most brilliant talents of his generation, a true joy and the best night ever at the cinema!"" – OK, just bill it to the usual address please Walt Disney inc, thanks!"
99,10,Exactly as I expected.,"I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original. Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. "
100,7,Star Wars IV: A New Hope,Star Wars IV: A New Hope Synopsis: 
101,1,A museum piece should stay in the museum. You don't alter and create new bits in it.,"If something ends, it means it doesn't go further. Sometimes it's better not to restart something that actually ended. Simply, because it can't go any further."
102,,Not that great,Spoilers may ensue...
103,10,Sci-Fi geeks are insane! LOL,"I mean honestly, what do these whiny nerds want? Prior to episode 7, I distinctly remember die-hard fans complaining how the prequels were pure garbage. Now you're all saying you miss the prequels? XD XD XD"
104,10,So hilarious to see 1 star troll ratings,"Just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Having seen all the movies at least one time each, The Force Awakens was exactly what I wanted it to be. A nod at the aging characters of the original trilogy and the setup for the next two movies. "
105,10,Best film of the Star Wars saga. By......a.........MILE.,"I know biased fanboys of the painfully average, outdated original trilogy will cluelessly cry about this, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. "
106,9,An amazing homage to New Hope,"I was blown away by this movie, despite how obvious this was J.J. Abrams' homage to his love of the original Episode IV, A New Hope:"
107,6,Predictable Reboot,"Talk all the crap you want about the prequels but I actually liked them. Were they perfect? By no means. They had their issues but so did Return of the Jedi. The franchise as a whole started going downhill when Gary Kurtz was fired after Empire. Lucas chose adorable Ewoks as opposed to Wookies as the inhabitants of Endor. With that being said, regardless, it's his franchise and his rules I suppose. The prequels were his story whether you like it or not and what you got was a decent story that was overshadowed by overdone CGI and bad acting on the part of Hayden Christensen. Even with the prequels' problems they told a story of Palpatine's rise to power and Anakin Skywalker's journey to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. Could have it used tighter editing? Absolutely. Could they done without Jar Jar Binks? Certainly. Did it tell a decent story? I know it's my opinion but yes, I believe they did."
108,10,Absolutely perfect in everything it sets out to do.,"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with the start of the film on a Tatooine-like planet, Jakku, as per usual. It follows the thrilling journey of the brilliant Poe of the Resistance and Finn of past Storm trooper relation, at first, as you are thrown into the blistering excitement. But then there is a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic — with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc)."
109,6,I don't like what this film is doing to Star Wars.,Return of the Jedi had a solid ending and to continue this story you have to do better than (spoiler alert) give us no context in A New Hope Reboot that just happens to say Episode VII The force Awakens.
110,10,The Franchise is rescued!,"Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that, for many traditional fans, had become a niggling source of disappointment."
111,6,Force Awakens is to Star Wars what Zathura was to Jumanji,"So, I finally got around to watching the new Star Wars movie and although it entertained me, my biggest feeling when I walked out was... disappointment."
112,3,Just trash,"This movie just copied the entire plot of New Hope. The acting in this movie was complete garbage and the names of the characters were awful. It took them this long to come up with names like Po,Fin, and Rey. The villain was a complete joke. First off Kylo Ren is a awful name. Some how Kylo loses in a fight to Rey even though she had ZERO training and she just learned what the force was. Kylo also looks like a dirty man if you know what I mean. The only reason why this movie has such a high rating is because it has Star Wars in the name and the original actors back. Now to the worst part of the movie. They killed off the best character in the series Han Solo. His little annoying son kills him. Everything about this overrated trash makes me angry. I just hope this falls out of the top 250. This movie was just a cash grab and nothing else. I suggest you do not watch this overrated trash."
113,,What a load of crap!,"Lousy movie, stupid, shallow, even more childish than ever. Same sh@t, different outdated gimmicks piled on an ancient concept that never evolved to graduate from a child care center."
114,10,Simply Amazing,"I vaguely remember my first introduction to Star Wars. My uncle had taken me with his family to see some horror flick at the Drive-in about a ship that needed to kill people in order to keep the engine running; I seem to remember grey uniforms and it might have a gun ship of some kind? I don't remember too well; I was young, it was gross, and so I didn't pay attention. Looking out the back window of the station wagon, I saw the opening scenes of Empire Strikes Back. I spent the rest of the time entranced, even without having any sound. My first ""grown up"" movie in a normal theater was Return of the Jedi. My mom had the Beta disks. I wore them out. I had the tape series. I wore it out. twice. Then, the movies were re-released. And altered. And the death spiral of the series began."
115,9,Star Wars Episode Seven is a Force to be Reckoned With,"The opening of Star Wars, The Force Awakens, with the titles traveling along the screen, and the orchestra following in the background, immediately absorbed me into the experience. Although I initially feared this sequel would fall flat, from the very beginning, the film sends its audience on a magnificent ride across the galaxy. There are significant gaps in the story-line, from the conclusion of the last installment up until this point in time, some of which are addressed over the film's duration, while others will hopefully be answered in future episodes. Despite some segments of the film bearing a striking resemblance to scenes encountered in previous installments, these are so well delivered, they offer the viewer moments of nostalgia, that have not been felt, since the original trilogy, all those years ago."
116,10,The movie was great. Stop the whining.,"I don't really understand the negative reviews on here. People moaned that the prequels were nothing like the original trilogy and now they are moaning that this is too similar??? LOL Get a life, children!"
117,10,Easily the best Star Wars film.....by far.,"This new edition to the Star Wars franchise is arguably the best by  far. It combines the time-tested formula with the new and raw ideas  Disney brings to the table. From the moment the traditional text crawl  appears, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat serving you  with action-packed scenes and unpredictable reveals that will surely  make you wanting for more.  One thing I particularly adored is how this new movie creativity uses  the Force. Disney has steered away from the boring 'push and pull'  concept and found ways you could never imagine the Force can be applied  and used on.  The presence of the old cast was monumental as it helped the old  audience transition to the new heroes  as they have similar (but also  diverse) qualities with their old counterparts. The ending, as  expected, is a major cliff-hanger. Expect to walk out of the cinema  dazed, amazed and confused as the movie, not only, answer the old  questions, but at the same time unfold new mysteries for the audience  to ponder on. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a movie this generation  should really see. I genuinely recommend you see it on IMAX so you may  experience the Force in a way that will leave you lost in thought in  the days to come.  You-are-wel-come"
118,6,"Thank you, Disney, for murdering a huge part of my childhood","Despite the review's title, I actually enjoyed the movie quite a lot - hence the rating of six out of ten. I think Abrams did a good job as a director, and the actors were also good enough. But that is it. In fact, the writing of this movie is so deeply flawed I have a hard time finding anything positive about it. And yes, by the way, that is a fact. You will forgive me for saying it like this, but the prequels are better. Again, that is a fact. It is not a matter of opinion. I will try to explain it here."
119,10,J.J. Abrams Has Restored Hope to the Star Wars Universe,"I purposely waited 24 hours before writing my review because I wanted to digest the film that long to truly take it in and reflect before I actually reviewed it. I wanted the euphoria of seeing the next chapter of the saga on the big screen to subside some so that I can make an objective review, but alas the euphoria has not subsided and the childlike excitement is still at an 11! This is plain and simply a great Star Wars film! In fact, I feel it is the second best offering of the franchise (behind 'The Empire Strikes Back'). From the opening crawl to the epic and somewhat moving final scene the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. "
120,6,It's just a re-boot,"I say this contains spoilers, but anyone who's watched the 1977 original will have seen it all anyway. Some plans (sorry, a part of a map) are hidden in a droid which, after wandering across a desert (check) falls into the hands of the adopted son of a farmer (sorry, a lone female scavenger). At the same time it is hunted by the Galactic Empire (sorry, the First Order), under the command of a bad guy in a mask (sorry - oh no, that was correct, though this time there's a bad gal in a mask as well)."
121,10,"J.J. brought a balanced, not forced, return to the Star Wars saga","I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you still haven't seen it: stop reading about it, and go see it."
122,6,Over-hyped,"I liked the first 45 minutes to hour of this film. It had the magic that I loved and expected from a Star-Wars film and I was thoroughly enjoying myself. Then the film, without warning, slid off a cliff and into a deep dark river. I can't exactly pinpoint where the film became sluggish and utterly predictable, but I seem to always go back to the scene where Han Solo is introduced and the terrible Rathtar sequence after it. The film showed its true colors as sequel bait by the third act and I had already made up my mind on this painfully average film. It's essentially a remake of a New hope, which I think would've been fine if it was done with a little bit more effort. A lazy attempt at starting a sequel trilogy. Let me guess that episode eight will be a lot like Empire in that Luke will act as Yoda to Rey and the good guys will lose throughout the film for it to end on a down note and a cliffhanger. As Immortan Joe would say: Mediocre!!!"
123,3,Disney's Hype Wars Won. Star Wars Did Not - A Safe Corporate Exercise In Entertainment.,"Following the mass-marketing campaign extraordinaire, I truly was fooled into believing this was a fantastic movie before I saw it. I believed the hype, that this was a Star Wars returned to form.....It is not! "
124,,Moron Director.,"This moron JJ, managed to single-handedly screw up an entire franchise. I'm not going to theatres for any future Starwars flicks, because of him. I was hugely disappointed. It just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie... I really wonder how many episodes of lost this idiot truly worked on, probably just the pilot and that's it... Why he's such a big name in Hollywood is beyond me, absolutely terrible. The way this movie was hyped up, was just ridiculous... 2 billion box office... Highest grossed Star Wars film of all time... This... This lousy piece of crap of a film. You see people? This is how Hollywood works. They don't care about the fans or the story, it's all a money making scheme in this day and age in Hollywood."
125,10,Absolutely PERFECT.,Let me just say that this film was sensational!
126,10,Abrams Delivers!,"First off, PLEASE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION to the negative comments, poor excuses for reviews, and crybaby frustration out there from people who claim to be Star Wars fans. If anybody is upset about this film, does not like the film, or has negative things to say about the film, they are not truly a Star Wars fan and are probably upset that Jar Jar Binks was not in the movie. "
127,10,Disney and Abrams bring Star Wars back to full glory.,"I know I'm late to the Star Wars party, but there's an old say; better late than never. By now, many of us had seen what Abrams and Disney brought to us to the big screen, as it's currently breaking box office records left and right, and could possibly Avatar for highest grossing domestic film of all time in a matter of days now. It's been 10 years since the last Star Wars film, and boy, it couldn't had come out in a better time. Abrams and Disney bring us Episode 7: The Force Awakens. How good is it?"
128,10,Abrams saves a franchise with only 2 good other films (Rogue One and Empire) to deliver what's EASILY the best one yet!,"Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could do/ever has done. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. "
129,6,A new hype,"1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert."
130,10,"Welcome Back, Star Wars","A perfectly balanced blend of charming love-letter to the style and structure of the original trilogy, infused with an emphatic freshness of humour and new ideas, creates what could be argued to be the purest straight Star Wars film of the entire saga. Paced to perfection as it hits the familiar narrative beats we come to expect, Awakens is alive with the over-the-top action and stirring sentimentality of the films we grew up with while also casting very modern shadow of intrigue and mystery that sets the mind whirring with possibilities as the story moves forward; a shot of pure adrenaline to the heart of the Star Wars fan in all of us that had laid dormant for ten years since Lucas completed his prequel trilogy."
131,6,The Force is weak with this one...,"I went into the movie flushed with anticipation. As the story went on, and we were thrown recycled plot point after plot point I started getting angry. By the time the credits rolled, I swear i was close to ripping my seat arms off. I was FURIOUS. I felt duped. I felt like an idiot. I was promised a movie that would make up for the prequels. I was promised a sequel, but instead got a remake. A remake that completely invalidated the original trilogy. All the events that led to the fall of the Empire in Jedi were for naught. 30 years later, and nothing's changed! Everybody's back where they started, more or less. I couldn't believe it. And to make matters worse, it seemed like nobody agreed with me. I pointed out these failings to numerous friends and family and they were just like ""So what? It was awesome!"" Ugh. Does nobody care about seeing something new anymore? Something original? Say what you want about the prequels, but at least they were imaginative and took chances. IMO, the only thing Force Awakens does better than the prequels is the acting."
132,10,"Exciting, emotional and endlessly entertaining, the Force Awakens is one of the best movie theater experiences that I've ever had","The Force Awakens may not feel totally original, but in my opinion that doesn't take anything away from the film. It's fresh, exciting, loads of fun, and it introduces three fantastic new characters who will inspire a whole new generation of Star Wars fans. Its nods to the old fans make the film even more exciting, with Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Millennium Falcon making appearances that caused the entire theater to erupt with applause and cheers. Rey and Finn are immensely likable and both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega give great performances, and while Poe doesn't play a huge role, he is still a really charismatic character. BB8 was also awesome. "
133,6,George Lucas: No no no no no!,Why did I entitled the review this way? Because if I was George Lucas... this is what I would've said at the premiere of this film. Sad...
134,4,The Force is Undead,"So many possibilities to tell stories following the event after killing the Emperor and Darth Vader in Episode VI - and what they opted for!? A re-telling of Episode IV (a lost droid with a ofc important map in his memory, a deathstar again blabla). This is now the 3rd destroyed Deathstar - the engineers of the imperial troops seems to me are not very capable of learning how to secure a Deathstar and the script-writers are in an immense lack of imagination or not daring or probably both. This time a whole planet is the gun - what's next!? Must the rebells/resistance destroy a whole galaxy to get rid of the 4th Deathstar!? Also what I don't like are the zillions of inconsistencies here - no cameras or motion trackers on the base, all the gates and doors open, u just have to push the button or walk through the ofc open gates, and remember the base is a whole planet but ofc the heroes just stumble over each other. Or all the intel the storm-trooper-traitor got about the Deathstar - I mean he was just a storm-trooper of low rank, how the f*** he would know how to bring a planetsized-weapon down!? So in a meeting this dude just says - ah you need a plan how to kill that thing!? Easy! And on top they take a captain of the stormtroopers hostage and she just shut down the shield, and no other commando-post is able to override the shutdown!? It's just ridiculous the more you think about it. Or the scene where the Millennium Falcon is (re)entered by Han Solo and Chewie- looks like the universe is a small neighborhood. Even in my hometown I wouldn't run by coincidence over one of my old cars... Really I try to think of sth I like in this movie - and there is nothing. literally nothing. i don't like all the ""humoresk"" comments through the whole movie, I don't like that every scene has a equivalent scene in one of the old movies, the acting is mediocre, the action is mediocre, everything is predictable, the dialogs - well, never were a strength of the Star Wars movies. Rethinking all the fuss about Star Wars imo there are only two decent movies at all: IV and V, with VI (the Ewoks...) the decline already began. Episode I to III were stuff made for kids (I mean little kids)- droids with humor and afraid of being shot I expect and enjoy (!) in comedy-movies like Wall-E - but not in a sci-fi context like Star Wars. Only III of that trilogy wasn't too bad. So if u didn't see VII already - wait till u can stream it or buy/lend on DVD (wait till its cheap), in a cinema I will never go again to watch a Star Wars movie. JJ Abrams did a great jobs with the 2 Star Trek movies and I hoped he would do great stuff again - but with this work he did a bad job. I know, I know he didn't wrote the script but he got enough influence to put the Star Trek franchise on the next level, why not Star Wars!? Well, how its done Miller showed with Mad Max Fury Road - I had to watch that one 3 times in a row - but this one I will never watch again."
135,,Luke rewrites Matthew,"This is a replacement comment for the one written on opening night. I've had a chance to see it again, this time in 3D, and of course think about it."
136,9,Justifies the hype and awakens the Force that franchise lost in prequel trilogy,There are very few people who won't admit this is the most anticipated movie of this decade. Taking all those expectations into account reviewing this title is quite a difficult and delicate thing but after seeing this movie on its release day it is impossible to hide all these positive emotions. Every fan will rediscover his inner child and get goosebumps at almost every reference to the galaxy far away.
137,10,People that are hating this film are sheeps,This is actually better than the originals i love all star wars films but im watching back the originals and honestly they are so boring the prequels and the new sequel trilogy so far are way better honestly this film is better than a new hope and honestly its not even that much of a remake its kinda different there are some bits the same but this is way better than all 3 of the originals. So people who are saying this is rubbish ur just being ungrateful coping what those few other people are saying and making up little stories bout other people hating it because your all low lifes this is one of the best star wars films only behind ROTS and LJ. Plus most people who watched this film obviously love it because it made like over 2 billion in the box office and raked even more money when dvd was released
138,8,Been waiting to say this for a long time... THE PREQUELS WERE WAY BETTER!!!!,"If you liked any of the previous Star Wars movies, then get ready for the Harry Potter villain's lovechild with President Snow to poop on them. I knew that Han Solo would die, Harrison Ford wanted his character killed off in the first movie, and the second, and the third; and I knew that Disney would take liberties with characters from the books (since they haven't had an original thought since Mickey Mouse), and there is nothing that could make me happier than to see all the prequel haters get their comeuppance. I know, I know, you'll all say, ""Hey, I liked it!!!"" No. No you didn't. You can lie temporarily, but in the end, no matter how much money this makes, this is the worst attempt at a Star Wars movie and I love it. This is an insult - Like if Iron Man III threw up the deleted scenes that weren't good enough for freaking' Iron Man III and J.J. scraped them up in a strange, tearful Jos Whedon-esque wannabe student film and slathered them with Millennium Falcon. Although, it had great special effects, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker weren't fat, but no CGI could get Han and Chewie to be any less 70. Han's Kessel run would take a lot of parsecs these days. Good thing the smugglers are still megalomaniacs and really need to discuss things before being foiled by sticky ball monsters (WTF?) and storm troopers still can't shoot or I would still have 2 hours left on my life to think, ""hey, I like Star Wars and I'm excited to see this movie!"" "
139,10,Incredible reboot,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an incredible reboot/sequel that successfully combines the new with the old in an emotional, consistently funny and thrilling revitalisation of the Skywalker saga. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are all incredible. Adam Driver is also incredible as Kylo Ren, the franchise's most interesting and compelling villain. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are also incredible with their returning characters having grown and evolved since episode VI. It's expertly paced without a single scene dragging or being boring. The music by John Williams is once again reliably perfect. J. J. Abrams' direction is excellent and the film is visually stunning with excellent CG. It also has a fantastic lightsaber fight."
140,6,A New Hope Awakens...with the same plot lines (spoilers abound),"The good: Fun, re-watchable, roller coaster type movie with very fast pacing. John Boyega was a standout & Harrison was as snappy as ever. Great action overall, fun choreography of lightsaber fights,etc"
141,10,Freaking amazing,"I simply can not comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review! It was, without a doubt, brilliant. The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters vs returning characters and story lines was brilliant. "
142,6,Average follow-up with unoriginal plot,The Force Awakens is a customized version of a New Hope. A person who has seen both movies will easily be able identify the similarities. It is not a complete dud but it could have been much better.
143,9,Don't worry. It's great!,"Do you remember when people used to joke around about another Star Wars movie being made? Well, now we actually have one!"
144,6,A third Death Star killed Star Wars,"Dear all,"
145,5,Star Wars without a story,"Before I start writing this review, I want to say I'm a huge fan of George Lucas' Universe. I have the 6 previous movies on Blu-Ray, which I love very much. I also played the games, watched Star Wars the Clone Wars film and TV show as well as reading the books."
146,,Star Wars: episode whatever; The Force Can't be Arsed.,"*contains a good few spoilers!* I felt an initial thrill when the title screen and music came up, yet, despite some pleasing tense moments when I was on the edge of my seat, the well-worn familiarity made this whole film nothing more than a pleasant sepia amble down memory lane – a rehash of all I fondly remembered from the old days before everything went wrong and became a dry politics show/pantomime with Yoda leaping about in a fashion most unbecoming of a Jedi Warrior of his stature."
147,10,Awesome Movie,"I saw Star Wars in 1977 and since then I have seen all the episodes multiple times. The Force Awakens is one of the best entries in the series if not the best one yet. I do not understand any negative reviews, especially by the so-called original fans. This movie is awesome and outstanding. "
148,9,A bad return to the Star Wars Franchise,"I'd like to start off by saying that this movie had a lot of good things and bad things about it. I'd rank it 4th in the series of my favourites (6, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2, 1). It tried to look like the 4th Episode, but was absolutely incomparable to it, and the attempt at making it look like that, was awful and a pathetic idea."
149,8,Very good compared to the past,The force awakens was a very enjoyable movie for the average star wars fan. New viewers of the series will also probably enjoy the movie. The movie critics if the world that look for something new and innovating will hate this movie. This movie is a close replica of the first star wars movie in a couple ways. If you were to summarize The Force Awakens and A New Hope at the same time you would recognize how similar they are. Now for star wars fans that isn't the worst thing in the world because it is refreshing to see new faces and things from the old movies that all is star wars fans love. The only disappointing result of this movie is the company making the best and most complex character of the movie a big cry baby everywhere you see him. Even in the Disney World park Kylo Ren throws fits. It's truly disappointing to see the downplay of such an interesting character.
150,8,"If your new to Star Wars you'll enjoy it, if your a fan you'll hate it.","First off let me say I've been a Star Wars fan for YEARS, I've seen the prequels, the original trilogy, and I've watched the tv series (clone wars, rebels, etc.) when I first heard about this movie I was really exited, especially hearing that Han, Luke, Leigh, and other original trilogy cast we're returning to their roles for the first time in over 30 years. Kyle ren looked like a really cool villain, with the crossed light saber, and rey seemed interesting, all in all the trailers looked great and I was exited. Then the movie came out and I saw it and we'll...mixed emotions. The bad: the story feels more of a reboot of Star Wars, with no real new story. The empire was defeated years ago, but just brought back again for the sake of the plot/ no new ideas. Stormtroopers, oh, and let's just add a bigger Death Star. Obviously very poor writing is shown in this movie. It feels like a joke, a parody of Star Wars. Still that's not to say I enjoyed this movie to some extent, the cinematography in some scenes is excellent, the space battles and action are every well done, the VFX was great, and of course the score by John Williams is brilliant as always. That being said the story, the plot, the characters, and the overall direction of this movie was a joke to me. I was hoping to see the story go in new directions but it didn't. Luke isn't even in the movie, Rey and Finn are these young kids who know nothing about the force, yet can go toe to toe with Kylo ren in lightsaber combat, can pilot a ship with ease, it's just an obvious mess. If you've never seen Star Wars and this is the first one you watch, you may enjoy it. If not, you'll hate it. For me I had mixed feelings but overall it was a mess."
151,6,"New Title - ""Nostalgia""","I knew going in to this film that it wasn't going to be as good as the first two films. Still, I did have high expectations for this film that unfortunately feel flat. This film seems like the first three films thrown together in a blender. With the all the similarities, I was surprised there were no ewoks in the film. Aside from the plot, I felt like the old characters were given too much screen time. While I do love Harrison Ford (My favorite actor), I feel that a lot of the time he doesn't fit into the plot. His relationship with Leia seems forced. These old characters overshadow the potential of Rey and Finn. I like the two new main characters along with Poe who is great in the film. But, this overshadowing wasn't just during the film. Mark Hamill was SECOND BILLED in the credits and didn't have a SINGLE line! He was more important in Kingsman as Professor Arnold than he was in his signature film series. The one thing that saved this film was the action. It may have been michael bay- esque, but at least it was awesome. Episode IV and V in my opinion are 10/10 movies, but this film just didn't cut it. I'm not that big of a star wars fans as I haven't seen the prequel movies, but I know this one seemed like a Brady Bunch reunion. 6/10"
152,8,Recommended for viewing,"In general, I was satisfied with the viewing. The main thing that I liked was how the film was shot. First, the creators as much as possible embodied in it a visual image from old movies. Secondly, there were many actors and favorite characters from the old ""Star Wars"". Thirdly, the film has comical moments that fans of this space saga will certainly appreciate. Well, of course, a lot of shooting both on land and in space. "
153,6,"JJ Abrams, after this,PLEASE retire from The Seventh Art","Mr. Abrams, first i regret you exist in the World of Cinema. What's your career? What.. Star Trek 2009? That's basically that.."
154,8,A new story about old stories.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A new story about old stories. The obvious thing is that the new film of the new trilogy looks very nice, even when compared with the films of the 2000s, and especially when compared with the original trilogy. But, the story itself very strongly in some places begins to resemble the ""New Hope"". There are Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and others in this film, but in a more different form, which is why history begins to repeat itself accordingly. But even with these moments, you want to watch the new Star Wars, because it's all just as beautiful and interesting. New characters have entered this huge universe well and I hope they will take root well in it."
155,6,The Vidiot Reviews...,Star Wars: The Force Awakens
156,4,Get swept up in the nostalgia and enjoy it... just don't think too hard about it.,"OK so I went into TFA with very low expectations, mostly because it was directed by JJ Abrams and he single-handedly slaughtered the Star Trek timeline with his two horrendous movies (don't get me started on that we'll be here all day)."
157,,Lacks imagination,Star Wars to me has always been about imagination.
158,10,Best Movie Ever?,"I don't understand why this movie has gotten so many negative reviews. I think it is underrated, so I was compelled to give it a perfect 10 score. My original thinking was that it was somewhere around 9.5."
159,8,"After Many Years of Waiting, This is the Star Wars Film you are Looking For...","Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is directed by former Star Trek director J.J. Abrams and focuses around a scavenger (Daisy Ridley), a runaway stormtrooper (John Boyega) and the former war hero Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as they search for the key to destroying the newly-formed First Order, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Overall, I am a huge Star Wars fan who knows quite a thing or two about the franchise (not to brag). When I first found out about this film being under production, I was very excited, yet nervous as Star Wars films have had their bad days. Now, after two years of reflecting on the film, I think I am finally ready to get my opinion out there."
160,10,"It ain't broke, so JJ didn't fix it","I have heard quite a bit of hatred about this movie being too much like episode IV: A New Hope, but the one question I have is what would YOU do differently? "
161,10,Grow up and enjoy something for once.,"Why are all the reviews for this movie so negative??? Whenever I click on user reviews for a good movie like this one, why are the only reviews that come up 1s and 2s? Why does IMDb decide to put all the negative reviews at the front of a movie with a rating in the high 8's when a terrible movie like Pixels has all 9s and 10s??? I find it extremely odd."
162,6,Spaceballs 2: The quest for more money,Something fans of the first Spaceballs waited for so long. Was it worth it? Yes and no.
163,10,Could be the best episode of the Star Wars franchise,Great story and action. Even an emotional twist. Character's even better than the New Hope. JJ did it right. Absolute entertainment is what this episode has. I suggest go to Disney x and complete the marathon before #9.
164,6,i had high hopes but was disappointed,"i saw the movie yesterday but was very disappointed the characters played by john boyega and daisy ridley looked childish and the dialogues looked like they were trying to copy a marvel film and failed miserably at it. i wouldn't say the film is 1/10 that would be too harsh, the film had its moments but 6/10 would be correct. i personally felt that the phantom menace was better than this. when you walk out of the movie you will feel disappointed and i would say the acting was also not that good. there is no mention of how the first order rose to power and build a death star as far as i remember the empire was crushed in the 3rd episode."
165,8,Give the Sensation of Déjà Vu,"Thirty years after the fall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is vanished and there is a new threat to the Republic: The First Order under the command of the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the Resistance has sent her best pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to the planet Jakku to get a map with the location of her brother. However, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the Stormtroopers destroy the village and Poe hides the map in his droid BB- 8 before he is captured. Ren wants to kill the last Jedi and needs to know his whereabouts. But the Stormtrooper FN-2187 (John Boyega) saves Poe and flees with him in a TIE fighter. Poe calls him Finn, but they crash on Jakku and Finn survives while Poe disappears. Meanwhile the scavenger teenager Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds BB-8 and brings him to the trade camp. But Ren discovered that BB-8 has the map and attacks Jakku. However Rey, Finn and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon that is left in a junkyard and escape from Jakku. When the spacecraft breaks down in space, they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca. They have an incident with gangs but they succeed to go to the Resistance base, but Rey is captured by Ren. But the Resistance learns that the huge Starkiller Base is powering a weapon to destroy their planet and now their only chance to destroy the weapon depends on Han Solo, Chewbacca and Finn that wants to save Rey. "
166,6,JJ Abrams RUINED it.,"Picture this: You wait an entire year for an Episode of Star Wars you thought would NEVER come. All of a sudden, the hype builds to epic proportions, the cash grab begins before the movie ever comes out on screen."
167,4,Another disappointing review :(,"*** Spoiler Alert *** I just wanted to start by saying, I am a true SW fan; I love all the previous SW films (including Episodes I-III, although I think the books are much better!); I have read over 50 SW novels (my favourite is Darth Plagueis by James Luceno, hands down); and I even enjoy watching SW the Clone Wars and SW Rebels on the weekend with my girlfriend. Saying that, I really wanted to enjoy this film, so I walked in with no expectations."
168,,1977 again,"With the familiar John Williams score, fast pacing, familiar characters such as Chewbacca and R2D2, and some wonderful visual effects, I can understand why many people enjoyed this movie on first viewing."
169,9,Exhilarating return to form!,"Let me preface my review by saying that I went into STAR WARS:THE FORCE AWAKENS (2015) 100% KNOWING that it would surpass George Lucas' generally poor prequel trilogy! Sorry, but those movies overall were very lacking in every department: character, dialogue, acting, and even the effects which were over-infested with CGI making them come across as phony. Having seen the original trilogy many times over and this new film TFA a couple of times, it saddens me that the prequels were so empty-headed and empty-hearted. There were a VERY FEW positives in the prequels, but overall they were just plain BAD!"
170,8,"Not as good as the originals, but light years better than the prequels","Another decade has past and J.J. Abrams, resurrector of franchises, has come to take his swing at bringing back a sense of movie magic to Star Wars. Did he succeed? I don't know yet. It's hard to judge such a hyped movie after a first viewing and this one leaves me with mixed, but positive feelings after watching it."
171,10,"The force has indeed awakened for Star Wars, and the haters continue to embarrass themselves. XD","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'."
172,8,The Beauty of Repeating History,"The story of Star Wars is one that many love and cherish across the generations. For each generation, it differs. Having been raised watching the original trilogy and then witnessing the second trilogy's release, I feel that I can only supply an opinion that could generally apply to my generation (as opposed to those who saw the originals in theaters or those born around the time of the second trilogy, etc.)"
173,6,The worst episode of all saga,"This is a very bad episodes for this saga. Inserting a funny afro American is a classic Hollywood stuff for a world wide pop up. Repeated story from the old episodes, really? For all this years they didn't design a original story. Don't know, but this is a big disappointment. Can't understand 8.5/10 for this comedy. Too much similar parts in the movie from the old episodes. OK, this is a movie for the kids right, but there is a too much aggregation for them. Don't know, but simple can't take this movie for a good, i hear too much laugh in the cinema hall for projection this movie like for a some Monty Python movie. Acting is good, but really John Boyega aka Finn is excess."
174,8,The Return of Star Wars,It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot.
175,6,"Recycled and uninspired,","I feel like writers and directors who are attached to big name revivals of some of histories greatest cinematic entries, don't even bother to watch the originals and try to improve upon them."
176,8,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens Review,"Abrams had the benefit of learning what didn't work in Lucas' prequels, and he's gone in the opposite direction. He's also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe."
177,7,Episode 4 revisited,"Star Wars force awakens is a good movie, don't get me wrong, but my review will be more negative than the average. I'm no going trough some good and bad moments from the movie, not in any special order."
178,5,Fun to watch but still very disappointing,***Spoilers***
179,,I had a bad feeling about this,"Star Wars To Do List: 1. Throw lots of money at an already established franchise. 2. Give a director lots of money to ""reboot"" an already established franchise. 3. Throw lots of money at a good writer who couldn't care less at this point, tell him to just tweek the first episode, then throw even more money at him. 4. Get the old beloved characters back and throw lots of money at them so they'll show up. 5. Introduce some new actors to hopefully appeal to younger audiences. Throw lots more money at them. 6. CGI and LOTS OF IT!!! 7. Throw in a bigger, more explosive death star. Blow it up, then rebuild a bigger one to blow up in the next installment. 8. And the profits start rolling in. (Disney destroys all it touches. 'Nuff said.)"
180,10,The Force Is Strong With This One,"As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I felt this movie birthed a new version of Star Wars. It was NOT like the prequels, but then again, it was NOT like the original trilogy- it was a beautiful combination of everything we've seen of Star Wars (with a bit of modern humor). This start to an epic trilogy is well on its way to becoming emotionally gripping, excitingly intense, and elegantly original. "
181,10,Perfect....,"JJ Abrahams has directed a fine Star Wars movie with numerous hidden references and Easter eggs which are pretty mind blowing once they are found out. Many fans keep complaining how the plot is similar to ""A New Hope"". However, a saga prominent as this one must recapture what was observed more than 3 decades ago to show obvious relevance to the past."
182,10,Force Awakens Review,"In my opinion Star Wars Force Awakens is the best movie so far. So I am writing this review to show why the people who think this movie is bad, in my opinion is wrong. First of all this Star Wars has the most humour since I would say: the empire strikes back. There is lots of humour between Rey and Finn, Han and Chewbacca and just BB-8 in general. There is a lot of referring back to characters and things that happened in the original trilogy, but wouldn't 9 out of 10 people be disappointed if some of these people or things weren't in it? Let us not forget that there are way more new characters that have a lot more screen time than the original cast including: Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo, Phasma, BB-8 and Snoke. The director JJ Abrams could have easily made the whole movie about Luke, Han, Leia and the empire, but he didn't. He made a new movie, with new characters which is very brave in a world at which will throw hate at anything people like or is popular. Now a big problem that people have with this movie is star killer base and that it is too much like the death star. So Kylo Ren is trying to recreate what his grandfather did including the death star. Even when the rebels find out about star killer base they reference the death star. In this movie they also made all main characters very interesting. Rey waits for her family as well as being one with the force. Finn is a rogue stormtrooper, which suddenly makes them more human. Kylo wants to live up to Vader as well as going back to Han and Leia. Han Solo is still interesting in his 4th film as his son is a sith working for the first order. I first saw this movie at the cinema on the 27th December 2015 and I wanted to be the person to that said it would be bad and prove it at the screening. However as well as being my favourite movie it is the movie that proved me so wrong - I was blown away. This movie is called Star Wars the Force Awakens which is fitting as after this film the force awakened in me."
183,8,The Force awakens and reminisce the originals,"For many years that you have been aching for a good massage. You have been to Thailand many years back and had an excellent massage by the sea. The masseuse applied strange techniques, and you wondered she knew what she was doing. But as her finger touched your upper back, you cried. You cried with joy. It was a feeling like never before. It was something that you could never forget. And in your trip, you went for massage three times, till each muscle in your body and brain was filled with nostalgia."
184,6,Meh.,"A fun time at the theatre but not much else. I liked the additions, and how the Force worked, but it was kind of a mess. Weird pacing, hyperactive editing, and plot points straight out copied from A New Hope. Rey was okay, she was overacting at times and her performance felt a bit too artificial, in fact the whole movie felt artificial. The directing was just, too much! Too much intensity, overly polished and produced, out of place crooked camera angles and slow zooms to make everything intense when it's completely unnecessary. Good performances overall, fun action, I was eating my popcorn pretty fast. Well timed fan services and winks to the original trilogy, but when I left the theatre I told myself:""Meh, it was fine."" Better than the prequels obviously, but that is not saying much. They crammed so much in one movie, that the movie itself felt claustrophobic. Kids will LOVE it. I, personally, liked it for what it was, but I was disappointed considering the hype and fantastic reviews. NOT A BAD MOVIE, at all, it's a fairly competent big budget space movie, but not as good as I thought it would be. Haters giving this 1 star are just lying. It is far from a bad movie, there was a lot of love and craftsmanship behind this film and it would never deserve a one star."
185,8,Miles better than the prequels,"Just ignore the haters and toxic fanboys who just love to hate a star wars film and enjoy this movie, it's way more fun than those horribly aged prequels<br /><br />yes it's similar to a new hope but it's not a remake of it because the characters and story its different, it's what this franchise needed the fans wanted a classic simple star wars and jj did just that and much more."
186,6,Had its fun moments but otherwise nothing new.,"While it was good to see a new Star Wars movie on the big screen I strongly felt that despite some fun scenes overall it was not that memorable. To sum up my experience, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was nothing new. I feel conflicted here. Yes it was a good time filler. Yes it was good to see a new entry into the Star Wars franchise. But the movie just felt like it was going over old ground, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before."
187,8,"On Second Thought, Fantastic Music","I previously wrote a scathing review of this film and gave it 3 stars. I now have to give it 8 for the music alone. The music is a ""10"" but the film is a ""3"". Let me explain."
188,7,Somewhat disappointed,"I grew up with Star wars and i just love the series and Think it should go on forever. Yes i gave it a 7 after all it is Star Wars. But yes i agree with someone saying the Star Wars feeling is almost non existent, cause it is. This is a regular Sci Fi action Movie. Just because you talk about Jedi and the force doesn't really make it Star Wars. "
189,4,insulting,This is my first IMDb review I only did it for Star Wars. Man after seeing this movie I was insulted. I am a huge Star Wars fan so I was anticipating great things. Sadly this movie is bad for many reasons and nearly ruined Star Wars
190,,"Unnecessary, boring and juvenile","Did the world really need ANOTHER Star Wars movie? It depends on who you ask. Star Wars junkies don't count as they're a notoriously biased and juvenile bunch and obviously they can't get enough of all things star wars, no matter how bad or unnecessary they may be. To everybody else, like me, the answer is NO."
191,10,"Great new start, brought out the worst in many fans.","This movie was fun. From beginning to end, it was a good way to jump start the star wars franchise. While I'm not a JJ Abrams fan at all, and can't stand his Star Trek movies, I also don't like his habit of let's do it because it's cool and never explain a thing, this was a fun movie. The new characters are tremendous and the only complaint I have is that it really brought out the worst in Star Wars fans. There's no such thing as black stormtroopers! How the hell does anyone know that? (I would have liked to know why they stopped using clones). Why a female jedi hero? Why the hell not? Just sit back and enjoy the movie or shut up."
192,8,Star Wars roars back to life,"The fate of a foot soldier, an ageing pirate (and his loyal sidekick), a young girl, a star pilot and the leader of an enemy army, all collide and intertwine in this highly anticipated return of the Star Wars series."
193,8,"The Force may be awakened, but its still in a daze.","The Force Awakens is fun and action-packed, if derivative, entertainment. It pays several homages to the original trilogy and introduces new characters, most of which are interesting. The story, as many have mentioned, is a rehash of Ep. IV, V, VI, to varying degrees, but I won't be stressing on that in this review since it's been validly stressed upon already. The CGI of course is great, and while it isn't used to add any new landscapes or settings, it does justice to the pre-established worlds of star wars. The background score is competent. I believe the acting has never been a forte of the Star Wars trilogy. Barring, Luke Skywalker there isn't really much in the way of brilliant 'acting' as opposed to mere 'reacting' to various situations and dangers. This is not to say that Darth Vader wasn't a villain of epic proportions, nor does it take away anything from the charismatic hero that was Han Solo, the only point being, that these characters were brought to life by brilliantly engaging story arcs, intelligent dialogue and individual peculiarities; Darth Vader's ominous voice, and Han Solo's rebellious charm. Yet, these have less to do with the more conventional sense of great acting; in the potent expression of emotions and thoughts, as wide as they may be. Heath Ledger's terrific performance in The Dark Knight is universally lauded, just as Jack Nicholson's in The Shining; that is the acting that levels great. And that is why, the acting in TFA does not specifically surprise me, it is only more of the same. The acting is good enough to serve the purpose. "
194,8,"Enough of the old, fresh with the new","Taking the first Star Wars with a fresh twist, it contains many subtle elements that tie in with the original film. Yet, this film is basically a repeat of the last, just with some fresh faces. That is not necessarily a bad thing however. It's a winning formula. For the fans, you'll absolutely love it."
195,6,"New movie, same episode.",I love Star Wars and yes even the prequels. Each film stood out on it's own and had it's own identity. The Force Awakens however is missing it's identity. First off trying to figure out who the main characters are will waste your time. It may be on purpose but do not expect much of a story here. The film is largely a run and gun blow this and that up and get away over and over again. Don't get me wrong seeing Han Solo and the special effects were great of course but there should be a point to all of it. Unfortunately the story leaves you feeling lost and confused. There is way to much resemblance to the original Star Wars that makes you feel like they filled up half the plot with the original script. Overall you can tell the difference when George Lucas isn't behind the camera. I hope the future movies will elaborate on the characters and story because so far it just feels like Disney is looking to make a quick buck of the Star wars name after buying the rights from George Lucas.
196,10,The Force Is Strong With This One. {The negative reviews are wrong},Whoever gave this a negative review clearly lost their minds or just doesn't have much going on upstairs to begin with. This film is exactly what all actual Star Wars fans wanted it to be.
197,6,Disney = 0,"As we know Disney has bought the rights for the all next Star Wars films. The moment was right, the comic book movies are on top of the production and is expected to decline. George Lucas has enough of it. Disney see this as a very good chance to score."
198,10,Worth the wait!!!,For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!
199,7,Just doesn't work somehow,"I don't know what it is, but it just seems like the soul of the Star Wars universe is missing. There is an emptiness that was only emphasized by killing off one of the main characters. It was almost like the director knew something was missing, and had to do this dramatic stunt just to make a surprise/shocking ending to add some sort of life to this shallow film."
200,4,Seriously terrible!,"Oh man, Star Wars was terrible, such a delusion, even worse than what I thought! Great VFX, very good photography as well as sound mixing and editing, and OK directing. Terrible acting, especially Daisy Ridley, and seriously awful screenplay; come on guys, my dog could've written better dialogue. "
201,,Disappointed,"I've been a Star Wars fan since Lucas wrote the book. The first movie, episode IV - A New Hope, was innovative, action packed, and both mentally and emotionally involving. Awakens mimics much of the original plot, mixing elements of of Episode V as well, but regardless of the similarities and action, it really was a let down. It relied to heavily on the story line and plot of it's predecessors and too little on it's own merits. Was it entertaining? To a point, Yes, but disappointing in it's content.There just isn't anything new here, just a rehash of old plots and old story elements. I did like the new players and have hope that Lucas will make use of this poor start to bring us something interesting and engaging."
202,10,A fantastic film if you understand context and managed expectations,"I loved this movie, immensely. It was fantastic. Too many people let hype culture kill their experience or something else.. I didn't. I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I've spent so much time with Star Wars throughout my life and this movie was a roller-coaster ride of emotions and fun. I am very excited for the upcoming releases, don't let the negative nancies ruin the movie for you. A movie can have flaws and still be fantastic, I don't understand why some people can't grasp that!"
203,9,The Force Is Here - And It's Welcome To Stay,"The return of Star Wars has been long-awaited, and it's finally here. With so much hype surrounding the film, there was no-doubt some extreme nervousness about the turnout of the film. But put your nerves at ease, because J.J. and his team have delivered very solid, flawed, but exciting Sci-Fi adventure."
204,10,Awesome Movie!,"This movie was excellent and they couldn't have done it better... I'm 27 years old & I've loved Star Wars since the third grade... It was very entertaining and exciting! People that are posting bad reviews are obviously extremely picky and it doesn't seem like anything can please them, but hey that's what opinions are for. They can't make a movie and please everyone but they sure made one that pleased the majority including myself. It felt like I was watching the original Star Wars and the new characters were very likable. The plot was outstanding and my fiancé and I enjoyed every second! I highly recommend anyone that hasn't seen it yet to do so ASAP!"
205,10,A fantastic return to a galaxy far far away,"Its finally here. After Disney's $4 Billion acquisition of Lucasfilm back in 2012, the announcement that there would be a sequel trilogy beginning with a 7th episode in the beloved franchise was met with intrigue and excitement by fans everywhere. I am a longtime fan of the saga(both the originals and prequels to a degree); and I have spent countless dollars on games(most recently Star Wars Battlefront) , books, and tuned in to the cartoon Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star wars rebels from time to time.This review will be lengthy, but there is so much to say about Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
206,7,"Haters will hate, no cure for that :)","I spent last half an hour reading first few dozens of reviews on IMDb. Every single one was bashing with rate from 1/10 (big majority) to maximum 4/10. Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not bad movie at all. Haters claim this is is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it."
207,10,"""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" a bold and brilliant continuation","The Force is with J.J. Abrahms. Star Wars fans, especially those of us who grew up with episodes IV, V, and VI, are going to be absolutely thrilled with Episode VII, aka ""The Force Awakens."" As the familiar music blasts through the speakers, the bold letters roll past you in space to get you up to speed as to where we are in the story...just like old times. The epic scale scenery, reminding you not only of past Star Wars episodes, but also of the vastness of space, wonderfully overloads your senses as the ships glide effortlessly through the galaxy in the foreground as they shadow the planets. "
208,6,"This viewer is in neither the ""love it"" nor the ""loathe it"" camp.","Basically adequate reboot of this legendary film series offers up a reasonably entertaining story, but one without much resonance. The special effects often tend to take over, and there's not really that much threat from the villains on hand. While it is a treat to see veterans of the franchise return to their beloved roles, they mostly take a back seat to the new characters. Yes, the yarn concocted here by director J.J. Abrams and original series screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan feels awfully familiar at times; there's no denying that. ""The Force Awakens"" also tends to get a little overly precious, as it concerns the new droid character BB-8."
209,10,One of My Favorite Films of ALL TIME,"First off, to those people who think that this is just a remake of A New Hope, it most certainly isn't. There are similar contrasts to it in parts, but in all honesty, isn't that what we all wanted? Everyone loves the Original Trilogy so much, why should we complain if there are some similarities? That doesn't make any sense to me. These people were just expecting too much in my opinion. They cannot be pleased with anything."
210,7,Near flawless film. Star Wars is back ! ** spoilers,"This film was nearly flawlessly executed . I have little to no complaints about it. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver really shine here . The opening scene on Jakoo rivals the opening scene from a new hope . I saw this opening night and it was the best movie experience I've ever had . The film combines old Star Wars themes such as : friendship, loyalty , adventure and brings it to a whole new time . Poe and Finn's friendship seems natural and real.Harrison Ford was fantastic and his performance was as good or better than the originals. The film also has great secondary characters of which my favorites are Snoke, General Hux and Maz. I am looking to see Luke Skywalker back in action in the Last Jedi and my only real criticism of the film is that I wish we saw more of him , but the last scene is so terrific it makes up for it . Overall the best Star Wars film since Jedi."
211,1,7 pages before I found a review giving more than 5 stars,If like me you have seen the other films or know anything vaguely star wars related.... you will hate this abomination of a film.
212,,Utter Garbage.,"The single piece of laziest story telling i have ever seen in my life..If this is the new standard for Hollywood, then it's utterly disgusting..The story was pitifully bad...The characters were pointless and shallow..It was a dumb mary sue propaganda video with a few special effects thrown in..Disney and Abrams should be ashamed of themselves...This was a really bad ''any kind'' of movie. Let alone a good star wars movie...I bet the ones that hated on the prequels want to beg Lucas to direct the future movies now...DO NOT SEE THE NEXT MOVIE AT THE CINEMA OR Hollywood WON'T GET THE MESSAGE...ALSO..DO NOT BELIEVE TRAILERS..THEY JUST MAKE YOU THINK THE MOVIE WILL BE GOOD..IT'S CALLED HYPE, AND THE WORLD GOT CONNED BIG TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE."
213,10,We let the force in... and it was goood.,"My intention is always to keep my reviews spoiler-free, and this will be no exception."
214,10,Great addition to the saga,"This movie is excellent. It takes 30 years after the Return of the Jedi and people are searching for Luke Skywalker as he had disappeared many years ago. The filmmaking is incredible and the shots are very well done. There are some very interesting and unpredictable twists in the movie.The actors did a great job. You actually felt like these characters were alive and living through these situations. There was even great humor. Now, many people were annoyed with the end. But, I think that the end is great as this will tie directly to the next movie! Perhaps, the only problem I had with this movie is that certain characters like Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) and R2- D2 weren't in this movie enough. Other than that, it's perfect."
215,10,'Best since Original Trilogy the film is',First of all let me say one thing. Just one. No matter how good any Star Wars sequel film including this is one no other Star Wars film will ever be as famous or full of pop culture as the original. Even the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi will not be as famous as the original. Because if it were not for the 1977 version we would not have Star Wars as it is today.
216,10,A fun callback to the original trilogy.,"A fun romp that holds true to the wit, adventure, and visual spectacle of the original trilogy. The sights, sounds, and feel hearkens back to when this franchise knew what it was doing. I look forward to many more viewings and the follow-on films to come."
217,7,The Force isn't that strong with this one,"There has been a lot of hype going into this film. And I will admit the fact that it carries on the ""Star Wars"" name and because of the nostalgia factor, I will give this film a slight advantage when it comes to my grading scale. However I can't just jump on the bandwagon and claim this movie was awesome or anything like that. And I am a reviewer that tries my best not to be picky about the small stuff. It just did not meet the super hype it has been getting. As a matter of fact this installment was a bit disappointing. Nowhere near as disappointing as ""The Phantom Menace"" and it's at least better than Episodes 1 through 3. However the original classic trilogy is still better than this one. The cast was good with a lot of new faces and few old. Harrison Ford takes on the role of Han Solo, but he is a bit of a different Han Solo. In this he is more of the wise father figure like guide, which actually works when it comes to the context of this film. But the actress Daisy Ridley as Rey. She just nailed as this character who is innocent but not really naïve, feminine but able to handle herself and emotional at times but very competent. She is almost a bit too cool in this installment. It was kinda cool to see Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson in the same film, the last film they were in together was ""Ex Machina"" which is a great film worth checking out. The most interesting character was in my opinion Kylo Ren, although his motives aren't entirely clear the emotional scars and the demented aspect of this character stood out to me. I also found it interesting how when he wears the mask that alters his voice, he comes off as this menacing and intimidating villain. But when it takes the mask off and shows his very human like face, he comes off as this whiny kid who is sort of emo. But he tries to emulate or maybe become just like Darth Vader. The chemistry between the characters was good, but I just felt there should have been more of a development. I guess they were saving that for the sequels. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a entertaining enough film, but it still felt empty and not very satisfying. If it was satisfying but made the audiences want more, it would be another thing but that just isn't the case with this one. It spends too much of it's time trying to build up for the sequels instead of it being a fine stand alone movie itself while leaving room for the sequels. There is a lot of things that are not explained in this one. Lastly it also lacked the emotional grip that it needed, because one of the most important scene in this film just wasn't really impactful because of how the whole thing was structured and how it got to that point. I guess I had a bit too high of a expectation from J. J. Abrams but this movie was pretty mediocre. Hopefully Episode 8 will be better since they went through the build up stage."
218,10,Lived up to the hype,This is the first movie i have ever gone to see back to back and I must say it lived up to the hype.
219,6,The biggest problem with this movie is that it had Star Wars in the title,"The expectations for this movie, fair or not, were going to be impossible to meet. "
220,10,Top Two In Star Wars Movies,I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by a complete landslide. There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original.
221,6,"JJ Abrams needs awakening, not the force","Only JJ Abrams can make a light saber fight scene look sh**. With the tech available now days, you can do amazing fight scenes. I loved the light saber- the close up vibrations, the intense subtle flaring around edges, and the noise accompanying it were good. But look who is holding it. A little-thin man, Kylo Ren, for whom the light saber is too big. And what does he use his light saber mostly for? Destroying ship controls. His voice is impressive ,though."
222,5,I can't believe this has 8.5 in IMDb.,"So, to start, I'm not a big Star Wars movies fan. I like the Star Wars universe and like Star Wars: KOTOR games. I've watched all movies though."
223,,Belongs on Disney XD after Power Rangers,THE FIRST MOVIE THAT I DEMANDED MY MONEY BACK--AND I GOT IT!
224,10,A cinematic piece of art that gets underrated by a fan-base that's never satisfied,"It's truly sad to see a minority of social rejects hating on this wonderful piece of cinematic art, because it almost had me (who's also an old-school Star Wars fan) in tears."
225,9,A lot better than the prequels,"Before you start to read this review, realize, that I have in fact seen the movie, and that I am going to talk about the spoilers: You have been warned! "
226,10,Does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong,"Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens is the long-awaited seventh installment in the Star Wars film series and the beginning of the brand new Sequel Trilogy. Without giving away too much, I'll say that it is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong."
227,10,"Star Wars returns, for the first real time since the 80's","Ignore all the troll-worthy complaints on here. They are from people that have idolized Star Wars so long that the original trilogy have become a 20/10 movies, so when they get a 10/10 they trash on it. Ignore all the people that call it a ""Remake"" of episode 4, it's no more a remake than Episode 6 was."
228,6,Star Wars: The Homage Cliché Edition,Is it fun - yes. Yes it is. It's a Star Wars film. Light sabers and TIE Fighters oh my! There will always be something fun in the fantasy of this universe. 
229,10,Star Wars The Force Awakens is 100% Perfection,"In 2012 after hearing about Disney bought Lucasfilm I was among all other fans that were skeptical and scared of the future of the Star Wars franchise. When the teaser 2 trailer was released in June 2015 and after watching the trailer I was so hyped for this film. So after watching the film, Does Star Wars The Force Awakens delivers?"
230,6,Its James Bond in the Sky,"I'm not one for hype, but having seen all the originals as a kid I thought why not. I didn't bother with the last 2, although I may have switched off the minute that Binx robot thing appeared."
231,10,Saving Star Wars from George Lucas,"J.J. Abrams managed to deliver what fans have craved for the last three decades: a Star Wars film that is actually good. The film manages to capture the spirit of the original trilogy, and presents it with skilled acting, plausible dialogue, and ass-kicking, multi-layered characters (for the first time ever). "
232,6,Should have been left asleep for Arndt to finish the sricpt,Hypocritical marketing and lazy writing took the magic from Star Wars.
233,4,Boring and Predictable,"I jut got just back from the cinema, watching a movie everyone has been waiting for since 1983, me included. And i got to say, I'm starting to get a little bit tired of watching a 2 hour movie about destroying a death star."
234,,This movie garbage,"Well, where do I start. "
235,10,Can't please anyone,"when the prequels came out, all of you harsh critics HATED them because of the story lines and the horrible and overused CGI (which I hated as well). It was missing the nostalgia and gritty production that made the originals so great. JJ was HAND PICKED by Lucas, after Lucas himself gave Disney rough outlines of how the 3 movies should go based on the Star Wars universe. After that, he was hands off. Now, you people hating JJ and wanting Lucas back, are the same people who complained about the prequels and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was Lucas. Obviously there is no pleasing you. ""BOOOOO the prequels aren't like the originals"" and now ""BOOOO VII is too much like the originals"". Absolutely ridiculous. I will admit, there is no beating the originals. They were ORIGINAL. Nothing like them had come out yet. They were adventurous and feel good and exciting. I want to go out and fight the Republic after watching them. But it's 40 years later. They had to please the people who were upset with the prequels, and had to find a way to bridge the gap between that generation and this. "
236,9,"Smart movie production wise, fandom officially becomes ignorant",Let me say that this is the first time I've ever written a review on IMDb even though I've on the site daily for the past 16 years.
237,10,A slightly more adult Star Wars that shows Lucas was right to let go of the series.,"I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed."
238,10,Absolutely Terrific!,"Normally I don't do such things as sharing my personal opinion on the particular films online, but this time I'm going to make an exception."
239,6,Good but lacks what the original(s) had in abundance...,"Which was originality along with a sense of realism, wonderment and awe."
240,10,The greatest Fanfic in Star Wars Universe),This is warm) This feels warm) Like a kid who suddenly got his dream come true - to create his own Star Wars Movie) Onle this kid is an accomplished professional J.J. Abrahms))
241,6,The Force is still Asleep,"Dear Star Wars fans, this comment is meant for you. Did you expect, as I did, the long waited rebirth of the greatest fantasy saga of all time? Then I assume you also felt a huge sense of disappointment. The unexpressed potential of this movie reaches frustratingly high levels : shallow jokes, clichés, bad visual effects... This really couldn't have been worse. We should all consider the opportunities given to directors nowadays : unlimited budget, amazing technological means and countless examples of awful science fiction to avoid. How many artists wish they had this miraculous set of tools back in the Seventies of the Eighties? However these gifts are still wrapped up and hidden, no one chose to see what's inside the packages, but, in my opinion, the omission wasn't caused by lack of curiosity or audacity. Somehow the public still demands a taste of tradition, even in science fiction, and the producers' only desire is to fulfill the expectations of the audience (even if, in order to achieve their goal, they managed to conceal a remake under the ""sequel"" label)."
242,10,"Ignore the vocal minority of jaded, clueless (friendless) nerds",As a 30 something who grew up on the original trilogy and like so many others was utterly disappointed by the prequels I went into viewing The Force Awakens with great anxiety and reservation. This movie delivered in so many ways. I am not going to write a detailed or even general review of the film as I truly feel one should go into viewing knowing as little as possible. 
243,6,The brand is strong with this one. 65%,"""Star Wars: The force awakens"" could easily be retitled ""Star Wars: The next generation"" because this long time coming sequel to the original trilogy introduces a new cast of characters, as well as some familiar ones. Providing a lot of fan service to those who've seen the original trilogy, those who see this new chapter in the franchise will find a lot of this fan service goes over their head if they haven't caught up with the original trilogy (a cynic might say that the movie is a rehash though). It seems pitched at a young audience at times ('cute' new robots etc.) but occasionally I'd say that the action is more suitable to young teenagers."
244,1,Soo glad I did NOT go see this in the theater,"So many other reviewers have stated all the terrible things wrong with this movie. You have to be brain dead to have found this stupid movie entertaining. From the beginning of this movie, I thought it was a spoof movie. I could not believe they actually thought this was supposed to be serious. Absolutely no character development. Absolutely no explanations about anything. The dialog is abysmal. The characters were boring. The bad guys were so boring. I did not care about any of the characters. All this movie is a cheap ridiculous poorly done rehash of the other Star Wars movies. Characters do things for unknown reasons. The bad guy throws temper tantrums. I understand the need for diversity in more movies WHEN IT MAKES SENSE! They act like there were no other movies before this, the storm troopers were clones from another race!! The movie was not full of plot holes, instead this movie is just one big black hole where common sense-character development-real action- good story ALL go into a black hole never to be seen again. Movie makers put out movies they think will sell, The fact that most of the movies made today suck, but still are made shows the people today are idiots."
245,,Some Intriguing new characters for the series otherwise disappointing,"*************Warning extreme plot spoilers do not read further if you have not yet seen the film.***************** We watched this last night. I thought it was okay, not great. It did not have the impact a few of the other films had on me. I do like the new characters that were introduced. It was also great to see some of our old friends from the original series back again."
246,10,Excellent Action Movie and Faithful to the originals,"Wow! I'm positively surprised by the new Star Wars movie! The story is perhaps a bit too much like episode IV, but then again that was my favorite episode and perhaps its not altogether wrong for stories like these to come in cycles."
247,10,Comfy like an old pair of slippers meets 21st Century awesomeness,"17 December 2015 Film of Choice at Just After Midnight at The Plaza Dorchester - Star Wars: The Force Awakens. With much shushing there was silence in the auditorium, a dark screen filled only with stars........then those two wondrous words written in yellow and the familiar blast of music......every single person clapped and cheered and we were immediately thrust into a comfortable familiar place which was presented in a whole new 21st Century way. As the credits were rolling at the end I overheard someone say ""there are no words to describe how good that film was!"" I totally agree but I will do my best. When I first heard Disney had assumed the mantle of this beloved franchise I must admit my heart sank, I'm of the generation who queued for the very first film in the very first week back in the seventies and I was dreading how this latest edition would turn out. As filming progressed and stories were being leaked I became more hopeful, and as of this evening I can only say what a completely marvellous job has been made of this film. Following the story was a mixture of emotions, we met new characters who slotted in easily with old favourites, and the appearance of each of said old favourites was like wearing your old slippers and a big floppy jumper it was so familiar. New technologies were apparent which appeared side by side with 21st century mannerisms and behaviour yet there were many references to the previous films in the form of phrases, looks, actions or merely set design and props. There was also much humour, at points the audience were laughing out loud. I watched this latest episode just after midnight and wondered if I would stay awake.......I never moved a muscle throughout and thoroughly approved of the huge round of applause that accompanied the closing credits. Only one character I must bring to your attention........the new droid BB8......I want to take him home! No spoilers here......YOU MUST WATCH IT and love it as much as I do."
248,8,"""It's another Death Star""","*Spoilers of the rest of the Trilogy also*<br /><br />This movie was released 5 1/2 years ago I was 11 and I up to that point I grew up thinking there was never going to be another Star Wars movie. So when Disney bought the franchise for a ridiculous amount of money I was excited. The overall ratings for this movie on the site are overall pretty good, but there is a huge flux of terrible unfair reviews that have spurred from the huge negativity toward all the Star Wars movies produced by Disney.<br /><br />This movie does not reach the levels of greatness that the OT does, and for some people it is never going to be enough. But not a rehash of A New Hope except of the giant space weapon that blows up (Which is not a positive).<br /><br />Personally, I really like this movie and since 2014 it has not lost its charm. Rey, Poe, Fin, and BB-8 are great new additions. Hux and Kylo are both menacing villains. Though ROS cheapened Snoke completely. He is still compelling and that it is still Palpatine pulling the strings fits into the plot even if I don't like that he is back. Specifically Snoke takes interest in Rey in the first interaction he mentions her.<br /><br />One thing looking back on the movie now I think it is terrible that Rey and Finn did not end up together. I my imagination they are together after the 9th movie.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is great as Han Solo and probably has the strongest return of the main 3 human characters in the OT. Him and Leia are torn apart by Ben's fall to the dark side, but when they are reunited their chemistry is great though in this movie somber. All they wanted to do was be a family again, but that does not happen. Han Solo's death was sad and socking in the theater and is still emotional and sad today. It is the first step of portraying the conflict in Kylo "" I know what I have to do and I don't know if I have the strength to do it"". Clearly he is leaning toward dark at this point and now with the trilogy completed the interaction with his memory of Han Solo is stronger.<br /><br />This is the not only the first chapter in the arc of Ben Solo, but for both Rey and Fin. Rey in this movie is a scavenger thrown into an adventure is awaiting her families return even though they are long gone. She sees in Han Solo the father she never had, and he is taken from him. Through the whole movie she discovers her new powers that in this movie she is very naive and amused by her own actions. Rey as a character has been over analysed and label a ""Mary Sue"". Which she is successful in everything she does. It is not for no reason, (She is strong with the force), but I think I is a valid complant people have. Though that is not her conflict in the movies it is not about her failure to succeed, but she does fail evermore as the trilogy progresses. Her real struggle is her identity, which is not super consistent throughout the trilogy (mostly with the opposing themes of nobody vs. Palpatine in 8 and 9), but I like the individual story each movie tells.<br /><br />Fin (FN-2187) sees the faults of the first order and runs, helping Poe in the process and builds a friendship with Poe that continues through all three movies. In this movie he is a runner, but is pulled into the conflict by his connection with Rey (I think it is eveident from the first movie that he is in love with her), maybe it is not mutual. I love Fin his relationship with Rey, is friendship with Poe, and even his brief interactions with BB-8.<br /><br />Poe I has been my favorite character in the trilogy from the first time I saw this movie, over the 3 movies he does not exhibit too much growth, but he is a ""trigger happy fly boy"" with a lot of talent. He is funny entertaining and he plays off all the characters even the weaker ones like Maz Kanata.<br /><br />The overall plot is weaker compared to the characters, but is fun. I do not think is is supposed to be real sophisticated it is more entertaining. This movie is well paced with action and has a entertaing lightsaber fight (the weakest of the trilogy) you can not go wrong with a lightsaber fight. And you can also not go wrong with a rebel victory.<br /><br />This movie is not faultless, there is things I don't like. I think most strong negative opinions are not based of the movie itself, but the impression the internet has left on people. I don't like Maz Kanata, I think she looks weird she is mysterious in a boring way, and is just not likable, but she has an awesome castle with the magic of a room full of aliens from around the galaxy. It is also a little contrived from A New Hope, but also I feel like this movie has so much love for the originals that it almost had to steal something. I would have preferred it was not a giant space ball with the power to destroy a star system that the rebels had to destroy before it destroyed their base.<br /><br />The movie has looks amazing the effects practical and digital do not disappoint as Star Wars has always been top of the line.<br /><br />In the Theater I was predictable, Poe was going to destroy Starkiller Base, I was not a long shot that Han Solo was going to die, and I even saw the lightsaber coming in the box (I think the worst scene in the movie, does not work and shows weird vague visions the served no purpose.<br /><br />Also the acting is good. Anyone who is picking that out as a problem is really fishing for complaints.<br /><br />It is not my favorite Star Wars movie, probably not even of the ST, it has a good characters, a good story, and is entertaining. This one does not knock it out of the park like the best of the Star Wars movie, but a good Star Wars movie is a pretty great movie. This movie is has nothing major I don't like about it, but since Star Wars is great it is mediocre for Star Wars. (Which is not bad, just with holds it from the top)."
249,8,Watch with an open mind.,"Straight off I will say I was entertained and they did a good job of introducing flawed new characters and incorporating old ones and explained most of the relationship between the two although they relied on the Star Wars thing of not explaining everything Verbatim, which I like, this adds to the mystery but lets be honest the 'hidden' history probably only exists in outline somewhere yet to be developed."
250,6,"Action, Adventure, Violence, Nostaligic Science Fiction story.","I'm not going to give a synopsis but a review of what I saw. This movie is a continuation of the others but in the future where Han Solo and Princess Leia are now seniors. The focus of the movie is finding Luke Skywalker. I did find in a couple of places I was teary-eyed but some of it was totally corny. There was too much violence in the film for children but they are being taken to see it. I like the two new additions of the young female and the Storm trooper gone rogue. Both were great in their parts but I hated Adam Driver and felt he was totally miscast for his part. He gave me the creeps and he didn't fit who he was supposed to be by looks alone. Obviously his uniform made him look extremely tall since he is only an actual inch taller than Harrison Ford. The movie was entertaining and nostalgic but that is the best I can say for it. Most are looking forward to the next movie to see where it is being taken. I hope Driver's part is considered dead because I don't like that character and wouldn't want to see it again in the next movie. People wanted to see a new Star Wars movie, so it's been highly over-rated. The fact that it is rated higher than Martian says it all. It's being rated by the fact it's a Star Wars movie and not its real quality. It was entertaining and a good movie but not as good as the ratings here are showing. It did it's job to reopen the series of movies, but to rate it so high because it is connected to the old series of movies now is not using good judgment and realizing it is a nice movie but not academy award material other than maybe special effects. It had a lot of that taking away from the fact there wasn't much of a story line."
251,10,Epic!,"My childhood was filled with the original trio of Star Wars movies, numbers IV/V/VI in the series, and they blew me away. A New Hope (IV) remains one of my all-time favourite movies. As a result, I found the prequels a complete letdown, as did many others. So I approached The Force Awakens (VII) with some reservations."
252,6,An Essential Hollywood Perversion,"An inflation of fan hysteria, it is the epitome of Hollywood's contemporary 'art' and the, subjectively(somehow it's important to emphasize this word in the dark ages of today), worst Star Wars movie yet. When real art is accused of having no story, read 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD', you proceed to repeat eternally in your mind that people are idiots -- a fact that needs perpetual proof from time to time."
253,10,A Great Star Wars Movie!,"Firstly it's obvious most people rating this film 1-2 stars are simply just saying ""tHiS iS a ReBoOt gO wAtCh tHe OrIgiNaL hurrr durrr"". It's simply blind hatred and it's clear most haven't seen THIS movie! Don't listen to the blind hate reviews!! They all have nostalgia goggles on from the original Star Wars movies! It's such a shame cuz I imagine it's angry 50 year olds just hate bombing the reviews cuz they have nothing better to do with their day lmfao."
254,6,In a word: Overrated,"If I had to describe Star Wars: The Force Awakens in a single word, it would be overrated. Or, perhaps, plagiarism. Or maybe nostalgia. All three apply pretty well."
255,4,Mediocre Hollywood block-buster garbage,"Saw the new Star Wars Movie OMFG it was bad bad BAD, much worse than the prequels. Where to start? The two main protagonists were morons (talking in idiotic Hollywood cliché's like, ""I can do this"") with no charisma and I didn't care about them one way or another. The movie picked up (slightly) when Han Solo magically pitched up. On that topic, I really missed Ewan MgGreggor, who, along with Palpatine and the wacky aliens, made the prequels fun, I must confess I enjoyed the prequels, for all their faults. But this movie: AVOID AVOID AVOID. --- SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The villain was the son of Solo, a foppish fellow in a black suit, a Darth Vader Lite. He was about as menacing as a pooch. So, the Star Wars stars were rubbish, lets take a look at the plot. This was the original recycled (rebooted?), basically, only without the charm. And then we're supposed to believe that a lowly scrap scavenger lass can supernaturally pilot a massive spaceship evading zippy tie fighters. WTF? And then she can rip some electronics from the cockpit and thereby magically fix the craft when it breaks down? No wonder Solo scoffed. Then she turned into a full blown Jedi, able to fend off Darth Vader Lite with a light sabre and use Jedi Mind tricks on a conveniently lonesome guard. The plot also relentlessly relied on coincidences, with characters turning up exactly on cue in specific locations on specific planets across a galaxy. Most of all, The Force Awakens did not feel like a Star Wars movie, the prequels were much closer in this regard. this movie felt exactly like a generic Hollywood director making a ""reboot"" of the first star-wars movie. There was only one single point in the movie where I felt any sense of surprise or emotion or suspense. There is seldom art in Hollywood movies any more. Don't bother going to see this drivel."
256,,"An absolutely marvelous, thrilling film","Perhaps the most anticipated film of the decade, this is an absolutely marvelous, thrilling film. While I do like the prequels, this film does a considerably better job of recapturing the tone and atmosphere of the original trilogy. It has a great spirit of adventure, a compelling emotional core and it does a very good job of further fleshing out the ""Star Wars"" universe. The characters, both old and new, are very well treated. The film has a very strong script by J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt and Abram's direction was excellent. He is certainly much more suited to ""Star Wars"" than ""Star Trek"". It hits all of the right notes. It is my third favourite film in the franchise, after ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""A New Hope""."
257,8,A good start to a disappointing trilogy,"It's been 3 years since the sequel trilogy ended. Now that we have the whole story, I thought it would be interesting to revisit the movies. Despite how The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker turned out, I still believe The Force Awakens is a good movie."
258,10,My Mixed Feelings About This (Not Any More),"I know I'm going to get a lot of haters breathing hellfire down the back of my neck for this, but here it goes. I went into the cinema to see The Force Awakens with, not a highly anticipated approach, but a modest one with low to medium expectations. Despite that, I ended up conflicted in how I feel about it. Allow me to start with the things I've found good with the movie. The beginning was fantastic, from the visual of a Star Destroyer overshadowing a planet to the First Order's brutal attack on a village and to the introductions of the new 'Darth Vader' Kylo Ren and our two main heroes Rey and Finn and their funny little droid companion BB-8. And as for others, the return of Han and Chewie as main characters rather than secondary ones was a welcome plus; Supreme Leader Snoke gives off a sense of menace that is good to feel satisfied with but not as much as the 'it's great to be bad' you can get from original head villain Emperor Palpatine; and then of course there's the interesting, mysterious and climactic backstories of Kylo Ren and Rey, which I will not spoil for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, but I can say that they are very engaging and will pretty much determine their futures in the later instalments. There are also many laughs to be had, especially with the scenes featuring any of our five main heroes, as well as scenes of tension, horror and of tear-jerking sadness."
259,8,Great!,"I'm not objective on this. I know. I don't care. I love Star Wars. This has all the Star Wars feeling from beginning to end. The plot works. The characters are well defined, are different from each other and feel authentic. The way we're introduce to each of the old classics is exemplary. I love it."
260,10,Reviewed through the eyes of a fan,"I'm a real Star Wars fan; seen all of the films a lot of times over a period of 35 years (there's not much I don't know), so for me, Star Wars, The Force Awakens, is viewed through the eyes of a fan and not just a film-goer. If I was reviewing the film as a standalone, I'd probably give it a score of 8 - fast paced, easy to follow, great effects, sound, decent enough story from start to finish and the actors all carried off their roles."
261,6,Very disappointed,I recently bought this movie. I did not go see it on the big screen as I just did not want to fight the crowds and boy would I have been upset after I saw it. Yes special effects were pretty good. That said I feel a lot of the movie was like the very first Star Wars the café club scene for one the bigger death star just a lot of similarities. The acting was pretty bad the guy they picked to play Kaylo was not very sinister looking and his voice was all wrong for this part. I did like the some of the characters BB-8 kinda grew on me as I felt sure from all I read about I might not like care for him. If your a true die-hard fan of the first Star Wars movies you will see what I mean. Go see it for the effects if nothing else.
262,8,Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a good continuation of the series as it left off from 30 years ago,"As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
263,7,Not the joy I was looking for.,I have a bad feeling about this. That's what I was thinking as I entered the cinema to watch The Force Awakens. 
264,10,JJ Abrams delivers on high expectations with a true Star Wars movie!,"Star Wars is back, as JJ Abrams achieves a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. "
265,6,Most overrated movie I've seen,"While this movie isn't bad per se, it's about as surface-level as a film can get. It's a cash grab. I hadn't heard a thing about the movie before watching it, so I went into the experience without any bias whatsoever."
266,4,Wow. Did they really do this? Spoilers,"You know... I guess I should be used to being out of the target demographic, but this movie was just plain rude to anyone who was a fan of the original. I'll get to that at the bottom so as not to put a huge spoiler in plain view. If you've never seen a Star Wars movie, or think the original is quaint and dated... Read another review."
267,,Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood.,"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy."
268,9,Best film of the Star Wars saga,"I know the fans of the original trilogy may find this as blasphemy, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers. This films plot is somewhat reminiscent of A New Hope, but still the themes here are different. The plot here opens many doors for the sequels, and I cannot wait to see what the next films will do with these characters. J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. Oscars are going to lineup for this film. Its that good. Expect nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Visual effects and sound categories, but I am still being modest here. This film deserves every award it gets. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good."
269,9,I just don't get the hatred???,I just rewatched Episode 7 and maintain my opinion that I really like it. I looked through the IMDb reviews of this film and cannot believe the hatred for this film. It seems that some people just hate for hatred sake. The biggest complaint that I see is that it is a rehash of Episode 4. I have to agree that it is very similar to it but after the absolute hatred that was unfairly bestowed on the prequel trilogy I knew that this would be a big budget fan film. Which it is. I am not bothered by that. George Lucas was criticized to the point of ridiculousness about how Episode 1 thru 3 weren't like the previous trilogy that there was no other way to.go. Does episode 7 break new ground? No. Does it harken back tl.the reason i.love Star Wars? Yes. That was enough for me.
270,10,The Force Awakens is an awesome flick.,I saw some of these moronic reviews on IMDb for this movie from 'so called' critics and I laughed out loud at their reasons why they hated it. But these reviewers are just amateurs who try to bash a great movie. 
271,10,Twizard Rating: 100,"The good news is you don't really need to watch the original Star Wars films in order to follow along with this film. But then honestly, why wouldn't you have seen the original Star Wars films? Star Wars is really an amazing franchise, starting in 1977 with the very first film. Can you imagine watching that in its inception? All these years later, you're still in awe of the characters, the story, the effects, the set pieces--the whole universe. The sets don't even look that different in this one than the ones from the '70s. Yet, we're still in awe."
272,7,Abrams destroys star wars,"So disappointed. Can only assume that the previous ratings are based on brain washed fans so happy to hear the anthem and see the yellow writing scroll up the screen that they didn't bother to watch what followed. The aforementioned opening was by far the highlight. 30 mins in and I had to nudge myself to stay awake. 60 mins in I would have walked out in disgust if I didn't think I would offend my wife and daughter who had decided to accompany me on my quest to re-capture my youth. The lack of a story was unbelievable. The main villain is a fluffy bunny next to Vader, Maul or Sidious. What rocket scientist decided that Stormtroopers were no longer clones. I'd be easily convinced that Abrams hadn't even watched the original movies, if it wasn't for the shameful way that every scene from Episode IV had been woefully reproduced. Predictable and not an original scene in the movie. I know you have to watch it, but do yourself a favour and wait till it hits TV."
273,10,The Force is back!,"I have been a Star Wars fan from the very beginning and while I was happy that the Walt Disney Company would make another trilogy of films I was somewhat reserved because while I thought the prequels (Episodes 1, 2, 3,)were good I felt they could have been better, but JJ Abrams take on the Star Wars mythology reminded me how much I loved the original trinity. The Force awakens takes place 32 years after Return of the Jedi, During that time Luke Skywalker attempts to restore the Jedi order by training padawans the way of the force. But one of his students has turned to the dark side and takes the name of Kylo Ren. Luke Skywalker then disappears and the majority of the movie is spent trying to find him by Ren and the first order (an offshoot of the Galactic Empire that was defeated in episode 6). The movie is action packed but it also has a great storyline unlike the prequels. Old favorites return such as Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C3PO,and R2D2, but the movie introduces us to 3 new characters that in a way are being passed the torch by the original cast. Rey, a female scavenger played by the enchanting Daisy Ridley, Poe, an experienced X-Wing pilot played by Oscar Isaac, and Finn, a rebel stormtrooper played by John Boyega. While the main villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is impressive, he doesn't come close to matching Vader, but Vader does play a key role in Kylo's mission. The Force awakens is a breath of fresh air in the Star Wars universe and I cant wait for episode 8 in 2017! May the force be with you!"
274,6,The Force is not so strong in this one,First off I really wanted to like this movie. After the prequel disasters I thought finally we are in line for some redemption.Unfortunately this wasn't the case.
275,10,Great addition to the star wars family,"We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm. "
276,6,The Force Awakens Should You?,"I like Star Wars. I have seen them all and enjoyed them when they came out. Yes to the flaws, inconsistencies, less than stellar performances and story-lines. Those things didn't stop me from having a good time. They still don't. Now, that being all said, let me let you in on a little secret that has been used on you and you don't know it yet THE JEDI MIND TRICK at work. You will go see Star Wars. You will love it. You will tell all your friends. You will relive your childhood or late blooming. You will return to the days of yesteryear. You will get your monies worth. You will & you will and you will. Whew...Come out from under the Jedi Mind Trick for just one moment please...."
277,3,But why did you do it....? this is unacceptable,"Good heaven's i don't know where to start. I've been watching star wars since i was four years old. I was a fan of it and then i grew out of it but the fonder memories never left me. I always loved the previous six films and kept recommending it to my non movie watching wife and my little daughter. They were so amazing, ""Empire strikes back"" name just makes me run back to my TV to see whats it all about."
278,,"Seriously people , this movie an 8.4 ?","People are looking at this pile of crap with rose colored glasses , nostalgia is a powerful thing it seems, This movie might appeal to sub 12 year crowd but I cant see a lucid adult sitting through it (unless they came with their kids ) "
279,8,The Force Awakens - A Nostalgic Trip Down Memory Lane!,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an epic adventure that takes us back to a galaxy far, far away! The film has a perfect balance of nostalgia, humor, and action, making it an entertaining watch for both die-hard fans and casual moviegoers alike."
280,10,"Fantastic movie, excellent on nearly all fronts.","Let's get one thing straight: the plot is derivative. There are tons of parallels to Star Wars: A New Hope, and pretty much the same events are going on."
281,8,The Force Awakens is a reboot of A New Hope,"The Force Awakens is the best of the sequel trilogy, in my opinion. This doesn't take away from the fact that this movie is essentially A New Hope reboot..."
282,10,Bravo J.J Abrams. A spectacular experience,"Wow, just wow. I went to this movie with highish expectations, the internet was abuzz about how this movie was going to be good. And I am pleased that this was one of the few times the buzz is justified, because this movie was a spectacular experience."
283,7,Star Wars have awakened,"1977 people saw for the first time the big title of Star Wars on the big screen, and after Star Wars: The Revenge of The Sith came out 2005 the world known franchise went disappearing. I saw The Force Awakened 2015 on its premiere night and it was clear that people had been waiting long for Star Wars to return to the big screen, and there is no doubt that J.J Abrams must have felt much pressure taking this franchise back to the big screen as it is certainly one of the most loved and respected movie franchises in the world. "
284,9,Star Wars is back with a vengeance!,"Set many years after Return of the Jedi this continues the story, introducing us to new characters as well as bringing back some of the old."
285,6,"The Force Awakens, A.K.A. The Easiest Paycheque Mark Hamill Ever Earned In His Life.","Let's make no mistake: this is a cynical film, one that feels like they found an algorithm that makes action films and just let it run. I'd like to know, for example, just how many iterations the BB8 design went through before the focus group decided that it was sufficiently mathematically adorable. There's no reason why X-wings and TIE fighters need to appear at all - given the diversity of ships in the canon, and how technology marches on and all that - but it's important to this film to trade on recognisable cultural properties. This can't afford to be the start of another prequel-esque trilogy, which lost 40% of its audience after The Phantom Menace, so X-wings it is. This is cynicism that extends to continuing to use Stormtroopers as disposable people to be mown down in their hundreds, while at the same time offering them the potential of agency and independence as expressed by Finn; the clearly-delineated heroes and villains worked fine in the fairy-tale logic of the original trilogy, but become more problematic given the attempted additional characterisation of the new film."
286,10,The Force Awakens is a definitive return to the epic Star Wars saga. Fans will be pleased.,"Here's my review of the latest installment in the STAR WARS saga, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens or Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
287,6,A huge commercial success but a disappointment to hardcore star wars fans,When I watched this movie it looked good to me; better than most fiction movies I watched in 2005. I think it's 8.3 IMDb rating is justified but I didn't get why this movie has got so many bad reviews. I think I have never seen any movie which got so many bad reviews on IMDb and still enjoys 8.3 overall rating. This prompted me to watch the earlier star war episodes and I got my answer.
288,3,Why I hated 'The Force Awakens.' ( mega-spoilers ahead ),"If J.J. Abrams had stopped making sequels for 5 minutes, he might have read about how it was George Lucas's adherence to classical story-telling that helped make Episode IV so great. But then Abrams would have had to have accepted that story counts in movies. And having seen 'Cloverfield,' I have my doubts."
289,,Jar Jar Abrams Never Watched Star Wars Before,Or he would know that the rebels won in Episode VI!
290,10,Tired of these fanboy hipsters,I have read through some of these comments and WHAT A JOKE! The lot of you. 
291,9,The Kids Are Alright; but Han & Chewie are the golden touch to what's old is new again!,"STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS (2015) *** 1/2 Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domnhall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Max von Sydow, Peter Mayhew, Gwendoline Christie, Simon Pegg, Greg Grunberg, Warwick Davis, Ken Leung (uncredited: Alec Guinness, Ewan McGregor, Daniel Craig) Every thing is old that's new again in this breath of fresh air to the sci-fi franchise unleashing a new chapter with echoes of its lineage - to wit: The Force is in full swing both light (newcomers Driver, Ridley & Boyega as a rebel force about to be reckoned with) and dark (Driver as Vader, Jr.-wannabe) and enlisting some welcome familiar old friends (trifecta of Ford, Fisher and Hamill) to continue the battle of good over evil. Director JJ Abrams (who co-scripted with veteran Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt) wisely incorporates touchstones of the past while impressing a new wrinkle into the forged chain of iconic moments : (the return of The Millennium Falcon and a fantastic blend of practical effects with gee-whiz enthusiasms of state-of-the-art CGI) Ford lends a surprising amount of ballast and gravitas and sprinkles of curdled snarky humor (much needed) with Chewie also having his moments in the sun. Fun, fast and can't wait for the open for a new sequel down the pike."
292,10,The best Star Wars movie ever!!!!,"At long last we have been given a Star Wars movie that takes full advantage of what the universe has to offer. JJ Abrams has shown that he can handle a movie of this kind and balance all the elements that makes up the movie. I was, more or less, at the edge of my seat from start to finish, since I didn't want to miss the story when it really kicked off. And the movie kept me in suspense in a brilliant way, so that I never had a moments rest, and thus was fully entertained from start to finish. "
293,10,The best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back',"There has been an awakening and it is awesome! No offense to those Ewoks, but STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is the best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back.' This film is exciting, it's fun, but it's also heart-wrenching and deeply affecting. Clearly the result of a work done with care."
294,6,A New Hope 2,"I came in with high expectations, some good reviews. But three quarters of the way through the movie, it was the exact same story as 'A New Hope', with a few juxtaposed characters and a slightly different ending."
295,10,"Exciting, Entertaining, and Engaging. 10/10","This movie was by far the best movie of 2015. Go in with normal expectations and you will come out deeply content. Loved every bit of it. The movie has all the big bangs, flight sequences and special effects that you come to expect from a great Star Wars movie. "
296,7,The Force Awakens captures the Spirit and Magic of Star Wars,"In a galaxy far, far away Star Wars. It's about time we should see that opening to a film. 10 years since the last Star Wars Film, J.J Abrams takes the time to get it right. And he does it perfectly. I won't say anything about the plot, because I'm sure you want to find what it is yourself. But I will tell you of a New, Epic Adventure. "
297,10,"All of the best parts of the previous installments, with none of the cheese!",'STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS': Five Stars (Out of Five)
298,6,Why all the hate?,"I really liked this movie! Yes it's plot is similar to ""A New Hope"", but the execution is different enough to make it feel fresh. I've seen it twice. In Theaters in 2015 and today. I wanna quickly mention, that the cinematography by Dan Mindel is extremely underrated! It should at least have gotten an Oscar nomination. The score by John Williams is great as always, though not many original cues. ""Rey's Theme"" and ""March of the Resistance"" are however exceptions. Overall a really great experience, great characters, dialogue and a flowing pace delivered by J. J. Abrams. A 4/5 stars from me."
299,3,A brief rundown of the plot,"PLOT: While looking for Luke Skywalker an asthmatic stormtrooper defects in search of a cute girlfriend. Pursued by Bane, the girl steals the Millennial Falcon and together the millennial crew fly across the galaxy in search of 'green'. Without a navigation app they end up going in circles and land in various parts of England before she is captured by Bane and taken to a Death Star so big you will forget the other ones even existed. Then a Cylon stormtrooper also decides to defect and shuts down the base's shields to help them. But not before the base drains the sun of its power ends up blowing up their own galaxy because it has no sun anymore. In the end R2-D2 wakes up and it turns out it was all a dream as they discover Luke was hiding on an island just off the coast of England all along. J.J. Abrams directs."
300,,BY FAR the greatest Star Wars movie ever made!,This is so easily the overall best movie in the Star Wars franchise it's not even remotely up for debate (with The Last Jedi an incredibly close second!) 
301,8,It's 1977 Again!,I wasn't even a twinkle in my mother's eye when the original Star Wars film came out in May 1977. 
302,9,Facepalming so hard and being ashamed for the movie fandom,It's just sad. People come back to the force awakens and give it a worse review because they didn't like Last Jedi or Rise of Skywalker and thus have to hate on the entire trilogy. Sad. Sad. Sad.
303,9,Make Sure You See It A Second Time...Trust Me,"Seeing a new Star Wars movie is a big deal. It should be filled with great special effects, a compelling story, and intriguing characters. ""The Force Awakens"" hits all of those marks, providing a very entertaining viewing experience. However, as Old Biff might say in Back To The Future 2: ""There's something very familiar about all of this""."
304,8,The Next Gen Star Wars We Need,"I was seven when I first watched Star Wars (1977). Like many nineties kids' I watched the beloved first trilogy on VHS, in the days before George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic had its way with the ""Deluxe DVD"" modified version. The space saga of Luke an Leia was never bestowed upon me by my parents with fond memories of the premiere. My mother, though fond of musicals, was not much for sci-fi or action movies; my father even less so. It was my older brothers who first sat me down to gaze upon its glory and since those days, every space adventure I have watched over the years lives or dies on the standard of the Star Wars."
305,7,Sounds Legit,"My take? Nostalgia overload! I also agree that the plot is strikingly similar to 'A New Hope', but I won't re-write all the comments that other's have made to compare. "
306,10,"An Incredible Movie, Far Beyond All Expectations","This movie was fantastic. The new characters we receive are fun and interesting, and we are left to see them fleshed out more as the series continues, which is exciting. The movie is very reminiscent of the Original Trilogy. We have a decent amount of aliens (almost all of which are seen using costumes as opposed to CGI). The plot moves along at a great pace. Nothing is really dragged out, but at the same time it is not so fast that you are left confused. And speaking of confusion, there was none in this movie. It was all very straightforward and everything was very easy to understand. This movie absolutely pays homage to the original from 1977 in many ways, but at the same time I feel that you do not need an in depth knowledge of the previous movies to love this one. A general knowledge of the plot and main characters is all that is needed going into this movie. I will have to see it again to make sure, but at the moment this movie is vying for my favorite Star Wars movie ever with The Empire Strikes Back. But don't take my word for this - go out and experience it for yourself. You will have a delightful time filled with comedy, excitement, action, epic plot reveals, and an overall enjoyable time!"
307,6,Michael Bay's Star Wars,"Star Wars TFA is not a bad movie it's just meh. My biggest gripe with this movie is the blatant hypocrisy among movie goers, because this movie has more in common with the recent Transformer movies than Star Wars. It's a long winded awkwardly paced cgi fest with misplaced humor. When people say this ""captures the magic"" I really don't know what they're smoking...we must have saw different movies. One of the other major problems with the movie is that all the characters felt the same (few exceptions) this is due to the overly comedic script where people are constantly quipping back and forth and have an observational joke for literally everything. These forced comedic elements really took me out of the film, just by sheer volume alone. However the film has redeeming qualities like Kylo Ren he's just about the only innovation in it, everything else was been there done that better."
308,9,Good Movie! Dumb Reviews!,"Okay, I'm coming straight off the bat and saying that this was a really entertaining movie - period. It's not perfect but it is definitely an excellent film with lots of great aspects. The acting, screenplay, directing were all well above average (especially when you consider how terrible the prequels were). It had a wonderful sense of fun and borrowed a bit from it's predecessors (I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing as the originals were awesome). I felt it was a worthy successor to the original Star Wars movies. I have literally waited a lifetime to see what would happen after episode six and I wasn't disappointed. That is a huge achievement in itself. And better yet it has helped rid me of the painful memories of Mr Lucas trying to ruin the originals by 'updating' them and of course, those God awful prequels. I felt this movie was strongest in the first and last thirds of the film with the middle being a tad clunky. That being said I am not complaining. Actually the only thing I will complain about is some of the reviews I read on IMDb this morning. What kind of an idiot could sit through this movie and then only give it one star! I believe everyone has the right to an opinion but seriously, some reviewers here are completely off the mark. If a movie has a bad script or painful acting (like the prequels or The Room) by all means crucify it in your review. But if a movie has a good level of humour, interesting characters, a good tempo, a plot, solid acting, a little bit of intrigue, then don't review it poorly just because you can. I would go so far as to say that anyone who has given a review with below five stars for this movie has no idea what constitutes a good movie and should be ignored. My little rant over, I'll just say this movie was a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe (or multiverse now that the books don't count). I left the movie last night feeling very emotional as one of my childhood dreams had finally come to fruition. I hope when you see it you feel like I did and that you don't get put off by people with no idea about how to review a film."
309,7,Deep frustration,"Episode IV was seen on an European beach movie theater in 1978, real stars in the sky, fake stars on the screen. It was unbelievable, purely magic. 1981 ""the Empire strikes back"" was released, new creations, especially ""Yoda"" and the new empire spaceships, planet Hoth, the city in the clouds etc... Episode VI was a panting expectation. Released in 1983, many critics saw it as weak. Still, new creations like the Ewoks or the woods vehicles were to see. The saga was almost finished. The galaxy was at peace."
310,5,Was fun but terrible script... !!!,"Seriously,,, can we stop already with the Father and Son scenarios !!!!!! Yes, it was fun to re-visit old friends from the 70's trilogy and I enjoyed a lot of what it had to offer.. But that silly overdone plot has worn out its welcome.."
311,,Like dragging a corpse around,Look in the real world what do you do when someone is dead? You bury the person or cremate them. You don't play cards with them or serve them dinner or take them to the friends' house.
312,8,Best star wars since Empire,"Seems that everyone either loves or hates this movie. While some people think it's the best star wars, others think it's the worst. I'm in the middle. It's a great film, but far from the best star wars. Better than the prequels, and I even thought it was better than ROTJ. So for me it's the 3rd best star wars film, but it's still a really well made film. It's acted and wrote well, which Rouge one is not. The series needed this refresh, which is why I am mostly okay with the rehashed story. Still, the characters are well written and acted, and the visual effects are stunning"
313,9,"CHEWIE, WE'RE HOME!!","The return of the Star Wars franchise which has been met with some resistance but was great fun to be back in this universe. The story is quite similar to ""A New Hope"" introducing new characters Finn (John Boyega) who was a storm trooper who defected to the resistance, Rey (Daisy Ridley) who had similar beginnings to Anakin and Luke living on a desolate planet and scrapping for survival, Po Dameron (Oscar Isaac) an elite X-Wing pilot with a trusty droid BB-8 and the new foe Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) the son of Han Solo and Leia turned to the darkside. The story isnt breaking any new ground but the mix of old characters and new made for a fun adventure and a nice starting point to go on from."
314,10,"What movie did all the naysayers actually see? Don't listen, it's incredible!","So, my daughter and I just came out of Star Wars. My short summary is it is a perfect mix of old and new, and an excellent movie, probably one of the top 10 movies I've seen in 5 years or more."
315,8,I enjoyed this entry into the Star Wars universe more than the prequels,"My review is pretty much going to be one of those that are going to be unhelpful for all, I'm afraid. I only write these things so that when I pass on from this mortal world, something of me will remain. With this film though, I did not utterly love it and give it a ten so those that did are going to hate my review while on the other hand I did like the film and did not give it a one, so those that hated it or really disliked it will hate my review. I literally read a review where a person gave this film a one, but there were things he enjoyed about the film. Um, if you give the film the lowest ranking that means there should not be anything in it you enjoyed. There are a whole lot of numbers between 1 and 10 to use! It matters not; the film was good to me as it was better than the prequels. Why? Well for one it had better humor. Another reason? It felt more real while the prequels I felt I was watching people in front of a green screen. I can keep going on, but yeah, this one is better than the prequels; however, that being said, it is not as good as any of the originals either. I was really enjoying the film up until the final act which felt kind of rushed. After a certain character takes a fall, the film just speeds along to its conclusion and I just felt more was needed."
316,6,Have I seen this movie before?,As a Star wars fan I have to say that I'm very disappointed with this film. They did a great job with recreating the universe but I was not to amused about them recreating the exact same story as well. 
317,10,"Get over it already, fanboys. The movie was massively entertaining and better than the originals.","I've watched the original Star Wars many times growing up, and I know the story inside out like anyone else. Classic films that many people like my self have been wanting back. I saw the movie today and walked away satisfied and eager for the next one. I read some of these highest rated reviews and it's literally awful how full of yourself and pessimistic some of you are. You're giving the movie a 1 star, for what? Most of you have a delusion of 30 years of fanboy pathetic bias that nothing released will live up to your laughable, impossible to please standards."
318,7,Certainly entertaining...but quite unoriginal!,"Saw the movie yesterday and found it to be entertaining, but at times quite annoyingly unoriginal!"
319,8,It definitely delivered,"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams. This film takes place over 20 years after The Return Of The Jedi. It was long awaited, but it definitely delivered. This film is everything you want a Star Wars film to be. It further deepens and gives purpose to the original characters, as well as introduces very likeable new additions. The action sequences are all incredible. This film really makes the most of modern CGI, but also does many things practically, which is essential for a Star Wars film. It is important that I speak about the new villain, Kylo Ren. This guy is awesome! He's such a deep and complex character. There is so much conflict within him, and when learning more about his back story, it makes you really view him as more than just an evil antagonist. The main criticism of the film surrounds the fact that it seems to follow and share similarities to the original trilogy, particularly A New Hope. I can see how perhaps they played it safe. But in my opinion all they did was improve on it and explore everything on a much deeper level. Star Wars: The Force Awakens contains such great writing and film making so therefore I give it a 9."
320,7,"good news, it's a Star Wars movie. bad news... not too much (but some)","So the good news to report first is that J.J. Abrams is someone who loves Star Wars enough that he more than respects the mythology, which itself is cobbled together from past mythological stories, both old (back to the Greeks with the Gods) and modern (serials and comics), but also recognizes that in this 'Episode' series as a saga a lot of it has to come back to family. The Force Awakens works tremendously when it focuses on the two (maybe three) new characters who are introduced in this series, and the familiar is both welcome and sometimes questionable, but mostly welcome all the same. It's a movie made for the fans, but it's not necessarily a ""fan-film"", if that makes sense. It's the logical progression of this franchise in 2015 and by a filmmaker like Abrams it's a commendable effort (if not great, read on for more, and of course SPOILERS be ahead)."
321,5,Epic let down to the first 6,I am a huge fan of star wars and therefor placed the expectation of the 7th on a very high pedestal. But that's probably why it was such a let down.
322,,"If you're a true fan of the franchise, just don't watch this","The best thing I could say about this movie, is that it has set itself up for a better sequel. I'm just going to go ahead and list my grievances, without giving anything away: -""Knowledge of the force"" was a very important factor in how good a Jedi was at fighting over the first six movies. There was years of training, infinite hurdles. That all goes out the window. Apparently, anyone can beat a Sith lord. -The premise of the main characters, their motives and backgrounds, was so much less believable (even as a fictitious storyline). -The fight scenes were less like the epic battles of Episodes I, II, and III, and more like the fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. -The villain was so boring. Abrams didn't pull any brain muscles thinking him up. -The story altogether was extremely weak -Finally but most importantly, this was less of a sequel and more of a remake of Episode IV. I won't tell you how, but you'll see it."
323,8,STAR WARS IS BACK!!!,"A perfect beginning. I remember when the trailer of this came out. I was so hyped. ""STAR WARS IS BACK!!"" I said, and I was right. This movie is what star wars is about. And I never quite understood the ""A New Hope Rehash"" comments. Sure I get it sometimes. But come on, this is Star Wars. Most of the times the basic concepts are the same. Villain, hero, wise master who guides hero, end fight with fighters. Also the death of one character didn't feel forced, it felt right for the character and i love it. It's amazing how almost all star wars movies are insanely good. Man, I love star wars....and that's the feeling you're supposed to get watching these films."
324,9,"Episode 7, the Star Wars sequel that could have been so, so much worse.","First off I'll admit it, I'm a Star Wars fanboy. Ever since I can remember I've had an association to the original trilogy. I can recite the words to episode 4 without prompting, and I consider ESB to be one of the best sequels of all time. This is no Empire, its not even a Return of the Jedi, without wanting to spoil too much, its almost episode 4.1, like a patched version for a modern audience. What stuck me was that the period between 6 and 7 had in no way been a fairy-tale for our original heroes. The frailties they showed in the younger years which were endearing, have haunted them and left them vulnerable. The new heroes are full of that naivety and wide eyed hope that attracted us to the gang 30 years back, and its great to see the sparkle in the eyes of the original cast when they get their spark back. The world has changed, yet no one seems to have it better - desert planets still provide little respite for the scavengers, Remains of the civil war litter the landscape, and the 1st order rule with an iron fist not seen with the Empire. As a visual feast its excellent. The Star Wars universe is there in all its glory - The 1st order is a clean, regimented, brutal regime. The resistance are rag-tag, grubby, barely surviving band of rebels after 30 years on the run. The modelling and effects are awesome, the lack of George Lucas style CGI noticeable after the rehashing of the special editions. And John Williams has managed to score another excellent soundtrack. Its in no way perfect, the recycling of story lines are even mocked by those involved (so its another death star???) but the formula works, its what's drawn us in since '77 , and it sets up the subsequent movies well. Did my legs shake with excitement? Yes. Did I giggle like a schoolgirl at times? Yes. Did I cry? Yes. Do I now want to be Poe Dameron? Hell yes. Will I see episode 8? Without a doubt."
325,10,I can feel the hate swelling in you now! A review for the fans.,The film is a masterpiece of escapism entertainment and so what if the template was borrowed in part from previous Star Wars movies (especially the original trilogy) – those movies worked!
326,10,Star Wars Awakens,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a long anticipated sequel and return to a galaxy far, far away. Return of the Jedi (1983) being the last installment, J.J Abrams takes the reigns as director and services the fans well with a generous dose of nostalgia. There are some cliché or corn-ball moments but there is plenty of new here to be mixed in with the old and it pays off greatly and only left me wanting more."
327,7,The Force Rehash,"Don't get me wrong. It's a fun movie. Great special effects, good action and likeable characters but it's also devoid of any originality to the point that it could be called a reboot. Also world building sucks and that Star Killer base was such a Deus ex machina. It was both taken straight from New Hope but also was a easy way for writers to erase all that happened between Return of The Jedi and Force Awakens.<br /><br />To sum it up I don't regret watching it but I have no desire to see it again."
328,10,Did every mom's basement troll see the same movie??? LOL,The amount of negative reviews that are out there are simply hilarious. 
329,6,The Force put me to sleep,"Director J.J. Abrams (""Lost,"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" ""Mission: Impossible III"") steps into the future (again) to bring the latest of the Star Wars trilogy to the big screen. Not seeing any of the prior movies, I was poised and ready for an exciting film experience. Unfortunately, I feel asleep twice due to boredom. Sure, the spaceships are cool, the futuristic characters are interesting, and traveling through the galaxy looks like fun, but I've seen this all done before in any number of other space travel films/TV series. With something new to look for out of the question, I turned my attention to just enjoying the film for what it was and getting to know the characters. Unfortunately, the dialogue was so basic, I found it hard to stay interested. I was, however, amused to see Harrison Fords' character filled with so much dry-humor, and I now finally understand the attraction of the light-saber. Maybe if some new film technology had been introduced, the overall film would have meant more to this first timer. But, since that didn't happen, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just bored me with its familiarity. One of the highlights of the film was to see Adam Driver (""GIRLS"") step into such an iconic role within the film. Driver continues to be an interesting actor, and it's great to see him successful jump genres here. May the force be with those who love this trilogy!"
330,10,"Yep. Disregard the laughably biased, contrarian ""reviews"". The Force is strong with this awesome movie!","This is a great movie. It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out people that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2/10 shouldn't be taken remotely seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right and putting a magnifying glass over a handful of beyond minor flaws."
331,6,Just an action-adventure rehash of Episodes IV and V,"This movie has space ships, robots, exotic planets, and aliens, but it is not up to the standard of sci-fi space opera that George Lucas set for the first 6 movies. Abrams gives a contemporary action-adventure overhaul to Lucas' universe similar to the way he bastardized Roddenberry's creation in the Star Trek movies."
332,1,It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone,So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7. 
333,,Lacking originality,"Most of the user reviews on IMDb are trashing the film for stealing the plot of the first. It's hard to argue that's not the case when the story line is practically identical. For that reason, the film has no originality. Unless of course, you consider inserting awkwardly unrealistic social advocacy elements into the film as being ""original""."
334,10,Star Wars The Force Awakens is the best star wars movie.,"The Force Awakens is the best of all the star wars movies by far . All the new actors in this movie made it even more enjoyable, especially Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. They were the breakout stars of the movie. Adam driver was a complex villain and thankfully will be in future episodes. Daisy Ridley did a brilliant job as the main hero of this movie and her performance was amazing. "
335,8,"'The Force Awakens' sticks to its roots, introduces great new characters","The Force has indeed awakened, ""Star Wars"" fans. Thanks to Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm we have been gifted a new movie and all the excitement and anxiousness that comes with it. And while it has only been 10 years since the last new ""Star Wars,"" it has been more than 30 years of wondering what happens to the beloved characters of the original trilogy after ""Return of the Jedi."" And so, it is at times a teary-eyed delight to see these old friends return to the big screen. "
336,8,The Force has Awakened,This is my review for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (spoiler free).
337,8,Wake up!!!,"The force truly has awakened! Any one who is even a casual fan of Star Wars will tell you that this movie is the very essence of what Star Wars stands for in all of its wondrous glory. The cast was very well selected, it's very clear that they selected the right people to populate the new generation of the universe, and that J.J. Abrams is, indeed, the man for the job. It really comes as no surprise that Abrams was able to do the series justice, but it was indeed refreshing to see to what extent. "
338,6,"Everything is Bigger, Bigger, Bigger and Feminist Awakens is Made for SJW's",Disney has taken Star Wars and PC-ed it to no shame.
339,10,Best Movie I have ever seen!,"Before going into this movie, I was a bit nervous. I did not want this film to be a bit of a disappointment like The Phantom Menace, not saying I hate that movie. After walking out of the IMAX theater, I was amazed. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is my favorite film I have ever seen, and I have seen many of the greats. The story takes place, 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The First Order, the new Galactic Empire, is looking for the map that leads to the missing Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, while the Resistance is trying to get it as well. First off, the casting is amazing, especially Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey. The story was great, and don't care about ""the plot being too alike to A New Hope"" because pretty much all of the Star Wars plots are like that. The characters were very well thought, especially Kylo Ren. The twist is amazing, not spoiling it. I have no negatives what so ever. Unfortunately, I can only give this film 10, and not higher. I loved it, so I saw it again in IMAX. I highly recommend this film."
340,6,I find your lack of originality disturbing,"This is my very first review on this site. I have to admit that I was really thrilled after I had watched this film on premiere. But, the next day, I realised that this film is not that perfect. This is the first SW ever i watched in the cinema. I enjoyed this film, and here are things I like and I dislike:"
341,9,Worst Star Wars movie in the sense that it is the most underdeveloped..,"This review is from my 2 viewings of TFA and is going to focus on the negatives. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of positives in this movie, it's just that the negatives are so over-powering, they completely over-power the positives. "
342,7,Lets just kill Han Solo like he never exist.,"The Dark force was actually the ""magic"" side of all Star Wars movies. There is no magic in this movie cause there is no Dark force at all. What? Adam from ""Girls""? Really ? Justin Bieber would be more scary and less hysteric. This movie is just about money and technology and more than that, ethic politics, picking the right ""colours"" to be heroes. There is no creativity at all anymore in the industry of movies. it's a shame. it was good to actually invite my friends and go to the movies cause that stop happening a long time a go for a lot of people. Well i understand that we all have to just accept the fact that we all have to move on with our lives but the way that they kill Han Solo to take him out of the next movie was simply low! he deserved better than that!"
343,3,Forced to Stay Awake,"Despite all the retreaded ideas, non-charismatic new characters, incredibly slow scenes, uninventive battles, one hilariously bad CGI individual and laziest of all Star Wars scores, Episode VII was at least a different movie than the rest."
344,,Rehash,"Great to see another Star Wars movie. Great to see Han, Luke, and Leia again. Great to see R-2 and C-3PO again, even though you can't recognize him with the red arm (lame joke), I find this movie to be the worst of the 7 films."
345,10,"Relax, weirdos. It's just a space fantasy movie.","10/10, if only to irk all the whining fanboys on here."
346,8,Abrams brings the wonder of The Force to a new generation.,"If you don't include the dreadful prequel trilogy from George Lucas, many Star Wars fans have spent over thirty years waiting for the next great addition to the sci-fi saga worshipped the world over. "
347,10,My personal favorite star wars movie,"Was it similar to A New Hope? A little, I guess... but I still absolutely loved this movie. The acting was great, and the editing and effects were both phenomenal. All of the new characters are very likable, and it was awesome to see Han Solo return. I will admit though, that Rey is a little too good at everything. That is fixed a little in The Last Jedi, but still. I still loved her character, though. Han Solo's death scene was handled very, very well. Even though I knew he was dead as soon as he stepped out there, I did start to believe for a second that Kylo Ren had changed. The action is awesome to watch and I loved every second of it. Overall, I really love this movie and the new movies in general. It may not be the best sequel, but on it's own merits this movie knocks it completely out of the park."
348,9,Star Wars for the new generation and that includes my son who loves this!,"Ok, so Disney have got their hands on the Star Wars franchise and too many people don't like it - BOO HOO!"
349,7,"Better than 1 & 2, Worse than 3, 4 & 5","""This will begin to make things right."" The film starting with that line infuriates me. Though the prequels are not held in high esteem, the thought that this movie would course correct the franchise is asinine. Starting on a self-righteous note definitely leaves a sour note."
350,10,This is the Star Wars movie you were looking for.,This is a Star Wars movie of EPIC proportions and was awesome to say the least. 
351,6,"Good movie, reused plot, lame villain.","To really understand this film and my review I would encourage everyone to watch the other Star Wars movies. If you already have or you're just a rebel, keep reading. "
352,9,Proof Of Concept,"Well 30 years have passed since the last, ""GOOD"" star wars movie, and with the current fashion of going back to a franchise that was meant to end a long time ago (more star puns coming) here comes episode 7 , the 7th entry to this franchise that seems to be having a mixed opinion amongst it's viewers. Before starting up with this review let me be really clear about the fact , that the force is strong with this one , and we are back in to the good ol' Star wars. This movie is definitely not the best star wars movie made, but it isn't a movie worth slashes of 1 and 2 ratings either. And in this review I will explain and justify my opinion with absolutely no spoilers."
353,7,"A disgrace to Lucas canon Star Wars, this film won't age well","This film was essentially a cheap rip-off of Episode IV. It wasn't as good as A New Hope because Luke was way more interesting than Rey, Obi-Wan was actually in it for a long time unlike old man Luke who was only in this film for about 5 seconds with no dialogue and Episode IV wasn't so feminist and focused on shoving a barbaric political agenda down our throats. Whilst it was a cheap rip off of A New Hope, A New Hope is a very good film so this film is still good enough for me to give it a 7/10, however that doesn't necessarily mean I'll consider this canon in the long run, that all depends on how good Episode IX is."
354,3,Repetitive,"I've seen a discrepancy between the grade of 8.4 and the mass of bad reviews but still decided to go and watch it. Should have donated to wikipedia instead. Just trust those who tell it feels like a weak remake. There are almost no new ideas here just the same rehash of the good ideas and visually very similar shots from the first two films which becomes now a cliché. Bad father - good son or vice versa, death star but bigger, scenes in an alien pub, scenes in the desert, scenes in the mountain terrain with snow. Lots of explosions and flying, special effects OK as usual. Very few jokes, one or two good ones. The acting is wooden. All the gender, race issues checked in but with weak acting do not look believable. There is something fishy with the 8.4 grade, even assuming the wave of fans. Mechanical turk?"
355,,Star Wars Name? Yes. Star Wars Film? No.,"This was truly an awful sequel. Disney pokes you in the eye to say 'we have no ideas, feeling, creativity or sense of the force and we just want your cash. Pay it up you nostalgic, sucker.' I cannot believe the movie reviewers have such low income that they take blatant bribes form the studios and blatantly review crap that is standard Hollywood borefest as socmething exciting."
356,8,A fantastic start to a trilogy that goes downhill.,"""Star Wars- episode VII: The force awakens"" is directed by ""J. J. Abrams."
357,8,Wait... Have I seen this before?,"I thought this was supposed to be a sequel? The Force Awakens was really similar to previous Star Wars movies and it really took away from what could have been a great movie. The original stars were back, there was a fresh director with new ideas, and some new characters that the younger generation can relate with. This seems like a recipe for success, but the similarities were just to much to overlook. Here are just a few examples:"
358,10,Never Thought It'd be that Good,Really Great Movie ! First time watching star wars movies . It's far better than expectation
359,9,"9.3//I don't care, I love it","10 years later from the hated star wars prequel trilogy, this nostalgic movie gets back and it Don t disappoints, with a new hope references, a magical pure directon from JJ Abrams, New great carecters, a great universe expendeition and incredible fight scenes, The Force Awakens gets back in the high way, being for me one of the bests"
360,6,"Disappointing, lazy film that didn't excite.","As a massive film fan but not a die hard star wars geek, I was still very excited to see a new Star Wars film brought into our generation. I was looking forward to imaginative fight scenes, dark and thrilling bad guys with epic imaginative scenes to keep me interested and watching. This unfortunately didn't happen. "
361,10,Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,Loved it! Can't praise it enough Sat there for 2 hours like a little kid on Xmas morning
362,7,Episode IV Redux,"My review of this entry is simple, it is a New Hope redone with new characters and a couple of different twists. Does this make it bad? No. There is no such thing as a bad Star Wars film. The problem with the lifelong fans, of which I am, I was four when A New Hope was released, is that they want to recapture the awe and splendor that they experienced when Star Wars first came out. It will never happen people."
363,10,A Masterpiece That Breathed New Life Into This Franchise,"Seeing Star Wars The Force Awakens at midnight one year ago today is the greatest cinema experience I've ever had in my life, the theatres were full to the brim and everyone was dressed up but I was still cautiously optimistic but I was blown away by an incredible movie. I adored this movie, I think it's better than A New Hope and almost on Par with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. This film understands that the most vital part of A Star Wars movie is the characters, we are given the time to care and love these new characters because they're developed perfectly, there character progression felt natural and they fit right in with the rest of the veterans. Kylo aren't was an amazing villain, mainly because he isn't completely a bad guy yet but instead a well rounded and complex character struggling with the overwhelming odds he faces. Of course since this is a Star Wars film the special effects are perfect and fit in just right with the rest of the environment. The performances are all fantastic, Daisy Ridley fit right into this role and was extremely likable, John Boyega was not only hilarious but also had a real complexity to him as a character and let us see things from a stormtroopers perspective. Harrison Ford came right back into Han Solo perfectly, he had amazing chemistry with the other characters and was just great to see him back again with a whole new layer of characterisation added to him. Back I really have to be honest the greatest performance in this film was Adam Driver, he gave an amazing performance that rides just the right Lin between fragile and hostile and he made Kylo Ren a much better character to watch and was in my opinion worthy of an Oscar nomination. This film unlike the prequels understands that this film is part of a trilogy, so we are left hanging on certain things and left to wonder for a while, which in the long run will make the whole trilogy more satisfying. JJ Abrams was the perfect choice to direct this film, he paced this film quickly while occasionally slowing down to develop the characters more, he made sure that this film had the greatest Lightsaber battles in all the franchise. "
364,6,"Was really looking forward to it, but left the cinema disappointed","OK let me start of by saying this is NOT a bad film at all. It was entertaining and the special effects were top notch. But if you're like me - that is a Star Wars fan and expecting a film in typical true Star Wars fashion - you'll be left disappointed. See the prequels got a bashing form some, but I actually liked them as they had a true Star Wars feel to it. That is plenty of lightsaber action, a good balance of both the good and bad, and not too much Hollywood style humour. The Force Awakens was different from the first 6. The film focused heavily on The First Order, we didn't get to see much of the resistance until the final quarter of the film. The film had comedy scenes which didn't really suit the Star Wars style. Don't get me wrong, comedy is great, but when you have lines where a spaceship is referred to as garbage, the intended spaceship gets blown up, then the lead character Rey then says, ""ok, garbage will do"", you know they are just using cliché comedy style which isn't ideally suited for a Star Wars film. I also found Kylo Ren to be a very promising, bad ass Sith one minute. Then all of a sudden he becomes this unstable man who removes his mash and shows weaknesses, which are so the opposite of the evil dark figure with special powers which he was displaying literally just 10 minutes prior to that. I wish the film had focused more on making Kylo Ren the unstoppable dark force that only gets defeated in the end with lots of hard work by the Resistance. Instead, we just got to see him struggling in a lightsaber duel with a goofy Stormtrooper who betrayed him. If you go back to the Phantom Menace, Darth Maul was incredible in a fight against Qui-Gon and Obi-Won, which is how it should be. I hope they do better with Kylo Ren's character in the next sequel, he could easily be the closest power Sith to Darth Vader."
365,4,The Hype Awakens,"Disney perfects the process for turning nostalgia into hard cash. Possibly the most over-hyped movie EVER in history, and also one of the biggest let downs for fans of the original trilogy. I really tried to love this movie, but that's the problem right there... everyone is trying a bit TOO hard..."
366,,How is this rated 8.8/10?,"There is no way this film should be rated so highly. You're telling me it's as good as Lord of The rings, the original Star wars films, The Dark Knight, Fight Club etc....? No way... the plot was an exact rehash of Episode IV. Unoriginal, uninspiring, and lackluster all round. The only good thing about it was performances and the nostalgic music, sounds etc. As a stand alone film i'd give it like a 6/10, but since it's being rated so highly I'm going to give it a 1/10. An 8.8/10 film should be original, not a film that is an exact copy and paste of another movie from 30 years ago. I will say, it was better than the prequels in terms of acting, production etc. But even the prequels had better ideas, and MUCH better music. The music wasn't special at all in this - no Dual of The Fates etc etc. Overall im disappointed. Over-hyped to the max."
367,10,The Time Has Come!,"It is surprising that only 10 to 12 hours of films created the giant franchise we know as Star Wars. People have been waiting for a good Star Wars story ever since Episode 6 came out 32 years ago. Fellow Star Wars fans, I am pleased to tell you, it has come. "
368,10,Beyond my wildest expectations!!!,"I can't believe all of the negative comments coming from people reviewing this movie! As a long time fan of Star Wars, Force Awakens was everything I was hoping the Prequels could have been. In my opinion they did a great job honoring the old characters while also introducing some new and very fascinating people. The story was fun and paid homage to the original movies. To all the idiots bashing JJ Abrams, my words to you are, ""Shame on you!"" For him to take the reigns and be willing to bring the series back probably took some courage!!! Do your self a favor and go see this film. I am going to see it at least a few more times!"
369,10,Perfect! Hands down the best one yet! Insecure trolls are out in full force.,Let me start by saying I didn't know what to expect before going to see this movie. Last night we were standing in line and you could feel the anxiety of everyone looking forward to this film.
370,8,Nostalgic and New Fun,"Greetings again from the darkness. In what can justifiably be termed a cultural event, director J.J. Abrams brings us Episode VII in a film franchise that date backs almost 40 years. While I was one of the lucky ones who waited patiently in line to see the first Star Wars on opening day in 1977, I can only be described as a series fan rather than a Star Wars geek. My bond is with Hans Solo and Chewbaca, so this is not the place to debate the minutiae of costumes, timelines and weaponry."
371,6,Are you sure this is a sequel and not a remake?,"If I had never seen any Star Wars movie before, I'd have thought that J. J. Abrams manages to successfully make a very entertaining movie, a journey of almost 130 minutes full of action, science fiction, space adventure, and exciting challenges for its protagonists... But in reality I have seen everything that has been done previously in the saga and that is why I must say that episode VII feels a bit repetitive. Maybe too much. The clue hidden in a droid, the girl is captured on an enemy ship and the good guys go undercover to rescue her, the bar full of puppets, the surprising revelations about family ties, the son who went to the dark side, the look of the villain , the super weapon that looks like a planet, the destruction of this super weapon... Everything has been seen before, this looks like a remake instead of a sequel. For the casual viewer it's a great film, entertaining, emotional, enigmatic and with a great visual spectacle, both in its photography and in the action itself. But it seems to me that for the most radical fans and even for the not so radical, it may not be the new movie that was expected."
372,10,A Wonderful Return To A Galaxy We Missed Dearly!,The Force Awakens promised a lot and delivered more for both a first time Star Wars viewer or a die hard fan of the series.
373,6,The Force is Confused,"J.J. Abrams gave us so much, and if we had been paying attention, we would have noticed that most of the cheers emanated from our recognition of the old guard and our affection for what once was a welcome return to old fashioned fun. It looked like it was impossible, but Episode IV transitioned into ""Empire (Episode V)"", and one of the best films ever (of any genre) came forth. After the disastrous trilogy that we were subjected to a few years ago, it was encouraging to see how the best elements of the original trilogy was about to make an appearance."
374,10,Star Wars is back,"Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams have delivered the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi, and it may be the best one ever. This is the Star Wars movie fans in 2015 have longed for."
375,7,A good weekend movie... but for a Star Wars movie? Err....,Spoilers ahead.
376,3,"um, er, how about the power comes from the sun!",Script Meeting:
377,,Abrams has found his niche ... now stay away from Star Trek ! 5/10,"OK, first, the reason for the 5/10 is that I could not watch it again. There is not a lot of plot tension or complexity, and the movie is a little long and schmaltzy ... but, this is so much better than I thought it would be, I am glad I went to see it, it was fun."
378,9,Better than Last Jedi by a mile,A lot of people complained about the similarities between this and the original but I thought it was kind of a fun ode but still its own sort of thing. After seeing the horrifically awful Last Jedi I think we can all agree this one looks even better in retrospect. JJ Abrams clearly loves it and you can feel that and I think it's pretty great.
379,10,My third best Star Wars movie,"It was incredible the effects of the movie I love the first scene that appears Kylo Ren it was incredible because it was like wow the new Sith of the Skywalker Saga and the scene that Poe Dameron And Finn (FN-2187) on the Caza Tie And when Rey, Finn And BB-8 escape from the First Order in the Millenium Falcon I think that was the best scene for me"
380,10,The franchise is rescued.,Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that for many hardcore traditional fans had become a niggling source of disappointment.
381,10,"Well, it worked for me","It is over 30 years (or the galactic equivalent) since the evil Empire was overturned and democracy returned to the galaxy (it's still a long, long time ago, though). A New Order has arisen from the ashes of the Empire and a planet-scale Death Star has been constructed. Luke Skywalker has not been seen for years after his Jedi apprentice turned to the dark side of the Force, adopting the masked identity of Kylo Ren. When a conscience-stricken stormtrooper deserts, and then joins up with a strangely skilled girl from nowhere and a droid with hidden secrets, we are in territory which is both unknown and yet strangely familiar."
382,6,A remake of episode IV,"Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"") is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in ""New Hope"" as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships. "
383,8,Great return,After so long without a Star Wars film I was worried about what we would get but it was brillaint the story was great and fitted great
384,6,Not so much innovative compared to original trilogy,"Alright, I would like to compare it to the original Lucas trilogy. Youngsters might find this movie very entertaining if they have not watched those old good movies. However, the older audience who ever watched the 1977, 1980 & 1983 movies would have much higher expectations. "
385,10,It's so good.,"I really recommend watching it. But if you're a very die hard star wars fan, please don't watch it. I wasn't a die hard fan but I still liked it because I loved the action and everything. I even liked the story. But for die hard star wars fan, some of them don't like the fact that some of the characters were useless such as Finn."
386,6,Star Wars is DEAD! Say hello to a new Disney princess & her journey,"I will tell you what I liked, didn't like and then talk spoilers in this order. "
387,4,A great example of a defensive movie product,This movie is neither as good as some would like to make you believe nor as bad as some would like to believe themselves.
388,,Disappointing movie,Saw the new one last night. It was decent. I enjoyed watching it. Might even see it again. For a Star Wars fan after so many years this was like a cold glass of water after being stranded in the desert for an extended period. But would probably rank it last among the 7 Star Wars movies so far.
389,8,When George Lucas sees this...,"...he'll want to smash the prequels with a large sledgehammer. If he's honest about his work, that is. Now he has the time because he's not involved in Star Wars fist hand... and ostensibly enough money to buy an appropriately large devastating device."
390,10,Most. Applause-Garnering & Eye-Tearing. Ending. Ever.,"After the first two scenes — which seemed a bit fumbling & ""ice- breaking"" — I was astonished, time and again, by how meticulously balanced this film turned out to be; here's something new, here's a reference to something old, here's a dizzying shot reminiscent of Kubrick's effort in ""2001"" to dwarf the audience, here's a reimagining of Lucas's locating the slum-dwellers on offshore worlds so you can better see the scavenger life and all its travails, here's the Nazi impulse projected into the First Order rally, here's ... "
391,8,Defending This Movie,"Let me say this right off the bat: ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is not a horrible film. I'm sure most people in their right minds will agree with this statement. I personally think that people have the wrong idea about what makes ""Star Wars"" great in the first place. It's a simple, straightforward, and fast-moving story. There are clear villains and heroes. Frenetic action that is spectacle and also suspenseful. ""Star Wars"" is not a thinking man's franchise. It never has been. So for anyone who criticizes this movie for being unoriginal and just derivative of the original trilogy: the original trilogy itself was unoriginal and derivative of fairy tales, science fiction serials, and Japanese cinema. George Lucas was a visionary in terms of bringing us an interesting and unique universe as dressing for a simple fairy tale story, and also by bringing us ground-breaking special effects. He was never a terrific storyteller, so people who come to a ""Star Wars"" movie expecting to see something that will move you or make you think, I'm sorry that you have that impression of the franchise."
392,8,"Great Movie, Recycled Story",It's true. The movie is good. It's also true that all of the complaining people on here upset about the recycled copy of a storyline as it applies to the other Star Wars movies have a point. Let me first of all touch on a fact that everyone knows by now: it's a good movie. 
393,6,A forceful awakening...,Watched the movie twice.I really tried to like it and find something at least half great as the advertising campaign behind it.
394,9,The movie fans have been waiting for,"Often, being an artist who creates something immensely popular is a tricky situation. A work of art, like a certain movie that a young twenty-something director by the name of George Lucas created in 1974, merges with the public consciousness and becomes part of the Zeitgeist. "
395,6,Not as good as I had expected,"OK I am a fan, but not a fanatic! to begin with, the movie is solely carried on the tiny shoulders of Daisy Ridley (Rey), the rest did not hold a candle to her (including Harrison Ford & Oscar Issac), so well done miss Ridley, you saved the movie. Special effects and action are all very good, story? well 'aaay ' acceptable - but my beef is mainly else where. I watched this movie at Empire - Leicester Sq. in London, which to my knowledge is the only IMAX-Laser theatre currently in UK. The cinema is supposed to be the state-of- the-art with 4K resolution, 3D and the latest incarnation of IMAX which uses laser- beams to create images brighter than anything before, with better contrast blah- blah. But it failed miserably! I have seen sharper & cleaner pictures from a £500 TV set, Picture was awash with dot-crawl noise, contrast was terrible, motion-judder almost made me sick, and if that was not enough, the crappy 3D-glasses were so hazy, slightest ambient light would turn them gray, destroying any blacks! the space scenes background was not black, it was an annoying gray. Do yourself a favour, watch it on 2D and don't waste your money on IMAX-laser 3D , it is just a hype. Otherwise the movie is watchable, but not great! ---------------------------UPDATE------------------------ Just watched it again on bluray release, and I haven't changed my mind. I still find it ""Not-Good-Enough"" to do justice to previous movies. They need to really concentrate on a STORY first, a movie is nothing without a proper story - re-using previous stories is no good - no matter how much you throw Special-Effects at it. StarWars did not become a classic because of it's special effects alone. Needs a better story teller (as in both writer and director)."
396,10,A perfect combination of the new and the old,SCORE: 9.7/10
397,7,Forced,The pervasive hype in the days before it opened should have been a warning sign. This movie is better than the prequel trilogy - in the sense that it sticks more closely to the look and feel of the originals - but it falls well short of the epic restoration we all wanted to see. It's closer to Return of the Jedi than to Phantom Menace - but not troubling ESB for top spot in my affections.
398,2,Watered down politically correct rewrite of the original trilogy,"If you are under 30 and enjoy poorly rewritten stories with a modern politically correct tone, you'll probably like this movie."
399,,First Star Wars Movie I've ever Seen. I'm 29,"It's an awful film, I'm just giving it a 2 because it actually had a beginning, a middle and an end."
400,10,Spectacular film for the old and new generation,"I can't believe it took someone 32 years to make a decent Star Wars movie. Finally, true fan and director J.J. Abrams gave us the film we have desperately been waiting for."
401,10,JJ Abrams made Star Wars cool again!,JJ made something that the previous trilogy completely missed; strong characters! 
402,8,A great beginning to another saga,It is very fun and entertaining. The first half is a little slow but picks up the pace as the story goes on. Speaking of the story it is great. The performances of the cast are good. The CGI and visual effects are outstanding. The sad part is that a loved character had to die.
403,8,"May knock some back down to Earth, but will lift up others to that special place they haven't been in a while","Few franchises are as cherished and as glorious as Star Wars. Since its release in 1977, it has been passed down by hardcore fans to their children in the form of repeated viewings on VHS or DVD like a precious family heirloom, or has simply found itself etched in a young child's mind with no help from their parents. My generation endured the often tarnished prequels, but even if you're somebody who despises the franchise's prequels and embraces ""the original trilogy,"" think about that; you dislike one-half of the series, but you still have the nerve to call yourself a Star Wars fan. That's because the Star Wars characters, universe, and experience transcends a few subpar films; it's something that reminds us why we go see films in the first place and how they can completely transport us out of our element for an experience that we'll always hold dear to our hearts and cherish until we pass."
404,6,Another Galaxy Altogether,** Spoilers Inside**
405,9,"A crowd-pleaser, but one with the full power of the Force!","Let me start by saying: Wow! J.J. Abrams did it again! Like Star Trek before it, Star Wars is ready to take old and new generations of fans on a new journey. This is probably THE Star Wars movie that most people have waited for since Return of the Jedi. "
406,6,The new Sith Lord needs a time out!,"I really wanted to like this movie but the cards were stacked against it after 3 dismal attempts to reproduce the success of the first 3 movies in episode 1, 2 and 3 ""prequel movies"", which in my opinion are almost unwatchable. The only redeeming quality the 1st prequel movie had that this movie did not was a memorable bad guy that actually had a menacing screen presence! No offense to the actor who played Kylo Ren but the new Star Wars bad guy SUCKS! This character comes up short in so many ways it is not even funny! He is not intimidating at all! The attempt at comedy by portraying him as a this tantrum throwing kid makes him irritating not scary and the fact that he is the child of 2 of the veteran main characters makes it even worse! "
407,9,"Incredible stuff, even though it's in familiar territory.","After a really long decade Star Wars is back! J.J. Abrams has done us proud. The Force Awakens, or episode VII (the first in a new trilogy of films to come every other year) as it's been named, is a superb science-fiction film. For the die-hard fans its only gripe is it's a little too familiar in territory, but that's genuinely it. For the newer, younger audiences, TFA leads a path to what's to come. When the blue letters 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' followed by the trademark yellow words swiping up the starry backdrop, I felt like I was 11 again. There's a strong scent of nostalgia mixed in to the story, but for every old memory there's 10 new ones. So many emotions washed through me within a short space of time, as I know my expectations (and everyone else's) are, and were, going to be met. It only takes a few seconds to know we're in the capable hands of someone who's a major fan himself."
408,6,It's Just A Re-Make Of The Original,"If you have seen the original Star Wars, then you already know the basic premise of this film! It did invoke some feelings of nostalgia at first, but it became painfully predictable very early on in the film."
409,1,A Cinematic Travesty,I will never forget seeing Star Wars Episode IV for the first time in 1977. What an awesome film it was. I've been a fan of the Star Wars universe ever since. It was with great excitement I watched the latest episode VII.
410,,Fairly enjoyable... but very derivative,"With the, ahem, force of so many user comments for this movie already - and with no doubt much more to come - I wonder if anyone here will read my comments on this movie. (Please leave a vote if you did!) Anyway, I just got back from seeing this movie after waiting so long to see it, and my verdict is... mixed. There are some good things about it, for sure. There aren't any slow spots, there is a lot of action, some of it pretty exciting. The sets, props, and special effects, of course, are excellent. And it was great to see the classic characters once again."
411,10,Don't let the trolls deceive you: this movie is bliss,"Isn't a little suspicious that a movie that has 95% approval by critics and 93% approval by fans at RottenTomatoes, an 81 score at Metacritic and a 8.1 overall score at IMDb has so much 1/10 stars reviews at the IMDb user reviews section? This section has been invaded by trolls. No doubt about it."
412,10,Best possible resurrection of STAR WARS,"The movie is undoubtedly made with a lot of details and attention, scenes are well crafted and the dialogues are well written. There's a classic feel of the old Star Wars movies to this and also the visuals of the new world. <br /><br />The old cast mark, Carrie, Harrison and the rest are as good as they've ever been and also the new crew Daisy and John are amazing. <br /><br />The score of the movie is the best I've heard in a long long time. The movie made over 2 billion dollars and well it desverved it."
413,9,The next generation Star Wars is Fan-Tastic!,"One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with ""Star Trek"" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new ""Star Wars"" installment. ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! ""Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid ""Star Wars"" admirer, it was the first one since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. ""The Force Awakens"" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!"
414,10,Autistic Reviewers Opinion of This Movie.,"The Franchise we all know and love is back, and guess what? It's BETTER THAN THE PREQUELS! While it doesn't quite top the originals, it comes so close. The movie is so close to perfection! "
415,6,Are all the Empire's Stormtroopers writing these reports?,"Big struggle from the director to target a new audience but I am sorry, this is not Frozen and there was commitment with this saga. I blame also Lucas for giving up. I am also really impressed on how they are burying all the bad critics in the first and most crucial week after the release. The movie doesn't expand the Star Wars universe, it is a terrible copy-cut-paste of the best moments from the saga. When Admiral Ackbar showed up I was expecting a ""It's a trap"", never happened but I am sure it will be included in the expanded version in a couple of years from now. Anakin took 3 movies to become a complete Jedi, the main characters of the Force Awakens will have full powers in less than 1 hour. Yes remember Anakin's story, slave living in a dessert planet with special abilities in certain areas, it will become quite handy when you go to see the movie in case of some similarities. The teenager version of Darth Vader, a sick R2D2 missing papa and the DEATH START ALL OVER AGAIN were too much to handle for a average fan like me... I hope superfans are doing better than I am. 6 stars of disappointment..."
416,10,What I expected,"Just came back from a midnight showing in New Plymouth, New Zealand. Have to say I loved it. It didn't feel like an Abrams film. It felt like a Star Wars film. I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original ( I refuse to call it A New Hope ). Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the haters go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Footnote. Daisy Ridley sometimes looks scarily like Keira Knightly."
417,6,Nothing new under the sun...,"Sadly, not blown away by Force Awakens."
418,9,An incredible return to the Skywalker saga,"J.J Abrams's return to a galaxy far far away is a pleasant one with 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. Returning the beloved characters of the Skywalker saga and showing what happened to them.The visuals are beautiful as is John Williams score, the brilliant performances also help with Harrison Ford fully channeling Han Solo, and not a grizzled Harrison Ford. The newcomers are very good as well with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. The largest complaint I could even have with this film is the fact that despite the over 30 year wait for an Episode VII we get something very familiar, which is obviously intentional to bring back the feeling of Star Wars to fans, however the film becomes predictable once you see the formula, the film is still fun, and does have new ideas but overall you see the similarities. Despite being a very familiar film, it is heavily filled with fun nostalgia and a Star Wars movie that will leave you feeling like you're a kid again."
419,6,"The worst Star Wars so far, story wise",The Force Awakens is a lazy mess. It's a rehash of mostly the first film and parts of the next two. Absolutely riddled with plot holes.
420,4,"Please Do Not Buy....... Just Rent and that will be plenty, You can thank me afterward....","You know, I don't usually give low rating as I respect for film makers and the actors who sweated and poured their hearts in it...."
421,,What happened to screen writing these days?,"First of all, the movie is not as bad as many others review it here. But the essence of these reviews is true: It just mirrors what Hollywood has become today. Episode VII is a uninspired ripoff of somebody else's ideas and therefore has no soul. But what is really annoying, considering the professionals involved, it has a poorly written script. It feels like a first draft that has been rushed into production. Abrams knows his job, he wrote Super 8, which is a well written movie. And Kasdan co-wrote Empire Strikes Back, which is the best star wars ever. I don't know what happened, maybe they tried to make it great and some studio boss messed it up. Or they didn't have enough time to make it right. Probably Abrams is just too busy producing. I wonder how the movie had turned out if a writer with a master skill set like Aaaron Sorkin or Quentin Tarrantino had written the script. Writers who really know their craft and can build up scenes that work for the story. This movie had, except a couple of good punchlines, not one well written scene. And that's too bad as Abrams knows how to direct a well written script."
422,9,Best SciFi Movie of 2015,"The saga that enthralled two generations is back to captivate the imagination of a third. A new Star Wars trilogy begins with the much discussed STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. Since the classic trilogy, Star Wars has become synonymous with relatable characters in an old fashioned good vs evil story all set to mind blowing special effects, convention defying designs, and a rousing fanfare that kicks off each story set in that galaxy far far away."
423,8,"'Help me finish, what you started'","I don't think I've ever cried out of sheer happiness. It's an incredible feeling, and one I had figured I would never feel because of my relatively pessimistic attitude on most things. The Force Awakens achieved this, not through emotional manipulation or cinematic perfection, but by simply inducing a powerful sense of nostalgia inside me. "
424,8,Something something Remake something,OK..I have given this a high score and it should be less but damn I loved it.
425,10,A bit predictive but so awesome,"I was thrilled to go to this new Star Wars, being a fan of JJ and the way he rebooted some other series and having seen Star Wars as a youngster, the original series."
426,6,It isn't a terrible film but it is a film of two halves.,I am a big fan of IMDb but I've never written a film review and it was after watching this film that I felt compelled to do so. Others have given much better objective and critical reviews than I have here.
427,10,A Masterpiece That Breathed New Life Into This Franchise,"Seeing The Force Awakens was the greatest cinema experience I've ever had in my life, the theaters were full to the brim and everyone was dressed up but I was still cautiously optimistic but I was blown away by an incredible movie. I adored this movie, I think it's better than A New Hope and almost on Par with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. This film understands that the most vital part of A Star Wars movie is the characters, we are given the time to care and love these new characters because they're developed perfectly, there character progression felt natural and they fit right in with the rest of the veterans. Kylo aren't was an amazing villain, mainly because he isn't completely a bad guy yet but instead a well rounded and complex character struggling with the overwhelming odds he faces. Of course since this is a Star Wars film the special effects are perfect and fit in just right with the rest of the environment. "
428,7,I see why they kept this movie a secret now.,I'll keep it short and sweet without repeating what some reviewers have said because if I did that well my review would be like the movie. Should I leave it at that? If they were going to reboot a movie Disney should have practiced its dark art of the force on remaking the prequels. This movie was not as good as I had hoped. It's episode IV in a 21st century shell. I saw it 12/18 in an IMAX theater so bare with me as I try to remember it all.
429,10,Exactly what a life long fan of Star Wars wanted to see.,"It was basically all a life long Star Wars fan wanted to see excluding the haters that existed, exist and will continue to exist to the end of time that will say that it completely ruined the franchise and that ""Star Wars is dead"" and will never enjoy a new star wars film no matter what it is as long as it isn't the ORIGINAL EPISODE IV FROM 1977. Despite having a few similarities to episode IV (A New Hope) it does't keep it back from being fresh, with a lot of adventure, a sense of nostalgia and rewarding every fan with what he was hoping to see. Glad they finally released an awesome Star Wars film after the disaster of episodes I-III that do have their good moments too, and we're waiting to see what is to come in the next few years with episodes VIII and IX. 100% recommended and even if you haven't watched a Star Wars film before, start by watching Episodes IV-VI then I-III and finish up with episode VII (The Force Awakens) to continue the story next year. Thank you all, hope you are a true fan and that you will enjoy the movie, may the force be with you (it has truly awakened)."
430,7,"Overly familiar, flawed, but tons of fun!","First of all, I will say this movie is great fun. Abrams does a great job with the action scenes and the pace is great. Rey is perhaps the greatest character in the series so far, I thought she was even better than Han Solo. Also I think Kylo Ren is a great character."
431,5,Special Effect and that all !,"My score for this film, Star Wars VII - The Force Awakens, is 5/10 maximum. Nothing is original and it is only a pale copy of the first Star Wars IV - A New Hope (1977)"
432,,I do not understand,"Disney has money. Disney has lots of money. Why didn't they hire a good director and good actors? Why do they bring inferior amateurs to film and play in Star Wars?<br /><br />Could someone explain this to me?<br /><br />Also, whya re they remaking and yet calling it a new episode. It is so confusing that the rebels won and now they are rebels again.<br /><br />Could someone tell me?"
433,9,"No Ewoks, No Jar Jar, No Kidding","Note: Even though I checked ""might contain spoilers,"" for the benefit of those who haven't seen this yet (which was me until today), I'm going to try not to give too much away here."
434,9,"Not a sequel, but a reboot","I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Used to Abrams' horrid bastardizing style, I expected something fit for children and devoid of soul. But since I am not a Star Wars fan and Abrams probably is, I found it acceptable and he probably made more of an effort than when he mauled Star Trek, where the situation is clearly reversed."
435,8,Everyone Has Already Seen The Film Anyway...,"I don't think there are any real spoilers in this review, but I checked the box just in case."
436,8,A generally enjoyable film,"The film manages to capture the essence of Star Wars, and has decent production values. It also provides the audience with intriguing questions about the characters of this film."
437,6,What I most learnt from Star Wars the force awakens,There is a lot I could write here about this movie but why repeat everything that almost everybody has already said.
438,9,"I love this movie, almost as much as the original!","I was so excited when the prequels came, having always loved the original trilogy. I was a bit disappointed with them, but still enjoyed them. This movie brought back the magic of the originals, with a fresh cast and goosebumps at the returning characters. Not a perfect movie, but an awesome and welcome edition to the saga!"
439,6,Disney Fail,Does anyone remember when Star Wars was first purchased by Disney and the reaction was less than positive? Well there was a reason for that. I bring you back to modern day in which Disney released their new kid- friendly version of Star Wars. 
440,8,same story and yet unexpected,"Expectations where high on this blockbuster, but though I was in fear of being disappointed, that was not the case. The movie keeps your attention and packs everything a movie needs. The makers knew it packed everything it needs, because it is a shameless remake of A New Hope and that was about the only really annoying thing about it. They should have made it ""more different""."
441,7,Disappointed,"This? This is what Disney jettisoned Michael Arndt and Lucas's story treatments for? So they could do a retread of EP 4? With elements of EP 5 and 6 thrown in? Nearly every single scene harked back to the original trilogy like one big exercise in fan service. It was exactly what I feared it would be after watching all the trailers and TV spots. I was hoping for something new, and not yet ANOTHER Death Star. Holy god, couldn't they come up with something different? I thought Abrams and Kasdan said they had worked really hard on coming up with a good story. Doesn't take that much hard work to reboot A New Hope. "
442,2,Disappointing rehash. Over-hyped,"Over-hyped rehash. Another cute droid with the key to a lost Jedi who has disappeared because an apprentice betrayed him and turned to the Dark Side. Another desert planet. Another roguish Han Solo wannabe. Another prison break from deep inside Imperial/First Order held territory. Another cantina scene. Another Death Star-like planet killer which must be destroyed (and is, again right before it's about to destroy the Rebel/Resistance base planet). Another plan to destroy it which involves a small team of infantry destroying a shield generator. Another masked evil student of the Dark Side with a respirator-distorted voice (without the reverberating depth and presence of James Earl Jones's voice). Another mysterious shadowy super-evil figure scheming behind the scenes. More Jedi family intrigue. "
443,,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Delivers the Thrills, With a Touch of Humanity","The Force Awakens re-awoke my love of the first movie and turned my inner fan boy into my outer fan boy. There are very few films which leave me facially exhausted after grinning for 135 minutes, but this is one. And when Han Solo and Chewie come on, I had a feeling in the cinema I haven't had since I was 16: not knowing whether to burst into tears or into applause."
444,8,Puts Star Wars back in its proper place,"As a huge Star Wars fan from a young age, writing an objective review of this movie is almost impossible. It's evident from the reviews here on IMDb that people are either adoring this movie, or they're vastly disappointed by it. "
445,10,Roller-coaster on an excellent return-to-franchise,"I entered the cinema complex with absolute no knowledge about the movie, the only thing I saw was one trailer, that's it. Even if you did watch all of the trailers, shots,... you can't know what will happen to you in the following 2hours and 15 minutes..."
446,9,All the feels,"Two words: loved it.<br /><br />The feelings I got as a kid? Rekindled. The new characters? Awesome! The old characters? Oh yeah!<br /><br />The visuals were amazing, the plot got me intrigued. Got no complaints about the acting, it all seemed to fit the individual characters imo.<br /><br />Out of all of them, Rey definitely got to me the most. Her longing for a place to call home and for people to call her family and belong with is something I can understand, so I felt for her. I thought she was cool on screen, but you should hear my little ones - they were practically gushing about her (still are), and well - that sealed the deal. A new hero has risen."
447,10,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,"Disney paid over $4 billion to buy Lucasfilm, George Lucas himself served as creative consultant, I was super excited about a new movie, and the original stars returning, it was just a question of whether the acquisition was worth it, forget the prequels (no Jar Jar Binks), directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, it's been 30 years since the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared, the remains of the fallen Galactic Empire have risen and become The First Order, seeking to eliminate Skywalker and the Republic, the Resistance, backed by the Republic, are led by Luke's sister, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposing the First Order and searching for Luke. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) obtains a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow), Stormtroopers, commanded by Kylo Ren (What If's Adam Driver), destroy the village and capture Poe, his droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and comes across scavenger Rey (introducing Daisy Ridley) at a junkyard settlement. The First Order Stormtrooper FN-2187 (Attack the Block's John Boyega) is unable to kill, gets away, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, Poe gives him the new name ""Finn"". Poe and Finn crash on Jakku, Finn appears to be the only survivor, he finds Rey and BB-8 in the village, the First Order find them and attack, the three flee the planet in the stolen, rundown Millennium Falcon. Following a chase and escape, the Falcon breaks down and is captured by a larger ship, piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), they reclaim their former ship, finding Rey and Finn, Han explains that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but a student turned to the Dark Side, Luke went into exile and all he built was destroyed. The five escape on the Falcon when attacked by criminal gangs, the gangs inform the First Order of Han's involvement, the Falcon lands on the planet Takodana, the group meet cantina owner Maz Kanata (12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o), who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, Rey finds Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, it also belonged to his father Anakin. The First Order have converted a planet into a superweapon capable of destroying star systems, Starkiller Base, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to use the weapon for the first time to destroy the Republic capital and its fleet, Snoke tells Ren he must kill his father, Han Solo. Takodana is attacked by the First Order, Finn uses the lightsaber in a fight, Resistance X-wing fighters save Finn, Han and Chewbacca, they are led by Poe, but Rey is captured and taken to Starkiller Base, she resists Ren's interrogation and mind-reading, and Rey discovers her powers of the Force, using a Jedi mind trick to escape her cell. Han, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 meet Leia at the Resistance base on D'Qar, droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) explains that R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) has been inactive since Luke's disappearance, the group learn that BB- 8's map to Luke's location is incomplete. The Resistance plan to lower the planetary shield of Starkiller Base, before it will fire on D'Qar, so the fighters can attack, Leia asks Han to bring their son back alive; Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base in the Falcon, the shield is lowered and Rey is found, and explosives are set. They encounter Ren, Han confronts him, using his birth name Ben, and implores him to turn from the Dark Side, but Ren kills his father Han, Chewbacca shoots Ren and sets off the explosives, the Resistance X-wing fighters therefore attack the weapon and the Starkiller Base is destroyed in a chain reaction. Injured Ren chases Finn and Rey to the surface, Finn is injured in a fight using the lightsaber, Rey takes it and overpowers Ren, who is wounded, they are finally separated by the ground crumbling, Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to him, while Rey, Chewbacca and Finn escape in the Falcon. The Resistance celebrate victory on On D'Qar, but Leia, Chewbacca and Rey mourn Han's death, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, Rey follows this to an island on a distant planet, and there she finds Luke Skywalker, offering him his lightsaber. Also starring Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, Simon Pegg as Unkar Plutt, Tim Rose as Admiral Ackbar (voiced by Erik Bauersfeld), Pip Torrens as Colonel Kaplan, Rocky Marshall as Colonel Datoo, Heroes' Greg Grunberg as Snap Wexley, The Raid's Yayan Ruhian as Tasu Leech, Sebastian Armesto as Lieutenant Mitaka, Warwick Davis as Wollivan, Saw's Ken Leung as Admiral Statura, The Raid's Iko Uwais as Razoo Quin-Fee, 30 Rock's Judah Friedlander as Bar Patron, Thomas Brodie-Sangster as First Order Officer, Bill Hader as BB-8 Voice Consultants, Daniel Craig as Stormtrooper JB-007 and Ewan McGregor as the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ford, Fisher and Hamill returning makes the nostalgia all the more fun, newcomers Ridley and Boyega are fantastic talents, and Driver a great choice for villain, supporting cast members do great as well. I was hoping the feel of the fantastic originals would be reignited, I'm happy to say it met all my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase and fight sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, this truly is a return to the good old days and I cannot wait for the next, a brilliant science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music, Original Score for John Williams, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, Best Original Music, and Best Sound. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!"
448,7,Not much more than a badly disguised version of the first movie (ep IV),"JJ did a great job. Especial effects look great. This movie takes you back to the style of the first 3 movies. Less digital, more realistic. I liked that a lot."
449,10,"A perfect Star Wars, A cinematic masterpiece.","I have been watching Star Wars since I could walk, knowing the inside and out of every nook and cranny in the series. I, like many of you, adore the original 1977 release far more than the 1997, and despise Jar Jar Binks. Honestly, the Phantom Menace should have never existed."
450,6,A New Hope: Fan Fiction Edition,"SPOILERS The two stars are for Rey's strong female portrayal and the fact Harrison Ford really acted for the first time in decades. Otherwise, here are my problems with this derivative and disappointing Star Wars movie, in no particular order."
451,8,A good way to relaunch the saga,"JJ Abrams is smart about how he plays with the toys he was given. If I had one criticism about this movie; it's to be too classic in its structure - no spoiler but the movie will feel very familiar. On the other hand, what is the right balance to strike between old & new? "
452,6,Not much to do with SW,*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***
453,3,Ummm... what was the story again?,"I saw this movie in 2 different days taking a couple of breaks, if that means anything to you. I chose not to read or see anything about this movie, because I was exited that ep. VII was coming out and wanted to save all the excitement for the night I watch the film. I even setup a deep put away projector for that. Oh what a disappointment it was."
454,,The Force Awakens is really just another New Hope,"The first (or fourth) Star Wars worked so well because it was something new. The older mentor Jedi walks the hero through a desert planet opening,finds Han Solo and Chewbacca, gets cut down by the Sith while X-Wings fight Tie Fighters, a giant planet destroyer is itself destroyed and the forces of good are saved."
455,9,The Sequel Trilogy Is Over! ~ And Looking Back The Force Awakens Was The Best Of The 3.,Easily the best Star Wars film in the sequel trilogy.<br /><br />It was a good basis and I loved the rendition to a new home which was clever by Abrams.<br /><br />Should be appreciated by many.<br /><br />Shame the last Jedi didn't quite follow that down that path that Abrams left...<br /><br />JJ Abrams should have directed the whole sequel trilogy and I'm sure if that would've been the way.. The outcome sure as hell would've been different from a very divided Star Wars fan base.
456,10,Why this is my favourite Star Wars movie,"I'll start by saying I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I remember back to when I was 3 and watching the movies non stop, playing with my Star Wars Lego, action figures, lightsabers and costumes made by my mum and always loving every second of it. I'm a fan of many franchises from Marvel to DC to Doctor Who but the biggest fandom of all has always been Star Wars. I may not have been around when the original movies were released but I am honestly one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world."
457,8,The Star Wars Movie We've Been Waiting For,"Let me ask you this, after you watched Return of the Jedi...way back when...were you hoping that there would be another SEQUEL? A bunch of us did, but George Lucas gave us PREQUELS. Now don't get me wrong, the prequels have their flaws but do add to more depth to the Star Wars universe and got better towards the end. But The Force Awakens continues the legendary tale forward. We all wondered what might have happened after the empire was defeated...well now we know--sort of--I'm sure more will be revealed in the next sequel. But right now this movie is IT! This is the Star Wars sequel we've been waiting for! Less fancy CGI than the prequels, more action and even some comedy, and a good balance of nostalgia combined with the additon of new characters and moving the story forward. This movie respects the fans of the old Star Wars while forging ahead to create more new fans. It's awesome, best movie this Christmas season...so don't just sit there reading reviews...GO AND SEE IT!"
458,10,J.J. Abrams made The Ultimate Star Wars sequel. This is the film you are looking for.,"What J.J. Abrams achieved is astonishing, and something to remember for all eternity. I can't talk about specific things, because this is like the ultimate spoiler film, but... "
459,6,"Uninspired, paint-by-numbers film-making","The whole film was just dull and adopted too many elements of modern Hollywood. Far too many key events and plot complications were disappointingly familiar. Important characters have little motivation to carry out key plot progress and I kept asking myself ""why does this person even care?"""
460,10,Abrams Delivers!!!!!,SPOILERS!!! 
461,7,The Force did awaken after it flatlined in the prequels,"I thought the film was a lot better than the prequels but still wasn't as good as the original trilogy for me as I still took some issues with the film. I'll try and keep my review as spoiler-free as possible, but you still might come across some minor spoilers."
462,9,Everything I expected and yet nothing I expected!,"I am proud to say I'm one of the first people in the world to have seen this cinematic event, and I'm happy to say it was well worth the wait! I'm desperate to talk about this film but I'll keep spoilers to myself as I want you all to enjoy the excitement and twists yourself. I'll put a spoiler tag on just in case I accidentally leak something."
463,7,This was not the movie I was looking for!,And then it begins...
464,5,Star Wars never looked so rewritten,"There is almost nothing unique about this movie. Take a bit of A New Hope, with a dash of Return of the Jedi, throw in new characters and kill some others. Add a Death Star, planet-style and throw in just enough of the junked, unused Universe that Lucas created and you have this good-enough Sci-fi movie. It rates the same for me as Maximum Overdrive, Garbage Pail Kids, and Home Alone 5. Not the proudest of company there, but it is what it is. It IS a decent movie, but just a real disappointing Star Wars Movie. I liked some parts, which made me chuckle, but too many direct similarities to what was already in film make for a dry movie."
465,,Worst Star Wars Movie Ever,Where is George Lucas when we need him?
466,10,Bravo!,"When you're taking on this amount of history, or baggage depending on your point of view, you have to start modest and start small and let the story slowly tell itself and fill in the gaps. That's what happens here, as we begin (not unlike SW IV) with a small droid with an important package running into some random (or are they random?) characters. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that along the way Hans Solo and Chewy join the ride and things really start to heat up. As they do the movie pays homage to previous episodes without just redoing what they did before (with one exception). Maybe it's easier just to say what it is - 1) good plot, 2) good characters, best of them Solo, 3) good dialogue, 4) an active story that moves along well, and 5) beautiful scope to the scenery and special effects. What is one of the things that made the original Star Wars so damn good? Scenes like Luke looking wistfully over the desert grandeur of Tatooine. Just reveling for a moment in the spectacle of a foreign world. We got some of that here. What it's not is 1) too over-the-top, 2) too long, or 3) too complicated. Is Abrams to blame for why this is the best SW since Empire? I suspect he is. Real real nice job."
467,8,"The Star Wars franchise is back, with a vengeance...","I have just come back home from the cinema after having spent the evening there with my family watching the new ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". And I am thrilled, excited and ecstatic."
468,10,"Ignore the negatives, this movie is AMAZING","Only people that ""think"" they are fans are giving this movie negative reviews. This movie is absolutely incredible and I don't think anyone could have done any better with it. If your nit picking little things you should really re-think your entire view. This was probably one of the hardest movies ever to remake and JJ Abrams did an awesome job. He had a lot to live up to, and a lot to follow up.....and he did it!!"
469,10,If u are A TRUE FAN u will love this....GRADE A,Cause i'm sick and tired of a few people who are bashing this movie and the prequels i want to clear that anyone who is a true fan and loves the star wars universe loves all 6 movies the same and now he loves also the new addition to the series.
470,7,Expected a lot more than a copy of episode IV done a lot worse...spoilers,"My review contains a lot of spoilers...I just saw Star Wars Episode VII and i wasn't happy with it at the end. Firstly I like all Star Wars movies. I prefer the Special Editions of the Original Trilogy and I like the Prequel Trilogy too but this movie feels like a copy of the original Star Wars. It gets too boring with a third Death Star. The villain for me is ridiculous with no credibility played by an unknown teenage actor. He looked too weak and everybody could beat him with a light saber. The marketing technique with the different races and sexes is so obvious in this that it is ridiculous and predictable. Make a woman Jedi and a black Jedi and an Asian pilot so that everywhere there will buy tickets and that nobody will say they are racists. No problem with that it is just too predictable and obvious it is funny. Secondly why did they bring Han Solo back just to kill him in this sudden and bad way? Why tell the same story for a third time with a death star? Why awaken the force except for money when episode VI was a perfect ending? It's just boring with nothing new. They can awaken the force, make an empire then make a republic with the sons of the sons of Anakin Skywalker's grandfather till eternity. And lastly, Snook was such a pathetic excuse for an emperor or whatever he is. Some ugly giant that looked like someone from Lord of the rings. The effects are good, the battles too but I really expected more especially when I saw the ratings of both the critics and the IMDb users. I will put this movie in the list of - a lot of special effects with no substance that to me doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie."
471,8,Very Strong Sequel,"As I said before, I am not a Star Wars fan but all of these films are very exciting and very entertaining. This one, Force Awakens, is a pretty strong and astonishing eye candy with plot to match and excellent actors' chemistry to binge watching and enjoy.<br /><br />I need not retell the plot but what I can say, this is a fine element of a bigger mosaic and as a definitive piece it holds well, showing that not only excellent CGI or great vision can create a stunning effect, but also a thoughtful idea, careful approach to depicting baddies, strong twists and very subtle grain of humor add a real lot of greatness and grandeur.<br /><br />Good movie with Daisy Ridley and Harrison Ford as well as Adam Driver shining great and not allowing te plot to slide into banality or sentimentality.<br /><br />I await a new episode and hope they will prove more."
472,6,I missed the Force.,"This movie is a well made ""sequel"". I agree with many comments on this site: this is not a sequel, but a - to much commercially inspired - remake. The visual effects are perfect, the music is excellent, the actors are doing a perfect job. But still... the real Star Wars spirit is missing so much. The storyline is unidimensional and simplistic, the emotions are rather flat... Maybe the story was to complete after episode VI, and maybe it's just not possible to continue to milk this cow in a sensible way. I feel a bit betrayed in my expectations. For Episodes VIII, IX, X, .... till IC, I will wait for the BR-disk to be available instead of going to the movie theater."
473,10,Coming Home,"Rey, a scavenger barely eking out a living, needs to go home. She will do what she can to support the resistance, but she needs to come back to her planet. Nothing remains there for her but a hope that something or someone will find her."
474,6,The Wizard of Mediocrity strikes again,"J.J. ""The Wizard of Mediocrity"" Abrams strikes again. This movie has lots of good qualities and good Star Wars feel to it, but in a typical Abrams fashion, good must be balanced with bad in order to create the most average end result possible. At least with episodes VIII and IX one can have positive expectations since Abrams won't, at least directly, be there to mess things up. One can only hope that him being a producer means he'll stay clear."
475,1,"Worst film yet in the series, Mindless.",**** warning this review may offend those who actually like it *****
476,,The force awakens and the audience goes Zzzzzz,"J J Abrams (with the blessing of Disney) has manages to reunite the band, but fails to awaken the force. His sence of pacing has the rushed feel of the television world, as if he thought he were making a one hour pilot. He has somehow managed to edit out almost the entire story leaving nothing but action scenes behind. Aquaintances and friendships are made between characters in such absurdly rushed fashion that it makes you yearn for the more zen pace of Lucas' writing."
477,8,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (Short Movie Review),Positives:<br /><br />
478,10,Very good movie and work...,The movie has a good and funny history and I like too much the return of the héroes like Han Solo and more.
479,10,It beats Empire!!!,"Being a long time fan of the original, prequel, and the EU I came into this movie expecting at movie that was sub par at best compared to the original trilogy but no. This film was far better than I could have anticipated! The almost spine chilling performance of Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn) is superb and can keep up with the original stars like Harrison ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (General Leia/ Princess Leia). The plot might have been a little sloppy at some moments when plot devices required it but the tension you feel in the movie is so moving. My feelings after the film have caused me to feel a mix of despair and love. Anyone who doesn't cry at least 3 times while watching this movie has no soul at all, that I can guarantee. This movie rocked me so hard that I had to sit at my local theater for 20 minutes afterwards so I could process all that happened and stop my hand from furiously shaking. EU plot points, great story elements, bone chilling acting are all part of your package deal my friends and I will be going back to see it another 3-5 times. I love this movie and it just barely beats ""Empire Strikes Back"". Thanks for reading if you found this helpful please like and go see the movie NOW!"
480,10,Superb,"Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid! "
481,6,Nostalgia personified,"Mixed feelings on this one. Again the hype machine set my expectations way too high. The trailers were brilliant. When I see trailers that good, my mind starts to imagine what to expect from the plot, I just cant help it. When the picture in my head matches what I see on the screen, I view that as predictable and relatively enjoyable (if made well), when on the other hand a movie exceeds my imagination, I hail that movie as something amazing. This ones a mixed bag, but fundamentally the story elements and characters are not very well written, rushed in some areas and overwritten in others, the balance is wrong if you pardon the pun. I just didn't care for the wonderfully directed action scenes and didn't emotionally connect with the main protagonists. The Star Wars universe is wonderfully created here and seeing Han,Leia etc on the big screen is a great tick in the box but therein lies the problem, it serves to be a tick in the box; the whole thing just feels a bit forced. George Lucus got a bashing for the prequels, but thats because he's not a great Director of actors, but he a great story writer - the prequels though badly executed, were actually good stories. Fortunately the force awakens doesn't suffer some of the cringe worthy moments present in the prequels but the story is one that you've seen before. Being cynical then this is just another franchise and as such is just a precursor or advertisement if you like for all the memorabilia that will be available for the kids to enjoy. Go see it but be sure to dumb down your expectations."
482,8,Good for what it is - Genre-Rating,"Let me start with one of the most important things first. I'm not a big Star Wars fan! I have seen the previous movies, but I would not consider myself as well familiar with all the easter eggs and story lines BUT this is why I represent the casual viewer and will answer the question if you can watch and even enjoy this movie, if you are not that deep into the topic, as a lot of other people."
483,6,yes !! and no!!!--- nostalgia-inconsistent,"entertaining, convoluted and inconsistent"
484,10,"it's true, all of it... i've fallen in love all over again","30 years ago the incredible Star Wars trilogy came to an end, many didn't expect the return of the characters we grew to love and cherish, but now they have returned and JJ Abrams has given us back a world which shaped so many childhoods and i could not be happier. This review will be completely spoiler-free, which will be hard with so much to cover, but i will not be revealing anything here which you didn't already know from trailers."
485,6,Very Much overrated,As an old fan of star wars this part wasn't as expected .. here are few things i didn't like:-
486,5,Yawn!,"As a true die hard original fan of the movies (17 when first movie was released), I walked out of the cinema somewhat bewildered and definitely disappointed with The Force Awakens. In fact, I was pretty much bored after the first 30 minutes. Kept asking myself, is there nothing original going to happen? It starts in the desert like episode IV, makes its way to the snow and ice like Empire Strikes Back, and ends up with a fight in the forest like Return of the Jedi! Again, kid grows up in the desert, this time 'steals' the rusting Millennium Falcon (sitting around for years but starts first time in the usual Falcon way) buzzes off to a planet, finds A light sabre in a box, works out how to use it in 5 minutes...please, come on!"
487,,Brilliant Special Effects and Nice Mix of the Old and New,Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) 
488,9,An Awakening,"Im not a particularly a big fan of the Star Wars franchise. For a long time I found the Revenge of the Sith the most enjoyable of the lot. A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story, tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia, the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one."
489,8,The Great Start to a Mixed Trilogy,"The Force Awakens successfully revived Star Wars for many people. It made it good again by capitalizing on things we enjoy from a Star Wars movie. The story is a little similar to A New Hope, however it still has many creative twists and leaves you on a cliffhanger that left fans restless. All the music, acting and effects are incredible. The Force Awakens will always be a top tier Star Wars movie."
490,8,The Force has Awoken in me.,"It's an awesome time to be alive when your life co-exists at a time when 'Star Wars' ruled the cinema screens. This is the film I was looking for. Being reunited with some old friends brought a nostalgic smile to my face as I returned to a time long ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It was simply coming home for this 'Star Wars' fanatic. Before I even thought about reviewing this latest installment, 'The Force Awakens', I had to see a viewing not once but twice. The first was out of pure excitement and after allowing my brain to process what I had just seen, I took a quick trip to the local cinema and relive the magic all over again."
491,9,There has been an awakening...,It is crucial that I don't spoil anything so I will stick to the general facts and the technical parts. The story you will have to find out on your own.
492,6,Nostalgic Payoff and Little More: The 5 Problems w/ The Force Awakens,"Episode VII is a very average, 2015ish type of movie. If it was taken to a lost tribe of humans who had never seen any prior Star Wars films, I am fairly confident it would be ranked alongside other contemporary movies that are short on story and long on action scenes--e.g., Transformers, Iron Man 2, and Pacific Rim. "
493,8,Star Wars wakes up the force awakens! With a mix of old and new characters!,The legendary epic saga continues as Star Wars returns with a new entry properly called The Force Awakens. Picking up three decades after Return of the Jedi even after the defeat of the Galactic empire a new threat is on the horizon as the darkness still is present in many forms. A young Sith lord has come to control much of the galaxy as that's the evil and mysterious Kylo Ren(Adam Driver in a strong performance)and the film would reveal a troubled family secret that's attached to Ren. And from the planet of Jakku a young lady named Rey(newcomer Daisy Ridley) a slave type scavenger who comes upon the scene to help the rebels once she exits her planet as this lady is a Jedi in the making. Finn(John Boyega is a storm trooper who takes a turn for the good to help fight evil in the galaxy. And in a real treat the return of old characters is abound with Han Solo and Princess Leia and the fury fuzzball who I say is Bigfoot's brother and that's Chewbacca all make a return! Overall it's a joy and thrill ride of space battles with ships and explosions and battles of good facing evil and the saga has mixed connections of characters new and old from the saga to strongly awaken the force and fly high thru the galaxy!
494,6,Nothing new under several suns,"Spoiler warning (of a kind) - this is a fairly spectacular film... And it offers a salutary lesson in the fact that, these days at least, we out here in audience-land are expecting far more than just that. To the best of my knowledge, my dictionary has separate entries under the terms ""pay homage"" and repeat"", yet the makers of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" don't seem to realise that, or at least they are very confused as regards what they want to achieve. A long time ago in a galaxy far away some rebellious types were attacking a lethal weapon being manned by some pretty fascist-type rotters, and here we are again doing the (self-) same thing again 38 years later. The plot would be predictable and nuance-free even for those who weren't around to fill cinema seats in 1977, but this is a copy even to the extent that the good-guy pilots enter that structural groove in the surface of the rotters' planet-cum-vessel, except that this time they do it very briefly and far less spectacularly than they did all that time ago! It's as if the makers felt embarrassed to really do this, but just could not help themselves. The real joys of the original ""Star Wars"" were 1) the ramshackle, Heath Robinson look of anything not in the hands of the bad guys, 2) the panoply of robots, machine-like creatures, creature-like machines and creatures and 3) the imagined planets, be they the deserty one, the frozen one, the jungle one and so on. Happily, all three of these features are present once again, but - although effects have obviously moved on - it is hard to say that the achievement is greater in 2016. Certainly the new ""weird creatures in the bar"" effort does not better the ""Cantina Band"" scene of old, which was also interesting musically. In turn, the dull and at times wearisome message of the original Star Wars - that new technology is bad, while old-fashioned mysterious powers are divine, and cobbled-together stuff is OK, has sadly not been diluted by the passing of the decades. And, while Max von Sydow has the clout to satisfy our unassuaged appetite for the late, great Alec Guinness, he has far too little to say or do in this movie (another mistaken piece of homage-paying). The new Vader-types are not a patch on the original, and the chief rotters do not have the power to charm and repel at one and the same time that Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin had back then, irrespective of how few lines he actually got to utter. Otherwise, the scenes from within the enemy's control room are the spitting image of those from 1977. And this brings us to the last suite of wrong assumptions made in this film. When the late and lamented Leonard Nimoy as Spock pulled down his hood and revealed his identity in a new Star Trek movie, we the audience mostly had a genuine lump in our throats, for ST inspires, not just some kind of a shallow teen crush, but genuine love and devoted affection. In contrast, when Luke Skywalker pulls back his hood in this movie, the underwhelming nature of the revelation is palpable, and made all the more so by the fact that the character cannot even bring himself to say anything! With the best will in the world, Mark Hamill was not a titan of the screen, nor Carrie Fisher, for that matter. So bringing them back so we can all say ""aaah"" does not work as effectively as the makers would like to hope. Harrison Ford's Han Solo was the sarcastic and unwilling one who went around scowling with a kind of walking fireside rug as a sidekick - and all of those things remain true, but Ford at least has a degree of magnetism that allows him to dominate certain scenes - and in a few ways the personality of his character HAS modified a bit. Our two new heroes who both get to ""feel the Force"" are actually interesting enough, and display a degree of chemistry, so all credit to Brits John Boyega and Daisy Ridley for giving us something new to deal with, and a modicum of interesting storyline given his change of heart and side and her reluctance to get involved overwhelmed by the need to do so. They are easy on the eye also, and many parts of the film are of course good to look at - at times even truly exquisite! But then, nobody ever (in 1977 or 2016) accused the Star Wars series of being short on clever design ideas. A hint of new plot would be nice, though."
495,10,Best film of the Star Wars saga,"I know the fans of the original trilogy may find this as blasphemy, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers. This films plot is somewhat reminiscent of A New Hope, but still the themes here are different. The plot here opens many doors for the sequels, and I cannot wait to see what the next films will do with these characters. J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. Oscars are going to lineup for this film. Its that good. Expect nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Visual effects and sound categories, but I am still being modest here. This film deserves every award it gets. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good."
496,7,Microwaved Goods,"The time has finally come, a new star wars film has arrived. A sequel to the original trilogy and hopefully an apology for the 3 prequels. Also now in the hands of Disney who have had the rights to star wars at the parks for years. Seemed like a good move and honestly I think it was a wise choice. I shuddered when I heard JJ Abrams was the chosen director. I find him over- rated and personally dummbed down star trek and ruined it completely for a new generation. However I was still excited and would give him the benefit of the doubt. So how does the new movie fair?.......well it basically has the exact same plot as A New Hope with old and new characters thrown into the mix. "
497,4,Such a wasted opportunity,"I just watched this with my daughter and have to agree entirely with DavidMezies' review. I am old enough to have watched all the Star Wars films on their release and I found this to be a dumbed-down, superficial, trite and clichéd travesty."
498,,I actually came to this movie the opposite of most people,"I watched a video on Vimeo that mocked and ridiculed this film so I borrowed the DVD from the library to see if it is that bad. It was completely true. This film is utter shambles. I cannot understand why the sequels are all universally bad and yet they keep making them. The question one supposes is why do people keep watching them. Do people have so much extra time on their hands? I am going back to my policy of not watching sequels. They are terrible.Compare this film to A New hope. The cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves. For instance, there is a guy who bought a darth vader mask at the toy store and he keeps forgetting he needs to be masked and takes it off. WOW"
499,10,A Great Return to Star Wars and a Fun Time,"Star Wars - Episode VII: The Force Awakens is an amazing legacy sequel and a great time throughout. All the characters are quite simply amazing, all having great and quick setups, and instantly likable. The First Order, though for all intents and purposes is just another Empire, is very intimidating and their designs from the ships to the outfits is amazing. The original characters aren't present much here, save for Han, but he feels just like himself. R2 and C-3P0 only have small little lines, Chewbacca's kind of pushed to the background, Leia feels very bland and unimportant, and the film revolves around trying to find Luke. Overall this film is just a great time with a fun plot."
500,9,PERFECT BLEND OF SOMETHING FRESH AND FAMILIAR.,"A perfect blend of something fresh and familiar, the nostalgia feels are there but aren't the focus, the new characters are so exciting, stunning visual, emotionally effective space adventure, also does a lot of great world and character building that might be even more fun than before."
501,9,Beginning of a new era with the foundation still intact,"Finally, the most anticipated movie of the 2015 is here! After gathering all the hype and hoopla around it over a year, Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't throw in any unpleasant surprises. Taking over from George Lucas, JJ Abrams makes sure he does not disappoint any Star Wars fans or cinema lovers in general. It is quite hard to make a sequel to the movie which had ended almost 30 years ago and especially when it comes to this era where most of the sequels are made just to mint money without a proper story, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens has quite a strong plot to build on. In fact with this movie, it looks like there are more to come."
502,10,"Nice plot, great effects, Loved it","First of all, I don't know why there are people really bashing this movie. It is actually very good. I am already a fan since 1977, when the first...or better said, the fourth episode was released. And now, 32 years after episode VI, there is finally the continuation...sort of. No more Empire. Now there is the New Order. The interesting thing is that the 32 years that passed since episode VI, is also the time that passed in the story. Leia and Han have a son who appears in the story. I won't tell who or what he is... You should see this for yourself. Unlike episode I where an idiot figure like Jar Jar Binks appeared, speaking a ridiculous English, there is a nice new robot, named BB- 8. In short, I loved the movie, the action, the effects, and let's not forget the awesome 3D. Definitely worth watching...more than once. :)"
503,7,Good - but lacks a little soul,"While this film is an improvement on some of the prequil movies such as Attack of the Clones, which were a disappointment, it lacks the soul and character the original 3 had."
504,8,The Force Awakens With Joy,"I am coming from a place of honesty, and for some reason people just hate on other's opinions. Growing up with Star Wars since I was little, the franchise has held a special place in my heart. And as I grew up, I recognized there are flaws in both the original trilogy and the prequels."
505,6,Starcrash,Possibly the most incompetent script ever written for a major motion picture sequel. It's completely wrong to call it a rip-off of Star Wars - it only steals the message-in-a-droid idea and then just goes into a morass of pointless coincidence and plotless sequences until they decide to blow up the Death Planet at which point the story much more closely resembles Return of the Jedi - right down to the father/son confrontation intercut with the fighter attack. The new characters are however quite lovable and they honestly deserved a better story. There are way too many unexplained introductions of icons from the original trilogy (Why is the Falcon there? How did she get Luke's lightsaber?) and it just seems like the filmmakers couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it all make sense and just gave up.
506,9,Action packed and entertaining,"I think The Force Awakens is a great film. It has good dialogue, interesting characters, and entertaining storytelling. This movie is very action packed, which is what I love about this movie. I think everyone should give this a try."
507,6,The Force Awakens played it safe.,"Now we have to be honest, if you bought a franchise for 4 billion dollars: would you be bold and risk the longevity of the story for one good motion picture, or would you stick to what works and lay the foundation of an everlasting franchise?"
508,1,An insult to a true fans - The Force Awakens is the remake of A New Hope!,"I hate bringing bad news to Star Wars fans, but this film is really terrible, It is A New Hope remake, It is boring, slow paced that I have almost fall a sleep. The movie copied and borrowed numerous things from original trilogy and ruined completely the previous six films. This REALLY WAS a remake of A New Hope. My jaw dropped (not in a good way) as to how much it rips off the first 3 films (to me, the ONLY ones). This movie has so much plot holes that it was just terrible. I am a fan of the original trilogy, not that prequels. I love A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back to death. I think they are the best movies ever made and a true classics, I like Return of the Jedi and I also like the prequels, I still can't believe how Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace are highly underrated."
509,,no words to describe,i don't know where to start but all i can say that this movie was amazing and i watched for many time like 6 times and more and my family was like what the hell u only watch it and repeat it many times..soo wht can i say..love star wars and its one of my favorite movies and hope they keep making this for the next level...and
510,10,This Made Star Wars Fun Again!,"The Force Awakens isn't perfect entertainment and we should all stop pretending Star Wars movies as a whole have to be flawless(The Prequel Trilogy also gets held up to that kind of scrutiny, as well as The Original Trilogy). They're not THE films by which ALL movies must be compared to; films like Sunset Boulevard or Citizen Kane are more suited for that purpose to compare movies to because they were benchmark films that set the stage for Hollywood movies then onward, even though they weren't films driven by special effects. Cinema is an evolving art form and it's bound to repeat some things. Is that really a bad thing especially when the film in question is only a 'soft-reboot' and not a shot-by-shot remake of the original? I say no: it isn't. The Force Awakens is a blockbuster that's derivative but progressive, familiar but fresh. It's not perfect but it's Star Wars through and through."
511,9,Respects the old and heralds in a new and exciting chapter in the Star Wars universe,Star Wars fans and fans of baggage free thrill ride blockbusters for all ages rejoice as not only is the Force Awakens the return to the galaxy far far away we've been waiting these many long years for this is a Star Wars film that just could well be the most unarguably well made of the entire beloved series.
512,10,Back to the Basics,"Being a fan of the original Star Wars films, and then having the franchise all but ruin it with I, II, and III, I had high expectations with this film. But with J.J. Abrams and Disney, they came in swinging, and hit a home run. The story line goes back to the basics of what made the original excellent! It had an ""old Star Wars"" feel from the beginning, and that was just perfect! We saw old friends, and met new ones. There were twists, moments revealed, moments of shock, moments of cheering. The writing was excellent and I thought they played the story out well enough to give you enough of a taste to fill your empty Star Wars stomach. At the end of the movie I wanted to jump up for joy - but as it was the entire audience cheered, and whooped, and fell in love with Star Wars all over again. Well done JJ Abrams and Disney....well done! I'll be seeing it again VERY soon."
513,8,Episode 7,Star Wars The Force Awakens. A fantastic Star Wars movie with new interesting characters and the old characters returning to pass on the torch to a new generation of heroes.
514,6,The Force Is Awake and I Wish It Was Still Asleep,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a perfectly average movie. It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. However, as a die-hard Star Wars fan I must say that I was a bit disappointed. "
515,8,A huge return,"Although I'm not a great fan, with time I really became obsessed about this universe, and that movie is one of the bests, they have all the references, the olds characters (more evolves) and new ones pretty well work, the visual effects is nostalgic and so much better also, the story is totally understandable, and you really will enjoy this adventure."
516,7,i feel like i should give it an 8 but i don't want to,"not flawless, but still very, very good."
517,10,Great Star Wars movie,"Great plot, great actors, everything is so amazing"
518,7,Very much enjoyed the movie,"Although sometimes I wonder if we're so attached to the series that we can overlook a lot of things. I think people who grew up with the series would rate most as at minimum ""Watchable"". Having said that, did not really like I and II very much but Force Awakens was great. I totally Love BB8, he (she?) is the best. Good acting and good plot line. Good combination of drama/SPX/action."
519,3,Disappointing,There's not much that I can add to all the other reviews. 
520,,The force awakens. The audience is put to sleep.,"""A New Hope"" had a very gentle fairytale-like segway ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."" that lulled the audience in. By contrast this film, which follows the original trilogy, feels very jarring and discordant with it. Wasn't the Empire defeated, after all? How did what must be a smaller force have the resources to build a much bigger, planet- sized death star? And why did it need to be bigger?"
521,8,Actually a gripping take on the STAR WAR Franchise!,"I don't want to sound much rude or biased but actually liked this one. It has all, everything a modern Sci-fi Action needs."
522,10,Star Wars is back!,The Star Wars that we know and love is back and better than ever.
523,10,This movie awakens that good ol' feeling,"Finally there is a new Star Wars movie. This movie is easy to sum up without spoiling it. It is a roller-coaster ride throughout the whole movie. And yes, there are (a lot) of elements that summon a déjà vu. But those elements made us fall in love with Star Wars in the first place and once again it made me fall in love with ""The Force Awakens"". I saw it yesterday in IMAX and I am still shaking. This is my first review because I owe it to JJ. I just want to let people know to go and watch this. And form your own opinion! Don't let negative people influence your judgment...Pessimism is a path to the dark side. Stay true and may the Force be with you."
524,8,"""This is not how I thought the day was gonna go.""","I've taken my time getting to this review, having seen the movie twice and allowing nearly three thousand other reviewers take their shot at the picture. I have mixed feelings about ""The Force Awakens"". As a stand alone movie I think it works well enough. It's got the CGI enhanced battle action down pat and the new characters add some fresh blood to the Star Wars universe which most of us expected. This is where I think I'll insert the 'but'....."
525,6,Nice but nothing new,"It's great seeing the old cast again, and they were embedded in the story in a way that makes sense. Visually stunning and without a clear fault, this still left a bland aftertaste. Why? Because too many things have been there before. A droid carrying the all important message and landing in the right hands? That rings a bell. A giant deathstar that needs to be destroyed? Well that only happened twice yet. I wonder how it can be destroyed. By landing on the deathstar and disabling the shields and then a really good fighter pilot flying into the deathstar and shooting a vital part of it you say? AW COME ON! Seriously. I don't regret watching the film. There are some good laughs, good characters, and stunning visuals. But Kylo Rens character doesn't make too much sense - yes we get he's a frustrated emo kid on the inside, but even with his frustration shining through when he's wearing the mask it seems like he's two completely different characters. The shiny stormtrooper captain was completely unnecessary, the only thing she did was surrender the deathstar right away. One must wonder if she didn't secretly work for the resistance."
526,9,I am speechless!,Going into this film I was hyped out of my mind. As I was driving towards the theater I had a hard time containing my excitement and from the opening scrolling text started till the end credits rolled I had goosebumps! It's safe to say I was thoroughly satisfied with the result.
527,6,Checks All the Boxes,"(spoilers) Director JJ Abrams steps into the Star Wars universe nicely unsurprisingly after how he transformed the new Star Trek movies into more Star-Wars-esque. He seems like a good fit. However the movie keeps so much in the original 77 movie that it is more like a quasi- remake than sequel. Abrams is so intent on checking all the boxes it seems he forgets to let the movie become his own creation. In his defense this is a monumental undertaking. There's no wonder he was reportedly hesitant and anxious to helm such a beloved series. The end result is nicely nostalgic, but at the same time kind of stale. There is too much ""coloring in the lines"" for this movie to be rated glowingly. Harrison Ford certainly lends mightily to the franchise, but this feels like a nice merry-go-round ride, something you loved as a kid, but is too tame and too familiar now. Give it a generous 6/10 and worth one viewing."
528,9,A Worthy Start to the Sequel Trilogy,"I know it's popular online to trash the Disney trilogy, and I agree with some of the hate that Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker gets, but this movie doesn't deserve any of the hate it gets, in my opinion. This movie was fantastic, if you ask me. It had some very good and likable characters, a nice story, and a very good villain in Kylo Ren. And I think this is movie fed off the original trilogy in the best and most enjoyable way possible."
529,6,How an untrained girl can defeat a trained warlord?,I put 6 because of the jokes pull in the movie otherwise it would be a 5.
530,1,What happened?,"As a die hard fan I had high hopes for the sequels, specially after the incredibly dumb prequels. J.J. did an amazing job reviving Star Trek saga. With Star Wars, he managed to sell a complete garbage. I wonder if the movie was ever edited."
531,,Repeat after me,JAR JAR.... ABRAMS!
532,10,Star Wars is Back,"I sat with anticipation, the likes of which I had not felt since the premiere of the Special Edition or Episode I when I was in Middle and High School. The marketing had worked its magic on me and transported me into the haze of nostalgia to prime me for, what I hoped would be, the second coming of Star Wars, delivering us from the wasteland of the prequels which we had been languishing within."
533,8,A story worthy of the original three films,"Finally, a film in the Star Wars saga that lives up to the standard set by the original three! Star Wars: The Force Awakens is basically a retelling of Episode IV. The story lines, the characters and their development, even specific scenes and moments parallel it throughout. "
534,9,The Abrams Awakens,"In 2005 I was in a massive, packed theater on opening day for ""Revenge of the Sith"", convinced it would be the final ""Star Wars"" movie. The mood was electric, the audience was buzzing with excitement and there were massive cheers and applause every time a new character appeared on screen. It was an incredible moment and one I was sure I'd never experience again."
535,8,We're home,Quickie Review:
536,6,Typical bland joyride - no depth,"I found myself really trying to like this movie...it was hard. Was it all bad? No, of course not. Most any bad movie has its virtues. "
537,8,Star Wars Done Right,"I thoroughly enjoyed Episode IV, loved Episode V, thought that Episode VI was enjoyable but too ""kiddy."" I consider episodes I, II, III worthy distractions at best. With the announcement of Episode VII a flicker of hope began to burn. Could JJ and Disney re-ignite what has been considered a world-wide cultural phenomena? Could new characters be introduced that engaged our hearts with emotion and excitement as Luke, Leia, Han, Chewy, Darth and the Droids did? I am writing this to tell you THE FIRE HAS BEEN RE-IGNITED! The Force Awakens has managed to re- kindle the fire of Star Wars. The new characters draw the viewer in and make you care about what happens to them (something Ep. 1-3 failed to do). The connection to the familiar old characters didn't feel forced and made it fun. I can't wait to see Episode VIII! I need to see it! I did not think I would feel that way about Star Wars again. V and V are still my favs, but VII has proved to be the awakening we've been looking for."
538,6,In many respects recalls the original Star Wars film.....,"The latest addition to the Star Wars stable of films, The Force Awakens, recalls the first film made way back in 1977. "
539,9,The Force is Strong With this One,This franchise does not need to be defended by anyone. It exists as a juggernaut of franchises and cannot and will not be stopped. The Force Awakens is a spectacular entry in the Star Wars franchise. I take issue with anyone who finds nothing in this entry to enjoy. 
540,7,Well made film but should have been done differently,The Galactic Republic is once more under a repressive regime of rulers using the dark side of the force.
541,1,Predictable very predictable,"I'll be nice and give this movie a ""2"" rating."
542,,You cannot stop change anymore than you can stop the suns from setting,"Since the arrival of J.J Abrams to the star wars saga, it was clear that some; if not a lot was going to change.This change has been much unapreciated in the IMDb community, spawning a great number of negative reviews, calling it a remake rather than a sequel, however; this is not the case: the shared plotpoints and familiar themes from the original star wars trilogy are there to appeal to old star wars fans seeking a renassaince in the star wars saga after the disappointment of the prequels."
543,10,The Force Has Awakened,"Two years ago, when I found out that Disney had bought Lucasfilm Studios and were making another Star Wars film, I was enthusiastic. Then when I heard that J. J. Abrams was directing this movie, director of Star Trek (2009), I couldn't wait to see how it would go. And then, when the trailers aired, I was crying from excitement."
544,9,Do it!,It's a heck of a ride! Loved how they keep the rhythm of the wow going when they keep introducing highlights. This movie has so much significance with regards to linking up from Return of the Jedi. This is easily one of the best from the original 9 movies. Perhaps my only dislike from the movie is how some pieces resemble episode 4.
545,8,All looks real and miles better than the Prequels,"It is good and I give it 8/10. I am no fan of J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies but this worked. It has some weak moments and one bad actor that you can never guess beforehand but contrary to my doubts, Daisy Ridley is good and it's miles miles better than the Prequel Trilogy, even Revenge of the Sith."
546,10,The Force has indeed (Re-)Awakened for Star Wars. The haters are liars.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'."
547,6,It will make billions! Not much more.,"Initially I wasn't going to write a review of Episode VII, but I've just seen a Duracell ad featuring light sabres and it was too much."
548,8,A safe return to the Saga,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a copy of A New Hope , using a similar plot and plot points of the original Star Wars film. This is hardly a new revelation: critics and fans made that point when it was first released. The plan was to make an entertaining if safe film to win back fans who displeased with the Prequel. The Force Awakens manages this with ease: it was a fun, popcorn film with excellent special effects and action sequences. When compared to J. J. Abrams' Star Wars work Rise of Skywalker, The Force Awakens actually had some build-up and invested in the characters."
549,6,Formulaic,"If you are not a die-hard Star Wars fan, you won't exactly be amazed with this new episode. A lot of stuff is really predictable and formulaic. It is OK as entertainment. Newer generations will probably get a kick from this, but not someone who liked the first trilogy and is expecting something new here."
550,10,"For me, this ticks all the boxes",I'm disappointed in the disappointment that surrounds this latest installment of the Star Wars franchise.
551,7,better on 2nd viewing,"Gave it a 2 after first viewing, but after a 2nd look I've changed my mind. i picked up on things I missed first time which has helped produce a more objective review. jj had to squeeze so much into this film to assist with the development of the next 2. he had to appeal to 2 sets of viewers - traditional fans whilst introducing new fans to the universe, a difficult balance, but think he just about did it. its exciting, it moves at pace and harrison ford and daisy ridley are excellent. "
552,5,I think I've seen this movie before...in 1977,****spoilers here******
553,,My prediction,None of these actors and actresses will find jobs in the future.
554,8,"The Force is back, but not with a bang.","I know, I know, Please don't kill me, although I see that some of you agree."
555,8,Best of the trilogyy,This movie had so much potential to open a great trilogy. Movie as it self is good but it's copying a bit too much New hope
556,8,Cheap Parody,"Well, where do I begin? Star Wars were great, then they started to die with each new episode. Then came this one abomination of desolation of our eyes and brains. What is wrong here - to omit all the mentioned already faults - absolutely wrong and unnecessary amount of silly jokes and vapid humor which leave much to be desired and ruins the solemnity of the film. Are we glad to see old Han Solo and Lea? Nay, they are as old as hills and simply drag by. Chewbacca? Same old geezer. Luke? One second. Not much to persuade us to like this sad, slow, long and unnecessary installment. Then the bad guy comes. Og my, who told him to utter his lines in this unimaginably awful flat bleak whining voice? Is he scary? Never a chance. He is merely a buffoon hidden in a mighty shadow of Lord Darth. And this new bad guy on a throne? Come on, give me a break. All said, we must admit that he sound is crisp, the camera work is serene, the editing is awesome. Well, this is all. Then you watch this and hate this."
557,10,Old and young Star Wars fans will enjoy this epic second revive of Star Wars!,"I just got back from the cinema. My gut tells me 10/10, of course! That was kind of obvious when feeling the hype that's been raining all over the internet these last few weeks. But where to begin, when I try to describe my emotions after watching it?"
558,6,JJ Abrams is the Puff Daddy of Film (Spoilers),"JJ Abrams is the Puff Daddy of films. He takes a concept that's been done, adds a little flare (literally), and gives you the Abrams mash-up of something you've seen before. I went into Episode VII expecting this based on his previous work. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, I'm barely a fan. Here's how he played it safe and why nostalgia fanatics are loving it: "
559,8,beautifully shot homage,"This is literally the most beautiful film in the series. The tight shots and cinematography leave the audience with iconic, wondrous, and haunting images that stay emblazoned in one's mind. Yes, the protagonist seems a little too perfect, some of the lines are heavy handed, and some exposition of new characters seemed wanting, but the movie delivers with fast-paced movement and taps into an uncanny feeling of nostalgia for something you've never seen before by showing respect for the original films while inverting characters in new ways."
560,6,"Hot water is discovered yet, IT IS REMAKE","I make it high 6 only because it is part of STAR WARS franchise. This movie is a remake of New Hope. There was girl (not Jedi) but daughter of Jedi, sand planet, Chewbaca, Solo, princess and new Darth Vader (very weird kind of Darth Vader because looks funny without helmet not scary as everybody expected. Emperor also have silly name Snoke. Like i bad comedy. Fight scene of girl and call it Darth Vader is catastrophe. One regular girl not Jedi girl almost defeated Darth Vader with lightsaber?? Isn't Darth Vader guy with force powers choke? throwing objects telepathic? Story is predictable and very similar with first STAR WARS. I am shocked with high 8 for this movie from film critics. People who wrote pro film critics don't know anymore how to watch movie??? This is worst movie of all Star Wars franchise. And new Rogue 1: a story of Star Wars is much better movie."
561,8,"Agile, cohesive, dramatic and definitely entertaining, Episode VII brings the franchise to a new generation, proving that the Force does not abandoned Star Wars","This seventh episode of the intergalactic saga arrives to expand the universe created so far, bringing new elements and taking advantage of everything that technological evolution can extract from this type of story, besides, of course, bringing the whole atmosphere of the initial trilogy back. to the most excited fans. Of course, the fan of the franchise would already be satisfied just to see familiar faces, like Han Solo, Leia, Chewie and many others, but he will be much happier to receive new characters to fall in love. It is especially exciting to see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fischer together again on the scene, so many years later, as Han Solo and Leah and to see how their relationship has been in the past few decades and their troubled relationship with their son and how it has affected them. Not to mention seeing Solo again aboard the Millenium Falcon, the most incredible old scrap in the galaxies. The introduction of the Millennium Falcon acts differently: it is the rescue of the tone of Episodes IV, V and VI, which would also work with the objective of introducing the figure of the mentor in The Awakening of the Force, an essential element for the Hero's Journey , that the feature film follows to the letter (too much). Fans will also be ecstatic to meet well-known spaceships and robots, such as C-3PO and R2-D2, but they will also be delighted with the new BB-8 which is a mix of R2-D2 and Wall-E in a most beautiful version."
562,6,"a decent movie, but weak story and nowhere near the hype","From a neutral perspective i would say its an OK movie. However the plot is mostly just a copy of Episode IV's plot. I didn't mind that the movie was a bit predictable, since the movie is still a Disney production - therefore also meant for children. But i did miss the force in all the fights - why not use it more, if you have it? "
563,1,Stupid.,"In short: dull, stupid, unimaginative. A huge disappointment for someone who has been a major Star Wars fan. A typical sequel rehashing old themes. The movie feels like a remake of the original 3 movies, borrowing here and there, but overall the effect is just boring. What the h**l was the studio thinking? "
564,,why ANH was better than TFA,Why Star Wars A New Hope was better than The Force Awakens.
565,9,Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens makes Star Wars fun again,"The opening crawl quickly catches the audience up on the new status quo. From the ashes of the Empire, The First Order has risen. The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa, is still putting up a fight. Both sides are looking for Luke Skywalker, who disappeared years ago. The Resistance has sent their best pilot, Poe Dameron to retrieve a clue to the Jedi's whereabouts. From there, the film introduces a couple of new characters: Finn, a stormtrooper that gains a conscience, and Rey, a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku who runs into a droid carrying an important secret."
566,9,Totally loved it,"I actually grew up with Star Wars, starting with the first one (IV) in high school. I had heard the Force Awakens has basically the same plot as IV, and thought I'd find it average. Turns out I loved it! I was amazed. The thing that gets you really involved in any fictional movie or TV show or book is the characters and the relationships among them, and that part was excellent. I had no idea Adam Driver is the bad guy, and was thrilled to see him when he took off his mask – he's such an unusual actor, and it looks like he's going to have a great career. What a leap, from Girls to Star Wars. Rey was quite good, and Finn I guess was the comic relief. Han did fine, and Chewy was just the same as 37 years ago – I guess that's easier when you're covered with fur. Leia (sp?) was okay but too low key – none of her old fire, and she didn't talk or sound like herself. The dialogue was very good, and often funny in just the same way the original Star Wars was funny. The droid was adorable."
567,8,Afterall this is my favourite star wars movie so far,"I just got home from seeing it. Definitely was a great movie, a great star wars movie. First thing I want to outline, which is not really spoilerific, that there were a few things from the trailers that did not make it to the final cut. Although J.J.'s lens flares did appear (obviously) quite a lot of times, the first thing to praise is the visuals, especially the intro's visual. Also later on, all the various settings were well cured. Surely the force was strong with the direction of this film. Next on, acting of the actors. That was great. Everyone just did the best he/she could, which was fantastic. Now the most important thing in a star wars movie, besides having stunning visual effects (Wich were just really the best in this film) is the story. Many ones hated the prequels for that, and praised the originals for having great stories. Episode VII has definitely both the best story and plot and the best backstory. The 30 years of period after VI got well covered, episode VII has a lot of great elements which expanded the galaxy really well. Definitely old EU fans will see a lot of new things they won't dislike. What homever bothers and bothered me was the music. It's john williams, you can hear it, but sound more like Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull's and harry potter's score. That's strange to be seen on a star wars film. So... overall this was a great film that earns my respect. J.J. Abrams won't be called Jar Jar Abrams"
568,8,Rise of a new war,"A new beginning and a new fight as after Vader's place is taken by Kylo Ren (son of Leia and Han) and a new supreme leader emerges. A new hope emerges in the name of Rey who through a series of unexpected events gets in touch with the resistance. On a similar note on the other side, Finn helps Poe escape and finishes his job of transmitting the information about Luke's location to the resistance.<br /><br />The story had little continuity from the earlier part and a new struggle has emerged as the First Order under Kylo has gained strength.<br /><br />The chemistry of Rey and Finn is also interesting. R2-D2 has become recessive after departure of Luke...a saddie moment.<br /><br />Poe's heroism as a brilliant pilot is worth watching. An emotional moment was the encounter of Han and Kylo wherein Kylo kills his father. Thereafter, the fight sequence of Kylo and Rey had nice action scenes. Overall, a good entertainer."
569,7,It didn't work for me really,"I guess I'm not an Abrams fan. There, I said it. I think he's almost ruined the Star Trek franchise. Sure, he's producing the action-filled and CGI-based sci-fi that young men 16 to 21 years of age want to see, but his work seems to lack originality, thoughtfulness, cleverness. I just don't find it that entertaining. He's good at fast-paced adventure, but that's not really what I want out of a movie."
570,10,Star Wars is back and you will love it!,"The original Star Wars (A New Hope) was a simple tale: that of a young boy growing up to become a hero and of a clash between good and evil. The prequel trilogy did not grasp this and that's why it failed. But this movie returns back to the simpler narrative of good vs evil we loved. Gone are the trade negotiations, discussions about taxes and laws, voting in the senate. We are back to the fairytale like world of the original trilogy."
571,6,Huge disappointment,"Positives: Han Solo and Leia are in it. Decent acting. Cool use of new saber. Negatives: A lot. Same rehashed story, Cameo appearances from R2D2 and Luke (who doesn't even speak) plot problems, Using teenage main characters, antagonist is a big baby wanna-be and not very menacing, no explanation of how things got to be where they are at."
572,9,The Force is strong with this one,"Welcome from Michael Lai's Magical Movie Reviews: ""Ahhhhhh!"" That's the sound you'll hear from the majority of Star Wars fans around the world breathing a huge sigh of relief. This is what Star Wars was meant to be, qualities not exhibited in Episodes I and II...characters you cared for, exciting action pieces not dominated by CGI, engaging plot twists and revelations plus a story that doesn't become bogged down with too much technical exposition. It's a combination of the old and the new with characters we remember and love from the original trilogy as well as new characters that have their chance to breathe a life of their own. We have the chance to reminisce with our beloved characters yet be intrigued by what will happen with the new characters. These characterizations ultimately drive the story with the action scenes helping deliver a spectacular and rewarding two hours plus of fun-filled entertainment."
573,6,Old story with new effects,"It starts well but it soon suffers from less creative dialogues, jokes at inappropriate moments or scenes that could be completely cut with no impact on the story. "
574,1,A shameless mashup of the old Films,"I liked both new Star Trek Films directed by J.J. Abrams. Playing with Wormholes, Parallel universe was always popular in the Trek-Universe, so why not. But after watching this shameless mashup of the first three Star Wars Films, especially 'A New Hope', everything shines in a new light. It seems this man is incapable of doing fresh, new films with creativity, imagination and so on, when he sit in the director's chair."
575,,"great for the fans, good for the others.","I just seen it in Brussels, right after work."
576,8,Delivered in every way,"I wanna start by saying that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan, even though I do enjoy some of the movies more than others. I believe the original trilogy to be a fine series of films and the prequels to be terrible at times but with some good things accomplished at times. Nonetheless, from everything I had seen from the previews for this film, I was definitely anticipating it a lot and I can definitely say that it was quite a birthday present watching this on opening day. The Force Awakens was entertaining, it set up new characters terrificly and brought back the beloved heroes of the first three movies in a respectable way."
577,10,The Star Wars Saga has Awakened!,"Wow! ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just became the Best Star Wars movie ever made since 38 years ago. George Lucas started from the very beginning, and now he's back, of going phase 3, for the new Star Wars movie, and somehow J.J. Abrams is involved with Episode VII. He did a brilliant job in Star Wars: Episode VII, I would have to say he should stick with directing, and producing Star Wars movies instead of Star Trek, I'm more of a Star Wars fan like everybody else who loves Star Wars. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas, great job and I hope you'll do a great job making Star Wars feel the force awaken again. May the force be with you. Always."
578,8,Chewie! We're home! Star War: the Force Awakens is a Force to be reckoned with!,"The 'Star Wars' film series is so engrained in our pop-culture, that even the rarest of movie fans have heard of it. There is no way in escaping from it! Several generations of people had gone through, at least one of the six films (1977-2005) in their lifetime. After all, the first 3 films (1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, 1980's Empire Strikes Back & 1983's Return of the Jedi) are often seen as the great examples what the ultimate cinema experience was meant to be. While, the chronologically recent 3 prequels releases (1999: Star Wars: Phantom Menace, 2002: Attack of the Clones & 2005: Revenge of the Sith) were somewhat mostly critically hatred. Can 2015's Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens fined a balance in the force? Can it live up to the hype and the high standard of movie goers, everywhere? The answer is a clear yes! Yes, it's better than the prequels, but no, it's not as good as the originals. What it is, however, is a promising start. The Force Awakens indeed awoken the long dormant Star Wars fan-boy in me. It's nearly a cinematic masterpiece with a few flaws. I wouldn't say, the movie is perfect. After all, The Force Awakens has the unenviable task of reintroducing audiences to a beloved cinematic universe isn't an easy task for anybody. Like the original 3 films, none of them were perfect. When you take off your nostalgia goggles, you will see the films for what they truly are, incredibly well-made, extremely fun, smarter-than-average blockbusters. Nothing more, nothing less, and after watching this film, you can put it in that level. I have to say that director JJ Abrams and his crew really did pull it off. With that said, the story is a mixed bag for me. It's a bit predictable. Set 32 years later, the events of Return of the Jedi, the galaxy's greatest hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has vanished. In his wake, a new threat arises, from the defeated Galactic Empire. Now call, The First Order; they attempts to rule the galaxy through power and fear. Only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them. Can they stop the threat, while also try to rediscover the true reason, why their galaxy's greatest hero, sudden exile from society? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, like JJ Abrams's last movie 2013's Star Trek: Into Darkness, the movie story is bit of a copy and paste rethread of familiar older films story beats with some differences in the way, in the, it's told. It can be a bit nagging with the 60 year timeline being call a myth, the movie being full of bad exposition spots, un-liking encounters with items and people, and it's lack of show don't tell moments, but for the most part, it does kinda work in establishing the connection from the new films to that of the old. They do somewhat work, together like emotional Han Solo (Harrison Ford) story arch. Make sure bring some tissue. Other moments, not so well. A good example is like how is there a Resistance movement, if the galaxy is once again, ruled by a Republic? Is the New Republic, some type of unseen villain that General Leia (Carrie Fisher) does not like? It doesn't make any lick of sense. The whole reason of conflict was a little awkward and a little unclear. One minute, they looking for maps for Luke, the next minute, it's about stopping a weapon from blowing up star systems. It's a bit flabby. Despite that, the original establishment cast were really great in their limited roles. It's really nice to see the characters back in the film, even the connection between them, wasn't well-established. However, I was disappointed by the lack of Luke Skywalker in the film. The new cast is just as good. Daisy Ridley as Rey, really was able to show the character's strong, capable, and courageous side, while also showing her weaknesses. She does match the role, very well. However, her character backstory wasn't really told, well. John Boyega's Finn was somewhat annoying, due to his mixed sense of morality, but for the most part, he works well in his means. For the most part, Adam Driver as the villain, Kylo Ren was alright, despite other critics might think of him. He show that he can easily be deeply conflicted, between doing what he feels is good and he feels he must do to keep the galaxy safe. From all of the new main characters, Poe Dameron is by far, the weakest. Oscar Isaac did well with the role, but I really didn't see much, character development within the film. In the supporting character side, I was somewhat disappointed with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) & Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) with their limited time and acting. These are just a few nagging bits and pieces to them that hopefully will be further fleshed out in future installments, but for now, they are mostly likable and despicable as they are meant to be. They work well off each other and with the old cast, and have a lot of promise for their future growth. The action is well-paced in the film. Never a dull moment. It looks more brutal and realistic, than the previous films. However, the CGI squid alien attack wasn't really needed. Despite that, most of the visual effects were really stand out. I like how the studio preference for using real locations and miniature models over green-screens and computer-generated imagery. The film is more aesthetically, because of that. It does work. The film's score is by John Williams is just as amazing and enduring. Overall: Regardless, what I say in this review, and what critics say about this movie; everybody should see the newest Star Wars film. So find the force within you and check it out for yourself!"
579,8,Amazing movie!,Newer SW movie is still very good and i love it. This movie is maybe little bit worse than previous ones but it's still good.
580,6,5 reasons why SW is disappointment,"I had big expectations for this move, partly because of so many positive reviews. Unfortunately it was not a case. And I left puzzled why so many reviews omitted obvious shortcomings of this film."
581,10,Yay,I saw it but my nieces and nephew were making so much noise that I couldn't concentrate
582,7,An Impressive Blockbuster Film...That Said,"I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of ""why did they do this?"" And ""why did they choose her."" And, ""Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch."" Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first ""Star Wars"" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest."
583,8,great start for a new trilogy,"The movie starts with the traditional scrolling marquee, narrating that First Order had risen in place of the Empire and Luke Skywalker is missing. Leia's best Resistance pilot meets Lor San Tekka to retrieve a map to Luke. The first Order lead by Kylo Ren storms through the planet Jakku to intercept him. They succeed, capturing the pilot and killing San Tekka. But the pilot put the map chip into his droid BB-8 which escaped. Meanwhile one of the Order's stormtrooper feels guilty of his actions. The droid find it's way to a scavenger. The guilty stormtrooper breaks the pilot free. The pilot introduces himself as Poe Dameron and he names the stormtrooper Finn. But their escape fighter gets shot down and they're separated as each survives the crash. Finn wears Poe's jacket and finds his way to the scavenger. They escape First Order pursuing the droid by stealing a ship, which happens to be the Millennium Falcon. "
584,7,Disney Star Wars. Good Enough.,Just got back from a pretty early showing in Manila. The real winner here was the production design and art direction which beautifully created an up to date version of the star wars universe whilst lovingly staying faithful to everything from the earliest movies. Together with the awesome special effects and locations the movie looked stunning. 
585,1,I want my money back,"After reading some of the reviews here, I am really glad I wasn't the only one extremely disappointed when seeing this so called ""movie"". I was SO excited to see this movie. The trailers got me hooked, it looked EPIC and after watching some of the red carpet event and reading the reviews saying things like ""JJ pulled it off"" and ""This is the best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back"", my expectations were even higher. But within minutes of watching it, I was devastated. Something just didn't feel right from the beginning. I kept thinking this has to be a joke, that I was in a parody of the movie I paid to see. This movie is NOT a Star Wars movie, this is a Disney movie made for kids. Everything felt SO rushed with no character development and full of plot holes. Most of my friends and family were extremely disappointed as well. I hope the next director can do better, although I doubt it because Disney holds the key and will not unlock it for anyone to do anything original. Disney killed The Avengers and now Star Wars. I will no longer support Disney in any way. I will just pretend that this movie never existed and watch the other movies instead."
586,,go away,Shoo. shoo. shoo. delete. remove. begone. eliminate. wipe clean
587,10,Best SW movie since ROTJ,"I have read a lot of the negative comments about TFA. Mainly I see comments like: too much like the original, not enough plot, etc. It also seems some have a problem with a female lead who is strong and powerful with the force. I go to the movies to be entertained and boy was I entertained. J.J. Abrams has brought SW back to what it was originally...action packed, character based, energetic fun. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver are absolutely fabulous as new characters and I look forward to seeing them develop in the next 2 films. There are many unanswered questions as the curtain closes on this Episode. I eagerly await the answers."
588,9,Good stuff,Ignore all the sad little fanboys on here. A fun film. Lots of drama lots of action. Currently imdb rated as an 8 which given all the dubious low scores is outstanding. Sit back crank up the volume and enjoy.
589,10,Took me right back to when I first saw a new hope as a kid thank you JJ Abrams,Finally saw the force awakens and it was brilliant from music to great action set pieces Abrams has really captured the kid inside us all who grew up watching the originals he was really able to give his vision of how it should be and in all honesty he has taken the SW universe to places Lucas never could no disrespect intended to Lucas. I will say that all performances were great Ford and Fisher included and there was a great sense of humour in this which was a lovely surprise I think Adam Driver did a stand out job as Kylo Ren he brought a great sense of fear and horror to his character.
590,8,Finally...the Force awakens!,"Acclaimed J.J. Abrams directs and co-writes this STAR WARS installment. I remember watching the original with my best friend in 1977 and agreed this is a spectacle. What a hallowed franchise it has become. Although not being a faithful follower, my perspective of THE FORCE AWAKENS probably will leave a lot to be desired."
591,6,Meh.,"As I watched this, I was getting bored. Even some of the big action sequences didn't catch me. When I had left I realised why, I had seen it all before in the other installments. It didn't seem like there was anything new about The Force Awakens at all. "
592,10,Old fashioned good vs. evil,"I wrote a review for the prequels saying that maybe George Lucas made a mistake using current world affairs as a means to tell how Star Wars came to be; trade negotiations, the war on terrorism, and the rise of imperialism in the government. But they were his mistakes to make in his legacy. But I accepted the prequels. I grew up with Star Wars. In fact, my family still has the home video recordings from when the originals aired on HBO in the 80's and I'm standing by those instead of the 2000 upgrades. As for TFA, I'm standing by it because I believe J.J. Abrams has gone back to the roots of Star Wars: good vs. evil. Before I went to see it, I asked my brother one question, 'Is there a preview scene after the credits?' I didn't want any spoilers or hints and he didn't have anything bad to say about it either."
593,7,Not as great as I hoped,"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars universe, and like many had very high expectation when looking forward to going to the cinema to view the latest instalment."
594,10,Out of this world!!!,"First and foremost: I would like for you to read my review of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""; but remember I don't like to leave my hand solo without writing puns in movie reviews. For those two or three humanoids who still have not seen ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", I promise not to play the part of Darth Spoiler in my review of this riveting installment of what is probably the most popular movie franchise of all time. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is set around 40 years after ""The Return of the Jedi"". Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance. Director J.J. Abrams definitely was not spaced out with his orchestration of the movie, as he brilliantly incorporates the vintage Star Wars elements, with an invigorated new narrative. It involves a fugitive stormtrooper named Finn, who wants to put a fin to his trooper-served time; I guess he wasn't a real stormtrooper. And a pretty scavenger named Rey, who is really the reigning character of the movie; let's just say Rey's role is as pivotal as it comes in a Star Wars flick. Now for the Old School of Star Wars; yes there are sightings of classic Star Wars characters and several are imperative in the film's narrative, But I will not be the only-one can-open the secrets of their roles in this installment; I will say that young actors Daisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn conducted forceful performances; the pressure was on and they delivered. Now to the dark side, which would come in the form of the primary villain here- Kylo Ren portrayed with edgy fierce by Adam Driver. Yea, he bad, yea, he loves the Darth. Come on, it's the dark side, what you expect! A few other laser points before I depart the Pun Star: Harrison Ford is back with his exceptionally clever badass wit with his work as Mr. Solo, and Carrie Fisher was gently effective as the former Princess now General Leia. And then there is that Luke dude.... So anyways, may the puns be with you; and yea, don't forget to watch this little space flick, if you haven't already. ***** Excellent"
595,6,Safe As Possible J.J. Abrams.,"We all knew going into the new Star Wars film that J.J. Abrams feared ruining the original story about as much as 'The New Order' feared 'The Resistance' locating Luke Skywalker before they do - so, what's the best way to come out looking like the lone hero? By being J..J Abrams, that's how. The play-it-by-the-book guy he's always been. A guy capable of making a good film, but, so far, not having the guts to do what has to be done to make that great film most directors dream about."
596,4,Underwhelming,"First of, the good. The universe is very true to what we've appreciated in the mention-worthy movies of the series. It's convincing and authentic. The atmosphere is spot on."
597,,Really just a 2nd rate plodding reboot,"The original Star Wars trilogy didn't amaze on plot lines, didn't amaze on dialogue, didn't amaze on ideas. But they did have genuine on screen chemistry and a sense of wide eyed wonder provided by the directors and actors. Even with the prequel trilogy the directing and acting at least felt connected (although too often infantilized) to the original trilogy. And the stories showed they were made by people familiar with the original trilogy."
598,8,The Force is calling to you...let it in.,"I have to start this review by saying that in my opinion nothing will ever top the original Star Wars trilogy. Ever. I loved those movies as a kid, I love them even more today, and I will insist on being buried with at least one item of Star Wars memorabilia. I will be referencing those movies throughout the review so I shall shorten it to the O3 for the remainder of the review."
599,8,"It's Been 30 Years Since ROTJ, Could There Be Hope For The Rebellion Against The New Order.","I see a lot of negative reviews about this movie; some say why did they even bother, the Empire was defeated. Well, like in every battle a new power will take it's place. In fact, true Star Wars fans were screaming sequels since the end of Return of the Jedi. Then the not so hot prequels come out, and almost destroy the saga. If you didn't find anything positive about The Force Awakens; then your mind was made up before the movie started. This is the first sequel since Disney took over the saga. The Force Awakens brings new cast members in such as Daisy<br /><br />Ridley( Rey), Adam Driver( Ren), Oscar Issacs( Poe) and John Boydega( Finn). These new characters, mix with so of the original cast of Star Wars, Harrison Ford( Han), Mark Hamill( Luke), Carrie Fisher ( Leia) and Anthony Daniels (3P0)/ Kenny Baker(R2)."
600,9,"A full scale, all action epic that brings the franchise back to life",STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 
601,8,Movie Review By MsClashKing YT,"The Force Awakens is an Amazing film . It does nearly everything right , the characters are likable , the action is great and the story and music are just great like usual . 9.5/10 A+"
602,6,"Uninspired, Unoriginal.","Almost every elements looks so familiar to A New Hope. Too familiar. Everything is just the same. This movie is a cash-grab type of movie. JJ abrams, I hate you."
603,8,"Great film, but... (read only when you've seen the movie!)",The greatest thing The Force Awakens did for me was that it made me feel like that little kid again. I was transported back to 1977 when I sat with my older sister in a movie theater in Amsterdam and was watching the first Star Wars film. What an amazing experience!
604,6,I am no longer a child.,"That is the conclusion I came up with by the end of this new Star Wars. Long gone are the years, when as a kid, I went with my Mum and my sister to watch the Return of the Jedi. I was at the time intrigued by the Force, the Millennium falcon, Han Solo, and of course Darth Vader. But of all this, very little remains. Darth Vader well and truly gone, Han Solo is too old, the force has become weak and the Millennium Falcon is more than ever a piece of junk. "
605,10,This is the Star Wars movie you were looking for !,"Not to many spoilers here but man this is a Star Wars movie of epic proportions & it was awesome to say the least , the new big 3 are great Rey & Finn work brilliantly together , the old big 3 are at their best although Luke Skywalker is only in it very briefly at the end but looks fantastic look out for him to take a major role in episode 8 . Kylo Ren makes Vader look tame he is evil to the core but also a great villain who is very powerful with the dark side & is very good with his sword . You certainly won't be disappointed with this Star Wars movie's it's right up their with Empire Strikes back as one of the best Star Wars movies ever made or better than any movie ever made period ."
606,6,"Buried underneath the melodramatic fan reactions, there's a good movie here","My Disney cynicism runs pretty deep - but not unfounded, what with the Mouse's recent announcements of killing Slave Leia merch and banning blasters from their theme parks (hello? It's Star Wars!) - so you can imagine my level of anticipation for ""The Force Awakens"" wasn't all that great."
607,3,They made it a Harry Potter episode. Hahahaha,Oh My God !
608,,Do not see in IMAX 3D,"I made an IMDb account just to say this: Even if you like 3D movies, do not see _The Force Awakens_ in 3D. This movie was not shot with 3D cameras. Not even the special effects shots were rendered in actual stereoscopic 3D. The whole thing is converted, and it's terrible. Characters often have the appearance of living cardboard cutouts. Sense of scale is horribly, horribly messed up. For example, we see a huge ship and part of it is made to look closer even though it is so far away that you shouldn't be able to see that effect (like how in real life, when you look at clouds near the horizon, they don't appear to have depth). Similarly with planets and other stuff. Instead of just looking natural, like movies shot or computer-rendered in 3D, the 3D is a distracting layer on top of what the cinematographer intended, drawing attention to whatever the people who did the conversion decided to push out or pull in from the screen. Combined with the usual drawbacks of the 3D technology (glasses darken the image and seem to ""box in"" the screen, etc.), it really got on my nerves, affecting my experience much more than I expected."
609,9,I enjoyed this film,"A Stars wars kid who grew up watching the films would, but please do not let the director touch another Star Wars film or offspring move like ""Rouge One"" or ""Solo"""
610,10,The force definitely strong with this one,I will warn you all now that I am a little bit biased when it comes to Star Wars. But not even I can fully defend the prequel trilogy. There were some good moments in and acting them (McGregor for one). But they were in essence just about trying to tell us what we already knew i.e. that Darth Vader was going to the dark side. Not much more was gained than that unfortunately.
611,8,Strong the force with the new cast is,"Daisy earns 10/10 for her intense play. The scenes on her home planet are the best and on par with the ones in 'Hope' as well as Williams' absolutely beautiful 'Scavenger' theme. Finn is a great character and Boyega the perfect actor for it. I like also Drivers subtle performance, he's great as (already very dangerous but still unsure) Vader wannabe. Poe is also a great character and the actor plays the pilot the way I know this optimistic tough guys in reality. the bad guy general as usual in SW has not enough room in the movie to be exposed in depth but is also great play. Snoke was somewhat disappointing but OK."
612,9,Amazing film! Lived up to the hype!,"Star Wars the force awakens is probably the most anticipated film of all time. And it was amazing! A lot of people criticize the force awakens for being a retread of a new hope. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film all Star Wars movies are similar to each other. The new characters in this film are great. And I loved the return of Han, Leia, and Luke. Even though Luke was there for only 10 seconds. The movie also had a cool villain, Kylo Ren. He's a conflicted villain with an awesome character arc. The scene where he kills Han Solo was pretty emotional too. So the force awakens is a great film and it revived the franchise."
613,6,"A long time ago in a Politically Correct galaxy far, far away ...","I won't get bogged down discussing the blatant political correctness of ""The Force Awakens"" (God forbid I offend someone) and it is not really necessary to point out the obvious, but what I will say on the get-go here is that I was suckered in to the irresistible nostalgic buzz that the film offered upon it's release in 2015. Like many people, ""Star Wars"" was my childhood. So I needed a more neutral viewing some years later to really give this film the once-over. In a nutshell, I've come to the conclusion that ""The Force Awakens"" is a poor film but with a nostalgic vibe that carries it along and makes it seem to be a far better film than it really is. Nonetheless, I give it a decent rating, purely for Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. The film is shamelessly a scene-by-scene remake of ""A New Hope""; Luke Skywalker is now a young woman and Darth Vader is Kylo Ren. And the Death Star even has a replacement. The Empire is now The New Order... I could go on, but at the risk of giving this a lower rating. Overall, this is purely one for the die-hard fans that needed the nostalgic lift a years ago. But now, and in future, I believe it will be completely forgotten about and relegated to being the lesser of the franchise, even worse than ""Attack of the Clones""."
614,8,Star Wars Awakens,"After thinking about the films for several hours after seeing it, and being initially disappointed. I can say that Star Wars the Force Awakens is well crafted film that captures the spirit of the original trilogy very well. The new cast members all perform well and create a new set of heroes and villains. Older cast members are also great especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Daisy Ridley as Rey. The film moves along at pace, similar to the first Star Wars film and is essentially a chase movie for the first hour of its run time. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is an interesting villain, which has conflicting issues to deal with, and is quite a nut case that has hissy fits. My main gripe with the film is the plot line of the Starkiller base, being too similar to the death star of the original trilogy. There was really no need for this plot line, just having Kylo Ren looking for Luke Skywalker was enough. Also would the rebellion not of known about the creation of such a base well before its construction? I also feel that Luke Skywalker would not abandon His truest friends, I do understand there is a lot gone on since Return of the Jedi that could of driven a wedge between their friendships. Luke however would of sensed what was going on with signals in the force and surely of helped, I feel his appearance was purely to set up the next film. Although the resistance claims victory it feels like a subdued win because of events of the attack on the Star killer base. The action is well filmed and the lightsaber battles are raw and feel dangerous. Overall this is a good film and a return to the film making beats of the original trilogy. It had unachievable hype to live up too, but the mix of old and new bond well, it is exciting to see what happens next in the Star Wars Saga...."
615,6,"""You were supposed to be the chosen one!""","New Star Wars movie has a lot of good in it. The story itself is pretty good, it had the vibes of the original ones and you'll love everything you loved in the previous films. Droids are still cool, spaceships are even cooler and Han Solo was still that Han Solo we loved in original series."
616,8,NO SPOILERS - Has rendered the prequels even more pointless than they first were....,"...., mainly because there are distinct references to relevant back stories in this film, tying certain characters together, concerning the 30 years since all events in the last movies, as there was in the original 3 movies, in relation to Darth Vader on that occasion. In order to tell these new stories fully they would have to sandwich movies in the middle of Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens, but of course they don't need to do that, allowing our own imagination to fill in the gaps, in much the same way fans, casual or otherwise, did upon first watching the original trilogy way back when, as indeed this movie does too. So, I would like to suggest that the prequels are now redundant. Having just watched the original trilogy, without all the extra gumph George Lucas tacked on to it for DVD and Bluray, seeing it in all it's VHS glory, the Force Awakens feels as though it really does belong to the original narrative, and works very well as a story occurring 30 years later. Much of that is attributed to the way this movie was filmed, using a lot of practical effects, as opposed relying entirely on CGI. There was something, I won't say what that 'something' was, that really did disappoint me, leaving me quite shocked, however in retrospect, later, I was able to appreciate all other aspects of the movie, character development, story progression, etc, and began to question if I really needed what I thought I was going to, and wanted to see."
617,7,Good but not better than 1977,"I got a thrill from the Star Wars opening theme. But as the movie continued it seemed like more than the opening was similar to the 1977 original. You would think trained storm troopers would not be so scatter-shot, however one of the main characters actually got hit!! Alas, it was a mere flesh wound. Don't you think you or I could hit something - anything - with a blaster? Oh well, a space opera needs it's heroes. The villain of the movie would have been more menacing had he kept the mask on until the death scene. Young love is expected in movies like this - old love is pathetic. Good thing they don't dwell on that too much. Nice to see all the originals again. I was sorry to see the ex trooper healing in bed - he was awkward in his role. Not as bad as Jar Jar Binks, but had a Wesley Crusher feel. Given his prior job on a death star that big he would have no chance at all to have the knowledge he imparted. Better to give him a hero's death. Senator, he's no Hans Solo. The new women lead was very very good. Better than a young Luke."
618,4,Disappointing: repetitive and shallow,"Having seen the original Star wars movies in theatres as an adult I am always cautious of sequels or prequels, which, statistically rarely live up to expectations. I do keep an open mind because there are exceptions, so I went into the Force Awakens with no preconceptions. So I was at first happy to see many of the features from the earlier films: the rolling yellow credits to the familiar spacecraft and actors. But it soon became clear JJ Abrams was going to play it safe by choosing all the 'choice bits' from the early movies and recycling them in a mechanical or predictable way."
619,,Unoriginal Soft Reboot,"The Force Awakens is about as original as Jurassic World. The characters, worlds, and plot are ripoffs of the original Star Wars. The only difference is that the writing is worse. Whereas in A New Hope Han talks down to Luke (""Who's gonna fly it, kid? You?""), in The Force Awakens Rey one-ups Han at fixing his own ship. When a new character one-ups a legacy character, it is a sign of poor writing.<br /><br />Rey is an expert pilot who speaks every language, uses the Force without training, and wins a duel the first time she picks up a lightsaber. Her character is a cardboard cutout without any weaknesses or growth."
620,10,"A tribute to the Original Trilogy, while also catering to the new generation.","Star Wars: The Force Awakens continues with the Star Wars saga created by George Lucas. This movie takes place 32 years after Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi(1983). After the fall of the Galactic Empire, a new threat emerges, calling themselves The First Order. The First Order is led by the villainous, Kylo Ren(Adam Driver). Now, it is up to a couple of unlikely people like, Rey(Daisy Ridley) & Finn(John Boyega), along with the help of Han Solo(Harrison Ford), Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) & the Resistance to put an end to The First Order & their diabolical plans for the entire galaxy. "
621,10,Star Wars is back,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford, and Domhnall Gleeson. First off, I won't say much about the plot because in the marketing you don't know much about, all for the good reason. It's mostly about Rey( Daisy Ridley) who's a scavenger meets up with a renegade stromtrooper( John Boyega) and from there, it's an adventure. Now the acting was a little worried because Daisy Ridley and John Boyega haven't done any big movies but I have to say they were both fantastic. John Boyage was great but Daisy Ridley stole the whole movie. Harrison Ford was amazing. He wasn't just doing the movie, he was Han Solo. Adam Driver played Kylo Ren amazing, one of the best villains in Star Wars universe yet. The action scenes were great too. The lightsaber fights seemed real and it emotion to them. Now some negatives that people might have with The Force Awakens is that it repeats a lot that happened in the first Star Wars( A new hope) but to me it didn't bother me, sometimes it stands out but I didn't care, everything was amazing it truly felt like a Star Wars movie. Overall Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a fantastic movie, had that emotion like the original Trilogy had and brought new things into. The acting, action, visuals, everything was done so well. Great job J.J. Abrams"
622,9,A Good Sequel After EP6,"After reading many reviews here, I finally stepped into a IMAX 3D theater to see it for myself. My rating speaks for itself about my verdict. It is a good sequel if you have seen all the other episodes with the storyline in mind. "
623,9,The Force Is Stronger Than Ever!,"The most awaited film of the recent times, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens finally arrived in India today! Being a fan-boy, I treated myself a ticket to celebrate my Xmas inside the cinema. And luckily & expectedly, the seventh installment in the main Star Wars film series, packs a solid punch!"
624,7,We Deserved Better,This hit all my nostalgia buttons...every single one of them...BUT
625,10,The Force is ALIVE!!!,"It took me a long time to write reviews again, which is fair, because I have been going through a bit of a block lately. Since it's the first day of a new year, I guess it's fair that the first review I write of this year is last year's (actually, it came out three weeks ago) biggest hit. To be honest, I didn't expect ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to crawl deep inside my brain and bring me back into the world of space that I remembered when I was a kid. Mainly, because I lost touch of it for a while. I wasn't born in 1977, but I remember seeing two of the three original ""Star Wars"" movies with my dad when it was re- released in 1997. Now after re-watching all 6 episodes of the Star Wars saga after seeing ""Force"", I realized that this was a world (or worlds) I couldn't leave behind. So, what's new this time? Well, Disney took over Lucasfilm, George Lucas is still retired, and it looks like the beginning of the new trilogy can definitely return to the flavor of the much-loved original trilogy (the prequel trilogy still remains quite divisive among fans). Now taken over by J.J. Abrams (director of ""Star Trek"" and its following sequel), ""The Force Awakens"" is a wonderful, exhilarating, funny, triumphant, sometimes tragic and beautifully imaginative adventure that reminded me and a lot of people who have already seen it how much we've loved and missed ""Star Wars"". We cheer for the heroes, hiss at the bad and we feel for the ones that are in-between. Plus, we get to experience worlds that Lucas and company has created 39 years ago and it still remains as vibrant and colorful and thrilling as ever. Whether you missed out or live in a cave (I don't think you're one of those people, because you've already seen the movie more than once), let me try to explain a bit of the plot without spoiling it. Set three decades after the events of ""Return of the Jedi"", a fellow Jedi that we all know and love has disappeared and the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is hell-bent on finding him and getting rid of him. Meanwhile, we get to meet some impressive new characters. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger from Jakku who has been for looking for her family ever since she was a little girl. Finn (John Boyega from ""Attack the Block"") is a Stormtrooper who has been ripped from his family and has been sent to kill but manages to turn the other corner, as it is. Finally, there's Poe (Oscar Isaac from ""Ex Machina"" and ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") who's a pilot. Oh, wait, there's also a new droid on the scene. Its name is BB-8, who is quite friendly and helpful in every way. Joined together quite late in the process, they team up with returning characters Han Solo (Harrison Ford), General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and, of course, our favorite Wookie, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) in order the find the missing Jedi and to take down the First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Our mo-cap superstar Andy Serkis), Ren and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, also from ""Ex Machina""). I was ever so reluctant to see another episode of ""Star Wars"", but after seeing it, it renewed my interest in the world of both filmmaking and ""Star Wars"". It looks as if Abrams has accomplished what Lucas did in the past, recreating the magic as if it still existed. Characters, galaxies, secrets, epic battles and plentiful twists and turns that never diminished of what Lucas had envisioned before. The only glue that remains as a big piece of the puzzle is the always unforgettable score done by John Williams. With the iconic opening theme and a few additional themes added in there as well, Williams once again creates another bit of lightning in a bottle. Nothing moved me more as I got to see Solo and Leia together again, as well as our original droids, C-3PO and R2D2. (Mark Hamill is also in here as well, but I can't reveal where he's at.) Plus the new characters are brilliantly cast. Newcomer Daisy Ridley is a star I definitely should keep my eye on. I even liked her chemistry with John Boyega, who is both heartfelt and humorous at certain turns. We don't get to see much of Poe in the movie, but Oscar Isaac brings a warm and dashing impression. But the standouts are definitely Adam Driver who brings a lot of terror and emotional depth as Kylo Ren and (obviously) Harrison Ford as Solo. This character that we loved for so long is charming, energetic and ruggedly laid-back as ever and Ford continues to make that character totally rewarding. This is a movie event I will never forget (next to ""Jurassic World"", it's easy not to overlook this). All I can say is this: I can't wait to see what Rian Johnson (director of ""Looper"" and ""Brick"") and Colin Trevorrow (director of ""Jurassic World"") can do with Episodes 8 (coming 2017) & 9 (coming 2019), because this is a fantastic saga that shouldn't be forgotten. The ""Star Wars"" saga still remains a amazing group of films that if you watch from the very beginning (I always start with Episodes I-III then Episodes IV-VI), you can see that the story still connects one way or another. I certainly hope to see this movie again. Probably because I want to pick up on some of the hidden secrets that are hinted at. Also, I want to be overwhelmed by the amazing visuals, memorable characters and incredible worlds. Another ingredient to add into this is that the Force has been passed down from one generation to another. With ""The Force Awakens"", it just shows that the force is definitely with us, forever and always. And I'm glad that I got to be a part of it again."
626,6,How is this movie in the top 250?,"First of all, I am a Star Wars fan, but not a rabid, wait in line for a few days to buy tickets, kind of fan. That being said, the movie just wasn't that good."
627,8,A triumphant return for a saga that's lost none of its magic,"If you ever thought that the magic of Star Wars was lost, then think again, because The Force Awakens marks a triumphant return for the series. Filled to the brim with some of the most spectacular action of the series, fascinating new characters, brilliant dialogue and stunning visuals, this is pretty much as enjoyable as Star Wars can get."
628,6,"After my second viewing, the flaws become much more apparent... Great characters but not enough plot or development.","First of all, I have to say like mostly everyone I loved the new characters especially Rey and Finn. I think they'll be a great addition to the SW universe and I'm looking forward to where future films take them. After the first time I watched this movie on opening night, I was ecstatic. I left the theater with a huge grin on my face because I knew that JJ Abrams made a movie that was better than any of the Lucas-directed prequels. Unfortunately after seeing it a second time, I noticed the flaws A LOT more because now I could focus more on the plot and pick up on anything I may have missed the first time. "
629,1,finally FANsmoney defrauded have DESTROYED STARWARS.,"A MOVIE SO STUPID BASED ON STUPIDITY. ""For idiots only"": should have been the advertisement. ""We WANT ONLY YOUR MONEY thanks to your stupidity"" Greedy makes people idiots... so Lucas began to ruin Star wars since the Return of the Jedi with little furry puppets able to face imperial army by arrows and spears. Then Lucas followed with a little child able to destroy a whole separatist frigate with a never managed tiny fighter and a simple shot (note that the ""heroes"" are always invulnerable and luckiest despite of enemies described always as imbeciles). All made to make easy money by marketing which takes advantage from emotional suggestions to sell stupid illusions considering viewer as IDIOTS. Finally Abrams arrived completing the dark plane of the Sith lord: the complete destruction of Star Wars icon so to make easy money selling a fascinating charming absolutely VOID to the dummies."
630,,oh so bad rehash of original-had to be a money grab by George,George Lucas has gotten old and run out of fresh ideas. Anyone who saw the first Star Wars will be watching a very poor facsimile. For those who haven't seen the first Star Wars you'll be watching a very poor facsimile.
631,8,More Than You'd Expect To Set Up Episode 8,I have been reading some reviews of this movie by a lot of folks who will get egg on their face when the next one comes out. There are a lot of plot parallels in this film including another son killing his father (which is a spoiler if you know who I am referring too). I have to laugh at people who are trying to critique George Lucas original ideas in this episodes plot. 
632,10,Loved it! The Star Wars we needed!,"This movie is the Star Wars sequel we needed! Perfect sequel of where the old movies ended. A new generation, a new threat, a new adventure!"
633,8,An Amazing Movie that will inspire the next generation,The Force Awakens is better than all of the prequel trilogy movies. It has a lot of scenes that are similar to A New Hope. That doesn't effect the movie in a negative manner but boosts the audiences interest in it. The characters are amazing and the reveals are brilliant. They make X wing pilots cool and bring a whole new take on the story that does a great job at continuing the story from the original trilogy. I felt a lot of emotion watching this and am glad that a new generation will be introduced to Star Wars in such an amazing way. 
634,9,Slumber Earthquake.,"There really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con. "
635,6,Retread from the original 1977 Film,"I should probably say this now, I've never been a Star Wars fan. I like certain aspects of the movies but as a whole, they are way overrated in my eyes. So it should come to no surprise I found the new movie rather tepid. Again, the movie had it's moments of great action, lightsaber battles, and uses of the force, but outside of those moments, the magic wasn't there."
636,10,Great film but you can see the consequence of Lucas selling out to Disney,I have to say I liked the fact this film follows on from the originals and maintains some of its appeal. However there is a true lack of Originality. 
637,7,A Galaxy Far Far Away From the Originals...,"*SPOILERS* The film alone is watchable, although there is certainly nothing remarkable about it whatsoever. I wont be re-seeing it. A major flaw with the movie is the rather poor story, which includes the usual Abrams plot holes and zero subtleties which are what hold peoples imagination as he seems on a mission that the everything be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. That the plot actually shares many parts nearly identically with SW ANH cannot be denied, and it was probably done intentionally as a slight tribute/""re-dedication for a new generation"" - oh yay!hooray for nostalgia!... or rather, how about a new story?! Character development: none. Yes, everyone knows they can't give the audience all the information, but really that lack of information on the back story in this film was bizarre and off-putting. The pacing: disjointed. Completely missing is the ""Star Wars feel"" with the intense battle of the Dark and Light side, that even the much-maligned prequels still manage (see ""Duel of the Fates etc). Also, I cannot remember any of the soundtrack after seeing the movie - even the Phantom Menace featured unbelievable scores."
638,9,Believe the hype. This is the Star Wars we have been waiting 30 years for. This is a must watch for any movie fan at all.,"""It's true. All of it. The Dark Side, the Jedi, they're real."" Thirty years after the defeat of Darth Vader and the vanquishing of the dark side not much has changed. A new threat called the First Order has risen with a new leader that is trying to bring back evil to the galaxy. The resistance, along with the First Order are working toward the same objective in hopes that they will be able to win once and for all. The new saga begins with the search for Luke Skywalker. In the last 20 years there have been two movies that have been hyped up to the point of insanity. The first one was The Phantom Menace. After years of waiting the movie turned out to be a tremendous disappointment and took some of the luster off of the series. Once again it is many years later and the hype is at a fever pitch, no movie can live up to that type of hype....except this movie. J.J. Abrams returns the series to an iconic status and starts to rebuild the legacy in ways not seen since the 80's. The movie is essentially review proof but I will say, believe the hype. This is the Star Wars we have been waiting 30 years for. Overall, forget how you felt about the release of the prequels, this is a must watch for any movie fan at all. I highly recommend it. I give it an A."
639,6,SPOILERS! My review / my BIGGEST problem with the movie / SPOILERS|!!!,"First off, I generally enjoyed the experience of watching this movie. Exciting, tip notch visual effects, fast paced, not excessive and over done action (as we often see nowadays) but beautifully staged dogfights, sabre battles, and other action scenes."
640,4,not great,"the film was as bad as this website. Firstly there was a lack of original storyline, almost all of the gags and main events were taken directly from previous episodes. The new characters added were, in fairness, quite good and added a new dimension to the films. However there was far too much time focused around old characters and old features. I don't understand why the film needed to revolve around the exact same story lines as the previous films. Bringing back the death star for a third time is just overkill. The decision to bring back the empire just makes the 'triumphs' in episode 6 pointless. Essentially all the writers and the director have done is attempt to remake the original trilogy. It's a shame because they did bring in some interesting new ideas and characters, but unfortunately they barely even used them in this movie. Ultimately though nothing is going to change for the rest of the movies as I'm they're making more than enough money from this."
641,,Star Wars : The Force Awakens ? Don't Think So !,4.8 Stars out of 10 for picture quality
642,10,Don't let the trolls deceive you: this movie is bliss,"Isn't a little suspicious that a movie that has 95% approval by critics and 93% approval by fans at RottenTomatoes, a 81 score at Metacritics and a 8.7 overall score at IMDb has so much 1/10 stars reviews at the IMDb user reviews section? This section has been invaded by trolls. No doubt about it."
643,10,A worthy sequel worth loving!!!,"I will not spoil anything, don't worry! "
644,8,10 Pros & Cons for seeing and not worth seeing 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens',Pros
645,9,If You Don't Cry,"Nearly four decades after 'Star Wars' fever hit the world for the first time in 1977 and initiated 'The Skywalker Saga' (1977-2019) with 'The Original Trilogy' (1977-1983), and thirty-two years after 'The Return of the Jedi' (1983), the original cast is back in 'The Force Awakens'. A seventh episode that marks the beginning of 'The Sequel Trilogy' (2015-2019), which is about to close the 'The Skywalker Saga' with the release of 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' on December 20, 2019.<br /><br />Star Wars is political, and it always has been. The Empire is a white supremacist organization that wants to dominate and destroy all known worlds and civilizations. Each episode is a powerful allegory and parable about fascism. A rallying cry to stand up and fight back Nazis all of kinds wherever they invade in the universe. A sumptuous cinematographic fresco painted by a team of visual artists who enlighten, inspire and bring the impossible to life, while upholding the right to difference and equality regardless of origin. A standard of universal love that teaches who our real families and allies are regardless of blood and traditions.<br /><br />In this extremely emotional episode, if you do not cry when Han Solo and Chewbacca appear for the first time since 1983. When Princess Leia shows up after 32 years. When the son Han had with Leia kills his father, and when Ray finally climbs up cliffs and finds Luke Skywalker with all the wounds and scars he has accumulated over time and fights, I don't know how I can explain to you what Star Wars was, is and will forever be."
646,6,an outer space adventure that falls short of expectations,"As a person who has never been a fan of star wars from the beginning, what can I say about this new addition to the universe. I wont give you a bad review just because I've never been a huge fan of the series, like some people do. I'm going to give you an honest opinion of how I felt."
647,8,Solid start to the sequel trilogy!,"While the subsequent movies do not do nearly as well, this film brings back original elements from the first trilogy that work, along with likable new characters! Plus, old characters make it truly feel like Star Wars."
648,6,Watching it again only because I don't recall seeing it before.,Oh heck I have seen this before (thanks to IMDB recording my rating) and I don't remember a thing. So either it is low on merit and/or I can watch reruns over and over be blissfully unaware I have viewed films previously.
649,10,"#TheForceAwakens is something old, something borrowed, something new, something blue.","But that's what makes this J.J Abrams Star Wars movie so great. It borrowed heavily from the original trilogy, making us all feel like kids again and feeling nostalgic. It lays down the same groundwork, the same plots, and allows us to explore the same galaxies/ environments and settings for this galactic space drama for the upcoming sequels. "
650,6,Not bad,This one gets lots of hate because it had a familiar story but it did its job and got me hyped for the next saga film. The big shocker is kinda sucky but I understood it from a three film narrative and character building. Sadly all of it was squandered in the end.
651,1,Disney what have you done?,"Mmmmm... where should we start? Well, falling asleep twice within the first 90 minutes and not even being bothered to see the rest of this movie says a lot. Honestly, I'm short for words! Where is the innovation in this movie, where are the cool actors, and where is the new story line? "
652,,"It isn't a movie, it's bait.","Here is the problem with this movie: it plays on nostalgia of parents to make money. It tries to appease extreme feminists by making all powerful protagonists female. It relies on special effects and 'cool' explosions to draw people's interest. In terms of story, there isn't much to it."
653,10,Fresh and as exciting as watching the first Star Wars 38 Years Ago,"Just from a packed first showing @ 12:01 am in Exeter, UK of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (in 3D). Remarkably I saw the first in 1977 on a first showing, and subsequent ones in between."
654,10,Brilliant,"I used to watch the original star wars movies over and over every chance I got as kid, never owned the VHS tapes but always managed to see the movies over x-mas on TV. I watched them way before I really understood most of the story and always wanted to be Luke Skywalker."
655,10,Outstanding!!!,"I'm not going to say much about this outstanding sequel film, but this Episode 7 alone rips the last three apart with the force! LOL!"
656,10,The search for Skywalker,"Thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the overthrow of the Empire a new force has risen from its ashes; the First Order. Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has disappeared and both the First Order and rebels, who are now known as The Resistance are searching for him. A map to his location has been found and given to rebel pilot Poe Dameron but the First Order's storm troopers attack before he can get it back to the resistance he gives the map to his droid, BB-8, and tells it to get far away."
657,6,"Better than TPM and AOTC, worse than ROTS","Not as bad as I expected. From the reviews I was expecting cameos from the classic characters and the most minimal service possible of Star wars themes. (Star Trek Into Darkness was frankly a dreadful movie, so I had very low expectations going into this. ) "
658,10,The Rebirth of a Saga,"Star Wars The name that gives hope, excitement, adrenaline, and so many other emotions for people that love this franchise. Growing up I loved Star Wars it was one of the first movies I got into as a kid(I first saw it when I was about 3-4 years old long after the original 3 had their theatrical run) Luke Skywalker was one of my on screen heroes and Darth Vader one of the most evil bad guys I had ever seen. Lucas for years had been saying he had no intention on making a sequel trilogy and I figured Id take his word for it after all he was getting older and preferred to have other people helm the directors chair(such was the case early on with the prequels but he changed his mind) but then he sold the franchise to Disney and as soon as the purchase was done it was announced a new sequel trilogy was being planned(Not prequels, not in between movies but A SEQUEL TRILOGY) I was excited and damn I couldn't wait! Now it's the end of the year and ""Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens"" has been released and the only thing I can say is I LOVED IT!!!!"
659,6,A part of the summer superhero franchise,"I rarely write reviews since I guess I am just too lazy at times. But Star Wars is perhaps my favorite franchise and this one kind of killed it for me. There is a trend going for Superhero movies and Marvel releases a bunch of them and have even been going for the minor characters now (Ant Man for example). I believe Disney said they were going to do something similar for Star Wars. So we have here a mash-up of some of the original series (4,5 and 6) with basically nothing new. Now if they had marketed this as a remade New Hope I would have nothing to complain but I was expecting a whole new movie. The common thing with most superhero movies is they get pretty high fan and critic ratings (aberrations being Green Lantern perhaps) and they always succeed in the box office. But the issue is Star Wars was much grander and more innovative. However,now it is all part of the same mold--- you feel good after watching it but it does never leave an impression. Thinking of the prequels, while Episode 1 was a bit bad but there were some redeeming moments---the journey through the underwater world, the pod race and the Maul vs Qui Gon fight. Attack of the clones made things complicated and I actually had to re-watch the whole 1st 3 parts to understand exactly what was happening. Political intrigue and Order 66. And it was great to see how different things were before the Dark Side took over. In this one, nothing seems different---what a disappointment. And it still gets a 8.9....Bleh On a separate note, this is also a very politically correct Star Wars, perhaps the first one which is so. Makes me think if we had any of Lucas' originals releasing now, how would critics and audiences have treated them?"
660,8,"90% unoriginal, but emotionally powerful ending . . .","This is the movie ""you've all been waiting for"", a grand, classic early 80s Star Wars sequel complete with analogue grain, and the exact same music, credits, shots, battle sequences, characters, plot devices and themes."
661,6,Perhaps it should have been titled 'Star Wars: The Forgery Awakens' or 'SW: The Force Cloned',"The Force Awakens is an exciting new chapter to the SW saga. But there are problems, which it would be easy to get overly critical about. First off, what they got right about this film. New characters: on the surface they're different and compelling enough to enjoy. But at times they lack depth (and maybe even maturity). Perhaps that was by design to appeal more to kids. Next (what I like to call) environmental moments! An example of that is in #1 when Anakin is pod racing, a group of sand people are watching & take a shot at one of the pod racers, causing him to crash. Or in #4 when on Tatooine, they enter Mos Eisley in Luke's land speeder, a Jawa can be seen struggling to control a Rhonto beast. It seems like unimportant details, but it goes a long way to making SW seem real (and not just some visually impressive trip thru a fantasy universe)! While not achieving a George Lucas level, JJ Abrams did a respectable job at this, and frankly I don't know if other directors would've even grasped that. As always, the special effects & sound effects are top notch. The action and pace of the movie are done well too. If anything it could've slowed down in a few spots to help add a little more depth to some of the characters. The visual look of the film is commendable. Traditional SW but tweaked just enough to convey a newness to it (examples: storm trooper outfits, TIE fighters, etc)... And now for what's wrong with this movie!! Large holes in character background. While this seems to be a big source of complaint from fans, especially because it lends to unexplained inconsistencies in some of the major characters. Everyone should try and chill out!! Some of this will be covered in the next movie (probably). Some of it will be revealed in the commercial empire of the SW after market (in such things as toys, games, collectors cards, and possibly TV shows & cartoons). We will have to wait and see if it covers all the significant inconsistencies... Having said that, the sheer volume of it is annoying!! More than any other SW movie. Next issue: disappointing performances by the old cast. Han is Han! One of the strongpoints of the film. Leia, at times seems like she's coming down off a hangover, but at other times gives a convincing performance. Even Chewbacca gives a deadpan performance at one important point in the movie.The villain, Kylo Ren, while not being a big disappointment, is a mixed bag. The biggest flaw by far is the plot. The plot is heavily, heavily, heavily recycled!! So much so that it can't be overstated! (Hence the title of this review)! Hopefully the next SW will fix some of the character background issues. But unless they correct the totally unoriginal plot... then, just like in this movie... great visual effects, a great pace, and somewhat compelling characters will not be enough to make up for it."
662,2,One word: Boring,"Almost everyone in the world has heard of Star Wars; if not, congratulations on waking up from your coma. Everyone thinks that ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is great; those are the types of people who have been blinded by nostalgia. I am here to tell you that Star Wars VII is NOT good, but downright dull and unoriginal. J.J. Abrams may be a good Hollywood director, as he proved with ""Super 8"" and barely squeaked by with the 2009 ""Star Trek"" remake with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. But Star Wars was definitely not supposed to be one of his movies. "
663,,Another piece of garbage,"I find it absolutely sickening that I paid $15 for this crap. I went there with my g/f and halfway through it we had to leave because it was getting too painful to continue to watch. The theater was nearly full and there was a lot of nervous tension going around and when the opening script started to appear there was a huge round of cheers and my g/f lost by telling folks to quiet down because it was rude. The cheers lasted awhile and most of couldn't here the initial dialogue. The sad part was most folks were clueless on who the actual characters were and didn't understand when older characters appeared. I had to tell the d'bags next to me to shut-up because I didn't want to hear them anymore or the stupidity coming from their mouth. I doubt after this epic failure there will be another episode, with this crap Star Wars is pretty much dead and buried."
664,8,"This Next Generation ""Star Wars"" Can Be Proud of What It Is","When ""The Phantom Menace"" came out back in 1999, I had to deal with the dismal and sinking feeling of disappointment that hit me about ten minutes into the movie when I realized that my expectations were not going to be realized and that the movie was not going to come close to recreating ""Star Wars."" With time, I've learned to like the prequel movies for what they are, mostly because I think it's fun to see the story begun by George Lucas in 1977 come full circle. And also with time, I've made peace with the fact that nothing will ever recreate the experience of the original ""Star Wars"" movies and nothing needs to; I will always have the originals and can watch then any time I want to, so I don't need substitutes."
665,10,First Star Wars since 1983 (Non-Special Edition) that didn't suck!,"""42"" unhelpful votes, there is cheating going on here. "
666,8,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens( review,"For several years, I lived and breathed Star Wars. When Episode I came out, my then-boyfriend (now husband) and I were stoked for it. We drove to London to see it in May, rather than wait until August when it opened in Germany. We got the last two tickets for the Royal Box at the Odeon! We loved the film."
667,10,Ray of Light,"As much as I love the prequel trilogy, I must admit that Star Wars needed this reboot. I was initially worried that it would be Disneyfied,but George Lucas and J.J Abrams didn't step a foot wrong. I have nothing critical to say and I believe anyone who does is either simply not into star wars or a wannabe critic. The new characters were (as always in star wars films) very welcome on screen and came organically with the story line. The film didn't feel 'forced' or over dramatised, it was all kinds of light hearted and at the same time action packed and thrilling. I felt there was a perfect balance between familiarity and new and exciting characters. They didn't try to replace Darth Vader directly and addressed his absence head on. But what impressed me most about the film (of which I have already watched twice) was its stand alone quality...by which I mean, even if I had never seen a Star Wars film, I still genuinely believe I would have fallen in love with it. To conclude, It does the original trilogy every bit of justice and anyone who hasn't watched this film yet and perhaps fears it won't live up to your childhood memories of A new hope... empire strikes back and return of the jedi... trust me...it will."
668,6,JJ Remakes A New Hope and not much else,"I can only imagine that the critics who have praised The Force Awakens were due to pure spite towards the prequels and the desperate need to once again revisit that magical world from 1977. Truth is, the Star Wars of 1977 was a product of that era and while the prequels as much harm as they did helped create a larger world and a larger context. Part of my disappointment in TFA is that I was expecting the movie to go into an uncharted era, but it ended up very much like a retreading of the older movies. When I say I was expecting more, what mean is I was expecting something a little different. This is a wasted opportunity since The Phantom Menace as flawed as it was it also had very similar story beats to A New Hope and added way too much material that while a lot of it was it hit- and-miss, it didn't feel like a complete ripoff of the 1977 classic. And to be fair TFA kinda started out in a different way, yet slowly but surely began hitting the same beats and started getting way too preoccupied with nods to the classics and much like the prequels, there's so much info left unexplained and unaccounted for (the evil empire and the main villain's motives are sketchy at best). The story itself is interesting, the search for the missing Luke Skywalker, a storm trooper who has a crisis of conscience and leaves the First Order, a certain smuggler comes back, a young girl who begins to feel a connection to the Force, a new villain with clouded motives and a new weapon of mass destruction. All of this is good material to take the series into new area to explore but JJ just seems happy to play it ubber safe."
669,8,Star Wars is Back in Resounding Fashion!,"Star Wars: Force Awakens is one HIGHLY entertaining film and deserves tons of praise and recognition for successfully creating an exhilarating new chapter in the saga. Its cleverness & sheer novelty is sure to create a new generation of fans, & its homage to familiar icons affectionately resounds to long time enthusiasts. In amazing fashion, JJ Abrams also injects renewed energy throughout the film's runtime, resulting to a humor-filled, heart-racing experience like no other. Episode VII then, checks all the boxes, on what a resounding Star Wars sequel should be."
670,6,The remake of star wars!,Spoiler alert!
671,10,At first I thought it was going to flop and be dissapointing,"At first I thought this movie was going be a dissapoinment and flop big time because star wars is a popular franchise movies that it's impossible to pull off, but jj Abrams proved me wrong."
672,6,"A fun movie, but almost completely unoriginal.",SPOILERS
673,2,Star Wars: recycling of old plot awakens,"Wow, Disney, way to kill a franchise!"
674,,Kylo Ren vs Rey and the confusion of relative force powers,"Kylo Ren established early as having great control of the telekinetic powers of the force (freezing a laser blast mid-air)I would argue that this power exceeds Vader's in episode V (Darth using telekinetic power to propel objects at Luke during their battle, absorbing Solo's laser blast with his hand etc). Ren also seemed to have mastered a before unseen aspect of the force, namely reading the mind or thoughts of a defiant captive. We have seen Obi-Wan and Co put a thought in the mind, but not extract a thought. On the other hand, Lightsaber training in the galaxy over the past 30 years has seen some funding cutbacks, as he wielded his weapon somewhat clumsily and amateurishly (compared with Anakin-Obi-Wan-Luke-Darth Maul/Vader etc) Like many of you, I was baffled that Rey and Finn held their own against him in saber battle. Lets give our heroes the benefit of the doubt on that one, Both Rey and Finn throughout the movie showed themselves capable fighters and resourceful. Its conceivable that they had each spent several years training in swordsmanship. When Snoke spoke of completing Kylo Rens training he could well have meant teaching him how to wield the saber properly. "
675,9,Star Wars: The Next Generation,"I find it harder with every passing year to take an interest in new release movies, and even I was more interested in newer films I would need them to sink in before reviewing. However, this is Star Wars we're talking about! When it was first announced back in 2012 that a new trilogy of Star Wars movies was to be made, my initial reaction was ""It will be better than the prequels, but will still suck"". The filmmakers had the gargantuan task of winning back all the cynical, jaded Star Wars fans like myself; I don't think many people were jumping for joy when a new trilogy was announced. As more announcements about Episode VII came to light such as the film's apparent use of practical effects and that it was going to be shot on film I compared it to a politician making false election promises; in other words, it's a trap! Then came the first teaser and I couldn't complain. It actually looks like what I want a Star Wars film to look like, but no, I'm not getting sucked in that easy! With the second teaser, I finally gave up; ""shut up and take my money!"". While counting down the days towards this film's release my love for Star Wars was reawakened."
676,9,JJ nailed it,"I don't understand why people say this is a cheap copy of A New Hope. Please The Phantom Menace had more similarities to A New Hope than Force Awakens. Did it have some similarities? Sure! The biggest one was the weapon they had, The Starkiller Base. But that's it. This movie left you wanting more! Like you wished that the movie wouldn't end! I feel like that is the only Star Wars movie in the entire saga to have that feeling!"
677,10,"Impressions from ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015)","I guess like every fan of the ""Star Wars"" saga, I eagerly awaited this new movie, and was not disappointed (much). I waited long enough until the massive crowds died down enough that I could finally see the picture and not have to worry about sitting in a heavily crowded theater and being constantly distracted by everything that comes along with a large crowd."
678,10,Star Wars has Finally Returned to Glory,I've been waiting for this movie for so long that it still feels strange that it's actually come out and I've laid eyes on its gloriousness. This film is magnificent and I recommend everyone to give it a shot. You probably don't need my advice though since it seems like almost everyone is going out to see this one. I had a feeling that J. J. Abrams would be able to pull off a fantastic sequel/sort of reboot of the series and I'm glad that Star Wars is finally back. Let's talk about the story.
679,7,There has been an awakening...,Spoilers within.
680,9,Exciting and Respectful Towards the Original Series,There are spoilers in this so read at your own risk.
681,7,"In brief: same old, but who cares?",Let me keep this to the essentials.
682,9,Haters gonna hate but great entertainment,"Haters are gonna hate this big time. Sure, on one or two occasions I was reminded of the old Mad Magazine spoof, I think of Return of the Jedi, which depicts a cinema audience wearily reciting the Star Wars formula of how the resistance fighters will attack the Death Star (or its latest equivalent). But ultimately, George Lucas and JJ Abrams have created a stirring, absorbing film, which is snappily edited, has great scenery, and, of course John Williamson's still superlative soundtrack. And it's a kick-ass film for women, with Daisy Ridley (looking spookily like Keira Knightley) doing brilliantly as the central character, the scavenger turned warrior Rey. For an inexperienced film actor, she does extraordinarily well. And with Carrie Fisher reprising Princess Leia, that makes two female leads who more than hold their own. Hooray! Harrison Ford still takes your breath away as the charismatic Han Solo. And it's great to see Chewbacca get a meatier hero role here!! The other male leads, Poe and Finn, are also well cast and the guys playing them can actually act. The enemy characters were a bit tiresome and predictable. And I felt it was unbelievable that Rey and her friends could get behind enemy lines so easily without detection. I admit I had low expectations of this film, but ultimately really enjoyed it!"
683,6,"Disney, what a tragedy...",This post doesn't contain spoilers.
684,4,Disney tries to reboot a cult anthology but failed miserably: many plot holes and disappointing cast overall,"Never understood why the new Star Wars trilogy got so much hate from the fandom, but after I rewatched all previous chapters (including Rogue One), I can understand why people that follows this saga since the beginning were so hard with it."
685,,Star Wars redo,"Heard so many rave reviews about the new Star Wars movie, watched it tonight and totally disappointed. Well, the fans of the original Star Wars would love it because this is just a redo the original one. I agree with the Audioguys review. JJ paraphrase the original one. You can defend for him to pay tribute to the original SW - New Hope but it just sadly and shamelessly copied the original one. Rey is a scavenger, same as Skywalker. Han Solo went to the bar in the original movie, same here. Princess Lea put the message in R2D2. Now, Poa put it in BB8. The droid took the message to find the Skywalker and lead to Skywalker in the new film. Some of the lines are even carbon copied it. This new SW definitely make tons of money. All I hope JJ will make a more original SW movie in next chapter."
686,8,For me it was awesome.,"The best thing about this film began with 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away' and ended with 'directed by J.J. Abrams'. "
687,10,Everything we know and love about Star Wars!,"I'll be honest, I'm the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly sceptical about his ability to do the film justice. But let me tell you after the midnight screening last night I was very impressed! Abrams (and everyone who worked on the film) are clearly loyal fans of the saga, and have done it a great justice. The pacing and flow of the film is a mixture of the original and prequel trilogy, and left me almost wishing Abrams had taken the reigns for the prequels as well. Masterfully written and directed with amazing visuals and cinematography, the film introduces a cast of new and soon very familiar stars that do a great justice to their roles. The return of the original cast had the audience up in cheers and almost brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. "
688,10,The return of the original cast,"10 years after the revenge of the sith and 32 years after the return of the Jedi, the original trio of Han, Leia, and Luke are finally back, this time around the story focuses on a younger trio, Rey, Finn, and Poe who are in their own way the younger version of the original trio, the film also faces a new villain named Kylo ren who wants to be in a sense the next darth Vader. There is a also a super weapon called in the shape of a planet called star base killer which is even more powerful than the Death Star, what made the film rather special was how it had lots of references to the original film which was great for Star Wars fans, Harrison ford sure seems to be enjoying playing the Han Solo again and has the most on screen Time of the trio, Carrie fisher plays leia as more battle worn now that she is general of the resistance which was once the rebel alliance. Mark ha ill shows up at the end which sets up the next installment."
689,9,"My spoiler-free review of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015)","This review of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" will be necessarily brief, for fear of spoilers. And when I say ""fear of spoilers,"" I really do mean FEAR of spoilers. There are people out there who will burn your house down if you ruin this long-awaited film's surprises."
690,6,What went wrong ( Spoilers ),"The force awakens is a fast food meal recipe, not made with passion and care,its was made for the one and only purpose of making money. It has no soul,after all these year and anticipation this is the end result,imagine you can deactivate the Death Star shield in one second,how convenient,kylo ren,really,very bad casting,and he keeps taking off his mask all the time,i need an answer JJ, the dialogue between Kylo and the heroes is absolutely nonsense,really disappointed,the way everyone is using the force is horrible.Plus,with all the humor in this movie its like watching Scary Movie ( star Wars ) edition. They had all the time to make a masterpiece but they did not,instead a movie filled with plot hole and unacceptable cheap drama."
691,8,Actually great Star Wars film!,"I do not understand the hate this movie has received. The critics are great. This is, very simply, a great movie. Very well-made."
692,7,has flaws,"OK my big issue with this and all the newer star wars film in over explaining everything...We got loud and clear it was han solos son...but what do they they over explain it..Haaannn sooolo..We are not 8yrs old..Do they not understand that all the original star wars films have been put under a microscope and every second of every film has been analyzed...We can figure things out...hello ""Lawrence Kasdan"" we get it..!!!....its a sign of a bad film when they over explain everything...My other issue is General Hux was way too young..a 20 something general...come on.....OIther than that there is just to much of revisiting the original star wars elements...thus the cantina scene..can we please see something new something we have not seen before...stop reliving old stars wars ideas and create new ones...we know were are watching a star wars film you don't need to remind us of the original over and over...lastly the Frankenstein way they try and connect the whole story...we are not gasping in amazement..we going DUH!!!thats dumb........One last thing when every character first appeared they were meet with applause..except Luke skywalker...the graying bearded Luke..was a shock to my audience..sorry everyone people age..its called life..."
693,9,The Force brings a new hope,"The first line in this movie is ""This will begin to make things right."" I feel like that's a jab at the prequels. ""Hey, we know the prequels were awful, but this new movie will begin to make things right."" Probably not intentional, but clever nonetheless. My goodness, this movie is so well done! The parallels and metaphors are so cleverly written. Even if you haven't seen any Star Wars movies before, you can watch this as a standalone. Will you get more out of it if you've seen the original trilogy? Of course. Is it essential viewing before going into this one? No. The plot does at times feel ""Been there, seen that,"" because it is essentially a remake of A New Hope. However, there's enough new bits in the story that left me satisfied. The practical effects are so well done, and the very little CGI in the movie looks more realistic than the prequels ever did. There's an important message in the movie, and the characters are relatable. Unlike some of the characters in the prequels, you care about what happens to these new characters. They're acting is great, and the classic actors still feel like their characters. Harrison Ford is still great with the zingers, and C-3PO is still the worrisome robot we all love. J. J. Abrams has restored what we all love about Star Wars. Even before the classic characters show up, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. If the upcoming films are even 1/4 as good as this was, there's a new hope for the Star Wars franchise.<br /><br />Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
694,7,Lather. Rinse. Repeat.,"Is it me or is this just the third installment of ""Bad guys have a big gun and good guys need to blow it up?"" Empire Strikes Back had the Death Star. Return of the Jedi had a bigger Death Star. Now you have ""The Weapon,"" which is a gun that uses the power of a star. Really, is that all they could come up with after all these years? As for the special effects, I saw this in IMAX 3D and while it is visually appealing, it doesn't have any of those moments where you truly feel in the action with laser blasts or light sabers going by your head. I did like the way the new characters were woven into the old - it's a good mix of new, young, energetic, and attractive cast along with some comfortable characters from my childhood. All in all, there's no reason not to see this installment, but there's no good reason to line up for it, either."
695,1,No plot mishmash with miserable weak new faces,"This SW movie was a huge disappointment for me, after so many positive critics and being a real fan of episode 4-6. First of all there was NO plot. Even episode1 had more. It was a remake and CGI orgy for the hard-core fans. The only positive things were the visual effects (X-wings vs Ties). Indeed this story played somewhere in the SW universe (well more punctually somewhere between the SW universe and a MAD MAX world). Beside no realistic and sensible story the new actors/characters were also disastrous."
696,,Typical JJ Abrams Trash,"The movie was BADLY written horribly cast and had not only terrible acting but MASSIVE PLOT HOLES. Its simply a crappy remake of the original in Jar Jar Abrams style, he steals another person franchise, rips out elements he wants an then remakes all the other parts BADLY and the hype sells tickets."
697,9,Superb entertainment,Greetings from Lithuania.
698,9,"J.J. Abrams Continues the Legacy with Class,","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. There's no denying how big the hype for this film really was, and it made me quite nervous as my love for the series was setting the bar high, but I wasn't one bit disappointed. The magic of Star Wars is back, the magic that I have always complained was missing from the prequel trilogy. The tone is similar to A New Hope in which it sets up a new adventure, beautifully, and it will leave you wanting more. "
699,10,An Epic return to the Original Trilogy,Here I am at my desk supposed to be working and I cannot get last nights midnight showing out of my mind.
700,9,"Fantastic, lost for words!!!","Well, what can I say. First, let me state I'm 42yrs old and a massive Star Wars fan. A hard thing since my wife just cannot understand why. Well, if there's ONE reason why this movie is so fantastic, it's that I saw the same wonder and magic in my daughter's eyes than I had when I was a young boy."
701,6,The Awakening Of A Strange Force,**Warning Contains Spoilers**
702,9,The Force Awakens to Great Applause!,"Star Wars: Episode 7-The Force Awakens (2015): Dir: J.J. Abrams / Cast: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Harrison Ford, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac: The Force Awakens to the best film in the franchise since Star Wars. Inner battles and abilities surface with the search on for Jedi Luke Skywalker whose whereabouts are on a map hidden in a small droid. Daisy Ridley plays Rey, a scavenger who comes into possession of the droid but secretly possesses powers similar to that of a Jedi. When Skywalker's lightsaber responds to her she begins to question her origins. John Boyega plays Fin, a Stormtrooper for the First Order whose experience during an opening battle has him question the First Order. After rescuing a fighter pilot taken prisoner he joins the Resistance in their fight. Harrison Ford returns as an aged Han Solo who is still in dept along with his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca. When faced again with former princess Leia they realize that their own son has joined the First Order and must be coaxed back to the Resistance. This is a risk that is potentially dangerous when entering enemy base. Adam Driver plays Kylo Ren, dark warrior and son of Han and Leia. He is powerful but flawed, especially when he underestimates Rey's abilities. Oscar Isaac plays a fighter pilot whom Fin rescues. He is said to be the best the Resistance has. Director J.J. Abrams successfully steered the Star Trek franchise in a positive direction and here he moves the Star Wars franchise beyond those horrible prequels and awakens loyal fans to the electrifying special effects and blazing action they celebrate while a new generation awakens to new visions. Score: 9 / 10"
703,7,Very good but not great,"This follows 30+ years after ""Return of the Jedi"". Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi knight, has disappeared and no one knows where. However a map is found that shows where he is. Two groups want it--the evil First Order and good Resistance. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) pop up as do Chewabacca, C3PO and R2D2. Also two young people--Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Riddy)--help the Resistance."
704,9,Great start to a brand new generation and trilogy!,"This review has spoilers. The seventh installment of the Star Wars saga hits the familiar notes of a lost survivor who encounters a droid with pertinent information, in this case a map. The whole story surrounds the search for Luke Skywalker and the cute little rolling droid BB-8 possesses the map given to him by Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron who receives it from a mysterious character played by Max Von Syndow. The first scene gets rolling with laser fights and the force, at least the darkside, used by the masked Kylo Ren. We also see a reluctant stormtrooper. "
705,6,Great pacing but I expected more creativity,"I'll start by saying I'm far from being a 'Star Wars' fanatic, or for that matter even really a fan. I happen to have seen all the movies to date and can appreciate them for what they are, but they are not really my preferred cup of tea. Hell, it took me almost 12 months to get around to seeing this entry into the series. All that said, I was still a little bit disappointed by 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens' simply because I expected more. I expected more in the way of a complex story and I expected more in the way of new characters. 'Kylo Ren' really didn't do it for me as the main villain. Obviously he had huge shoes to fill the terms of 'Darth Vadar' (this is even touched on in the movie), but I still feel like a better job could have been done. Also the story, while pleasantly easy to follow, felt like it was lacking in creativity. When your come to a 'Star Wars' movie you're prepared for a little bit of complexity."
706,5,Disappointed,"SPOILERS: I expected more because of the hype. Don't get me wrong, there were some parts of the movie that were visually awesome but the plot was weak. They also tried way too hard to jam everything into one movie (yes, I know there will be 3 but they put too much in one)."
707,,Guys I am wondering something. Please enlighten me.,Almost nobody rated over 3. HOW THE HELL 8.0 RATE??!
708,9,What a comeback!,"It's not difficult to see why Star Wars was dying. The prequels were never going to capture any child's imagination in the same way as the originals - full of wooden characters, trade negotiations and uninspired cgi overload. There were features of interest, but Star Wars was on the edge of death."
709,8,Star Wars The Force Awakens.. great fun,"Star Wars returns again after all this time. First we met a young woman named Rey who lives in the desert, searching for parts on ships. She then comes into contact with a storm trooper who is trying to escape from his life. They both board a ship and come into contact with the great Han Solo. Together they go looking for Luke Skywalker. There is of course a villain named Kylo Ren who leads the new order against the resistance. Other returning characters are C3PO and r2d2. There is a lot going on with action, there is some great cinematography and really nostalgic moments when you see old characters again. I really liked the new characters the young Rey (who looks like a Jedi in training). I also liked the new droid called BB8. There are some great moments with the lightsabers. That great score is back and the real fun adventure feel of it all is back for all the die hard Star Wars fan. I really liked Kylo Ren and his powers and internal struggles. I really liked that there was a real plot going on with great characters. I think they building to something even better in the future movies to come. The film is a real thrill ride and I highly recommend it"
710,9,Cliffhangers stopped in the 1930s... or did they???,"In respect of the many IMDb members who have covered familiar ground, I add only two comments "
711,10,Well Worth It!,"I saw ""Star Wars:The Force Awakens"", starring Daisy Ridley-In her first major movie; John Boyega-Junkhearts, Attack The Block; Oscar Isaac-Ex Machina, Inside Llewyn Davis, FYI:He is playing Apocalypse in X- Men:Apocalypse and Adam Driver-This is Where I Leave You, Inside Llewyn Davis. "
712,6,The Force goes all PC,"The Empire is replaced by ""The First Order"" as the main enemy of the Rebels. A former stormtrooper and a lonely farmgirl will try to save the day."
713,8,Nostalgia.....Have you felt it?,"I don't need to explain what this movie is; everyone knows what Star Wars is, we all know there were three good ones and then there were three not-so-good ones. It's no secret that this movie is the most important film of the year to a lot of people...so what did I think?"
714,6,Deja Vu this time around,"""This will begin to make things right,"" are the first words you hear in this seventh episode of the ""Star Wars"" saga. For all intents and purposes that's a promise made not just by co-writer and director J.J. Abrams, but also by the folks at The Disney Corporation who recently spent billions of dollars to purchase this galaxy far, far away. No more will we have to hear about trade routes, taxation disputes, nor any of those tedious Jedi council meetings. The mortification of George Lucas's widely-despised prequels will soon be lost to the sands of time alongside his Crystal Skulls, Jar-Jar Binks, and Hayden Christensen."
715,9,"All what you needed for the biggest movie event of 2015, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is one satisfying ride.","The most awaited movie of 2015 has finally arrived with full throttle. It had been years since the last movie in the saga was released. And now to officially start a new trilogy, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" kicks off the series in one satisfying ride."
716,6,"A Solid, Over-Hyped Dramedy with a Cute Droid","When the first part of Star Wars (now referred to as Episode IV) came to the movie theaters back in the late 1970ies, George Lucas, the creator, rather went on holiday with his buddy Steven Spielberg than attending the premiere of his movie expecting this B-movie inspired Sci-FI Western to be a failure and yet it became possibly the most successful movie franchise in history giving millions of viewers worldwide a form of light escapism which rarely another series managed to accomplish; and now roughly 40 years later, we have a whole different situation, the movie companies invested so much money into this and the fan expectations are so high that failure is simply not an option so whatever fresh, innovative, bold ideas on part of young, aspiring script authors were submitted for Episode VII, obviously everything was abandoned as too risky for a potential success, therefore they hired the same old script author L. Kasdan not to adequately continue the saga but to simply retell it for a new generation of movie goers in such a way that the old fans won't feel excluded and J.J. Abrams made sure the cast is young and energetic and the dialogues not so cheesy like in G. Lukas' times."
717,1,Jar Jar Abrams slaughters Star Wars,"Without exaggeration I can say that The Force Awakens is probably the worst movie I've ever watched. It completely befouls and murder the Star Wars legacy. I love the original trilogy and though the prequels were weak and disappointing, The Force Awakens make all the prequels look like masterpieces in comparison. "
718,,"Retains the Star Wars magic, the force is strong with this one","Thirty years after the second Death Star's destruction, Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has vanished. An unlikely group get drawn into search for the Jedi before the First Order, a successor to the fallen Galactic Empire find him first. "
719,8,An enjoyable sci fi flick,"Star Wars The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after the original one left off which starred Harrison Ford,Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill who all reprise their roles here in this version. This time around and Luke Skywalker(Hamill) has vanished and its up to a young woman named Rey(played by newcomer Daisy Ridley)and Finn to team up with Han Solo(Harrison Ford)and fight against a new villain called Kylo Ren(Adam Driver)who is in charge over the first order. But what secret is Kylo hiding....without spoiling anything lets just say that Han Solo knows him pretty well. "
720,8,A great movie dragged down by its sequels,I still stand by the idea that this movie is awesome. It's a great return to form after the mess that is the prequel trilogy. It's unfortunate that the following movies make a lot of this one dumb in retrospect.
721,9,Nice.,"The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film by Disney. It's has a great story and great action scenes. It has WAY too many jokes and although the acting is good, sometimes it's a bit too cheerful. Overall great movie and you should really watch it."
722,10,Stop what you are doing and watch this gem!!!!!,"Let me start this by saying that it is beautiful, just beautiful! The acting is superb, Boyega being my absolute favorite if the cast. Spot on dialogue (one scene on Jakku being the exception). Perfect mix of comedy, drama, lore, and complexity that the Star Wars universe is renown for. The plot was structured like A New Hope which is fine by me and I think every Star Wars fan will find nostalgia in its well fleshed out and stellar plot. The First Order lead by three new antagonists feels like a force to be reckoned with and Boyega is great at conveying those emotions (not that their actions throughout convey any less). All in all, I would watch this movie every day if given the choice and will view it many many times in the theater because it would be a shame not too. Do yourself the favor if a lifetime and watch this masterpiece of modern cinematography!"
723,7,A soft reboot failure,"This movie felt disrespectful to star wars fans. The last star wars in theaters was the prequels and clone wars movies. (If you count phantom menace 3D in 2012 but the last new movie was clone wars) so George Lucas has thus episode 6 part movie franchise split into 2 different trilogies, with so much lore. And disney buys it and retcons it all, and continues the story 25 years after return of the jedi. I admit han solo and chewie walking in the millennium falcon was cool, but that was. Finn, rey and poe, sucked as characters. Fin would have been interesting if they had let him be a jedi but they kept him as the guy who screams out reys name at inappropriate times. And then emo wanna be vader kills Han solo. I never cared for Han solo much, I mean yea he's cool but seems bland to me most the time but even that got me mad. Now we'd never see him Leia and Luke in the same scene together now. It was awful. Awesome concept but poorly executed. You tried to recreate the first star wars and ignored everything about what happened in the prequels and it looks like bladerunnee 2049 now instead of the epic star wars episode VII the next chapter and first of a new star wars trilogy for newer generations to watch and enjoy and then watch what happened before then and be like ""how did people enjoy these old films"" and they just won't understand but watch it and enjoy it and love the films of this decade but can't unfortunately because jj Abrams ruined it he took the heart and soul away from star wars in this trilogy. This trilogy needed George Lucas. What a shame."
724,9,The force is strong with this movie.,"I can't believe it's finally here. Ten years since the last 'Star Wars' movie, which was 'Episode III' by George Lucas. In the decade that followed, we all thought we would never see another 'Star Wars' feature film again, since Lucas himself destroyed and ruined the prequel trilogy and continued to alter the original trilogy to dried up mess of movies that are almost unrecognizable. Fortunately for every 'Star Wars' fan in the world, he sold his production company that included the rights to 'Star Wars' to Disney for a modest amount of $4 billion."
725,6,Disappointing but enjoyable rip-off,"My score of six seems a little unfair, even to me, because I did actually enjoy the film. The problem I have is that I spent much of the film thinking, ""Hey, that's scene from 'A New Hope', that bit was from 'Empire Strikes Back'"" and ""Err, isn't this the same story as 'The Phantom Menace or is it a mash-up remake of episodes 4,5 and 6?"" You get the picture. J.J.Abrams may have been trying for an affectionate tribute to what has gone before, but for me it ended as a thoroughly enjoyable but unoriginal copy-and-paste mash-up of previous Star Wars films. You just know that Honest Trailers are going to have a field day showing the dozen or scenes and plots side by side. Ultimately, the film was rescued not just by the brilliant direction and cinematography, but by the two lead characters. Daisy Ridley as Rey is truly outstanding. In so many ways I found her more convincing than Mark Hamil, who was always just a little too gangly in the first two Star Wars films to be completely believable as an action hero. The Rey character is everything you felt Luke Skywalker should have been. So would I recommend friends to go and see it? Absolutely, it really is great fun. Will I get the DVD when it comes out? Most probably. Will I go to see the next film in the cinema? Possibly not, more than likely I'll save my money and wait for the DVD."
726,9,There has been an awakening,"Let's face it. There was no way JJ could have made a new Star Wars film that people wouldn't over hype and end up being disappointed about because it wasn't exactly how they imagined it. No matter what, fans would have been angry. But let me tell you that some of the reviews I have read on IMDb are incredibly unfair, untrue, and just downright disrespectful to an incredible movie."
727,6,"Certainly feels like Star Wars again, albeit with a startling lack of depth","When Return of the Jedi ended its cinema run back in 1983, Star Wars fans were forced to endure a terrible 16-year wait for George Lucas to final greenlight the next instalment, The Phantom Menace (1999). Fan delirium soon turned to head shaking and bewilderment when the result turned out to be a soulless CGI-fest with bad acting and the most annoying character ever to grace the silver screen (narrowly beating Kate Capshaw from Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom). The prequel trilogy mercifully ended in 2006, bringing to a close one of the most disappointing movie events in history."
728,3,Truly disappointing,"I had high expectations from The Force Awakens. Initially I thought that the decision to hand over the SW franchise to a new generation was great. The new faces, the feminist twist and even creating The Force Awakens as a remake of Episode IV were not necessarily bad ideas. They were poorly executed though. I question Disney's choice of movie makers because JJ Abrams did a terrible job with the story, cast, score and pretty much everything. And he has no excuses as I am sure that he had a lofty budget. "
729,,THE SHORT AND SHORT OF IT: What a great Episode IV remake... NOT (spoilers spoilers!!!),"Thanks Mr Abrams. Then again, you just directed it, not write it, right? Great original plot of a new Death Star! Great idea of characters running around in new Death Star! Great idea of a droid being chased for holding vital information! Great settings on Tatooine (i mean Jakku), Hoth, Yavin and Endor (oops, wrong names again)! Great new Cantina! Great bad-ass villains! Great showing of the dark side! Great ending of Rebel HQ running out of time as Rebel fighters enter trench to destroy new death star! I felt so safe I yawned a few times. But seriously, thanks for maintaining the'I am your father' and 'If you are a main character then you are somehow related to me' tradition. Thanks for showing that a girl who just discovered the Force can suddenly know of and execute Jedi mind tricks and defeat a trained practitioner of the dark side. My bad for expecting Kylo Ren to personally just do the death choke on everyone he meets. My bad for expecting to relive the real-life excitement of the trench battle in Episode IV and snow battle in Episode V. As a movie, it's still worth our money spent. As a phenomenon, the franchise lives on. With your consent, I hereby re-title this: EPISODE VII: A REMADE HOPE"
730,10,"Oooohh, it is WIDE awake...","First of all, some basic info: I was five years old when the very first movie I saw in a theater was Star Wars. I grew up on the original trilogy. But that's not the reason why I hated the new trilogy, and why I loved this movie."
731,8,Old fan and New fan welcome back or just welcome to Star Wars,"Just out of the Theater, just watched the New Star Wars, the force awakens. This is the fastest 136 min I have passed in a long time if it makes sense... When the credit rolled out, I thought: Oh, what the... Oh Nooooo. Yep just like that, the movie was great, a new hope revisited somehow with lots of twist but this time an end that implies another episode or more 'a la' Lords of the ring way ... The movies answered lots of question but brings lots more, darn. I will not spoil the movie by telling you what happened. Just go watch it, if you are a fan of star wars and have knowledge of the first trilogy (you will need it), go watch it, if you are new to star wars... you are so gonna be hooked. New Heroes, Old heroes all lovable and doing credit to this fantastic franchise. CGI are awesome especially combat scene, but what was the best part of it? The awaken... The awaken of what? Well, you'll have to see it to answer this question. What I am sure about, it's the awaken of a new trilogy, mark my word."
732,8,Excellent Start to New Trilogy,"This was an unbelievable start to finish movie that was just the beginning of what we are going to see from another great Star Wars trilogy. The pacing of this movie was fantastic all the way through. I was never bored or getting tired of the plot. The characters really make this happen both old and new. Harrison Ford as Han Solo was amazing but the newer cast has a bright future. I liked the development of Rey and Finn and I am super interested to see where they are going next. I also thought that Poe was a great addition as well. If I had to pick a favorite character from this movie alone I would go with Rey. Her story starting as a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, relying on her own self to just survive, on to learning her importance in the war to come against the First Order was really well done. I loved how JJ Abrams gave only little hints of Rey having the ability to use the Force. It was an amazing cinematic moment when she took over the saber fight against Kylo Ren and eventually defeated him. The cliffhanger at the end seemed like it was the perfect place to leave off with us finally knowing the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. This is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen in theaters. Spine tingling from start to finish!"
733,8,Why Star Wars: The Force Awakens succeeds (NO SPOILERS),"While there won't be any spoilers here, you may want to not read this if you haven't yet seen the film and you're wanting to have a truly unbiased first viewing."
734,6,Retread of previous efforts but with relentless action,"Don't get me wrong - this is an exciting movie that does not let the franchise down. But we have seen most of it before, some almost frame by frame. Putting a woman and a black male actor upfront as heroes really is tokenism in trying to make the film distinctive, because it is not. Yes, the CGI is better than some earlier efforts and it looks realistic compared to some $200M comic book adaptations around. True, the action is relentless (Mad Max has obviously started a trend - one to be regretted), and the film suffers for it. The villains are underused and really pretty pathetic - the son of Han and Leia could not frighten a kindergarten birthday party! And the Starkiller base must have had a very secretive funder over the previous decades of chaos following the death of the Emperor! Resistance and Republic - just another theme thrown away in the rush. And how does the heroine turn into a pretty potent jedi with absolutely no training?! Answers another day, I suppose. Okay, but not worth the long wait on balance!"
735,8,"Box office buster, but a failure nevertheless!","I may voted 8, cause it's Star Wars, but...damn! It was rather disappointing! I tried not to write anything but I could not resist! I am sorry! First of all Star Wars without Lucas??? I mean J.J. Abrams is great, but I think he is missing the point of the hole Star Wars idea! The CGI may be a little better and how the camera rolls, but I think that should be by default since it is 2015/16. The hole story is like it was written at some train station for 10min or something. Second, what was this?? 130min of nothing except flying, shooting and jumping from one place to another?!? Lack of sword fights, only a few lines about the Force, poor cast choice (kinda liked Rey, but her part was forced into whatever they were trying to deliver) and...the storm troopers?? What was that?? Where did you guys find those costumes - in some Lucas retro closet? I think you could have done better! We may be a Star Wars fans, but we would like to be surprised! Third. Where did this First Order pop up from?? Can't remember, maybe I have to watch it again...And Kylo Ren - he was just some sith with poor sword skills joined the dark side and that... ridiculous creature just for fun I guess, because I could not see some other better reason - we know why Anakin did it! And fourth. Ren - who was supposed to be vicious sith, master in the light-saber combat, with good knowledge of the dark side, got beaten like a punk by Rey who has just discovered she has the Force. Many WTF moments in this movie I can tell you!"
736,7,"Pretty fun, although disappointing","The force awakens has a lot of good elements like good performances all around, fantastic effects (horrible cgi on snoke not withstanding), great action, charming characters, and amazing music. Where the disappointment comes in is the story. It is a note for note copy of a new hope (I came to watch a new Star Wars story not an old one with new paint on it) and it results in the third act being lame. Hans death is unsatisfying and predictable, and all the set ups I don't care for (snoke is a boring copy of the emperor, reys backstory i dont want her to be related to anyone, and Luke worried me that ep 8 will be just a copy of ep 5 and thankfully ep 8 wasn't that). A fun movie but I definitely prefer last Jedi over this."
737,10,Worth waiting for,"1977 i was 8. In Sweden u needed to be 11 to see the first one. Since then i've seen all the movies several times. Been waiting many years for this seventh movie and was expecting a lot. I got it all and maybe even more than i expected. The first 90 minutes was extremely enjoyable and the spirit of the Star Wars galaxy was all around with quite a few quiet laughs in the audience when certain scenes provided items from the past. A strong performance from all of the new young lead characters and an OK from the older ones. Time cant pass quick enough until the next part in the saga has premiere, still a lot of marvelous scenes to expect from part 8 and 9. Due to respect for all of you who still haven't seen it, not details in this review, but i can almost guarantee that you will be as happy as i am at the moment. This is a Must See for everyone :D"
738,6,Movie detracts from the futuristic feel and Daisy's Acting as Rey is apualing,"Some of the scenes in the movie are appalling - seems like - big budget cuts. From the scene depicting the first battle, to the ""earth like"" locations rather than futuristic locations, to the end sequence and the crew return to hero's welcome is more reminiscent of an army bunker rather than a futuristic hide out."
739,4,Like watching a potato boil for 2 hours,"Commercial campaign for this movie: 10/10, the problem with this movie is that it's a 4/10 at best, and very boring. Everything except for seeing Han Solo and princess Leia is insipid. Almost the entire plot is revealed from the start, character development doesn't happen (that too is spoiled from the start by revealing too much). The main characters are probably the worst, no sort of character development, the woman knows everything and does everything, because she prayed to feminism or something, the black guy's character is suppose to be indoctrinated and trained from childhood and then he turns traitor after the first battle because of the ""horror"" and then goes on happily killing his former comrades (*not a spoiler since it's in the trailers that he turns traitor). The main bad guy isn't as horrible but not something to impress or inspire either, and all of these new actors are ugly or average looking at best. The plot is very poorly written, it's like a small kid wrote it, it's as realistic as if you go to the USA, capture an army captain and he can then, ALONE, give you the codes to the nuclear rockets and at the same time fire them, ALONE. Boring, stupid and lazy plot, a lot copied from episode 4 but in a boring way. Like watching a potato boil for 2 hours, I had no attachment for the characters, for the ""good guys"" (none of them is played by a non-Jew white actor) or ""bad guys"" (you guessed it, all of them are white guys), so if you're a white-hating liberal feminist that likes to lie to themselves and would like to watch a movie as insipid and dumb as your political views, this is the movie for you."
740,,Nonsense,"The movie, although high-tech at times has so many subplots and characters, all of which don't contribute in any way to an actual film. Furthermore, many of these characters are majorly over played (asian women, Mary Sue, especially) and the direction they went with for Rey, Kylo and Snoke wasn't what Star Wars needed."
741,9,"The force is stronger then ever in the return to the famous saga, Star Wars: The Force Awakens","Star Wars! These two words are all I need to say when describing what is probably the most iconic cinema story of all time. I've never said it was the greatest (some may argue that though), it's responsible for reinvigorating the science fiction genre, raising the stakes on blockbusters, and turning a man with a creative vision into one of the biggest leaders in Hollywood. Star Wars has transcended upon generation after generation, letting children and their grandparents relive the tale of a warrior's journey through the combination of several likable characters and amazing special effects. This original series became of one cinema's greatest treasuresuntil the prequels."
742,9,Solid Star Wars Film,Overall this movie works well for me. It adds fun new hero's and villains and many cool storylines. I think the acting was pretty good overall and I liked the plot line about how the first order was taking control and the resistance seems like the underdogs of the story. I think this is a good Star Wars film and return to the galaxy far far away!
743,9,The definitive Star Wars Sequel: Episode VII is a new start and a new hope indeed!,"Whether you watched it or not, loved it or not, the original Star Wars Saga (episodes 4,5,6) defined and changed sci-fi movies forever, and came to be a defining moment in the history of Film Making. One that had a fandom that may surpassed all other movies in the history of cinema, becoming the biggest movie franchise ever and a cultural phenomenon like no other. "
744,10,The Force,This is the best movie in the Star Wars series so far. It was truly a chill through out. It was a knockout. It is a great movie without using profanity and sexual content. All Star Wars fans will love this movie. This movie was a movie that will be remembered for a long time as the best movie ever. I have never seen anything like this before it was so incredible. You will have to see it to believe it.
745,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"In the late 70's, my first trip to the movies was with my dad. It was the dog days of summer and drive-in theaters were hip. I saw Star Wars: Episode IV there and have since seen it 100 times over. It was the evolution of sped up sci-fi and countless imitators have tried to ride its coattails. Star Wars: The Force Awakens (my latest review) is the 7th entry in the popular, space opera saga. Unintentionally though, it tries to almost spoof and/or parody the three films from the earlier, George Lucas era (circa 1977-1983). Case in point: Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) is supposedly Episode VII's main heavy. Too bad his costume makes him come off more like Rick Moranis (in Spaceballs) than the new breed of Darth Vader. Dark Helmet well, he just ain't so dark."
746,9,Just watch and entertain yourself (without shocking the other visitors).,"I just read a lot of negative reviews on this movie. And I admit I do understand and also do recognize the points the disappointed viewers wrote. However for myself I have to say I was more than amused watching this movie. Why? Well first of all I avoided every article which might reveal a glim of script. OK, the storyline was thin, but hey, come on, that has always been the case. I see this episode as a re- introduction of old characters and pushing new ones forward asap. Not easy to identify yourself now with one of the main characters. The old ones are hmmz too old and well the young ones are too young. But than again: it is not the characters who have changed, no it is you, you and you (and yes also me) who have changed. We are longing to the old times, when we have our hero: Han or Luke. Or even Darth Vader. And that is the next one. People miss that old man. Even the story in ep1-3 you had a feeling he was there somewhere. But we just have to get used to the new characters. OK, one point of fear...I am afraid the villain in this movie will be more like old darth more and more. If that will be so, than yes I will be disappointed. But for now: good special effects, nice 3d effects (not too much), good sound, same old score (thank you Mr Williams) and no jarjar. Movie is a bit too long and the scriptwriters did too much trouble to get as much of the old characters in it. But too make a long story short. I am entertained."
747,7,"The good, the bad and the ugly (incl. German edition's review)",I went to the cinema last night and here's my personal review:
748,9,"A solid start, that, for me, is a solid Sequel Trilogy!","2005, Revenge of the Sith is released; a bittersweet moment in Star Wars history. Every Star Wars fan weeped a bit. We all thought it was over. 2012, Lucasfilm Ltd. Is sold to Disney and we are told that a brand new trilogy will be made! 2015, The Force Awakens is released and I rejoiced! It was a new beginning for Star Wars, the beginning of a new trilogy, with new characters but a lot of similar sights. While I will always love this film, there is no denying that there's a lot similar elements to the very first film. Now, I really don't mind that too much, to be honest. It was just so exciting to see Star Wars again on the big screen! The new characters sharing the spotlight with our favorite legends was gold as their chemistry was spot on. And the loss of one those legends, still cuts today. I love this movie! There are just some elements I would've changed."
749,6,Entertaining Movie but that's It,"Although Epidode VII is a very good standalone Star Wars movie, once again they do a terrible job of trying to make it fit with the previous movies. Return of the Jedi left me very happy with the way things ended, the Sith and the empire were vanquished, Leia and Han lived happily ever after, Luke was a consummate Jedi and he turned Vader back to the light side of the force before dying."
750,1,The Force...perverted,SPOILERS!SPOILERS!SPOILERS!SPOILERS!
751,,This movie is so bad.,"I just saw this movie again before Last Jedi and it is so bad. All the arguments over the past two years on why this is such a bad movie are still true, like Rey being a Mary Sue, Mark Hamill just staring weirdly, etc. Now I don't feel like going and seeing Last Jedi and I believe Star Wars has ended for me. I don't care about the next movie, the new characters being introduced, or anything else going on in the Star Wars universe. It's just over for me. Daisy Ridley even said she's leaving after the third film. That's cause she knows a sinking ship when she sees one and she doesn't want to be involved with all the controversies and stupidities attached with this new trilogy. Rey will just defeat the First Order in the next two movies and that's it. Way to go, Jar Jar Abrams, with a fully predictable plot. "
752,8,Entertaining on its own terms.,"No other movie this year, or perhaps ever, has been surrounded with as much hype as this long-awaited sequel set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. With lofty expectations and overly protective fans demanding the world, J.J. Abrams must walk a tightrope in returning this beloved franchise to the big screen for both decade-old fanatics and a new generation of devotees. It's not the first time Abrams has tasked himself with the impossible – after delivering the superb Star Trek reboot in 2009 – and he very nearly achieves it again here, albeit falling short of the ""classic"" status so many will be hoping for. He, and everyone else, will just have to settle for a damn fine fantasy flick that should be enjoyed on its own terms."
753,8,an otherwise amazingly entertaining film with one glaring flaw,"Everyone who has seen the movie knows its one huge flaw. But, other than the fact that it rips off plot elements from EpIV, why haven't more people noticed just how well done this movie really is?"
754,10,True to its heritage. Star wars wins again,"It was brilliant from start to end. I don't need to hyper analyse it to love it. If course there is that moment when you say NO!!!. (no spoiler) but what a way to exit. Unlike the hobbit which is really unwatchable again. I really liked the movie, I would see it again. I wasn't sure what JJ abrams would do with the movie, but he has been pretty faithful to the force. Pretty emotional at times. But a pleasure to watch. Felt like It was 1983 again. Its great to see this franchise resurrected. It seems like a natural continuation and not a forced project. "
755,9,Star Wars: It's Good Again,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brings Star Wars back to where it should be and mixes a good balance of what was great before and the convenience we have right now with the new generation. It delivers us a refreshing look at the world we were introduced to back in 1977 and brings back what we loved the most, while at the same time introducing us to plenty of new things to remember to love as well in the future."
756,6,Problems with logic,"The film is almost good, worth to look everybody but there are some disgusting moments:"
757,8,"It's the Same Formula, But It's Still a Lot of Fun","If you experience several instances of deja vu while watching the Force Awakens, fear not, you are not alone!"
758,6,The story weakens the film.,"(No Spoilers) Star Wars, The force awakens."
759,9,A Glorious Return to Glory,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is everything we could have wanted and more, and feels like a return to glory for the franchise that needed redemption the most. Going into the film, the hype was insane, but whether or not the film would live up to it was to be determined. The Force Awakens is surprisingly funny, filled with stunning visuals, and features a lot of surprises in an age when spoilers rule. Some may have issues with decisions of the writers, but the filmmakers deserve credit for their devotion to the story."
760,7,"Excels as a Thrill Ride, but that's about it!","If you haven't seen The Force Awakens yet, then go now, this is your last chance. The Force Awakens is a film everyone wants to spoil, and they've done a good job, I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum, but you can't review this film without some getting through."
761,4,Star Wars Episode VII : Return of A New Empire !,"Let me start by saying that I never was a fan of Star Wars, be it the original trilogy or the prelogy. I always considered those films to be made for children (which is why selling the franchise rights to Disney made perfect sense to me), with campy dialogues, simplistic plots and ridiculous characters. Some of those errors were partially corrected in the prelogy (with the notable exception of Jar-Jar, and the horrible chemistry between Padme and Anakin), which is why I prefer the more recent episodes. Still, on the whole, the 6 episodes are quite mediocre films. To me, Lucas' real achievement has always been his ability to push the technical boundaries of film making and to create (and market) a whole universe from scratch. In short, he's a great visionary, but a poor director and writer."
762,,SPOILER FREE -- My two cents on what is certain to be one of the most talked about films...ever.,"THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE--- Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Those five words will change cinema moving forward. It will likely topple Avatar being it has made almost 1 billion dollars in a week and hasn't even opened in China yet. It has rebooted a beloved franchise with a new director, new owners (Disney), new marketing, new technology and it has taken on the most veracious fan base ever known. And for the most part...it has blown away everything it has come up against. Critics love it, a lot of fans love it and there is mostly an outpouring of love and respect for what JJ Abrams has done with his beloved franchise. It's beloved to me too. It has always been a huge part of my movie watching life and some of the favourite films and definitely a part of my childhood so I was beyond excited to experience this. I had astronomical expectations like most people. I also chose to wait to review this until I had seen it twice because as many people have said...it gets even better subsequent viewings. The natural build up and hype inevitably mars your first viewing. Coming out of that I was prepared to say it was too long, too many holes and give it a solid 8. Coming out of my second viewing...I have to give it a 10. A 10 because it is the best film experience I've had this year even if it has its flaws. When something is this ambitious and this anticipated, you can find holes anywhere."
763,9,Predictable but beautiful,"""There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? The Dark side, and the Light."""
764,9,"A wondrous return to that galaxy far, far away... ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic (though not perfect) and promising start to a new trilogy!","""Star Wars"" is quite the enigmatic franchise when it comes to fandom. One one hand, we all love the original iconic trilogy. Those original films are classics of not only the Sci-Fi genre... but classics of film at large. Pop Culture and critical phenomena that to this day continue to be bathed in near-universal admiration. "
765,10,"Excellent Visuals, Funny, Nostalgia Feels",Visuals = 10/10.
766,8,The Force Awakens,"The Force Awakens was a fun return to the franchise. It is very similar to a New Hope which is unfortunate but the benefit of that is it felt much more like the Star Wars we know and love unlike the prequel films. The new cast is good, but it was great to see the old cast back. Especially Han. My biggest complaint is that Rey could beat Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel without any training. That was a big misstep. Other then that it's a very entertaining film."
767,6,A new start and a new line yet so much is familiar...,"You're never going to win when it comes to Star Wars. Most of us now have in one way or another grown up with it, and love it for multitudes of reasons. No point bringing up the prequels as that's polarised people, so I'll leave it there on that."
768,8,The Feeling is Back,"Let's be honest. After the colossal disappointments of episodes 1-3 ""The Force Awakens"" was bound to be ravenously coveted and widely accepted if it had any glimmer of competency. So, was Episode 7 better than the last three episodes released?? OF COURSE! I don't want to talk about the movie itself, I'd much rather talk about the feel of the movie. Before I talk about the feel of the movie I want to say that John Boyega, Finn, displayed more emotion and more acting range in one scene than the dreadful Hayden Christiansen showed in two movies. That's not fair; EVERY actor showed more range than Hayden did. OK, enough dwelling on the past."
769,7,"Rey is a Mary Sue, A New Hope but Worse",Title is called a new Hope but worse for a reason.
770,10,Abrams Delivers a Satisfying Sequel,"After his successful reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise, director-writer J. J. Abrams and co-writer Lawrence Kasdan have turned to the ""Star Wars"" series with equal or arguably better results. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" successfully mixes the old and familiar with the new and promising. Fans of the original trilogy will be pleased that the old includes Han Solo, Chewbaca, the now-General Leia, R2D2, and C3PO. Those seeking reassurance about the quality of future sequels will find promise in Daisy Ridley as the kick-ass Rey, who slides easily into the pilot's seat aboard the Millennium Falcon; in Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia, who has turned to the Dark Side; and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, a dashing fighter pilot. The newly minted trio of Rey, Kylo, and Poe are worthy successors to Luke, Han, and Leia of the original films and should hopefully endure through at least two more sequels."
771,6,Huge Disappointment,"I've watched it now several times. I tried to like it. It's Star Wars. It's Han Solo, Leia, Luke (a bit of him). I grew up watching episodes IV-VI. I can't describe how much I wanted to see and like this movie. But I don't like it. The story as a reboot stinks. How do you reboot something that is a part of this rebooted saga??? There are many non- canonical things happening around as well, and I don't want to go into debate with it. These things (without going into details) just don't fit my Star Wars universe. And this ruins the entire movie. I'm utterly disappointed. :((((( Damn You Walt Disney for ruining the most important sci-fi universe."
772,4,Hugely disappointing,"Yet another film made for the trailer. A crying shame given the material they had to draw from and the incredible production values - which are nothing short of spectacular. If you can totally switch off your brain, you'll enjoy it. If you can't... oh boy..."
773,,Disney Should Not Have Bought LucasFilm,"Therefore no one comes out looking good, not even George Lucas.<br /><br />Disney is the sith taking over the jedi council. The acting is atrocious and almost painful to watch. It comes across as a bunch of kids deciding to play around with video editing software and act out Star Wars. It is that bad. I want to know who was in charge of casting this plot hole extravaganza."
774,10,Welcome back Star Wars,"It was so amazing, I am just so happy that Star Wars came back to our screens. I loved the new characters, they are honestly easy to fall in love because like any other Star Wars film, all the characters would never let you down. I quite like Rey, she reminds me so much of Princess Amidala or Princess Leia in her younger years especially fashion wise. I really am looking forward to see what the new characters have in store in the next 8th film. It will be amazing as usual!"
775,10,"it can't be that good, but it is","when i was 6 years old, i saw the first 3 movies (4,5 and 6) and ever since i have loved star wars. don't know why it is that star wars just is my thing, i hate star trek. and then they made episode 1-3, and failed, and with that in mind, today i vent to the movies, thinking that from now on i will call j j Abrams for jar jar Abrams for the rest of eternity. "
776,10,Star Wars is in Safe Hands,"The Force has awakened once more and this time it feels as if it will never go away again. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the seventh installment in the Star Wars franchise and is the first of the Disney-era after they purchased Lucasfilm back in 2012. Directed and co-written by fanboy lightning rod, J.J. Abrams, The Force Awakens is a Star Wars film that was made by fans, for fans. While this could have easily been just a whole bunch of fan service to grab for some quick and easy cash, The Force Awakens is more than that -- it's a true tour de force of a movie (no pun intended)."
777,9,I enjoyed it!,"I am not what you would call 'the biggest Star Wars fan', the original trilogy certainly holds some nostalgia for me as I do remember watching them countless times as a child, the second trilogy I had little time for and only recently watched them all for the first time. I was however very excited to watch Star Wars – The Force Awakens, I bought into the hype and went to view it within a couple of days of it being released. "
778,6,Predictable - and Hard to Review Without Giving a Spoiler,"The movie has the Star Wars Music that evokes some good emotions and a story and characters that evokes some familiarity, and the basic concept of Star Wars comes across, that there is constant fighting across this galaxy as the battle between good and evil goes on forever. "
779,9,The franchise is rescued,"Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that for many hard core traditional fans, had become a niggling source of disappointment."
780,6,"A franchise extended, by removing its charm.","I as a 63 year old big kid, loved Star Wars. What made the first 6 films enjoyable, were the wide ranging array of Alien like creatures. Somehow the makers of this film decided to omit all of them bar one. Why on earth remove the charm of these past films, and include a poor effort of a Darth Vader . The script was a major disappointment, and the inclusion of the primary original characters failed to inspire. The film needed a good story teller, with the humour of past works included. What a let down this was, and i am wary of the next instalment. Up dated special effects, were not enough to keep me happy."
781,10,An Epic Restart for Star Wars,"Next stop on my Star Wars review series is the start on the new trilogy, The Force Awakens. This may have been the most anticipated film I have ever witnessed and I was so excited before seeing this for the first time in the cinema and now I have rewatched it and this is my review. The premise of the film sees an ex stormtrooper, a scavenger and two smugglers team up in an attempt to stop the new regime The First Order led by a powerful Dark Side user."
782,6,JJ does an absolutely excellent job of restoring the true of spirit of Star Wars,"I don't want to go too much into plot details. So I will talk in broad strokes. The original star wars movies had a certain 'western' or comic book feel, the sound editing, the dusty and natural settings, the sound effects, the jokes and ribbing - it all lead to a sort of rustic feel. Here JJ returns to a heavy emphasis on natural settings, rustic hardware, strong sound fx, and practical special effects - the effect, along with the plot, writing and characters, is a genuine return to those things we loves about the original movies - real humour, a real 'low-tech high tech' space western with mystic elements. The lead character, whilst strubbornly indepent is a great, and realistic female lead. All the characters are fairly likable, and we get return characters. Meanwhile chewy, and bb8 hold the role of child-like expression and cuteness, to lighten the mood. Han and chewie have some great exchanges, and our new ex-storm trooper also awkwardly provides some comic relief. The action is also true to original form - not so much about scale, and time in the movie, like some like of sense overwhelming cacophany like the prequals gave us, but an epic, even gritty single crescendo of light saber and star fights - the star fights so well done, they are reminiscent of dog- fighting jet plan fights, and very compelling in their motion. Honestly, this is a completely excellent movie, even down to the semi-emo fledgling sith lord. 10 of 10, haven't felt like this leaving a movie, since the matrix. JJ, you freaking did, so glad to have you on board, and looking forward to all the other installments. Yay!"
783,4,Score Is Great And Familiar Faces Of Old But Little Else,"I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see the overwhelming number of negative reviews here, expecting the Star Wars fans to heap grandiose praises on it. There is little original here. The pacing is better than the prequels, the score still gives chills, and the effects reflect some of the improvements of late and the 3D, but the plot and dialogue is SO simplistic, and the movies length is out of proportion to the story itself, which is mostly a rehash of the original triad, updated. While there is no vulgarity, the dialogue is still aimed mainly at the middle school level, and the violence, while sanitized, is prevalent throughout. For die-hard fans, negative reviews will have no effect, but if you are not in that category, you aren't missing much if you miss this."
784,,Why would anyone give this movie a good review?????,"This was truly rubbish!!! It looked like the actors and actresses were free to make up their own dialogue. Every single scene is made to be a comedy or a magical Mary Sue moment, but the jokes are sadly lacking in at least 90% of it. Disney have latched on to the comedy plaudits they receive from pre-teens. The action was horrible. Just a horrible backward step for saga movies. Devastated I spent money to go and see it."
785,10,What the fans deserve,This is what the prequels should have been.
786,9,Great movie that should please fans and everyone else actually,"32 years I've waited for this film...OK, actually 10 years since Episode III. Well, OK less coz we only knew in 2012 after the Disney takeover that there would be another one. Lucas always said he was done. So here it finally is. Grab a beer, this is going to be a long one smile emoticon"
787,8,I Can't Believe Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's Father!,"It's going to be hard to write my thoughts on this movie without actually revealing any spoilers (which is why I use the spoiler tag), but I have to say that while it was a good movie, and there were some great elements in it, it is going to me nowhere near the original trilogy (if that is at all possible). It goes without saying that it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year, and it was hard to hide from the fact that there was a new chapter in the Star Wars saga opening up, especially since Star Wars has literally been dominating social media all year. Fortunately, when the movie hit the big screen, there was a huge 'no spoilers' movement which meant that many of us did end up seeing the movie knowing little to nothing about it (except for one major part that a friend of mine posted on Facebook – though as it is with him, it was quite subtle)."
788,10,Star Wars Ep. VII: Very good revival of the series!,"I watched Star Wars: The Force Awakens yesterday at the cinema in 3D. I am a movie lover although I don't write much reviews, but after I read quite a few negative reviews I felt that some really got this one quite underrated! What to expect more? I have watched 5 of the 6 previous movies, and I didn't really feel it was a remake even though there may be some similarities in the plot with Ep. IV: A New Hope, but I'm wondering how better could it be made? We're not having here a lame reboot, but an excellent continuation with the old characters, in addition to fresh ones that give new stamina to the series... It all made a lot of sense to me... I loved the cast, old ones are as excellent as it goes (Harrison Ford as Han Solo was my favorite), and I liked Daisy Ridley's Rey a lot... The film making and effect were wonderful... I like the ship fighting sequences in 3D, they really got me into it... The action was also very well sequenced, and let us not forget the fun part... At least this one is not a ""dark grim future"" movie... we're starting to get sick of those! So all in all this was for me a very good Star Wars movie... It got me again onto the series... I highly recommend watching it in a cinema not far, far away ;) Can't wait for Ep. VIII!"
789,7,"Forced, Rushed, But Pretty Darn Good","Well there are two roads that a low-rent blogging critic-in-quotes can take without the luck of an early screening when getting prepared to view and review what is one of the most anticipated movies ever made: either go into the thing fresh without knowing anything, or read the few Rotten green leaves of the otherwise endless red Tomatoes, and then venture into the IMDb message board galaxy, studying every negative post written about the film, including spoilers..."
790,9,My personal apinion!!,"Much better than the prequels and what everyone says. I'm not a Star wars fan, I just really like this franchise, so I'm not as toxic as a real fan. Yes, the story is pretty much the same with the characters replaced but I enjoyed it especially the visual effects which are magnificent and the sound like you don't see in another movie. The Force Awakens is clearly the best of the sequels, what follows is much worse..."
791,6,episode 4.. but bigger!!,"at one point they actually say 'remember in the last movie you watched that was exactly like this, well the death star was this big, but this movie, with it's massive Disney budget, the death star is THIS BIG!' and point to a projection of the difference in size of death stars, to firmly prove the point that this movie is indeed bigger that the original."
792,9,"Hey, I still like it, to be honest","Rewatching this, even the knowledge that this story ends with, y'know, R*se of Sk*walker can't stop me from really enjoying it."
793,7,YOUTUBE MOVIE for youtube generation... I WANT REAL EPISODE 7!...and from where those high votes comes as time goes by?,"Something is wrong when a trailer is better then a movie! Very brief review: There is no atmosphere of star wars (like technology, movie have more Gothic ""color""). For worlds and places there is too many Earth location for star wars. I mean Bespin isn't filmed in Tokyo or somewhere. It's should to be far far away remember? Dialogues are very thin, too much comedy (sometimes out of place) and like they copy/paste story from episode IV with touch of V and VI...this is more episode R (R for remake) then episode 7. I mean how can you have Han Solo and Millennium Falcon and to be so far away from SW universe? They are only reason for my ""high vote"" because without them it could been 3 or less... No filling like 35 years ago when you was sad that could not go again in cinema to watch again and again that second...now you are just sad... There is end of one era, target group are new fans not old and this movie makes George Lucas immortal now! And I think that I'm not alone when I say: I WANT REAL EPISODE 7!"
794,1,I'm so disappointed,"I still can't believe it. How is it possible to turn something special, into something awful in just two hours. The whole Sci-Fi community waited such a long time for the SW - Saga to carriing on. And then came this. One of the most ...... up movies I ever had to watch in my entire life. J.J. Abrams is one the most uncreative, non visionairy falsifier in the film industry. Every movie directed by him, has a enormous touch of a cheap TV-series. So does ""HIS"" Star Wars Movie. I say his movie because, this is not a movie made for the millions of fans all over the world, who looked forward for a new breath taking adventure. Specially for those who already read Timothy Zahn's Star Wars books, this movie is just unbearable. No it is only made to satify his own, way to big ego. He already ruined the Star Trek Saga by turning it in to a stupid crash-boom-bang movie, taking place in a parallel universe. And now he destroyed Star Wars. I just hope, that the upcoming movies will be produced under the advice of George Lucas. That would be really nice, because it hurts to read all those reviewes from angry and disappointed fans. Ant it hurts much more to be one those."
795,,"Overcomes its inherent challenges by producing a fast paced, dramatic, fun, and very enjoyable film that hits all its marks","By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works."
796,10,Shocked at all the Negative Reviews! Great film!,SPOILER ALERT!!
797,10,Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"30 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat rises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a ragtag group of Heroes can stop them, along the help of the Resistance."
798,10,"Long, Long Ago...","The perfect nostalgia bomb and a triumphant return to the roots of Star Wars - a family drama with laser swords and swashbucklers. Similar to Episode IV, yes. Amazing for it, at that."
799,10,Star Wars: A New Beginning,"After months of waiting, The Force Awakens is finally here. It was beyond good, everything you'll love about a Star Wars film is here. It does not go overboard with CGI effects like prequels did. The effects here are practical like they in the originals. It does have an awesome light-saber duel, would not be a Star Wars film if they did not."
800,6,Rey Mysterious,"Ahead of watching Episode IX at the cinema, I decided to rewatch the previous two film from this trilogy as preparation. Interestingly, I found that though my recollection of this film was that I enjoyed it, and that it was still the case, it does feel like a basic retread of the formula from the original trilogy."
801,9,People are hating on this movie and that's not justified at all,"I get it that people can hate on The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, but hating one as much is just not fair."
802,6,Force Remaking,"Rey, a scavenger meets up with a storm trooper deserter named Finn and a hot shot rebel pilot Poe and joins the rebellion to oppose Kylo Ren and the New Order. Meanwhile Han Solo teaches our three protagonists the ropes while revealing a personal tie to Kylo Ren. Force Awakens is a solid enough sequel that is fine, but lacks any real freshness or even an identity. It's all perfectly serviceable, the new actors are relatively likable (Driver in particular is impressive as Kylo Ren) but the problem is that the movie tries to be too much of a reboot than a continuation of Star Wars and even more disappointing, while we want to know more about the new characters and their story arcs, as both an AWOL storm trooper and the son of Leia and Han leading the New Order holds so much potential and yet Force Awakens is too busy ticking the boxes of nostalgia than focusing on it's potentially interesting ideas."
803,8,I thought it was good.,"I understand that I'm among the subset of people who enjoy the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, and the most recent Disney films. However, if you view these movies as ""fun for the whole family"", I think you can get away with enjoying it too. My suggestion is not that you're looking at the movie the wrong way, rather you are no longer the target demographic. I understand for example nearer to the end of this movie when Kylo Ren slices down the back of Finn, in the other movies before these, that act alone would've more than killed Finn. But I can let that slide as I would be more comfortable watching this with my younger siblings and I feel that they would be more entertained by this than the other movies."
804,6,The Force's failure,"I think this movie is the worst Star Wars sequel ever made so far. The absence of George Lucas among the ""written by"" credits is so evident that you might think you're watching a movie that has plagiarized the Star Wars saga I'm going to tell you the why without spoiling anything."
805,1,OMG it's mediocre Star Wars: The Mary Sue Awakens!,I waited for it come out on home rental markets; for that I am grateful I had the foresight to do so. I WAS BORED OUT OF MY FRIGGIN' MIND!!!.
806,,Star Wars: The Force Awakens ended up being a over hyped nostalgia movie.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens ended up being a over hyped nostalgia movie which was specifically made to pull at your heart strings and make you reminisce about a time long ago when a movie wasn't a money grab. A movie series that stretched the boundaries on what cinematography could capture: Audibly, Visually and Emotionally. Good and bad decisions were made in the other six installments but at least they took risks. This series was good triumphs evil if you train hard enough. But now it's been watered down so much that all you need is a light saber and ""poof"" you have the skills of a Jedi and can match skill for skill with a Sith apprentice. If the participation award generation wasn't bad enough in real life now this universe has been infected with it. I'm not saying it was as bad as Teen Age Cavemen (sorry Andrew Keegan). But it was like watching a movie you've seen before in fast forward. A under dog becomes the next Jedi.. Seen it! A giant moon sized ship that blows up planets... Now it's a planet sized ship... seen it! Droid makes beeping noise everyone laughs... Seen it! Someone's hand gets cut off with a light saber... Seen it! Oh that's his father... Seen it! Destabilizing the ships core blows it up... Seen it! Some one gets stabbed by a light saber and falls into a bottomless pit on a ship.. Seen it! Why do these ships have so many bottomless pits? They could have saved some money on construction if they cut out these pits. Then they would have had a few extra galactic credits to spend on auto tracking turrets to shoot rebels. But Sean it made millions before it was release, that proves my point it is blind love for something we want so bad to be good. They rushed through this movie to get you wanting to see next one. When the best part of the movie is a drone giving the thumbs up with a built in lighter.... I don't need to even say anything else... 6-7 out of 10 is my opinion...."
807,10,"""Chewie, We're Home""","After first leaving Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I remarked that it was the most fun I had watching a movie since first seeing a VHS copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark at age eight. (Though in truth I couldn't decide between Raiders, or The Empire Strikes Back which I saw the same year - unaltered.) The next morning, I stand by this statement. "
808,9,A love letter to the franchise! Superb!,"I had a chance to see ""The Force Awakens"" in 3D, which made my experience even better, despite my viewing starting 15 minutes late due to a problem with my theater's projector. In any case, this film was extremely well done and felt very similar to the classic installments. Keeping in line with the traditional beginning and ending credit sequences was a nice touch, too."
809,10,It was good movie,I very much like this movie. And see new actors in it
810,8,The Special Effects Awaken,"A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, George Lucas created a simple movie that would blossom into one of the biggest franchises in history. Over 40 years, Star Wars has managed to work its way into numerous media that keeps fans screaming in glee. After a corporate buyout, Disney has set their sights on reviving the movie franchise in the form of Episode 7: The Force Awakens. Yet with the mixed response to the prequels and dry movie spell, is the Force still strong enough to keep us entertained? Hi, I'm Robbie K and I'm here for another review on the latest Sci Fi Blockbuster, spoiler free. "
811,6,Decent,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is Decent, but no where near as good as some of the star wars movies. It's not a bad movie, but a big disappointment."
812,10,The Force Has Indeed Awakened,Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)
813,7,Yep Star Wars,Decent action movie but I guess if you are a huge Star Wars fan you thought this was the best thing since Jedi. To me they all feel kind of the same and there isn't much difference here.
814,9,Loved it!,"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, showstopper, spectacular! Now if you'd excuse me *Re-starts movie for the 56th time*"
815,7,Totally Honest TFA review,*CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS*
816,5,"Star Wars opens up with a pop and not a bang, the poor dialogue and character development is overshadowed with a surplus amount of action","The amount of poor dialogue makes the first half of the movie seem dull and poorly done. The movie seems to be a rip-off of A New Hope, the old heroes (in this case Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia and Luke) must aid a new band of heroes in defeating a planet destroying system. Similarly to A New Hope, one of the old heroes must die to give the new heroes the strength to carry on. Finn's character is one of the worst I have seen developed in a very long time, and the actor rivals Anakin's poor actor from The Phantom Menace. Rey manages to unleash the power of the force while having NO prior training or knowledge. Kylo's character has NO facial recognition to Han Solo or Leia (the actor is very talented, however). Poe's character is unique, but they choose him to take Han's sarcastic and arrogant traits too early on in the movie and detract from the serious tone. This is only a small list of the many issues the movie brings up. The biggest pro is the stunning visuals that allow for the many fan-boys to fall in loves with the newest trilogy."
817,,Don't go in with too high expectations,"I was so excited to see this, perhaps too excited. I had watched all of the theory videos and trailer analysis videos and thought I had things figured out. So when I saw it the first time, I went in with preconceived notions and a critical eye, so I ended up disappointed."
818,10,The Return of The Star Wars Franchise Is A Dream Come True,"I really didn't think that there would be another theatrically released Star Wars adventure. The prequel chapters are so reviled, it is clear George Lucas was dejected and wouldn't make anymore movies and then with the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, it became possible again. As with many others I'm sure, I grew up loving both the original 3 entries and the prequels alike for different reasons. The imagination behind the original trilogy is a feat itself and they redefined the cinematic experience. Are the prequels as good as the original trilogy? No, of course not. But they are still fun to watch and I loved them as a kid. Disney seemed to have put the right guy in charge, J.J. Abrams is a self professed fan boy and his reboot of the Star Trek franchise was completely refreshing and breathed new life into a largely dormant franchise. I went into this movie with high expectations but I admit, I went in wanting to love this film."
819,8,New Hope 2.0,The Force Awakens (TFA) returns a major element to the Star Wars franchise; fun. 
820,9,"Best Star Wars since Empire, welcome back Lawrence Kasden and thank you JJ Abrams.","It was worth the wait, that's the first thing I'll say about STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS, the very highly anticipated sequel to the original trilogy. J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasden clearly have dug deep and come up with a story that logically continues the STAR WARS saga into a new generation, one that brings back iconic figures beloved by millions of fans, while at the same time, introducing new characters with whom the audience can fall in love. Those who say this is the best STAR WARS film since EMPIRE are right on point, if for no other reason than there is not a hide nor hair nor scale of an Ewok or Jar Jar Binks to be seen. In short, there is none of George Lucas's ill-conceived attempts at being cute."
821,10,The star wars essence has awaken,"Just want to say out first, that this is my first review. I always enjoy all the ones from others.So it's time i contribute my part. I specially want to thank to all the reviewers out there for helping me choose the good movies ""for me"" and not make me loose precious time on the bad movies ""for me"". I was a little kid when i saw Star wars the first time. It was on a VHS. But still it was one of those films that touched me, and i bet many others. Then came the other two episodes, and they were awesome. Than came a long silence and 3 more episodes where out. Now, i always thought it was me that grew up and did not see the movies the same way. The magic was some how gone! Now,with the force awakens i was ""shocked"", not because of the story, not because of the special effects. It was because i felt something again. I found out that this film does what the title says, ""it awakens the force"" what i felt in episodes 4,5 and 6. I think one of the reasons is that the filming of the movie was done exactly like the other 3. They did not abuse of the digital panoramic scenes and took more real footage and put ""feelings"" into the film. And one really nice touch is bringing back some star wars memories. I will definitely go to see it again"
822,6,Very predictable plot,"Yes we love Star Wars, and this title was much waited for. I have mixed feelings after watching it today."
823,9,It calls to you,"The opening sequence informs us Luke is missing and the ""First Order"" has replaced ""The Empire."" It is lead by another helmet covered Dark Lord whose identity is revealed about 50-60 minutes into the film. By this time the other two major characters are developed."
824,7,"Good, but not great. Spoiler-free review from a Star Wars fan.","Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Star Wars. Not the type of going to conventions and wearing costumes (although the idea already crossed my mind more than once), but the type that has seen the original trilogy (IV, V and VI) more times than I'm willing to admit. Regarding the second trilogy (I, II and III) I found them acceptable movies, with some mediocre moments but also some enjoyable ones, and quite a satisfying story arc."
825,9,They did it,"Star Wars is the best fictional universe ever created, and even when you're watching the prequels that galaxy far, far away is a place you never want to leave. JJ Abrams directs Episode VII The Force Awakens, which is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi and involves the characters of the original trilogy combined with some new, equally compelling leads. It's doubtful any film has ever had so much hype attached to it and TFA being a dud would have been... I don't even want to think about it. So, was it alright? The answer to that is it was far, far better than alright. TFA is fantastic. It's a wonderful escapist space opera rooted in nostalgia and crafted with emotion, care and art. This leaves the prequels in the dust (That's just putting it nicely) and, filled with epic space action, humour, compelling characters, science fiction wizardry and most importantly of all, heart, the force is stronger with this one than it was with Master Yoda. TFC is a thrilling tale of good vs. evil, a powerful drama, a love letter to Star Wars fans, but above all it's a thrilling, emotional, unbelievably satisfying journey like no other."
826,7,Vibrant Spiritual Successor That Falls on the Shallow Side of the Force,"Disney and JJ Abrams swing hard in their effort to repair the damage done by Episodes I-III, with mixed results. Spiritually it's dead-on, a loving tribute to the original trilogy that's a stylistic and thematic clone (with several not-so-subtly borrowed plot points) that makes for great fan service. Few cinematic properties have the rich, sprawling mythos of the Star Wars universe, and Episode VII is wise to draw from that at every turn. Those shared past experiences with familiar characters, settings and devices go a long way; without six films' worth of enhancement to help prop it up, this is just an average sci-fi picture. Wonderfully produced, with long, regular opportunities to appreciate the efforts of its all-world concept artists, somewhere the steep sense of scale was lost. It's a rather thin movie, all told, one that feels decidedly less sweeping and grandiose than its precursors. Less of a space opera than an interplanetary sonnet. The new cast members seem deep and interesting, so there's plenty of hope for future installments, but it's a little unsettling that Harrison Ford so thoroughly outshines them all. It's nice to see the rest of the old gang again, even if Carrie Fisher completely phones her performance in, but Ford is the film's heart and soul. Somewhere in the next installment, those new characters are going to need to step out of his shadow and carry things on their own. A promising step forward, teasing some intriguing potential directions for the rest of the new trilogy, but lacking a lot of the invariables that made A New Hope and Empire the timeless classics they remain today. Much better than the prequels, in any case."
827,1,"Soulless, Husk of the original movies.","This movie like most Hollywood movies last few years is devoid of soul, lacking in talent and full of social agendas and pandering to social activist. As a result has left behind the original fans. Little by little the masses are becoming aware of the shallowness of what they are being shown. When a movie is put together by executives whose main objective is money rather than passion for storytelling and the arts this is what you get. The original SWs had a story to tell it created an alternative universe with its own legends heroes and laws. This is why it was so fun to watch. This last episode has destroyed all that and extracted the last glimmer of soul out of it. This director (I forgot his name) did the same with Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, as well. I don't blame him solely for that, he is after all a small wheel in the hungry corporation that is Hollywood. I am sure he needs permission to scratch his head. As to the feminism that the new movies are pandering to,; it has become so tiresome and predictable that I can not bring myself to watch any more movies out of Hollywood. It all seems to go through the same cookie cutter mold; females have to be unbeatable and need to badmouth men and tough. A little reality will make the female sex more fun to watch. I do dislike the leading role being female, not because of the sex but because of the reason she is there, to prove an unrealistic point. Keep digging Hollywood, I for one and many others I know have better things to do than waste our time with your shallow pastimes. And when we watch movies they are mostly from China, Japan, Europe anywhere but America. They have not been destroyed by shallowness of capitalism and feminism."
828,,"Witty, vibrant, and so much fun.","As someone who's a fan of the original trilogy (Episodes 4-6. I never saw the more recent prequels nor have any plan to) but who's not obsessed or in complete love with them, I went with this with good enough expectations but not expecting to be blown away. Those expectations were entirely met. Like the original Star Wars films (mostly A New Hope, which was always my favorite) this has a complete sense of fun and energy that vibrates not just with the action (and there's a lot) but with the characters and their interactions. In comparison to most Hollywood blockbuster, it's pretty standard in its structure. There's nothing here that is any huge risk, but then again none of the Star Wars films were ever incredibly challenging or unformulaic. Like the originals, this one just has such a positive energy and its formula completely works. They did such a great job casting the new characters, and in particular Daisy Ridley and especially Adam Driver (who steals every scene he is in) do some great work here. I don't think J.J. Abrams has brought anything distinctive or different in style than the originals, but I don't think that was his aim at all. He does a great job handling everything as a package, and that is no easy feat. In a time where Hollywood is filled with unimaginative, repetitive, dull blockbusters (Hello Marvel!) this joins Mad Max: fury Road as really standing apart from the flock, even if it's different to Fury Road in that it follows the formula a lot more. But if it works, don't break it, and this is surely one of the most purely entertaining, and lovable, films of the year. The praise is deserved."
829,9,"Same story from a different storyteller, love it or hate it","My first review of TFA focused on the film's objective merits, but it was massively downvoted by disgruntled old-school fans (i assume). Only after that did i find out that the vast majority of the IMDb reviews of this film are actually very negative. So after brooding over this unjustified hate i decided to write a new review, this time concentrating on the reasons why the fans might hate TFA so much."
830,9,Great comeback!,"What a hype! And it actually payed off. This movie turned out to be absolutely worth the wait. There are some flaws of course, but not every movie can be like The Empire Strikes Back. I personally got exactly what I was expecting from this movie. Great, but still, not better than the original trilogy."
831,9,A lot better than other people are saying.,"After seeing The Rise of Skywalker, I've decided to review the sequel trilogy, starting with this film, which had gotten a lot of flak for being a rip-off of the Original Trilogy."
832,9,Star Wars: the Force Awakens is Outstanding but the Sequences Need to be More Original,"Being the starting point for a new trilogy, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a great kickoff. The movie is simply fantastic, one of its accomplishments is please long time fans as introduce the Star Wars universe to a complete new generation. The spaceship battles both on some planet or in the space, the CGI characters are beautiful to watch and see the how well-worked they are, but even though the CGI is incredible, what make this film more unique is the no dependence of computational effects and by doing so, not having the artificiality of the more recent trilogy. Putting the cast in real locations to shoot, better and real performances are put on the screen also the comeback of using practical effects and models to create dozens of creatures and species of the vast galaxy, the film feels more real and pays an homage to the classic trilogy. This alliance between CGI and practical effects make Star Wars: The Force Awakens have an astonishing visual and some takes are just breathtaking. It's wonderful along with the scenes listen John Willams's so mesmerizing soundtrack, who still created some new tracks to follow so many novelties brought by this movie. It's undeniable the resemblances to Star Wars: A New Hope, the script shape has its similarities, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens has a context quite different, besides the gripping plot with new and engaging characters that will keep you on the edge of your seat while witnessing this new Star Wars adventure, but no matter how much entertaining it is, the future films can't have this likeness. The lightsaber fights are awesome, they're are brutal and violent, there's not that feeling of excessive choreography so present in the prequels, you feel the threat of its deadly power and the ways you see the force being used is just freaking cool."
833,6,Another Wasted Opportunity,Firstly let me say that I'm a huge Star Wars fan and have been since I saw A New Hope in the 70's. 
834,10,scroll hit the screen I had a grin from ear to ear,"(SPOILER FREE) STAR WARS EPISODE 7: THE FORCE AWAKENS review by: Mike  Smith   Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat  arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a rag-tag  group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance.  Wow, just wow! As soon as the scroll hit the screen I had a grin from  ear to ear. That being said, I knew what I was getting into as soon I,  and everyone else, heard Disney bought Star Wars and was making another  film.  This movie fits right in with the original 3 films, but I couldn't help  thinking of Episode 4: A New Hope. It felt just like it to me and that  is a good thing and the use of practical effects and big set pieces  helps immerses you into the film.  The cast is a good blend of young and old. It was awesome to see the  original cast reprise their legendary rolls and the newcomers blend  right in and feel like they belong to this world.  The film is over 2 hours long but doesn't feel that way at all. This  film moves at a nice pace and surprisingly has some good laughs. Also,  this film has the excitement that we've gotten with past Disney and  Marvel films but stays true to the original trilogy.  The only thing I stress is if you know anything that happens after the  original films from comics, books, video games, etc. FORGET IT ALL! Go  in with an open mind and as a blank slate, sit back and enjoy. And  remember, life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch and  may the force be with you   10 out of 10"
835,7,You had an easy job and you blew it,"This new Star Wars movie looks like the uninteresting saga of Transformers which includes everything that any Star Wars fan hates: lots of explosions, poor CGI and bad timing jokes. I am in fact surprised that Rey was not wearing a hot cleavage."
836,8,An exciting beginning to the end,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a good film. The cast gives convincing performances, due to a wonderful mixing of established and new characters. Character development is largely well done, enhancing the emotional depth that captures audiences in the plot's most intense moments. Comedically there are on and off moments with some spotty dialogue, but character rapport is ultimately aided by these fun moments. The action sequences are notably thrilling, particularly during hand to hand combat. The score is spectacular, too. Unfortunately, there are under-explained developments that leaves too much for the audience to question. The storyline also feels copied from the original trilogy at points. Still, the plot is an exciting, shocking adventure with various interesting characters caught in a stirring battle of good and evil. Ultimately, this feature is undoubtedly a worthwhile addition to the franchise."
837,6,More of a reboot than a sequel,"Everything is back to square one. The empire is back. The rebels are back. Leia is still the rebel leader. Han went back to being a smuggler. The Jedi are still extinct. They just made a New Hope again. This is poor story telling. They should have spent more time on the script, but apparently Disney didn't want to invest in that kind of quality. It's a shame."
838,5,this is pretty much what I expected,"It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn't understand the plot until I listened to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"" (a parody of ""American Pie"")."
839,,The strongest of the new trilogy.,A new empire rose. A young man fell to the Dark Side. A Stormtrooper rebelled. The Force awakened in a young hero. Lightsabers ignited. An old Jedi Master removed his hood.
840,8,May the force be with you even if it is a flawed force,"Let me start by saying that this is a really amazing film. One that we all should sit and enjoy. It really is something to behold. JJ Abrams has made many great films. I loved the first Star Trek it was something new and cool to me, and while I don't think JJ made as good of a film with Star Wars as he did with Star Trek I still think he has done a really good job here and should be completely proud of what he made. "
841,8,They really nailed it!,"I you compare this episode with all the others, it really stands out when it comes to the acting performances and visuals."
842,9,Abrams is Successful in Awakening the Force,"Foreseeing the franchise's potential in the future, Disney has invested brilliantly by taking over Lucas Film and nominating Abrams as the director of Episode VII, who has done everything just right in reviving the fantasy saga. Having himself written the script with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, the film finds itself recycling the basic formula - An adventure beyond the galaxy, loaded with ton of action sequences, sense of humors and emotions, but the most important is the overall improvements from the last prequel 10 years ago. While the story is much predictable, the lightsaber fight might not as epic as the original trilogy and the ending seems a bit unpleasant, the return of the original cast mixing with fresh bloods creates a great chemistry in developing the climax, the visual effects are undeniable marvelous thanks to its wide angle cinematography and breathtaking CGIs, even the scores from John Williams, powerful as always to hold audiences at their seats until the end of credits roll. Although being formulaic, less darker antagonists and certain characters are underused, Abrams is still successful in awakening the nostalgic force of this galactic sci-fi adventure."
843,10,Worth the wait!!!,For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!
844,7,Better titled as A Newer Hope,"Oh my god, I just got done re-watching/reviewing the trilogy prequel by George Lucas and always lamented how poorly written/directed they were right from the outset but my gourd, how much better The Force Wakens started than those! Though JJ Abrams wrote/directed this one, at least there's a small army of producers and a different editor. George ""I have control issues"" Lucas' prequels sadly had no other input than his own. The first chase scene was weak though, Rey, with Finn, commandeers the Millenium Falcon without any biometrics or start codes, hmm, then she navigates it expertly albeit accidentally, but c'mon, she should've crashed this within the first 10-secs, then through ""Hollywood magic"" the two rookies best two trained TIE fighters, ugh, this again. But this was redeemed in a subsequent scene when Rey/Finn attempted to trap some raiders on a freighter but unleashed nasty monsters instead. The rest of the action/story was pretty decent except near the end as the planet 'sploded, those rescues were lazy deus ex. But just at the end when you're noticing that the old gang is all re-unioned except Luke, Rey finds him as an old Sith-lord looking hermit. Without a word, she immediately offers his lightsword, but the way JJ filmed it, it comes off as if she's offering a Coke to him, weird. And that's how he ended it, also weird and unsatisfying."
845,10,Well-done,"The Force Awakens is about as faithful a Star Wars movie as one could hope for. Return of the Jedi is a challenging movie to make a sequel to, but J.J. Abrams and company have pulled it off. While perhaps not quite on par with the originals in terms of sheer innovation, the latest installment in the saga succeeds in that it draws ample inspiration from the original films without trying to outdo them. "
846,6,"I know everyone expects me to rate this with A+. Well, I m sorry but I'm not American, so that's not going to happen.","I know everyone expects me to rate this with A+. Well, I m sorry but I'm not American, so that's not going to happen. If you are a Star Wars fan, that is a nerd erected by childish light swords, stupid robots and hairy creatures, then you'll be thrilled to know that the movie respects it's past, picks up where the last six (!) episodes left and generally speaking it will definitely please the fans of the series. Nevertheless the movie is disrespectful with those who seek something new and lacks emotion. The most strange and spectacular things will happen (again) but there is nothing to remember the next day. Compared to it, the latest Mad Max entry seems like a philosophical work. What I'm keeping from this movie is the performance of Daisy Ridley (currently no 1 in IMDb starometer), an unknown English actress starring as Rey, that you'll be hearing about in the future."
847,9,"Return to the beloved fantasy adventure, Star Wars: The Force Awakens will be a journey many will cherish for years to come.","Rejoice fans of sci-fi and fantasy, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is as good as advertised. It follows the footstep of Episode IV, using gallant action adventure theme with lighthearted and effective humor. The characters are very approachable, both the new heroes on the path of finding their selves and the old veteran who will produce such irresistible nostalgic effect."
848,6,Star Wars Episodes VII - The Force Awakens,"Good movie, but very disappointing, the movie could have been one of the best Star Wars movies, but due to Disney's stupid policy, they spoiled the movie and the third, the movie characters were really bad, especially finn character and Ray ,Kilo Rain was a bad villain who should have been on the same level as Darth Vader, but he was the worst villain in the Star Wars series, and Ray could defeat him without knowing the presence of force while he trained by Locke and after him, Snook, and it was an inconsequential scene. I wouldn't recommend watching it, especially if you liked the original trilogy."
849,1,A Knife In The Heart.,Forgive my pretentious summary but thats how I felt after seeing The Force Awakens on Friday the 18th of December 2015 at the IMAX theatre next to the science centre in Glasgow.
850,,Promising,"The 1970s and 1980s gave birth to a mode of movie-making not seen before. Look at it this way. In 1939, after uttering the iconic ""Tomorrow is another day"", Scarlett O'hara need not have disappeared from the silver screen forever. Twenty years later, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable (respectively 8 and 1 years before their demise, I grant you) could have shot a sequel showing how the stormy relationship between Scarlett and Rhett carried on in the next twenty year. But the audience never got a glimpse of Scarlett's ""tomorrow"". All you need was someone to think of the idea. But nobody did. Not until in the 70s."
851,10,A refreshing and imaginative continuation,"(Note: this movie is a 9/10, I rated the entire trilogy as one story with a 10/10)"
852,10,The force will be with us. ALWAYS!,"I am writing this review to clear the air about some of the things the haters are saying as well as to explain clearly reasons to love and be excited about this continuation of the franchise. I personally loved the movie overall but I can admit that at a couple of moments I felt an internal eye roll occur however neither of those moments was a deal breaker for me regarding the movie. First we wills start of with the haters. They complain that the plot is just like episode IV, or is it just like episode VI, they really can't decide...OK most of them say IV."
853,8,Re-Inforced,(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)
854,9,"""I will finish what you started...""","...that might just have been what Abrams could have said to George Lucas, because man, Abrams did do a lot of things right, and compared to Lucas' prequels, this movie is SO much better. I listened to a pod cast where the host said ""This was So good, now I can finally just FORGET those dang prequels, as this movie makes up for how bad they were""."
855,7,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Review: Fun but Nothing more,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fun movie. I thought that all of the action scenes were great and they kept me on the edge of my seat. All of the new actors were fantastic in this movie. Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron) delivered great performances. I loved the relationship between Poe and Finn instantly from the moment they met. My only problem with Poe's and Finn's relationship is when it's established. For example, Finn helps Poe escape the clutches of the first order (which is evil) by stealing a space vehicle. Poe and Finn escape the fist order ship and then are immediately attacked by enemy vehicles. Poe and Finn use their vehicles weapons to attack the oncoming enemy vehicles. While Poe and Finn are attacking, they laugh and have a good time as if they aren't currently in a life or death situation. Poe and Finn eased through the situation like it wasn't life or death... which that is something I can not believe. Finn and Rey have a really good relationship that doesn't feel forced or unnecessary. I do have a problem with one of Finn's and Rey's action scenes... Finn gets grabbed by some squid looking creature. The creature uses its tentacles, grabs Finn, and then it carries him away; I should note that this creature has been eating people nonstop, whatever is in the creatures way, it's going to get eaten, and yet it doesn't want to eat Finn for some reason. Rey saves Finn by closing some doors on the creatures tentacles. That whole scene between Rey, Finn, and the squid creature felt pointless and unnecessary. Kylo Ren is threatening and hostile; This man can go berserk and attack anything or anybody at any given moment. Harrison Ford (Han Solo) steals every scene that he's in. Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) is efficient. The scenes between Solo and Leia are really magnetic. However, I feel like Leia has nothing to do in this movie except for have scenes with Han Solo. SPOILER ALERT: Han Solo dies. I didn't mind his death scene, I actually thought it was pretty tense even though I saw it coming. It's when Leia tells Solo to bring back their son is when I knew Solo was going to die. SPOILER ALERT: Kylo Ren is Han Solo's and Princess Leia's son. I didn't really know how to take that information at first... I was shocked. However, there's one scene of exposition where Leia and Solo explain to the audience what happened with Ren, to me the dialog felt a little clunky, but Ford and Fisher delivered their lines with grace as clunky as they seemed. SPOILER ALERT: Luke Skywalker is in the movie for 15 seconds. I thought Skywalker was going to say the lines from the trailer to Rey, but he didn't; Rey finds Skywalker on a mountain and he just stands there, and then it's over. I was wanting some Luke Skywalker, I was waiting for some Luke Skywalker, and I got 15 seconds of Luke Skywalker... I was a bit disappointed. I know they're coming out with episode 8 and that ones suppose to answer the unanswered questions, but just have this movie feel like one movie. movies need to feel more condensed and confined. I don't want to watch a sequel or a prequel to understand what's currently going on with the movie I'm watching. Have the movie run on it's on two feet. Overall, I had fun with this movie, but that's all I can say. The characters, the action, and the actors were all great, but I just didn't really care that much about the story. This movie didn't have any memorable scenes and it didn't leave me with anything to wrap my brain around. Ultimately, by the end of the movie I felt really disappointed."
856,9,"The best one thus far, don't get the negative reviews.","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Force Awakens. I read tons of reviews stating this one was the worst and now after watching it I wonder why. To me this one was the best Star Wars thus far, equal to The Mandalorian. Everything is just much better, the acting (even from actors that were in the first movie, when you compare them now they're just much better), the special effects (they're just outstanding compared to the early ones), and the story wasn't bad either. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One that I thought was of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the nineth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely four days for me, next one today will be The Last Jedi. I hope it will be of the same quality or even better than The Force Awakens, looking forward to it."
857,7,I met the Force (again),"Am I the only one believing that the peak of the career of J.J. Abrams as director and producer was (up to now at least) 'Lost' - the captivating series which dominated the TV screens in the second half of the previous decade? A couple of things are obvious beyond any doubt. Abrams is a passionate of science-fiction, and he has Gargantuan ambitions as he tries to make his mark on many of the major brands of the genre (and some of its action spins) from the MI series, then in Star Trek ( with the 2013 Star Trek Into Darkness) and now with the film that starts the last series in the Star Wars trilogy of trilogies - Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He did not convince me yet on the big screen that he is the same original thrilling creator that made of 'Lost' the series that made people change their weekly schedules even in the era of Internet availability of everything, but he certainly succeeded commercially and this film is 'in danger' of becoming the best cash machine in the history of the movies industry, displacing another film which was not IMO a masterpiece either - James Cameron's 'Avatar'."
858,9,"""Chewie, we're home""","The Force Awakens is a continuation of the ""Star Wars"" saga, balance returns to the Force as the First Order, emerging from the ashes of the Empire, clashes with the Resistance, which includes scrappy newcomers as well as heroes from the former Rebel Alliance. "
859,6,Good enough for now,"Watching this movie was an odd experience. It was entertaining and well made, but didn't quite feel like a Star Wars movie. Most everything was handled well--the effects looked good, the dialog was fine, and some interesting new characters were introduced. My first impression after one viewing is that it's not a great movie on its own. The things that people will like about it are the pieces of the original trilogy--the characters, settings, and story beats redone for the fans who grew up with them. The one element that I thought they got entirely right was the character of Rey. Her arc from desert survivalist to powerful hero was maybe enough to make new fans out of first time viewers to the series. The rest just feels like fan service, albeit done very skillfully."
860,1,"The force was with me,my intuition saved me from seeing this movie.",I actually had free tickets for this before it was released and i had 2 weeks to go see it. Some circumstances made me miss it a few times and I went the last day of 2015 but was to late than so I missed seeing it again.
861,,Definitely the Worst of the Bunch,As a big Star Wars fan who loves to watch them over and over I was already on guard when they brought in JJ Abrams the man who ruined Star Trek. Force Awakens is hard to watch. So many of the characters are either annoying or just dull & vapid. The concept is the weakest of all the shows partly because it is cloned. I find myself getting annoyed to the point where I migrate to the other Star Wars that came before it.
862,8,now i like star wars,"Great movie, very entertaining, well-made with great directing, lots of cool scenes and shots. Good acting and likable characters. great villain. Fun with some good humor as well. (3 viewings 12/31/19)"
863,10,A fresh and exciting return to the Star Wars universe!,"Star Wars is back.....there it is, that very phrase. After waiting over 30 years for a good Star Wars film we finally have one, and it was worth the wait."
864,9,The Force Has Awakened,"The wait is finally over. After years of wondering if Lucas would make more of these or if he would sell the franchise elsewhere (Disney), Episode 7 is finally here. I was never into Star Wars as much as the majority of the population. I loved the movies, but I wasn't staying awake at night thinking about where the Jedi are now, that is, until about a year ago when the first trailer came out. After seeing the Force Awakens twice on opening night, I'm now one of those hardcore fans. With that said, I don't see how anyone wouldn't love The Force Awakens. It's full of nostalgia for the longtime fans, plenty of humor, great effects, and some of the most emotionally driven action sequences I have seen this year. It's directed by J.J. Abrams who is responsible for reinvigorating life into the Star Trek films a few years back and expanding it to reach a broader audience. Star Wars didn't need a bigger audience, because it's easily the biggest pop culture phenomena of all time, but Abrams does a fantastic job nonetheless. Even more so knowing just how difficult a job it is to make a film that not only starts a new trilogy but honors what came before it. Abrams handles that seamlessly."
865,9,JJ Abrams delivers a good one.,*** Please don't read on if you don't want spoilers****
866,6,Made for the Money,Part of what made the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes such good films is that they were episodes within a larger story _and_ good films in their own right.
867,9,"""Chewie, we're home.""","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams (Star Trek, Lost) and stars a compelling cast of new and old faces; Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels and Mark Hamill. "
868,7,"Cute, pretty, funny, but shallow and not especially interesting","The new Star Wars has spot on casting, is beautiful to look at, and is a familiar adventure. However, it lacks the spiritual depth of Lucas's original vision. You also can't use the word original to describe it, because everything in it has been recycled from the most popular of the other Star Wars movies. The one thing it does improve upon is the comic relief, which is the only thing that surprised me. Without the new humor and the chemistry between Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, this would just be a very predictable and sparkly retread."
869,10,JJ Abrams made Star Wars cool again!,"JJ made something that previous trilogy missed; strong characters! Star Wars are back on track as we return to essentials: lovable, heartwarming and inspiring characters. Rey and Finn are future of saga! BB-8 had same effect that R2D2 had in original trilogy and known characters fit in well."
870,7,Finn should've been the main character,It's a good movie except for the Rey bits. She knows legit everything and it's annoying and not relatable. The movies that follow this ruin Finn as a character and reduce him to a character who is only capable of saying REY. Poe was pretty good in this movie but under utilised just like Finn. It's a shame because it had potential until they sidelined Finn and Poe in the sequels...
871,3,"Overall, a fairly weak effort","I was going to give this film 4/10. However, way too many people clearly walked out of this film and gave it 10/10 on IMDb without proper objective assessment and were too caught up in the hype. One thing I can say for sure: this film should not be in the top 250 films of all time and should not have an overall rating of 8.6. To bring balance to the force, I'm going to slightly under-rate it."
872,,Farts,"This trilogy is extremely impressive in that its that bad its almost good, lol."
873,10,"""A New Hope"" for a New Generation","Ten years ago we never even dared to dream of finding another ""Star Wars"" movie hitting theaters after ""Revenge of the Sith"" ended. In fact, many probably hoped/prayed there would never be another opportunity to ruin ""Star Wars"" again. Then Disney bought Lucasfilm and a new age dawned."
874,8,A soon-to-be-classic entry in the greatest film series of all time!,"It's finally here - something that some fans have been waiting 32 years for! (Although the last theatrically-released Star Wars film, 'The Clone Wars', only came out seven years ago). Since I wasn't born until after 'Return of the Jedi' and grew up watching them on VHS and am a pretty big fan, the sequel trilogy (as opposed to the prequel trilogy) and 'The Force Awakens' has long been hoped for."
875,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"The prequel sucked! Then Disney bought the rights from George Lucas for $4 billion. The third trilogy involves the original actors and is a sequel to the 1977-83 stories. Of course, it is more than 30 years later, and everybody is old. The Force Awakens is close to the 1977 film. Harrison Ford returning gave it credibility. The audience applauded. The interracial thing between Rey and Finn would not have cut it in 1977. Modern audiences seem to desire that kind of thing. Han Solo will not be back, and neither will Finn unless he is somehow magically restored. I thought the film had good energy and lots of humor. I am glad I saw it."
876,9,The Force Awakens Fans,"After two of the three prequels seriously bored and unimpressed audiences, and the third garnering a little more attention, the Force is back and Star Wars awakens the stupefied and disappointed audiences. No longer are we laden with inane expository dialog, wooden characters, and uneven direction. Star Wars - The Force Awakens has given the franchise a serious shot of adrenaline. It starts about 30 years after Return of the Jedi. The Empire has retrenched itself with the First Order, while the Rebellion has also has turned into the Resistance. In charge of the First Order, is Kylo Wren, Dark Jedi who is prone to fits of anger and is laden with a mysterious, dark past. Wren, along with General Leia Organa of the resistance, are searching for Luke Skywalker, who mysteriously disappeared years ago. The search begins on Jakku, a desert world where scavengers trade old scrap pieces for a day's food. We meet Ren, a loner who seems to long for someone to return in her life. A few people do come into her life: Poe, a resistance pilot looking for Skywalker, BB-8, a droid with some secret information, and Finn, a former Stormtrooper who develops a conscience and decides to leave the First Order. To escape, they must use an old familiar flying hunk of junk. Once they do, they meet the actual owner, a lonely, older smuggler we have grown to know and love. Once he learns of the quest, he decides to help. He eventually reunites with Leia and works to launch a strike against the First Order's new weapon: a Star Killer (a really, really large Death Star, which is actually a hybrid of a natural planet along with technology). It is in this adventure that draws the old and new cast together. Backstory is revealed, characters are developed, and some twists and turns spring up without it being corny or sappy. As the characters mesh with the story, direction, and effects, we are left with a thrill ride laced with great humor. There were a few strikes against the movie. In the return of Han Solo, we have another back story that evolves into a muddled mess with strange alien creatures that was forced. Another was the fallback to use another Death Star. Although it was done slightly different, the Empire or First Order should probably give up on this idea as the rebellion has been able to destroy three out of three. J.J. Abrams and his team have reinvigorated another sci-fi franchise, proving George Lucas was the biggest weakness in the prequels. In this day of bloated special effects, weak stories, and wooden characters, this one returns Star Wars to its majesty of yesterday. Now if we can just wait for the sequel."
877,6,"Warning spoiler: Great ride, great potential plot, incredibly poorly written and edited.","I think this review says it all. I loved the ride so much that I watched it twice the same day in the theatre. However, there are so many unrealistic plot holes in this movie that really take away what could be a great film. It's like the producers and everyone are so caught up in the hype they forget to see the obvious disconnect that make my stomach churn. I echo the following review from huffington post by Seth Abramson: To blow up the 120-km ""Death Star"" in Star Wars, the rebels needed detailed plans for the base and a full-scale invasion force -- as well as the supernatural targeting skills of the most powerful Force-user in the galaxy. To destroy the exponentially larger and better-protected ""Starkiller Base"" in The Force Awakens, all that was needed was a janitor with no special skills, a few run-of-the-mill hand-held explosives, a couple not very difficult X-wing blaster strikes, and some moxie. It also helped that the Millennium Falcon was able to ""fly low."" 2. The wily Han Solo loses track of his most prized possession, the Millennium Falcon, for more than a dozen years. He has no idea where it is -- in the entire Galaxy. When you lose something in your house, that's bad; when you lose something on your planet, you kiss it goodbye but pray for a miracle; when you lose something in the entire Galaxy, you just get on with your life. And yet, less than a minute after Rey begins piloting the Millennium Falcon, Han looks out the window of his freighter and says, ""Oh, there it is."" 3. Kylo Ren, a powerful Force-user, fights a light saber duel with an ex-janitor who has never held a light saber and yet (a) never uses the Force on his opponent, though doing so would have ended the duel immediately, and (b) barely wins the fight, suggesting that he is simultaneously one of the least strategic wielders of the Force the Dark Side has ever seen and, despite his training, absolutely terrible with a light saber. None of this stops Kylo Ren from designing and building his own, completely impractical cross-barred lightsaber."
878,9,New Awakens,"The Force Awakens marks the first Star Wars film produced after the franchise's acquisition by Disney, and it served as a highly anticipated return to the galaxy far, far away. The film's director, J. J. Abrams, had big shoes to fill, and overall, he did a commendable job of bringing the Star Wars universe back to life."
879,7,Fun while it lasted,"It was good, but I wasn't as thrilled as most people were. Visually, it was very well made and the action scenes were cool, but the pacing could've been faster. Star Wars is usually known for fast action scenes. The story was interesting and so were the twists. So it was a good time, nothing more."
880,8,a worthy successor to the star wars franchise,"So watched the film once, and was really happy with it. Watched a second time and was more inspired to write this review."
881,6,Corporate-constructed entertainment,"I have to agree with many of the mediocre reviews here. I think once the Disney PR-driven, socially-engineered hysteria has died down, and the hardcore fans and trolls have gotten bored, The Force Awakens will eventually come to be regarded, like other JJ Abrams films, as a fun, but ultimately hollow, experience. There is no point rehashing most of the criticisms that other reviewers have leveled, but I think I can sum many of them up this way: the plot of this movie feels mechanical rather than organic. It's exactly what one would expect from a committee of people who were hired to sit down and construct a piece of ""art"" according to corporate specifications. Here's a checklist, guys, now make sure your script checks off every box. It's not easy to write a screenplay that way while still maintaining the feel and flow of natural storytelling. You end up with a whole bunch of scenes that probably sounded great when they were pitched to the execs, but don't resonate with the audience when they are assembled together on screen because they haven't been earned."
882,3,Let the farce be with you,This episode follows the steady decline in-line with each successive Star Wars movie.
883,,"After the disappointing prequels, Star Wars is back on track.","I know people hate the prequel films; who doesn't. I for one didn't hold Episode 3 in high regard either, but it was at least watchable, to a certain degree. I guess some are not as jaded and cynical as others, but to each his own. For a while, it seem that old magic of the OT couldn't be recaptured or restored to the rightful vision. It seem that Star Wars was doomed to be something of ridicule, rather than the cultural phenomenon that it once was; starting especially of course, with the first film to the last of the OT. But having said that, after coming from seeing TFA, I'm very pleased to report that the force is strong once again in the new film, Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens!! Gone is the cringe-inducing dialog, gone is the stiff, wooden, mechanical acting of the prequels(though they had their moments, but ultimately,uneven)gone is the overuse of CGI without a purpose or support to the story. What is here is what the OT was all about. Well-written characters, superb and at times humorous dialog, great action scenes, but most importantly, a great plot. Without spoiling it, there are numerous twists and turns and even some Easter eggs thrown in for good measure, that while as to remind longtime fans, but surprisingly, add to the overall narrative and it makes the film equally coherent as well as entertaining; something the prequels never achieved despite the high quality production values in accordance with the visuals."
884,8,Great return for one of the best series,"Star Wars has just burst back into life again, bringing with it new faces and old and a story that although familiar, is still epic. J. J. Abrams brings us back into the galaxy far far away and makes more than just a good little movie; he makes a great and massive film, filled to the brim with stuff to just simply enjoy. Now I'm not going to write this and pretend this is perfect, it has some mistakes I felt but they aren't massive really at all and in the big picture, this is very good indeed. The plot brings us new characters like Rey and Finn, Poe and BB-8 but then also those like Han Solo, Chewie and the Skywalker siblings who altogether make this a lovely experience to behold after so many years."
885,8,Very good movie,"Well first of all I am great fan of the SW franchise and also a big fan of JJ Abrams. He is indeed a terrific director. I saw this movie along with my wife for the first time as a couple. We really enjoyed the movie in 3D. As far as the story goes it is a typical JJ's way of story telling and it was so cool. As somebody reviewed earlier that JJ is not a fan of SW. Yes I agree but he is a great fan of the Star Trek series and I believe that he has made this movie like a ST movie somewhere on the line. Though a few characters were missing in the movie but still the movie was awesome. Daisy Ridley really stole the show in this movie as well as John Boyega. Oh! And BB8 was so very cute and really caught the heart of the audience. I was actually expecting Mark Hamill to be at least be joining from the middle of the movie but in the end he appeared and looks like his presence in the end will surely be a turning point in the next sequel. The visuals were overall great but it could have been greater but still it was good. I don't know how others judge this movie. Yes... for some people it maybe a disappointment because they would have expected a ""larger than life"" type of this movie but for me it was really great movie and two thumbs up to JJ and his team for the great effort. Keep up the good work JJ..."
886,9,Loved it,"Being born in the 70's I'm part of the generation that grew up with the original trilogy. It was basically my childhood, the movies, action figures, magazines. I know the original trilogy inside out. I still watch the originals every two years or so, they still work for me, haven't lost any of their charm. I was almost 30 years old when the second coming was, and while I did see them at the movies once, I never really returned to those movies. I tried to watch them before Force Awakens, but didn't get past The Phantom Menace. I remember the two following movies were better, but still never got around watching them again."
887,10,"Familiar, New, and Wonderful","Awakening with a ""Twinkle in the Eye"" and a Comforting Feeling, this new ""Star Wars"" Movie has a Medicinal Effect the way it Smoothly Releases the multitudes of Fans from the Coma brought on by the ""Prequels"", and Energizes Youngsters not completely aware of what has Come Before."
888,7,"Not as Bad as People Say, Not as Good Either","The Bad: A Good Complaint is the main character Rey, she's a Mary Sue. You can't really say she's not & stay honest. But we saw a small version of that in Ani in The Phantom Menace & we were able to get over it...or at least our focus shifted to how bad Hayden was."
889,10,"New director, new plot, still the Star Wars I loved","You might have read other reviews, where a lot of negative feedbacks are given, most commonly you might see 'it was just a reboot of its past episodes' or 'it was nothing like George Lucas' Star Wars films' and etc. But I think most people by now know that when there is a change of director within a franchise, you'd expect the movies to have a lot of contrary. Different directors have different techniques and intentions, so you can't expect them to be the same. "
890,7,Disney = The Empire,"What power does this corporate entity have over movie ""critics""? The first trilogy got pretty tepid reactions from the ""critics"" but the fans spoke with their $$ and repeat viewings."
891,8,Nice movie,"Overall very nice movie with a good characterization of almost all the characters, the special effects are beautiful and the action scenes are masterful. As defects there are the management of the emperor and the protagonist, as the first is not even seen practically and the second is senselessly too strong right away."
892,7,Not original but good if you loved the classic,"So I have been saving the latest Sar Wars movie since there isn't anything worth watching in the cinemas at the moment, and I finally watched it in the New Year's day. The verdict: I enjoyed it, but don't think I would bother watching it again. I don't think I would call myself a Star Wars fan, but I love the characters and the concept. I have the entire DVD collection, classic and modern, but I don't buy memorabilia and I don't remember many details about the movies like a lot of fans do."
893,4,The Trailer was enough,"Even with low expectations I was sadly disappointed. The trailer was so much better and exciting than the movie. Poor filming, poor editing and spending 2 hours with actors who had no idea what to do or how to act in some scenes is not something I want to reward with my money."
894,,"I shook my head, I cried, I was saddened!","I avoided watching this one for the longest time because of the bad review, and I should have just let it be. You go through an emotional roller coaster because it is Star Wars and you want it to be good but my instinct was right. The IMDB reviews are bang on. This film is as non-essential as it gets."
895,9,"Yes, it really is that good","This movie does everything right. Right from the start, I was sucked into the story. It may not have the sort of punch that Mad Max Fury Road had, but there are so many ways this could have gone wrong, and I'm so glad they did it right. Lets first touch upon the main criticism that I've seen about this movie. People say that it follows the structure of the original movie beat for beat. And yes, this is true. However, the movie also does plenty of innovation and world building of its own. And so this movie does feel new, even though it follows the same structure."
896,9,"The Force is Strong with this one, but first, let's go Beyond!","Today marks the end of one long wait and the start of another - with The Force Awakens finally here (my review is further down this page, be warned, whilst I won't be going out of my way to spoil the film, I cannot guarantee no spoilers), I feel it's a good time to reflect on that journey."
897,10,I enjoyed this,This was a perfectly enjoyable film A fun refresh of the franchise.
898,8,"Don't bother with the waffling reviews, see the movie and judge for yourself","Having watched SWTFA several weeks ago now, I have given myself sufficient time for consideration of an appropriate reply. However, I think as a 47 year old who was around for the original trilogy, I would like to leave only one simple piece of advice. Watch the film for the enjoyment factor first and foremost, save the analysis to the posters here who have 2 hours to spew blah on the comparisons to previous films, directors, themes etc etc, ad infinitum. I wanted to feel like an 8 year old again and did. The rest is just cornflakes. The opening credits, the X wings on the horizon across the water and Solo on the bridge of the falcon should be enough to jog the emotion cells of anyone who has an imagination. Don't bring baggage by reading 50 reviews, just get blown away by the feel good."
899,7,A New Hope version 2,Contains very insignificant spoilers.
900,9,A great film.,This a very good movie. Star wars a new hope is better. The Empire strikes back is also better. The return of the Jedi is also better. I know most of you will not agree with this. The phantom menace is also better. I do not think a lot of people will agree with this either. Attack of the clones is better. A lot of you will agree with this. Revenge of the s.i.t.h is also better. I and I know most of you will not agree with this. Star wars clone wars is better. But still. This is a great film. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. This is one the best science fiction movie from this decade. See it. See all the Star wars movies.
901,6,Predictable and stupid but OK,"The visuals of this movie is good but it doesn't have the star wars feel to it. It looks more like J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies than Star wars. The story is literally a remake of episode IV so it's very predictable. There are so many things that doesn't make any sense too. For example Kyle ren who was trained with lightsaber his hole life faces Rey and Finn, and they defeat him! I don't know how they were thinking here... It takes years and years to become a master with the lightsaber and I'm just supposed to accept that Rey and Finn who NEVER even touched a lightsaber before can DEFEAT a sith who has used Lightsaber his entire life! I have to give some credit to Harrison Ford for his amazing acting and I really feel he lifted the movie from a 4 to a 6. They killed of one of the things that made the movie good?! Do you really have that little imagination that you can't come up with a better idea than building another Death Star? And if you think it is creative because you built it in to a planet and made it bigger, it's not a four year old could have come up with that. List of more stupid things: Cross- guard, stealing thoughts from people minds, movie made out of nostalgia, same story but with different faces and names, lame fights etc. I only gave it a 6 because harrison ford amazing performance otherwise it would be a 4."
902,9,"Escape now, hug later.......","Years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, the galaxy faces a new threat from Kylo Ren and the First Order. "
903,7,Repeating the mistakes of the past,... and even the story - mostly of the very first Star Wars movie. I am expecting teddy bears with Mickey Mouse ears for the 9th episode and Death Star Nr. 4 - only half kidding. The kids not knowing the first movies will love this one though.
904,2,Glad I did not pay $ to see a good franchise drown,"I am happy I did not pay money to see this. We saw it on Starz. Hubby and I stopped the movie to eat dinner and realized we were only 30 minutes into it. It was slow. 30 mins felt like an hr or more. First Order? What the hell is that? If Lucas did something like that, it would have been in 1, 2, or 3, not way down the line like Disney. Having a group called the First Order would make the group the first. what is so 'first' about it since stormtroopers and sith are already established? Disney could have said the Order is before or started when the Jedi came into being. It would have made some sense. The First Order can be a new enemy, but then there would be no dark side. They just threw in an enemy it seems. A revised version of the dark side. We want a new movie, not revised, especially since our beloved Star Wars characters are dead or aging. The graphics are good because that is what Abrams does-delivers good graphics and not much else. What about the guy on the throne? He looks like something from Harry Potter. Ooh, big evil guy who wants himself to be menacing. Sidious was menacing in his own right and did not need to be gigantic. Covering his face with a hood did it all."
905,,Start wars opens its galaxy's gates,"Fantastic fun film. Loved everything about Star Wars the force awakens. Yes there are flaws, yes we have seen certain things before but history does repeat its self and I personally think it's a good thing. <br /><br />I loved the original trilogy and love the new ones too. Die Hard Star Wars fans will miss the opportunity's available for a new Star Wars trilogy but I'm sure it will come after J.J Abrams has had his fun. Rouge one was a taster. I believe a lot of negativity has developed because there are a few Disney haters out there. <br /><br />The force awakens has the music, flare and special effects that I bet George Lucas wish he had on the first Star Wars. This movie plays homage to the originals and brings it bang up to date. It's a fun movie not to be taken seriously. Go Bb8!!!"
906,10,Some people are just plain spoiled brats,"OK I went to this movie with my wife a few days ago and have to tell you that this was so much better than I ever thought possible. All these people that want to compare this to episode 1V are just the type of people I am sure that just can't be pleased no matter what you do for them. Wake up people with boring lives, This is STAR WARS driven by the best part of the force. I consider this a continuation of brilliance at its finest. You people that raged on this movie so bad did see it, right? not so sure. Please continue this story for years to come. This has made me a bigger fan of Star Wars. I thought the acting was Top notch especially Harrison Ford. I mean he stepped right back in that roll perfectly. Some people said this was predictable, Really people this is Star Wars not Forrest Gump . Relax spoiled brats and enjoy a good movie for what it is."
907,8,looks like a lot of people really hated it,"Somehow, even with all the hatred, Star Wars: The Force Awakens managed to bring in 2 billion. "
908,10,J. J. Abrams reboots another franchise and literally knocks this one out of the galaxy,"With all due respect to George Lucas, J. J. Abrams has taken this incredible franchise to the next level and added a little more dimension to the once rusty characters that the original master created. The movie itself has absolutely stunning graphics and a new story line, which was very well constructed. In a hyphenated word it is awe-inspiring and well worth the price of admission."
909,8,First time I watched it I loved it second time I watched it loved it even more.,Loved this movie to put it simply. Nothing crazy about it but definitely lots of good things even great things. Playing it safe but also doing it extremely well. I wish Rey would have been a Kenobi but oh well.
910,6,"A very well crafted action film, but horrible as Star Wars","JJ Abrams somehow managed to do exactly what he did with Star Trek-make a flashy, technically well made film that's fun on a certain level, but fails utterly as Star Trek, or in this case Star Wars. It's like he's watched some of the franchise, but doesn't really 'get' what it's about."
911,9,Tough call,"There are a few ways to look at this new addition to the STAR WARS Universe, the seventh in the series, and this time in the proper sequence."
912,7,It's hard to say the truth,"It took me some time thinking to myself if I should write something about this new SW movie and upcoming trilogy. I have to say that I really got skeptical about this new movie. As a huge fan, in my heart I wanted a new movie so badly, so deeply! But as a grown-up (not much of a grown-up, though), I must review it deprived of any passion. Let me say that I really enjoyed JJ's Star Trek. Why mention that? Well, wanna change everything in a long line of movie sequels and large canon time line? Throw time travel in the script. It's plausible. And it worked as a charm for Star Trek. Maybe I'm saying that because I'm not a hardcore ST fan anyway. Truth is, it worked nice to ST. Now, I'm not saying that time travel would had worked to SW. ST has a more diversified universe and saw time travel before. I guess it wouldn't had worked to SW at all. But neither worked throwing and flushing away decades of lore from such a gigantic expanded universe, like that of Star Wars. True, not everything is likable or really an original idea in the SW EU. But there were millions of fans around the planet that suddenly had all they knew about SW gone into nothing. Years of reading, thousands of dollars spent in books, comics, etc. Now everything is gone. And for what? Only to see SW turned into another teen action paced movie. I understand, of course, that this is business. And as for business what count is money. Disney bought SW from Lucas. SW is an endless goldmine. As Lucas had grew weary from directing/producing/writing/filming/making-up/bossing around, he sold SW to Disney. What Disney supposed to do? ""Let's change everything. We must harvest a new wave of fans"". I understand that. Do money. And I comply with those changes. That's how things work. What I don't understand here is the total lack of creativity. What I don't understand is a bigger Death Star. Another SW character falling down a deep well/high place (looks like it was not enough throwing Luke in Cloud City, Emperor in Death Star, Darth Maul in Naboo, Master Windu in Coruscant.) Aside from being almost a reboot, it lacks a great villain. Kylo is nothing but a brat, an emo, an adult man acting like an spoiled kid. Hux fights for having the attention from Supreme Leader Snoke, whom clearly doesn't know what he is doing. BB8 is just a piece of merchandise for Christmas (face the truth, he has a cool visual, but all in all, he's boring). Besides, come on, another super high important blueprint hid in the droid's guts??? Dude! Kylo is clearly beyond his 30's, been trained as Jedi for probably years, but he knows squat about the Force. Doesn't know how to build a proper light saber, doesn't know how to handle a light saber in battle. He practically lost a duel with the New Order janitor!! And how the hell a New Order trooper working in the sanitary crew knew how to handle a light saber? In the other hand, Rey suddenly is almost a Jedi master, doing mind tricks like she had done them her entire life. I could easily stay here and keep criticizing SW TFA. But that is just to hard to a true fan, because despite the fact that I really felt weird about JJ taking the lead of a new SW movie, I also had a ""new hope"" that this time things would end up nice. But I can't remember even the musical score. What happened to SW being an space opera? The real cool thing to remember is that dude with that baton blaster."
913,8,New cast is strong in a decent Star Wars outing,"Force Awakens is a nice start for the Disney-era of Star Wars. Its not the greatest Star Wars movie ever made, but they put together a very solid nucleus of young actors to build the new trilogy on."
914,6,Could have and should have been better...,"The ending to this messy, nostalgic nonsense brought home the fact that J.J. Abrams really does know better. So why doesn't he ever DO better in his movies? One of the things that made the first trilogy immortal was Lucas's epic focus on simplicity, gathering us around relatively uncomplicated characters and scenes stretched out into longer scenes and eventually, before you know it, the whole movie was over and imprinted on our souls forever. And this movie also proves that the golden age of casting is in the past for Hollywood. The lead chick in this future Oscar winner for Best Visual Effects does little more than cutesy her way through, uninterestingly, from beginning to end. Albeit she was definitely part of the glue that held this thing together, the other part being HARRISON FORD. Of the old actors that make their appearance, he is the one who still has the old magic on screen, proving that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg once knew exactly what they were doing. What story there is here just falls flat until the very, very end, when we are briefly, and impressively, reminded of why we still care about Star Wars in the first place."
915,1,The Force Falls Asleep,"Well I finally went to see the movie, with a total of 5 others in the theater! As I feared, the force has fallen asleep. This was pathetic as I kept seeing the same story, the same roles, doing the same things and everything else as it was before. Heck, even the animated chess board on the Millennium Falcon was activated (and probably right back to where it was left 30 years ago)! OMG is this the best they could come up with? Really? Hiding underneath the floor/deck in the MF, is that all they can think up? Oh but hey, the MF has a new radar dish on it, rectangular shaped vs round...30 years allowed for that significant advancement."
916,,Masculine Looking Mary Sue,"Lying Is A Sin, Hollywood"
917,8,A Good Start to a New Trilogy,"Looking at the trailers for this film, I was worried The Force Awakens would have a tone closer to an original JJ Abrams film than to the original Star Wars movies. Boy was I wrong. This film has all the quip and action of the original trilogy, making it an enjoyable ride for this viewer. The only differences in style are actually improvements: the cinematography and the image quality."
918,8,Surprisingly good,Minor spoilers ahead.
919,8,"Fun, nostalgic and thrilling","J. J. Abrams' first pass at Star Wars was an incredibly fun, nostalgic and thrilling experience. Despite the gap in years between the first movie in 1977 and this instalment, the main feeling was that we picked up right where we left off, both in tone and scale. We were also introduced to incredible new characters in the form of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Finn (John Boyega). This is one of the best reboots in recent memory."
920,8,"Fans rejoice,simply put the new Star Wars film is bloody brilliant! The force has truly awaken...","Its been 10 years since episode 3, and after waiting so long to see a Star Wars film that resembled episode 4.5.and 6 rather than the newer lot of ep. 1,2, and 3, as a Star Wars fan, my dream came true. The force has truly awaken with episode 7, and JJ Abraham as a fan boy of the series has steered the greatest film franchise ever back to its glory. I am going to try and keep this a spoiler free review because a lot did happen in episode 7, and I don't want to let the cat out of the bag for the true SW fans. But the nostigala feeling this film gave me was a high I wish I could chase forever. I was in awe seeing Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Chewie, and Lelia on the screen again. The film was paced so perfectly that the film was not even boring for a second, action, and drama was at its premium. The film almost finished at a blink of eye. While episode 7 is miles ahead of episode 1,2, and 3, its almost on par with episode 4.5 and 6. Which is bloody brilliant to say the least. But more on the analysis later."
921,6,"Fun, but nothing I haven't seen before","Let me just start by saying that I never intended to see this movie in theaters. I was going to just watch it when it came out on DVD, but I decided to see it yesterday. My co-workers were excited about it, and I thought, ""What the heck."""
922,8,"Only a Stuck-up, Half-witted, Scruffy-looking Nerf-herder Wouldn't Like The Force Awakens.","This is it. The Big One. The Grand Fromage. The last (biggest) movie of 2015. After years of mysterious announcements, casting rumors, story leaks, nerd speculations, and some amazing trailers, the epic space opera of complex-good vs. complex-evil is back, and in full force. Jedi Master Abrams, consciously and good-naturedly aware of the task he has been given, delivers an adventure every bit as fun as its predecessors, keeping intact the heart and soul of what we love in these films, down to its beautiful imperfections. Feel free to believe the hype and know that your question of ""Will it live up?"" will quickly disappear. It's like we never left the galaxy far, far away. It's Star Wars, inside and out, unabashedly biting elements from its origins while sweeping us along in new ways. Having learned from the dreaded CGI-drenched prequels, it's chocked full of practical effects, beautiful creature designs, and stunning sets. Even more importantly, the characters are wonderfully original and perfectly nuanced, especially newcomers Ridley and Boyega. I don't wanna say too much here in case you're one of the 3 people in the world who hasn't seen it yet, but be assured: Jar Jar Binks & Anakin Skywalker they are not. Thank God for Abrams, a fan-turned-filmmaker who knows what makes these movies great, and only uses modern techniques and tones when appropriate. Sure, it's every bit as big and bombastic as you could want in a Hollywood blockbuster, but it's the smaller nuances in the characters that will keep us coming back another 40 years later. Thrills, inspiration, humor, and heartonly a stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder wouldn't like The Force Awakens."
923,7,The Force Awakens - Movie Review,"""Chewie, we're home"". "
924,10,Great movie,"People only gives bad reviews all because there's no Paul walker, Vin diesel, or Dwayne Johnson in it. It all matters on looks these days not the plot or comedian, just looks. Moana is boring and not even funny people only gave it good reviews all because Dwayne Johnson was on it not the plot itself. The light saber fight was good the sound effects sounds so awesome and it's awesome when more than 1 event is happening throughout the star wars films. Once again people only gave it bad reviews all because there's no Paul walker in it or Dwayne Johnson or Vin diesel. People only rate movies base on looks more than the plot and comedian."
925,6,"An alright blockbuster - lots of flash, not so much brain",It's endearing the see people cheering at a screen and clapping to actors and reacting emotionally to every scene on the screen.
926,3,A lazy mess spray-painted gold and covered in sparkles.,No Spoilers.
927,,Nailed it!,"AMAZING actors, unique new characters, huge happenings, great humor. This is a memorable, record breaking, POWERFUL Star Wars movie. "
928,8,Star Wars: the Force Awakens works because it feels fresh and new yet still old and familiar.,There aren't really spoilers in this but I will put up the spoiler alert anyway.
929,9,New Zealand Premiere Review,Saw the film at 12:01 last night. 
930,10,I have never had a more delightful experience in the theater,"I have never been so excited for a movie as I was with TFA. Everyday leading up to the movie, I never neglected in keeping myself up to date with fresh news concerning the film such as trailers, promotional videos and articles about the cast members, (avoiding spoilers, of course). I could have never been more excited for this film. Yet, I had some doubts that it wouldn't live up to the hype. How could it possibly please Star Wars fans enough that their expectations would be fulfilled? Well, all I can say is that this movie completely lives up to the crazy hype. Simply put: it's visually stunning. It's positively delightful. It's immensely enthralling. It's emotionally strong. And most importantly, it feels like a Star Wars film, it is a Star Wars film. I have never been more delighted at a theater. While I experienced this remarkable movie, there were times when the fun made me smile so much that my cheeks hurt. There were also times when the emotion made my throat choke up and my eyes swell up with tears. You could tell that there was so much thought and love put into every scene, and every single character in the film understood the importance of their roles they were playing and delivered perfectly, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is undoubtedly extraordinary."
931,9,My New Favorite Star Wars,"Why are all the reviews for this movie so negative??? Whenever I click on user reviews for a good movie like this one, why are the only reviews that come up 1s and 2s? Why does IMDb decide to put all the negative reviews at the front of a movie with a rating in the high 8's when a terrible movie like Pixels has all 9s and 10s??? I find it extremely odd."
932,6,Fanservice brought to you by J.J. Abrams,"So when Disney bought Lucasfilms and announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films, I was initially skeptical. We had just gotten over the disappointment that were the prequels and it seemed like the originals were going to be tarnished."
933,9,Ignore the Negative Reviews. I bet they aren't even Star Wars Fans.,*****SPOILERS!!!!!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT THE BEGINNING/IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE MOVIE SPOILED FOR YOU! BE CAREFUL PLS**** 
934,7,Star Wars: The Force Awakens... again,"SPOILER ALERT! If you are one of the ten people who have not yet seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens, stop reading now. If you are one of the three people who have never seen Star Wars at all, this movie will leave you seriously wondering what just happened."
935,8,"A New Hope for the franchise, The Force Awakens brings Star Wars back to quality form","Let's get one thing clear: there is absolutely no way in the modern economic structure of filmmaking and Hollywood are we ever going to get a sci-fi trifecta as good as the original Star Wars trilogy. Just ask Indiana Jones what happens when you try to revive a severely beloved franchise in a new era decades later (*screams in agony*). And with the Disney Regime having their fingerprints all over the product you know there will be limitations, there will be questionable decisions, and the eggs will never be in the same basket."
936,7,"Fan Service nice and all, but please don't insult my intellect!","In advance I have to tell that I am a conservative fan, who saw the original movies (New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi) in theaters in the 70's and the 80's."
937,1,"A film for ""true"" Star Wars fans","Consider the state of the galaxy at the end of Force Awakens. The Republic? Gone. Han Solo? Gone. (Written out, as if never existed.) A small band of Resistance fighters struggles against the evil forces of a mysterious dark lord. The only hope are the descendants of Anakin Skywalker. Just like at the end of Revenge of the Sith."
938,,My biggest dislike about TFA,"SPOILER???? My biggest dislike (or disappointment) about this movie is that it does not incorporate the Expanded Star Wars Universe. I was so looking forward to a big screen movie about Jaina, Jacen and Anakin. Would have loved seeing the Jedi Academy. I know somewhere on IMDb this has probably already been discussed, I'm just too lazy to go hunting for it. Disregarding the fact it does not contain the expanded Universe, I'm actually going to have to watch it a few more times before I can truly give any complaint/compliments as I can't get my head to stop thinking about all that I have read in the Expanded Universe. Last night was my first time seeing the movie. Even though I have it on Bluray/DVD/Digital we were able to see it on the big screen as a second feature at a drive-in and there were just too many distractions. All in all, I guess my question is What does everyone else think about TFA not being about the Expanded Universe?"
939,9,"The Familiar Opening Text Promises Another Tale In a Galaxy Far, Far Away...","A couple years ago, it was widely reported that Disney acquired Lucasfilm and all of its IP's for a staggeringly large sum of money. What was more of a surprise is that within hours of sealing the deal, Disney had announced to create a further 6 Star Wars movies all to be released by 2020. Maybe it's all too much but look at it this way, the House of Mouse owns male interests for pretty much the rest of their lives, this and Indiana Jones."
940,8,The biggest surprise of The Force Awakens is it's GOOD! (fanatic criticism with only slight bias),"It's impossible to review a Star Wars film objectively, and yet that is the task when assessing the seventh installment Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The franchise is part of our culture at the molecular level, meaningful in a million different ways to a million different people, from $27K mint edition Boba Fett toy collecting superfans to the totally Lucas naïve who could nevertheless hum the imperial march theme in a pinch. Any given moviegoer's feelings about the new film are the result of a complex equation. Certainly it's a product of age, peer group, inherent interest in space operas, but it's also a function of time spent swimming in the nearly 40 year old cultural ocean that is the Star Wars universe—anywhere from browsing casting news on social media as an adult to disrupting chemistry class with Chewbacca growls as a teenager to daydreaming about what your own lightsaber would look like as a kid (guilty of all three). It's easy for most of us to float detached while watching the fanatics go deep sea diving in the Lucasfilm trench, thinking we've outgrown this world, only to realize after watching the first trailer for Star Wars 7 that we're also still submerged, our feet soaked and pruney."
941,10,Star Wars: VII Review 10/10,"Okay let me just say, that this is one of the best goddammed movies of all time, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens changed my life and inspired me to create and write my own short films, and i thank J.J Abrams for creating one of the most innocent and exciting movies of all time."
942,10,"scavenging a strenght through lost identity chasing a will to survives ones unknown past,","I have been a been a big fan of star wars forever as I remember of the first 3 films from George Lucas with a new hope , empire strikes back and the return of the Jedi we were introduced to Han luc Leia, Chewbacca Ben and obi wan ken obi cp30 and r2d2 and Darth Vader with the force of dark and the light we all knew Luke was trained by Ben ken obi i they find out who Darth Vader is as we know Darth Vader sense about a child hidden from him so any way we come the prequels as the introduce a young an akin sky walkers training with obi wan Kenobi who has the powers and over the course of 3 films we watch as Anakin is turned by the lord sith and slowly changes him to the dark side and becoming Vader so with the new star wars comes a visionary director for recharging old films and exploding them onto the big screen I avoided the trailers so I wouldn't be disappointed this film has it all in it surprises mystery suspense nods to the characters that are related in some way this film takes place 30years after the events of return of the Jedi with Luke leaving something behind on a desert to be cared for I'm worried about how much I should actually say. Disney and Lucasfilm have been very clever in how the film has been marketed and for once none of the film's twists or surprises have been spoiled in trailers or advertisements leading up to the film. I can't even talk about the first line of the now famous text scroll at the start of the film this brought back fond memories of old star wars so the new film . In the wake of the destruction of the second Death Star and the apparent defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new army known as the First Order has risen in their place. The mysterious Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) leads a group of stormtroopers to the desert planet of Jakku to search for a particular item. What exactly the item is will not be spoiled here! They encounter a Resistance fighter by the name of Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and the resulting fire fight leaves Poe's droid BB-8 on the run and one particular storm trooper (John Boyega) having doubts about his place in the First Order. BB-8 soon encounters a scavenger by the name of Rey (Daisy Ridley this is her film ) and everyone sets out to fight the dark side and get BB-8 back to the resistance while encountering some old friends along the way and that's all I can say with wandering into spoiler territory. All the cast are on top form with the likes of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher reprising the roles of Han Solo and Princess Leia as if they had never left. The new cast are perfectly introduced and immediately feel like they have been here all along with everyone's old favorites. That being said, this is absolutely Daisy Ridley's film as Rey. She gives the best performance of the entire film and I wish I could go on and on about it but it would spoil so much for anyone who hasn't seen it. Kylo Ren is a fantastic villain that has so much more depth than any of the Star Wars villains before him because he has his name that stands for something else . He can quickly go from being stoic and menacing, to lashing out in a fit of rage and trying to cut someone's arm off with a light saber. Domhnall Gleeson is great but doesn't get enough time to shine as the sneering General Hux, leader of the First Order's Starkiller Base. Surprisingly The Force Awakens is also one of the funniest films of the year. Some of the jokes have to do with throwbacks to there a few twist in this that will shock a few people the original films but many of them are just plain hilarious. BB-8's attempt to give a thumbs up might just be the funniest thing I've seen all year. I have seen some complaints that The Force Awakens is almost too similar to the very first film at some points with the plot. And yes, Skellig Michael absolutely gets its part in the film after all the press coverage the filming was getting all those months ago. While I can understand where they're coming from, for me The Force Awakens somehow managed to tread that fine line between fan boy service and fan introduction. It welcomes you back into the world of Star Wars but if you've never been a fan before it's just given you plenty of reason to stay and become one. I can honestly say The Force Awakens deserves to be seen by everyone and but to see the other films to under stand everything that happens in the universe here as to clues in the film go online to see I loved this and nostalgic as well fantastic action scenes and fighter pilots well what can I say if your not with the force now you will never be 2hrs15mins of pure heaven 10/10"
943,7,Kind of a let down,"I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 just for the shots of the Millennium Falcon, Chewie, and Han. The special effects were great as expected, but the story line was flawed. The two main characters were OK, but it kind of went off the rails with how they both were able to fight Kylo Ren. He was a master of the force and based on his abilities shown early on was even stronger than Darth Vader. However he was easily bested by both someone who never heard of the force and another who just learned of it. Imagine if we went back to Star Wars and instead of Luke learning about the force, then Empire Strikes back where he trained with Yoda and finally met Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi: Imagine if Luke never found Obiwan. Never practiced with a light saber and instead found one in a storage room. Met Darth Vader and then defeated him. Lame lame lame. Build your characters over the movies. I guess in the next one they will find some brand new character that kills Snoke with a slingshot and a smooth stone."
944,10,Way better than I expected!,"So, The Force Awakens is really one of the few 11/10 movies in my book."
945,6,A remix of the original Star Wars,"Just saw the movie, some spoilers ensue. It's basically a remake/remix of the first Star Wars movie masquerading as a sequel. All the famous scenes and characters from the first film and some from the second (Empire Strikes Back) are re-imagined into this one. BB-8 is R2-D2, Rey is the female version of Luke Skywalker, Finn is Lando with little bit of Han Solo in him, Kylo Ren is obviously Darth Vader etc. There's a version of Obi-Wan's death scene remixed with the famous I am your father scene from ESB. There's another Death Star (this time even bigger!) which they destroy. There's images and lines taken from the original film and obviously the original actors make an appearance too for maximum nostalgia factor."
946,8,"Fun, thrilling, and epic; a bold new reintroduction to Star Wars",WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS!
947,6,Solid reimagining but lacking any new ideas,**Contains Spoilers**
948,1,The Assassination of Star Wars,My expectations were high in anticipation of the new Star Wars episode. The raving reviews and huge success at the box office made me believe this was the best ever Star Wars movie.
949,,pretty good,"maybe, I am too old for a new beginning. but the enthusiasm for the new part of Star Wars remains low. not ignoring its admirable virtues - young actors giving life to new characters, meet with old friends, beautiful cinematography, presence of Max van Sydow, a seductive new character and a mysterious one. but, out of the small lovely gifts , essential is a big problem - the film has not a story. its story. pieces from the other parts of series are puts together. all is well known and the promise for another eight parts not could save very much.sure, it is only the beginning. and the target is a new generation. but the first detail looking for in the case of Star Wars is discover the roots of events. in this case , maybe, the roots are reduced at the humor demonstration. or at shocking solutions as the death of Han Solo. but,expecting new parts, you must hope the better."
950,8,Not bad....,"As a fan of the original 3 movies, I had high hopes for this film. I wasn't too disappointed. To me the film felt almost like a remake of the original 1977 movie. With the exception of Han Solo, the presence of Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker was a bit over hyped with Mark Hamill's Skywalker only getting a few seconds screen time late on. I don't think Daisey Ridley is a particularly good actress and certainly not to carry a film such as this. I thought her performance was stilted. Harrison Ford pretty much pulled off his return as Solo. Overall the film was very entertaining but think it lacked the wit and charm of the original movie."
951,9,A great return to a beloved saga!,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is beautiful. After watching Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, this is without doubt the second best film in the sequels and the entire saga, number 1 being TROS!"
952,8,A good star wars movie,Didn't know what to expect going into the theaters but came out really excited and interested. The plot was driven pretty well and the set ups look set set for a really good conclusion. Was into the movie and enjoyed the action and the overall story.
953,9,Imperfect as a whole but it gives 'Star Wars' it's dignity back...,"I must confess that I am someone who is a huge 'Star Wars' fan. I know you hear the story so often that it blends together but seeing the original trilogy for the first time really cemented me as a fan of film. Abrams for the most part knew how to play me and for the most part I will be honest his fan service works like a complete charm. 'The Force Awakens' has concentrated moments of what made the originals so magical and they will surely please the hard core fans. When it comes to judging 'The Force Awakens' on it's own merits and not it's nostalgic joys than the film has some cracks, nothing crippling mind you but 'The Force Awakens' is an imperfect film to be sure. What it gets right though will make you believe in the force again."
954,7,"Good, not great","Not as good as IV, V and VI. Better than I, II, and III. Didn't come close to capturing the magic of sitting in the theater during the first Star Wars film."
955,8,A strong start for this era of 'Star Wars'.,An enjoyable beginning to the sequel trilogy!
956,7,Disappointingly derivative,"I went with my 8 year-old son, who was super excited beforehand, and wasn't disappointed."
957,8,"Flawed, but it's still Star Wars","J. J. Abrams couldn't have had it easy. He had to bring back Star Wars for the diehard fans, had to appease those that didn't like the prequel trilogy, had to take into account the new fans... all the while working for the Black Mouse of Disney, who's notorious about keeping it clean and family friendly."
958,6,This Movie was Disappointing.,"This movie is Starwars and we can all love it because of that but it has way to many flaws to give it a decent rating. I would give it a 6 out of 10 at best. The reason being is that it honestly just feels like a massive repeat of previous Ideas and plot lines in the original trilogy. It just saddens me that 30 years or so after darthvader dies the rebels or 'resistance' as they now call themselves, haven't managed to build themselves anything significant to fight the first order. There is so much wrong with the acting and characters. There is WAY WAY WAY to much forced comedy. It felt like Starwars notebook at some points and if they had that fake TV laughter in the background it would fit perfectly in a lot of the jokey funny moments, which there were too many of. There are multiple cringe moments and times where it just didn't feel right at all. "
959,5,An Unimaginative Remake of Episode 4,"My expectation going into this movie wasn't so high after the prequels but even with that, the movie succeeded in disappointing me. The greatest failing of this movie is that it is not a new movie. It is basically a remake of Episode 4 that tries to mask itself as a new movie. The main story is exactly the same and even many of the details are the same. The lack of originality also extends to the universe. There are no new planets and few new races. Star Wars never had a great story, even the originals, but the amazing creativity made up for it. This movie lacks the most fundamental aspect of Star Wars, it is in fact even worse then the prequels in that regard."
960,,Passionate Homage,"Continuing the Star Wars saga can be both an exciting and tough decision. Aside of the fans' disappointment from the prequels, it is a serious task to make a new trilogy as good or even better than the original. And what The Force Awakens chose is to start with sheer nostalgia. The result of the new story is rather more intriguing than it is great. But the greatest feat of the whole is how downright fun it is. Whether you're a Star Wars fan or not, you'll just find this as an ultimately entertaining movie. And since this is only the first movie of this reborn franchise, it is already pretty good to what it is."
961,8,The Force Awakens,"This movie was very very entertaining! I know the two that come after are meant to be bad but this one I enjoyed a lot. The acting, Daisy Ridley is quite literally perfect for the role. The effects and action was great. My favourite of the whole Star Wars series."
962,8,"For me, by far the best Star Wars' since ""The Empire Strikes Back""","Excellent, and a lot of fun, even if it occasionally crosses that thin line between reboot and re-hash. But if a Star Wars movie is going to be in many ways a re-do of an earlier episode, than thankfully, it's a re-visiting of the very first and still best episode 'A New Hope', And thankfully J.J. Abrams is directing, since he seems to be able to channel the beloved film- makers of his youth (Spielberg in ""Super 8"", Lucas here) and actually make this feel more like loving homage than creepy imitation most of the time."
963,9,Star wars episode 7 the force awakens,"A new order threatens to destroy the New Republic. Finn, Rey and Poe, backed by the Resistance and the Republic, must find a way to stop them and find Luke, the last surviving Jedi."
964,10,J.J. Abrams made The Ultimate Star Wars sequel. This is the film you are looking for.,"What J.J. Abrams achieved is astonishing, and something to remember for all eternity. I can't talk about specific things, because this is like the ultimate spoiler film, but... "
965,6,I found it long and boring,"I am not a hard core fan, but the original trilogy was a nice childhood movie."
966,10,"Saving ""Star Wars"" from George Lucas","J.J. Abrams managed to deliver what fans have craved for the last three decades: a ""Star Wars"" film that is actually good. The film manages to capture the spirit of the original trilogy, and presents it with skilled acting, plausible dialogue, and ass-kicking feminism. The similarities to ""A New Hope"" seemed specifically intended to identify the film with the original trilogy; the differences were great enough that the film remained deeply satisfying to watch. I'm eager to see how the ""Star Wars"" universe develops now that it's finally in capable hands: Abrams and his associates understand Lucas's creation better than Lucas ever did."
967,6,The repeat strikes back..,"For me JJ Abrams is a synonym to quality productions, not memorable or full of sentiment movies but quality, illustrious, polished end- product. And Episode VII is just that. A polished version of the previous films. And in that aspect it is very good indeed. As for the plot and the neoterisms that it brings to the franchise then I must admit it fails miserably.."
968,9,Who cares if it's not original? It's brilliant!,"A perfect coming together of plot, great characters, well-placed humour, lovingly created settings and, of course, a big dose of nostalgia."
969,6,Quick review,"1. The story was taken from Star Wars 4 = What were you thinking Disney? 2. Really nice effects = Good work 3. Movie is on steroids = To fast phased, never had the chance to relax and enjoy the scenery, felt like i was stressed through the Movie 4. A lot of scenes were bad as the one where a man was talking to a couple thousand storm troopers. And a huge imperial flag in the background...Felt like the scene was taken from Adolf Hitler 1937.. 5. There was no time for me to enjoy the adventure that Star Wars is all about 6. Characters were bland. Black guy from the hood? hahaha Always being the funny guy and stressed out?? 7. The movie could easily be split into two parts. Instead you have one shallow movie 8. No depth in the Movie 9. Just a mediocre sci fi Movie.. Nothing more.."
970,3,"Original Trilogy fan, not so much a fan of this one","I waited to rent this on DVD, after what JJ did to Star Trek I wasn't willing to go see it in theaters. This version was slow, Kylo was not menacing when he took off his helmet, and like his grandfather in the prequels, which I try to forget ever happened, he is a whiny baby. And man o man I wish I could be as good at everything I tried as Rey is. I'm saddened by this movie because I didn't even have high hopes with JJ at the helm, and I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, so much so that I even have a VCR at my house to watch the originals that way, all JJ did here was try and put a movie together that threw in as much from the original trilogy as it could. It was an OK movie, that's why I gave it three stars instead of just one, but it is not one that I will be revisiting any time soon."
971,,Wasted Money on the DVD,"A waste even at $11<br /><br />I waited for it to come to DVD but even that was a waste of money. Loose ends, pointless diversions and inexplicable characters, creepy appearance by a dead actor, CGI for the sake of CGI... well you get it. Miss Ridley is lazy and has masculine hair and she has one facial expression, and that's not enough to save this mess."
972,8,Better the second time,I must admit that I was a bit disappointed when I first went to the cinema but I went again today and liked it more than I thought. 
973,10,A Monument to a Legendary Franchise,"What was it that captivated so many back in 1977 when Star Wars was first released? Was it the revolutionary advancement in practical and CG effects? The idea that space was so large and new, yet we care for these amazing characters like they were our neighbors? Was it the lightsaber? Or was it the simple line between good and evil, the Dark Side and The Light? To me, the answer is all of the above, and then some. After a shift in ownership, and a 32 year wait for a true sequel, Star Wars returns to the world in the form of Episode VII - The Force Awakens (TFA), and returns the legendary name to its rightful glory."
974,10,VII is a lucky number: Star Wars Episode VII truly deserves the name Star Wars,"I am only going to be brief here. I am not going to discuss the plot, the story nor anything else specific, and I am not going to include anything remotely spoilerish."
975,10,Amazing! I feel like a kid again!,"When I was 15 years old, I read a review in the local paper for Star Wars. Well being a sci-fi reader, and a lover of adventure stories, I was intrigued. When I got to the theater that hot summer day and saw all of these other people in line to see the original Episode 4, I felt this amazing excitement running through the crowd. Like all of the others who were there for that moment in time, I will never forget it. No one had ever seen anything like it. There were no big stars, only the amazing reviews. And were taken to a Galaxy far...far away. A place where planets were like continents. All you needed was my favorite souped up girl, the Millennium Falcon, and my favorite pilot of all time, Han Solo. Rake, scoundrel, sexy, antihero, funny, brave, so lovable, and always up for a good fight. Yeah, I would have had his kid too Leia! Too bad he turned out to be a sociopath. I digress. I was very skeptical of this movie. There was SOOOOO much hype. But after my beloved Star Trek J.J. Abrams reboot, I just had to give this a chance. My son bought tickets for Christmas day. I don't know how we got in. Wow, I haven't seen these kind of crowds since Avatar. It was sharing a moment again with not only my generation, but also a whole new one. My son for one. It was the best Christmas present I've ever gotten. I have the first trilogy on DVD. My son and I are going to have a SW marathon and then go see the movie again. I don't know if he will understand why I left teary eyed. I have read other people saying that this is a remake, but it's not. J.J. gave us all the touchstones of our youth while making the way for the next generation. He re-established the wonderful mixture of comedy, tragedy, and on the edge of your seat action of the original. It's so refreshing to see a real fan make a real fan's movie for real fans. I didn't see it as a remake at all. It was just a new wheel within a wheel. Everything makes a circle. And I loved so much seeing it come around again."
976,7,A Crowded Blaze of Nostalgia and Charisma,"As with any film that has the buzz of The Force Awakens, it's easy to slip into hyperbole here. But in many ways, this is simply a very well- crafted example of a typical modern blockbuster. It just happens to be Star Wars, and in that it is both a blessing and a curse."
977,8,A spectacular Comeback,"After almost 30 years Star Wars created hype among its fans and me too. I was very eagerly waiting for this movie to hit the screen. The Force awakens is in touch with force of action, adventure and fun. J.J Abrams had a perfect vision and there was no flaw in his direction. The terrific performance from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, the new Dark Lord with a terrible secret was gorgeously cruel, spiteful and capricious. I would say J.J Abrams gave a new breathe to Star Wars through 'Force Awakens'. It's a very good movie, I'd say, and should entertain audiences both deeply and casually. I was very impressed with visual effects and the overall story which continued from last Star wars episode. I would go with 4/5 for spectacular effort by J.J Abrams to bring in Star Wars back."
978,6,World war two in space,"It is great to see older characters still playing key parts. It should be fun to see star ships and alien pubs. However, it is the same movie over and over. "
979,10,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens – A Winning Combination of ""A New Hope"" and a ""Newer Hope""","The plot of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (hereafter ""SW:TFA"") is as follows – a group of freedom fighters must escort a beeping 'droid containing information which may be a critical key in defeating an enemy bent on universal conquest. Golly gee, this sounds an awful lot like ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope"", doesn't it? Some ""SW:TFA"" viewers have grumbled about director J.J. Abrams pulling this ""moth-eaten"" plot out of the closet. I think it's a stroke of nostalgic craftiness."
980,6,Entertaining but over-rated,"The good: They went back to the feel of the original series. The scenery, the ships, the characters. It seems they learned from the fiasco of making the prequel's ""modern""."
981,1,Why? Why? Why was I bored to tears? They messed up Star Wars!,The only thing good I have to say about this movie is that it has some pretty good looking special effects. If it was something other than Star Wars I would give it a better rating but since they messed up the Star Wars brand with this movie I'm giving it a resounding 1 out of 10. They killed Star Wars! Even more mind boggling to me is the high rating this movie received here on IMDb... ???
982,,The Force Awakens!,"Set in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Force Awakens (also called Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens) takes place about thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi and follows three people. First is Resistant pilot Poe Dameron who, while trying to obtain intel regarding the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker is taken hostage by the First Order, a military power that arose from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Second is Finn, a reformed First Order stormtrooper who frees Poe from his captivity before they crash-land on a desert planet. And third is Rey, a self- sufficient scavenger who after encountering BB-8 (Poe's droid) & Finn, embarks on an adventure that finds her & Finn joining the fight alongside the Resistance in order to bring down the First Order, commanded by Kylo Ren, a dark warrior strong with the Force."
983,10,Can't wait for the next one,"Well honestly I got a nostalgic feeling during the whole movie and that might be the reason I think the movie is so great! What I don't feel that people are getting is that this movie was more to show us that the torch was handed over from the old generation to the new one. They could have easily have included the ""new Death star"" in upcoming films and that they are in a mission to destroy it throughout the whole trilogy. But no they decided to make a short remake of Star Wars IV but with more focus on the new generation."
984,8,Promising relaunch of the franchise,"It's good. Everyone just relax, take a deep breath. It's good. Borderline great even. J. J. Abrams has managed to bring back Star Wars like it was in the original trilogy, though naturally updated to the new century and with a spin of his own."
985,8,Excellent start to a new trilogy in the Star Wars franchise...,"1st watched 7/14/2020 - (Dir-J.J. Abrams):<br /><br />Excellent start to a new trilogy in the Star Wars franchise. This movie has the same energy and appeal as the original with a very similar storyline, but I didn't really care that this was the case. It starts with the patented pre-story scroll that we have expected from the series, and we learn that Luke Skywalker is missing at the point where he was supposed to be training a new group of rebels, and the ""First Order"" is now the new Empire with the rebellion just hanging on by a thread....sound familiar? The character ""Rey"" is a lonely parent-less new Skywalker-type and is already filled with the force, but is a slave without a hope or purpose for herself. The rebellion determines that a droid has a map to find the actual Skywalker, but lose it and it gets dropped off on Rey's planet and she acquires it. At the same time - the First Order lead by a Darth-Vader type character(who happens to be the child of Han and Leia) also is aware of this, and the chase after her and the droid begins. I guess they both believe that finding Skywalker will have a major impact on the campaigns because he will decide to continue what he stopped doing when found ? (this could be a stretch) Finn is a character who is similar to Hans in the original movie, but is a defector from the dark side's army(actual he is a sanitation person but still a part of them), and wants to help the rebellion now. They pick up the Millinieum Falcon in a junk yard while escaping and they get pulled into what they think is owned by the dark side, but ends up being a smuggling post lead by the actual Han Solo. He and chewie than get connected to their old ship, but Rey gets picked up by the evil side setting up the ""rescue of the maiden premise."" Amazingly later we find out that the new ""Death Star"" has a spot the rebellions can shoot at and blow up it up....doesn't this sound familiar? The new General Leia directs the troops to do this and we than have a reunion of Han and Leia. So - like I said - a lot like the original, but the tempo and characters are likeable enough to keep you interested most of the way thru. I'm a little amazed I rated this so high, but the movie just pops not unlike the 1st Star Wars movie and finished with a bang and a couple of un-finished threads. Lucasfilm and Abrams knew what worked and they delivered on this continuation of the world of Star Wars."
986,9,"If you watched episodes IV, V, and VI, Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens may seem almost like a reboot, or re-imagining, of the original trilogy.","-Highlights- *When it comes to Rey, I feel like she represents a modern female action hero. She isn't dainty, but isn't mannish; not focused on falling in love, yet desires close relationships and loyalty; but perhaps what I loved the most about this girl is she was a bad ass. I mean, between chasing people down, fighting with her rod, or being a co-pilot to Han Solo (Harrison Ford) or Chewy (Peter Mayhew), I honestly feel the franchise is in safe hands as she learns the ways of the force."
987,7,The new start for star wars 7/10,"I don't understand all the hate around the film. This movie is what brought back all the excitement and love towards ""star wars"". Fans have been waiting a long time for another film and finally in 2015 it has happened. The actors are fantastic: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Issac and Adam Driver have become the new stars of the trilogy. The plot happens 30 years after the original story so it leaves a lot of room for new stories and imagination. Unfortunately, this is probably the only good movie in the trilogy. And it is fine enough."
988,10,Outstanding Star Wars style entertainment discreetly updated,SPOILER ALERT (after paragraph 2) 
989,7,Doesn't Deserve Criticism,"So many people are talking about how this movie is a terrible reboot, but it carries a really impressive story on its shoulders and it's hard to make a movie that pleases everybody having the legacy that is the entire Star Wars galaxy. I personally think that this movie is actually an excellent film, taking in that it's not Oscar quality and that it's like an Avengers movie but Star Wars."
990,8,"Good movie, but fix the traditional Big Bad Boom at the End","Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015): After reading others reviews I will not nitpick the minor plot holes or praise TFA's many good points which would repeat what most have already covered. I enjoyed the movie and was pleasantly surprised that it was not the anticipated Abram's reboot that overlooks canon but is a story that fits nicely as chapter VII in the SW saga. I will however, IMHO, do an improved but moot rewrite of the Starkiller's (SK) destruction scene to avoid Star War's threadbare ""big bada boom""."
991,6,Not a true star wars movie,"My wife and I have been fans of the star wars films since we were kids. We loved the originals, didn't mind the prequels...and we both thought that this movie was worse than the prequels. The movie felt rushed and character development was very poor. The movie started out well with Jakku and the intro, but even here stuff just didn't feel right. We had really high hopes for everything up to the point where Kylo Ren threw a fit....then everything went downhill from there on. "
992,5,A Very Sad Disappointment & Proof of the Power of Marketing,"As an absolute fan of Star Wars...I had been looking forward to this from the day Disney announced it would produce a further trilogy. I genuinely did not think it would be possible to make a bad Star Wars movie, given the history and endless plot line possibilities.....well....despite the odds they managed to screw it up."
993,,"Abrams has delivered the biggest movie event, perhaps of all time","It has been 30 years since the fall of the Galactic Empire at the hands of the Rebel forces. The New Republic has now established peace along with the Resistance, but evil has risen from the ashes to form the First Order; the remains of the Empire that is now led by Supreme Leader Snoke. His apprentice shows no mercy to those who refuse to abide by his order as he grows in strength as a Jedi on the dark side. The force has awakened in the Star Wars universe and J.J. Abrams is at the helm of the saga's revival under Disney movies. He manages to trounce all those pressures with a movie that rekindles the magic of the original trilogy, drawing the much needed familiarity with the classic themes and infusing it with exciting new characters, action and rising evil. Abrams has delivered the biggest movie event, perhaps of all time, that paves the way for Disney's grand plan to make a killing with its acquisition of LucasFilms. "
994,8,The Saga Reawakens,"""The Force Awakens"" does a fantastic job of recapturing the light-hearted, adventurous tone of the original Star Wars trilogy. While the prequels were bombarded with hammy, melodramatic dialogue and dull and stilted performances, this new instalment features rapid-fire, witty lines and more grounded and likable characters that helped make the originals great. "
995,9,"The right order to watch Star Wars: 4, 5, 6 and 7","The Force Awakens was relished during the last Christmas( of 2015) and it is the continuation of the saga after the Return of the Jedi.So is it good? Better from the prequels ?Even with the Originals? The short answers are yes ,wow surely man ,to become as good as the originals it will take time. In more details is an awesome flick and the fact you do not know what will happen ,like with the prequels ,is a great because it is a New Start(pun intended :) )so the saga comes back tall, proud and strong. As for comparing it with the prequels ,they do not even stand a chance, the story ,the effects ,the fighting both on the air/ space and on the ground are super and the character have already gain fun and I am included to this group. Now against the Original trilogy is not the landmark of the New Hope or Empire Strikes Back is more in the level of the Return of the Jedi and I believe that 5 or 10 years from now will gain a status among the audiences and whatever problems ,it may have, are going to become a part that will make stronger, like the jokes for Batman voice from the Dark Knight trilogy. Simple put Star Wars is back and if everything go well it is going to stay here for long. Strong is it with the Force."
996,8,"Call it a reboot... Enjoyable standalone, made for the 3d audience.","Some context - I like the original trilogy and wish the prequels were never made. That said, this sequel takes the best scenes and plot elements of the original trilogy (almost copying them entirely) and puts it in one movie."
997,8,Wonderfully Derivative,"Apparently, ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek into Darkness"" director J.J. Abrams adopted the strategy 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' for Disney's revival of George Lucas' ""Star War"" franchise. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" qualifies as an uninspired but entertaining science fiction/fantasy saga with spectacular CGI special effects. Unfortunately, it suffers from half-baked villains and a shamelessly derivative script. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt must have cherry-picked their favorite scenes and characters from earlier ""Star Wars"" epics, retooled them for this reboot, and then placed them in similar order to comply with the formula. Originally, George Lucas hired Kasdan to rewrite ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi,"" while Arndt wrote ""The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire"" and ""Toy Story 3."" Despite this gifted talent, Abrams and company don't awaken as much as recycle the Force. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" duplicates the formulaic narrative of the original trilogy without a flaw, but Abrams cannot conjure up Lucas' buoyant spirit of feel-good spontaneity. Nevertheless, unless you're a nit-picky franchise aficionado, you'll have four reasons to appreciate this melodramatic franchise reboot from the House of Mouse. First, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a full-fledged sequel instead of a prequel. (Mind you, the prequels weren't entirely ponderous, and each chronicled Anakin Skywalker's walk on the dark side.) Second, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker return after a 32-year hiatus. Mind you, C3P0 and R2-D2 are back, but they linger on the periphery. A new droid designated BB-8 replaces R2-D2 as comic relief. Third, Harrison Ford gives one of his strongest performances as Han Solo. You'll enjoy his shenanigans with the 'rathars,' tentacled, carnivorous, alien predators aboard his spaceship. Abrams confines Carrie Fisher to the sidelines, while Mark Hamill appears at the last minute. London-born Daisy Ridley, whose character draws on both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, is the fourth reason you'll want to see the seventh movie again. You won't take your eyes off this scrappy waif until Solo emerges to challenge her dominance. ""Attack the Block"" actor John Boyega plays the most interesting new character but his character appears to be given the short-shrift, Combat fighter pilot Oscar Isaac of ""The Bourne Legacy"" emulates Han Solo with his daredevil aerial skills. At the least, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" amounts to a swiftly plotted, larger-than-life, crowd-pleasing space opera with dialogue that propels the plot."
998,7,'Awakens' is Forced,"Okay, let's get the fangirling out of the way, shall we? Ahem. ""OHMYGOSH! A STAR WARS MOVIE! BY J.J.ABRAMS! I'M SO EXCITED! THE ORIGINAL CAST?!! DREAM COME TRUE! I LOVE HAN AND LEIA AND Luke!"""
999,9,Grow up and enjoy...,"Please, please ignore all these terrible reviews that have been written on this site. This is not a 1,2,3 or 4 out of 10 film! It's not Star Wars (A New Hope) or The Empire Strikes Back, that's for sure, but it is a very good movie, better than all of the sequels, probably on a par with Jedi. The negative reviews seem to have been spawned by people that need to grow up and let go of their images of the original trilogy. I gave it 9 to add some balance, it's really a 7 or 8 at best. It is obvious that they've attempted to regain what was lost of the original movies in the look and tone of this movie, the CGI is good and not overdone, especially where characters are concerned. The roles given to the original stars are all well done, but for me there's too little C3PO and R2D2, a lot of the first movie hung on the interaction between those two."
1000,7,Star Wars the Reboot?,"Huge fan of Star Wars episodes 1-6. In comparison, this new series feels like it is trying to emulate the Star Wars magic, but lacks the vision. In the end this new trilogy feels more like a reboot of episodes 4-6 than a proper continuation of the series."
1001,8,Pleasantly Pleased,"Adding to the already incredible franchise, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" did not disappoint! The over-the-top Sci-Fi characters and story line were captivating with great moments of humor. I didn't grow up with these films and wasn't sure it'd be my cup of tea. But I was pleasantly wrong and really loved it. Newcomers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley were wonderful. Ridley especially engaged me as a viewer and inspired me as an actress. I'd love to play a strong female character like Rey! From the music to the special effects, this movie hit every nerve and emotion. Crossing my fingers that there are more episodes to come!"
1002,6,"It took a long time for me to accept it, but this is a remake",I have defended this title against all the possible critics it has. I have tried to justify director's choices and the validity of the plot. But what's on screen can't be denied. This movie is a remake. 
1003,1,Boring and predictable story.,The story looks like they wrote it in a day they took the same idea as before and to get the fans back they though in the old cast. Each shot was cut down to the minimum typical Attention defect disorder public can keep their attention. It jumps from one scene to another with minimal dialogue just enough to follow the story. The acting is horrible in some scenes. I hate JJ Abrams movies his style is nothing more then computer aided action blasted at you every few seconds. He cuts the scene down so bad the actors say a few words then cut say a few words cut. George Lucas should have left it alone and never sold it as much as I didn't like his last 2 Star Wars he made this is 100 times worse then anything George Lucas ever made. I'm so glad I never went to the movies to see this I suspected it was bad.
1004,,No words,"I knew I should not watch this. After I disliked Episodes 1,2,3 I was still hoping that maybe only Episodes about times before Luke's adventures are bad? But episodes after Luke's adventures are much, much worse...<br /><br />That Kylo Ren is not Darth Vader, and the characters put significant efforts to show that they are frightened by him. That efforts are written on their faces like they are doing powerlifting.<br /><br />I liked Rey though, just because she has perfect face and it's a pleasure to see her.<br /><br />Apart from that, there is no real plot and no friends and no love, and I even cannot remember what it was about..."
1005,9,These are the droids we are looking for!,"We have always loved the original STAR WARS (A new hope) and the two follow up films, but thought this new one might be a disappointment. How wrong we were! From the moment the famous Star Wars fanfare comes crashing from the speakers and the iconic text rolls up the screen, we were hooked. What a treat to see Harrison Ford playing an ageing Han Solo and Carrie Fisher all mumsy as the Princess. Nice too to know that Anthony Daniels was still inside C3PO (although he isn't given much to do) and Peter Mayhew was bravely once again wearing 'the rug' despite his ill-health. No sign of Luke (Mark Hamil) or R2D2 for most of the time, but there are two gratifying reveals late in the film. R2D2's place in this story is taken by a spherical droid called BB8 who is cute and rolls around squeaking and bleeping. As for the story, it's basically 'fight off the baddies while trying to find Luke'. But who cares about the story - this is basically a nostalgia movie for those of us of a certain age. Plenty of fascinating extras too. These are not the droids you are looking for......."
1006,8,Very good - but the best is yet to come,As a lot of you guys I grew up with Star Wars. What would the world have been without these great films and characters? I dare not to think of it.
1007,9,"Great Movie, Period.","First off, all the people giving this film low ratings just because their particular idea of what Star Wars 'should' be wasn't followed are all crazy. Crazy and wrong. There are legitimate criticisms to be made about The Force Awakens, but any reasonable analysis should see it for what it is -- a damn good Star Wars movie. "
1008,8,The seek of Map,It was throughout a good movie with some touching and vigorous scenes. And the ending is also left with suspense so you can't wait to watch the next part.
1009,6,the future of film making looks depressing,"my god has the bar for film making today become so low and more importantly the bar for making a good star wars film become that low after the disappointing prequels that so many people actually really like and appreciate this poor excuse for a film (poor remake of the first film and bits taken from empire talk about no new original ideas, forced clunky dialogue that was embarrassing, forced humour that took away any depth and substance to many scenes and pretty much the whole tone of the film, forced introductions of legacy characters and forced interactions between the legacy characters that where cringe worthy to have to sit through, not to mention new characters that looked like teenagers to appeal to the younger and newer audience that made it feel more like harry potter twilight and hunger games than star wars which of course was the intention as those other film franchises made money must play it safe now although there is playing it safe and just copying), I so fear for the future of the film industry and the future of star wars and the direction that both are heading or maybe just maybe that I am already living that shallow soulless cooperate future here now in the present and have been for some time and have only now just woken up probably to late which i take full responsibility for. has or will anyone else awaken ? (no pun intended). I guess there goes the neighborhood and any kind of quality star wars the force awakens a tragedy and a warning about the future do not say that you were not warned but i doubt any of you would listen anyway"
1010,9,"A triumphant, goosebump inducing hair raising journey back to what we all love about Star Wars","I'm in my 30's, brought up on the original trilogy and I try to pretend the prequels don't exist so I (and my brother and dad) had such high hopes for this film. We left deliriously happy. "
1011,7,Has stood the test of time well,I saw this again as part of s triple bill on opening night of episode 9 and I was pleasantly surprised how well this film has held up.
1012,9,The long awaited return,"This was a great reintroduction into the Galaxy Far, Far Away. Though some people say that ot should have had a more original story, I say this: the last time we had something original you idiots said that it was terrible. Which is it? Is it terrible if it's brand new, or a retread? You can't have your cake and eat it, too."
1013,6,Imitation of life and film,"""The Force Awakens"" meets the burden of rebooting one of the most successful and beloved franchises in film history by largely playing it safe and copying the principle beats of the original. This approach is considerably more satisfying and considerably less daring than the approach George Lucas took with episodes 1-3, which tried to fill in the universe's back story with a lot of dramatically inert detail no one really cared about. Director J. J. Abrams and his vast army of helpers can be forgiven, and perhaps applauded, for going back to basics and giving the people what they want -- a rollicking good story that reminds us why we liked ""Star Wars"" in the first place -- even if that means sacrificing the element of surprise."
1014,1,What a waste,Most of the reviews I've read here confirm the negative opinions I had on watching this tiresome film.
1015,,Boring and ugly,"Is there a class action suit I can join? They call it a new episode, but it is a gender swap (yawn) of EP IV.<br /><br />Disney and JJ lie again."
1016,9,A Great Addition to the Star Wars Universe,"First things first, I love this movie! It delivered everything that I expected it to give me, and did it very well. "
1017,10,Can all this SOUND AND FURY really signify . . .,". . . nothing, in a Universe where planets come and go at the drop of a Light Sabre (and major characters who insist upon crashing their build-it-yourself-kit planes onto the 18th green have to be killed off before the insurance premiums needed to hedge the bet that they can survive in Real Life to the finale of a Triple Trilogy become cost prohibitive since everything is a simple business decision requiring folks to count their beans before throwing them into a Supreme Swamp Thing Snopes stew because Faulkner said that no matter how many times you nuke a planet with Death Stars you cannot get rid of the roaches or the Snopes and since they were able to also dust off Princess Leia is it too much to imagine that prolific Hollywood script doctor Bill left behind a something something involving another one of his inbred Yoknapatawpha County Mississippi plots--perhaps more Black Sheep Snopeses--working toward an Episode 9 punchline: ""Luke, I'm not only your Dad but also your Son, thanks to a six-dimensional Hyperjump) . . . ?"
1018,10,I liked it more watching it at home,"I saw this with my son on opening day and again a couple days later, thought it was pretty good, funny, exciting and nostalgic. At the time I would have given it a 7 out of 10 stars but to be honest most of that rating was because it was star wars, I expected a little more in the theaters. I saw the first one when I was 8 years old back in '77 at a little theater on university in Ann Arbor which is now a mall I think. Been a star wars fan ever since. The opening credits are the same; 'a long time ago ...' looks exactly the same, 'Star Wars' with the john williams theme looks exactly the same, a planet with a star destroyer silhouette at first looks like a paper cutout, all of it I expected more. I think that I carried this disappointment for the next couple of hours and it affected my opinion of the movie. Of course I bought the movie the day it came out on DVD, watched all the bonus features and then the movie on blue ray and DVD, it's even playing now as I type this, I really wish there were more bonus features, which is something that I rarely say. Now having seen it several times I give it a solid on it's own 9 out of 10, the extra point is just because it's star wars. The actors are engaging, emotional and complex, much better than the original star wars, even Han Solo is better 'I never ask that question 'till after I've done it' the look on his face is awesome. The main character in this movie carries it better than Luke did, she has a great deal of depth and charisma whereas Luke was more a whiny kid 'but I was going to toshi station to pick up some power converters' even at 8 years old I thought he was whiny. A lot of little things they put in there I was happy for; the sound of the millennium falcon not going into hyper drive, Han Solo being captured (they really should make a figurine with his hands on his head) the look on Chewy's face in the copilots seat near the end of the movie, that they found a role for Simon Pegg, loved Daniel Craig's part and that a couple of star wars nerds had made a droid and they were given a role in the movie. No idea why but I like seeing admiral ackbar. One of my favorite little things was the millennium falcon scraping a piece of metal during the first spaceship fight. Originally I was kind of agreeing with bad reviews that I was reading about all the similarities with the other star wars movies but some of them go a bit too far; there's tie fighters in this movie, there were tie fighters in the others, they talk about the force in this movie ... just shut up and watch it on it's own, it's an awesome movie. The bad guy is full of anger and rage, the heroine is full of hope and promise, that's the only similarity that matters, a fight between the dark side and the light side, that's what all these movies are about and they did a wonderful job at it. It's beautiful, fun and nostalgic."
1019,8,I love this new chapter,"It is great to be back in this universe, I have been waiting for something new for a while, I guess many people have :) I love this new chapter, not a dull moment, many great characters and a lot of nostalgia that reminds me of the original three films."
1020,6,"Recycling, but no so bad","Well, I'm not sure what people expected? The original trilogy is not gonna happen again. Dart is not coming back, neither is Yoda. JJ did what was partially expected: took several motives from previous parts, put politically correctness (girl-hero, afro-hero) and spiced it with new technologies. Plot is not original, not really. But it got good elements. Kylo - he is not really a Dart. He is Dart wannabe, he does not need to wear a mask and speakers, but tries to imitate the grandpa. He is torn between the Sides, so his power varies and that's acceptable. At least as much as the whole Force thing is - you cannot write equations about that, still, this is a movie, not a Nature paper. I like the idea of runaway storm trooper. We've never seen the human trooper-side before, they were more like robots. SW is much about that ""spanish telenovela"" motive - who is whom father/brother/sister and that will remain and I'm fine with that. I do expect new things in part 8, as I think of this part as semi-homage and intro to new trilogy. I watch all 6 parts every year. Wonder if I stop or continue with new trilogy. We'l see."
1021,8,Great return for the franchise,"I thought this was a great return to form after the prequels which were rather disappointing, I think there are some very good things about the new upcoming trilogy, I think Kylo Ren is a very good villain as it's a change from Darth Vader and I think he written incredibly well. All together: very impressed"
1022,7,"It's Our Fault, We Asked For This!","After 10 years - or 32, depending on your regard for the legitimacy of the prequel trilogy - Star Wars is back, and, in the spirit of times, as Giuseppe DI Lampedusa would have put it, it was necessary for everything to change in order for it to remain the same: new studio, new team, new characters... new expanded universe even (more on that later). It's funny then, and sadly not at all surprising, that so many things remain the same as in 1977."
1023,10,The Force Awakens Now,"Director and writer J.J. Abrams brilliantly summons the Force in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" in one of the great movies of the year. Along with co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, Abrams more than creates a masterful sequel; he reinvents George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" mythology for a new generation leveraging a powerful new star in Daisy Ridley, who is so strong with the Force. The visuals are breathtaking whether witnessing X-wing fighters gliding across the lake of idyllic planet Takanoda or the climatic light saber duel in the dark snowy woods. However, the affinity for ""Star Wars"" has always been the hero story. That was the tragic miscalculation of the last trilogy. Ridley's emergence as hero Rey embodies this legacy. Rey reveres the legend of the heroes of past and is present to a new realm of untold possibilities. "
1024,6,"Great filming, bad story.",Warning: mild spoilers below.
1025,2,The Force Reawakens... on Déjà Vu Planet or 'That's not how Star Wars works!',"This review contains all possible spoilers, but so does A New Hope."
1026,,Pleasant and entertaining throwback to the 1970s Star Wars movies.,"My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our local public library. JJ Abrams did a good job directing this movie mostly in the style of the original Star Wars movies beginning in 1977. I've been around long enough to remember them well and the positive stir they created. I had a good friend who became a giant fan of the robot C3PO, who also makes an appearance here, 38 years after the original."
1027,9,The Force Awakens a smile I could not put down. *spoiler free*,*Spoiler Free Review*
1028,9,Rating: A,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)"
1029,8,force awakens,This is one really fun movie to watch. which pleases star wars fans and to me suceed in that is trying to say with some small flaws
1030,8,"Better than the prequels, but still far off for the original trilogy","Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is a film that tries to balance the introduction of new characters and a new storyline, set 30 years after the events in Return of the Jedi, with old characters and story lines that were introduced during the original trilogy and expanded upon in the prequel trilogy. "
1031,6,just a so-so for a big franchise,"first of all, English is not my mother language, so please forgive me for grammatical error."
1032,8,Good,"Amazing visual effects and I like the new characters Rey and Fin and its fun to see the old ones old;) I only did not like the bad guy, the son of Han, I did not like his acting, it was a little bit to fake for me. But over all nice movie!"
1033,7,"Good, not great","Boy, was I excited for this one."
1034,8,"""Great Follow-up To The Original Star Wars Trilogy!""","Harrison Ford, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac and Carrie Fisher star in J.J. Abrams' 2015 sci-fi sequel. This installment takes place 30 years after the events of ""Return of the Jedi"" where an evil organization called, ""The New Order"" attempts to take over the galaxy following in the Galactic Empire's footsteps. Soon, we meet rogue stormtrooper, Finn (Boyega) who wants to stop them and he finds help when uniting with scavenger, Rey (Ridley) on planet, Jakku. They try to get a map delivered by droid, BB-8 pinpointing the whereabouts of missing Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to the Resistance formerly known as the Rebellion with help from pilot/smuggler, Han Solo (Ford). Fisher also returns as Leia Organa who is now general of the Resistance, Isaac plays Poe, BB-8's master and Driver plays Kylo Ren, the leader of The New Order. Peter Mayhew also returns as Han's hairy sidekick, Chewbacca along with Anthony Daniels as droid, C-3PO. This is a great follow-up to the original trilogy with a good cast, neat effects and excellent score by John Williams as usual. I also like the certain aspects that the film has from those films and it's nice to see Ford & Fisher reprise their roles. I won't say if Hamill reprises his role or not, but recommend the film anyway."
1035,6,Amusing Enough but Not Great,"When the original Star Wars came out in 1977, I was one of those kids that saw the film 11 times during its initial run. As an adult, I've watched the film many times, and it still holds up beautifully. I was not surprised when Star Wars made the AFI Top 100 Films list."
1036,5,A sequel or a remake? Not sure,"I am a sort a fan of the Star wars universe, and in contrary I also liked at least two of the prequels. But Episode VII is completely different thing. I went to see it yesterday. As you can tell, I didn't keep any hurry seeing it. I wasn't that excited of it than I was in 1999 when the prequels were released. Maybe partly because they were somewhat disappointments at that time, but during years I've learned to appreciate Lucas' work in Ep II and III. In the first minutes of Ep VII I didn't feel the excitement I was hoping, and the plot seemed to be all over the place. Couldn't really tell what was going on and what had happened. I didn't do any research or hadn't read any Star Wars novels, and I shouldn't have to. It's the movie's job to explain me everything but it was hard to get in to. During first 30 minutes or so I watched the action and effects and felt moderately excited, but the movie really started going when Rey and Finn escaped together from the planet Jakku and ran into Han Solo and Chewbacca. At that point I didn't worry about the new young characters and thought they're gonna be explained in awhile, I was sure of that. Still the movie left me guessing. Okay, Kylo Ren was Han and Leia's obviously spoiled son who turned into dark side just like that. But I kept throwing the ball back and forth guessing if Rey is either Luke's or Han's daughter."
1037,,"The new Force is Disney, and it's powerful.","""How do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that."" Han Solo (Harrison Ford) "
1038,9,Ignore the IMDb Spammers - Star Wars is back... BIG TIME!,"Most longtime Star Wars fans were dismayed beyond words with the prequels, especially at ""The Phantom Menace""; the lackluster acting, contrived script, overuse of CGI and cheap comic relief might have been amusing to 10 year olds, but for the older Star Wars fans who were there since day one of the saga, we left the theater feeling disappointed to say the least. On the other hand, there are legions of kids who grew up with those prequels and expect new Star Wars movies to continue in that direction, and it's understandable to a certain extent. A new Star Wars film would have to be, for business' sake, a careful combination of both, the original and prequel trilogies."
1039,9,I liked it a lot.,Although it stole a lot from the OT i think it set up a lot of things tht made me excited to watch the sequel....
1040,9,If it ain't broke don't fix it,"Nearly 40 years after the first ""Star Wars"" hit the big screens, even to this day it is still rewriting the imagination of the world. And I don't mean children or teenagers only, I mean fully functioning adults in their middle ages who are dressing up as their favorite heroes or villains. No other cinematic universe even comes close to Star Wars fanaticism in terms of numbers or just sheer theological offering."
1041,10,FINALLY The Force Awakens again. Pure Film Magic.,WARNING: Spoiler Alert.
1042,6,"Pretty good if you're a new fan, waste of time if you're an old fan","If this is the first time you're seeing a star wars movie, you are really going to like it. However, if you've been a lifelong fan, you will leave this movie doing the unthinkable, and that's saying, ""I miss George Lucas"". Say what you will about his failings in the prequels, but at least he had the guts to write an entirely new story, no matter how flawed. What J.J. Abrams does is essentially redo Episode IV and asks you to pay to see it. It's pretty much the same movie with inferior acting and characters. I don't need to even provide spoilers because it was pretty obvious what was going to happen before it happened. I was incredibly disappointed but not surprised, seeing as the minute Disney bought this movie, all semblance of ""star wars"" was replaced with ""cash cow"". And to all the idiots who are screaming ""haters are gonna hate"", they're just idiot fanboys who need to rationalize how their opinion is better than other people's. How dare we criticize this movie?! To recap, good movie for the new fan, a complete disappointment for an old one. Try again, Abrams."
1043,10,The Geek Awakens,"OK, first thing's first, I wasn't too excited about the prospect of a new star wars movie back when it was first announced that they were planning to make another ""trilogy"". The original, episodes **IV-VI** as they are called now, were released at a time when I was just a rug rat. I got to watch them some time around the mid-80s as syndicated shows on local TV, then after wards on every format from Betamax to DVDs."
1044,7,Star Wars is indeed back!,"After watching it twice, I've decided that SW:TFA is, in fact, a very good addition to the series. "
1045,8,Behold y'awl! The Force has finally awakened!,"After spending almost a decade devoid of force, J.J. Abrams walks in with the next big installment of the immortal saga with a brilliant plot in his baggage. Star Wars: The Force Awakens does the franchise justice it deserves. The sequel series has once again commenced and it has one of the most pragmatic plots in its vanguard. It at once gallops to answer 'what could have happened next' with three young actors to take the 'new' story-line forward."
1046,6,"Not the New Hope I was wanting, but no Phantom Nonsense either...","I was cautiously optimistic about this, with memories of the often-hated prequels still reasonably fresh in my mind. J.J is a good director, I enjoyed Mission: Impossible 3, Super 8 and Star Trek, but the problem with following up on someone's work is that sometimes it just comes across as fan service, a giddy young fella that tries to cram in all the memorable moments that he loved as a child without bringing anything new to the table. Despite this, I was happily surprised, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film. There is unnecessary CGI for a major character, and it's really bad, like ""Aliens at the end of Crystal Skull-bad"" and yes, the complaints about the story leaning too heavily on the OT story beats do ring true. Despite the prequels not being what people were expecting, those films brought a lot of fresh and new ideas to the universe. In Force Awakens, it's very familiar, the question is, is that what Star Wars fans want right now?"
1047,2,Pointless,"It's basically just a rehash of seven scenes and story lines from the first three films ... Put together with good cgi but apparently no decent writers ... Cliché upon cliché flashes across the screen colourfully ... A load of really dull characters do the sort of things you'd expect ... The villain is a bit of a wimpy dullard ... The original cast show up for a laugh ... But really there is certainly nothing new or interesting in this ... And quite frankly, in the age of Guardians of the Galaxy, this is outmoded in every way from the outset ... Mediocre film making that feeds on geek love of the first three films ... Unfortunately these are different times and this has none of the charm or excitement of the unique original trilogy"
1048,,Angry Mary Sue,"She must have slept with the producer AND the director. Otherwise, how can she be in this film? How can she be in any film??"
1049,10,Abrams nails it the force is strong with this one,I'm not ashamed to admit it I'm a massive fan and have been all my life. I was disappointed with the prequels so when I heard this was being made I was feeling a little hopeful.
1050,8,A welcome return to the Star Wars Universe,"So all i've heard is remake this, remake that. After the absolute shambles which were the Prequels, were we not all crying out for a return to the Star Wars Universe we all knew and loved from the Original Trilogy?"
1051,10,Did Every Mom's Basement Troll See the Same Movie?,"Folks! I just don't understand the amount of negative reviews that are out there! What where the Mom's Basement Trolls looking for in the movie, a complete exposition of the 30 years that have passed since Return of the Jedi? If you were expecting that, then we would have a 3 hour plus movie."
1052,10,"I just got back from seeing this, tonight (12/19/15).",And the Force is still strong with this franchise!
1053,7,Bright & exciting but ultimately too safe to be Gold-- just Gilded Metal.,*** S P O I L E R - F R E E - R E V I E W ***
1054,9,Great start to a new trilogy of Star Wars.,"AH, STAR WARS IS BACK!! Since I was very young when the prequels came out and wasn't even born during the original trilogy, this was my first Star Wars movie in a cinema. And it was an enthralling experience. "
1055,6,A gorgeous disappointment.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was an auditory and visual masterpiece. Unfortunately it was ruined by poor acting, poor actor choice, and a story that felt rushed and didn't make much sense when taking into account the previous movies and the lore of the series as a whole. "
1056,9,"Wow, 3000+ reviews already; But, what the heck, I loved it!","Thirty or so years after the Rebels got rid of the Emperor, the Dark Forces have risen again. Their new leader, Snoke (Andy Serkin), has a wily, evil assistant, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and a trustworthy General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson). In addition, the last great leader of the Good Forces, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), has gone into hiding. Yet, there is hope. A fighter pilot, Poe (Oscar Isaac) has secured a vital part of a map leading to Luke and hides it in a new age droid, BB8. This is a good thing, as Poe find himself captured by Ren. This roly poly droid lands on a desert planet where Rey (Daisy Ridley) is eeking out a living in scrap metal and waiting for her relatives to return. She captures BB8 and teams up with a Storm Trooper deserter, Finn (John Boyega) to get the information to General Leia (Carrie Fisher). Stealing a battered flying machine from the scrap yard, they are startled to learn it is the old Milleniem Falcon when they are picked up by a larger, scavenger ship piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his faithful Chewbacca. Naturally, Han, though glad to have his ship back, is reluctant to rejoin the fight against the Dark Side. This is ten times so because Han knows who this Kylo Ren is and its killing him inside. Nevertheless, Han, Chewie, Rey, Finn, BB8, Maz (Lupita Nyong'o) , Poe, General Leia and others team up to defeat Ren, Hux, and their BRAND NEW superweapon powered by the energy of a giant star. Who's going down? What a grand entry into the realm of Star Wars films, fans. Old and new cast members are total delights, especially Ridley and Driver. Then, too, the costumes, cool gadgets, sets, effects, script and buoyant direction join forces to make a visual and heartfelt movie. This viewer loved Rey's garb immensely, an elegant scrap of wisp. One word of caution. There are some scenes and happenings which may be hard for the youngest kids to handle. Yet, all in all, join forces with your loved ones and make time for SW VII!"
1057,7,"Beautiful crafted shell, hollow movie.","I've researched the ""making of"" of the first trilogy, episodes IV to VI. Those were turbulent times. My conclusion about that is that George Lucas had a big heart, full of ideas, but lacked the ability to properly portray them. That period was packed full of changes to the script recommended by his friends, coworkers and professionals of the movie business. He had years to prepare and craft his final work. His powerful, raw and creative ideas were shaped by the input and help of innumerous professionals who assisted in tailoring and shape the movies we love so much. It was the love of one man portrayed with the help of many, and it was improved for it. Impressive core, with a beautiful and crafted shell. "
1058,2,Horrible corporate disaster - Han Solo and Chewie were cool,This is a soft reboot of the original Star Wars - but it lacks any of the emotional journey of the original film. 
1059,,Almost a reboot of Episode IV: A new Hope,"A book could be written comparing the plot similarities between Episodes IV & VII. It is definitely not the story continuation those of us who grew up watching the original trilogy in theaters were hoping for; the lack of George Lucas' input is very evident. Social Justice Warriors will definitely find no fault with this movie, but I am old school and not politically correct... Han Solo shot Greedo first! "
1060,8,Beautiful and stunning visuals accompanied by a pretty average script,"I have been waiting to write this review since around 2012 when it was announced to the public that LucusFilm had been sold to Disney and that a Star Wars new movie was going to come out in 2015. So as soon as I could, I hopped into the next open IMAX Theater (which was at 530 in the morning) and saw the film. The movie was pretty much what I expected it would be. The visuals were stunning and crisp. The editing flowed together with the movie very beautifully, so did the sound mixing and editing. The acting was great. The movie was shot in real JJ Abrahams fashion with a lot of lens flares and unique camera angles. The cinematography was stunning as well. Daniel Mindel, who also did the cinematography on Star Trek, did a very good job at setting up shots that capture how well the visuals team revitalized the beautiful landscapes from the previous films. This was a very good remake of the old films and I really think the cast really revitalized the Star Wars franchise. However, I didn't expect it to be perfect and it wasn't. Most of the issues I had with this film, surprisingly, had to do with the writing. The way this film was written was like it was pretty much just a remake of the original movies. Within a couple of minutes into the movie, it started to become obvious that JJ was playing it safe with this movie. I would say that the overall tone of the movie was ""Hey, remember this? How about this? This was really cool right? This is a Star Wars movie!!"" While it's not bad enough to ruin it as a stand- alone movie, it is enough to call it unoriginal and unimaginative. I wouldn't argue with anyone who had that opinion of it. However, I also wouldn't argue with anyone who says that this is a well a great remake. Overall, my feelings about the movie were pretty mixed. While, it isn't as bad as the prequels, it also isn't as creative and visceral enough to compete with the original movies. It doesn't seem that JJ even wanted to do that though. It seems that he caught a bad case of 'fanboy' when he started working with Ford, Hamill, and Fisher. Also I blame Lawrence Kasden a bit for not going ""Ok, we need to come up with something new for this movie. The new characters have to be memorable and engaging. The plot shouldn't copycat the movie me and Lucas wrote in 77'. We should take out the scene where they hide under the floorboards of the Millennium Falcon and every other scene that has that kind of unoriginal feel to it. Let's move forward not backward."" But to be honest. I don't there is too much to complain about. It actually felt good to visit those places over again. I don't think that a lot of other audience members mind it either. It wasn't the most revolutionary piece of art to hit the screen. As a matter of fact I would say that the script was pretty average. It just felt like it was another fan remake that has been done a billion times. However, it does get the job done. It isn't a huge disappointment and anyone that thinks so should keep in mind that it was marketed and built-up for more than two years. The expectations for a lot of people shot through the roof. If the anticipation for a movie matched its quality, then 50 shades of Grey would have been the next Casablanca. I give this movie a decent 8/10."
1061,8,Great start to a new thing based off the old thing,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend."
1062,9,Star wars,The force awakens was an excellent Film starring Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. Like all the other Star Wars here lot of action and the effects were very good so if you're a Star Wars fan you have to see this one
1063,9,Welcome Back Star Wars Fans,"I admit I did not catch episodes 1-3 in the late 1990's-2000's but that is another story. For me, Star Wars is the original."
1064,7,Exceeds the Miserable Episodes I-III But Doesn't Top the Original Episode IV -- Relies Heavily on Elements from IV,"After I viewed Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens with family and friends, I asked one of my cousins how she liked these as compared with Episodes I-III which I indicated in no uncertain terms were bad additions to the series, with Episode I being a truly convoluted and confusing film and Episode III being mediocre at best. She replied she was surprised I didn't like them, saying she loved the run on the Death Star and Empire Strikes Back. Turned out she hadn't seen Episodes I-III; she was referring to what are now called Episodes IV-VI which were produced long before Episodes I-III. This confusion has plagued the Star Wars saga since Lucas decided to add the miserable prequels which are now called Episode I, II, and III. The first film from the late 1970's, now re-digitized, is Episode IV: A New Hope."
1065,10,A New Hope For a Dormant Franchise,"Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams and is written by Laurence Kasdan, Abrams, and Micheal Ardnt. It stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Harrison Ford along with Oscar Issac and Carrie Fisher."
1066,6,"The Force is back, but is it for real?","I've been digesting JJ Abrams' much anticipated, and by now highly praised, take on Star Wars for the last four hours, trying to reconcile the thoughts spinning around in my head. I sense now that it'll be some time - likely after another viewing - before I really know what I think about it. For now, as sheer popcorn entertainment, it may be unmatched by anything I've seen as an adult. Certainly in this millennium. And armed with distinct advantages such as emotional and narrative track already laid and a huge well of nostalgia, which it mines at times both expertly and overtly, it certainly packs a punch beyond the cheap thrills we often associate with modern blockbusters."
1067,9,A successful soft reboot of the series,"The prequel trilogy is an absolute mess and there's little to no redeeming value to it. As such the sequel trilogy had the stack against it. Star Wars was a dry and used up. However, this film manages to get the series to be entertaining and engaging again."
1068,6,"Star Wars crash-lands back into people's consciousness's, not with a bang, but with an oddly detached re-telling.","There's no time travelling in Star Wars, is there? No, didn't think so. Watching ""Episode 7: The Force Awakens"", however, the much anticipated 2015 continuation of the original trilogy, you would think you'd been thrown back to 1977 and were watching, in some alternate dimension, a re-run of the very first film itself. Sceptics have been writing for years on the 'place' Hollywood blockbusters have in the canon of film as an art-form, deriding them for being derivative, or for too often coming to form replications of each other, but this really does take the space-cake. The film is, in fact, so reminiscent in certain places of Episode IV that you might just as well call it An 'Old' Hope."
1069,5,Repetition and shallow...,OK I'll have to say first I enjoyed the movie but only because it was a big expensive production.
1070,,Rubbish,"I am not against re-makes automatically, but I am against re-makes because they are so bad and such a poor copy of the original. The re-make of The Thing from 1982 (I think) was a good one. <br /><br />JJ Abrams and Disney send us a pile of stinking poopoo with such bad actors that I was embarrassed for all concerned.<br /><br />This is purely a PC 2015 movie which by law (not by necessity or story) needs a superior woman. However, it backfired on the film makers because their heroine here was so bad, boring and magical. The Mary Sue picked up her light sabre, which she could not even name, and voila she is the lord master jedi of the universe.<br /><br />Some might say it was misandrist."
1071,9,"A scavenger and a stormtrooper team-up with old faces to find Luke Skywalker, the last remaining Jedi, while the ruthless First Order hunts them down.","Star Wars: The Force Awakens begins with its scrolling catch and hook synopsis that began almost 39 years ago with A New Hope, yet takes place 30 years after Return of the Jedi, George Lucas' finale to his original trilogy. It's an intro that we have become intimate with over the few decades since the Star Wars universe slid into our galaxy, offering up a wealth of novels, merchandise, and films, most notably the prequels that left the universe feeling a bit starless. Director J.J. Abrams doesn't just continue the familiarity of the introduction, he hearkens back to what A New Hope meant. By not only nodding to the original, Abrams interjects his film with an invigorating and exhilarating sense of spectacle and grandeur that fell apart with 1999's The Phantom Menace and its subsequent sequels. There is much of The Force Awakens that feels already established within the Star Wars canon, yet the abundance of novel and creative magic that explodes on screen is done so with a tenderly affectionate eye and delicate touch that turns the old into new and the new into everlasting memories. "
1072,8,A step in the right direction after the prequel trilogy,"Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 40 years you may have heard of a little movie franchise called 'Star Wars'. After being thrilled by the original trilogy, fans had to wait more than a decade to be cruelly disappointed by an underwhelming trilogy of prequels. However, following LucasFilm's acquisition by Disney, the stage was set for a new group of filmmakers to take a crack at extending the storyline. Whether the results would be worthy of the title of 'Star Wars' was anybody's guess."
1073,8,As great as the earliest in the series,"In part seven of the universally famous series, outer space continues to have more battles between good and evil forces. Some of the characters of the well-known middle trilogy are present (thirty years older) with some newer and younger characters as well."
1074,8,It all depends on the way you look at it.,"Many of us loved the original trilogy. It was one of the greatest things to happen to cinema. Later, we all had to deal with the prequel trilogy that some liked, but most were disappointed. We then waited a few more years for the 3rd trilogy to come out, and most were ecstatic!"
1075,6,"A ""Rebooquel"" to Satisfy the Fans",This is (probably) the most awaited movie of the decade considering Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises ever. The hype was huge on this one and the waiting time as finally ended.
1076,10,First-rate entertainment.,"This movie is excellent. The reason is because it has strong acting and an original story. This movie is not a rip off of earlier Star Wars movies. It is something new. The movie is engaging. It grabs and keeps that audience's attention. The characters evoke empathy. The story contains an element of tragedy. The director, J.J. Abrams manages to avoid using special effects to fill in story gaps. For once, special effects are actually ancillary to the story line. Some scenes contain real elements of drama. Abrams manages to avoid depicting the good guys and bad guys as caricatures. The most interesting character is Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver. The reuniting of Han Solo and Princess (now General) Leia is dramatic without being sentimental. It's good that they are together again. Of course, the Solo-Leia-Ren triad drives the story. However, this movie is not an overblown soap opera. Rather it is a well put together science fiction adventure that provides first-rate entertainment."
1077,6,Entertaining but impossible to ignore the faults.,This is the first movie review I have submitted. Why this movie? I felt compelled to unburden my mind of the disappointing elements of this film. Im not the type to over analyse a movie. I either enjoy it or i don't. I've read numerous reviews on this site of this film and the low ratings are not without justification. The higher ratings are not without some merit. 
1078,8,Awoke the Force in Me,"Brought me back to everything loved about the original trilogy. This movie had some actual soul, unlike the last three."
1079,7,Nothing new/Very predictable,As a standalone film this is a 6-6.5 max.Since we know it's the first part of a trilogy then I'm giving it a 7.
1080,5,Competent but derivative reboot of American exceptionalism undermined by crucial miscast of storm trooper character,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the 7th installment in the great money-making pantheon. After Disney bought out George Lucas, the progenitor of the series, the decision was made to conscript the heavily Spielberg influenced director, J.J. Abrams, who agreed to direct a veritable clone of Episodes 1 through 3 (eschewing the ""dark"" prequels of Lucas' Episodes 4 through 6). The three original episodes represented a grand updating of the old movie serials of the 30s and 40s, particularly those produced by Republic Pictures, known for outstanding special effects."
1081,,Why This Remake SUCKED,The hormonal teen emo's temper tantrum were both annoying and funny. Funny because he is such a loser.
1082,10,best movie ever!!,"Can i just say that the movie blew me away? cringing, breathless, amazing and possibly the best star wars ever made! so many classic concepts were kept and the storyline blew my mind! one hour passed since i left the cinema and my head still feels like its comprehending and storing information!! the movie is spectacular. best movie ever on my list would be star wars episode 7....bless j.j Abrams. Being myself a star wars maniac and a gigantic fan of the franchise seeing this movie exhilarated me to the fullest degree i would ever thought my mind could possibly handle. I have waited years for the movie days and long months to watch it. Star Wars will forever keep its legacy!!"
1083,10,Jj has done it,"This is it t,he best SW movie since Aä New Hope, forget the rest this is the best."
1084,9,A game changer for the series....,"When star wars first came out in 1977, no one knew it would become the cash cow it would become today, with billions spent on tickets and merchandise. Flash forward 38 years later, and with Disney now controlling George Lucas' empire, Star Wars is once again a big thing. Thanks in part to the success of the force awakens, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief as this movie is the best of the star wars sequels. Lots of great effects, drama, and stirring music and surround sound make this a must see. The passing of Han Solo at the hands of Kylo Ren, his son, was the biggest reveal since Darth Vader was Luke's father. Add to that a cliffhanger ending featuring an old Luke Skywalker showing Rey the ways of the force, and the anticipation for Episode VIII is coming. Thankfully I saw in in 2D since 3D was converted although i missed seeing it in IMAX (the home media release doesn't have the intro in imax; hopefully the bluray 3d release will have it)."
1085,8,Driver unsurpassed,"We never dreamed this trilogy would be made, but my inner fan-boy lost his mind when TFA came out. I loved every minute of it on first watch, and if they had planned the next two chapters properly, I'd love it even more. Ridley is perfect as Rey, while Driver is the best actor in the entire saga. That's right Harrison. SAGA. Unbelievable that this movie happened, let alone be actually very good. 8/10."
1086,7,The nostalgia is strong with this one,"I went into this movie not reading any reviews beforehand, only watching the trailers. And watching the trailers actually hurt my experience."
1087,10,Honestly a misunderstood Star Wars movie/trilogy,I just recently re-watched it force awakens and honestly the criticisms of the film are just bull crap specially the whole thing that feels like a new hope. It feels more like return of the Jedi but even then it's just a Star Wars movie it's ambition's the only criticism that really works is that sometimes it's to safe but it's really ambitious.sometimes people seem to forgot tiny details especially about things that don't match with there bias/head canon. There's like a lot foreshadowing people miss especially with snoke like most theories that are about him were trash . A great start to a good/great trilogy.
1088,7,The Seventh Awakens,"Although if you either dismiss Episode 1-3 it could also be ""the fourth Awakens"". But back to this one and let me begin with, that I'm not even close to being in the top of the biggest fans, when it comes to Star Wars. I came late to the party and enjoyed the movies (some more, some less) and am not obsessed with the whole thing. Always liked Han Solo, especially the way Ford portrayed him."
1089,10,Simply Amazing,"I vaguely remember my first introduction to Star Wars. My uncle had taken me with his family to see some horror flick at the Drive-in about a ship that needed to kill people in order to keep the engine running; I seem to remember grey uniforms and it might have a gun ship of some kind? I don't remember too well; I was young, it was gross, and so I didn't pay attention. Looking out the back window of the station wagon, I saw the opening scenes of Empire Strikes Back. I spent the rest of the time entranced, even without having any sound. My first ""grown up"" movie in a normal theater was Return of the Jedi. My mom had the Beta disks. I wore them out. I had the tape series. I wore it out. twice. Then, the movies were re-released. And altered. And the death spiral of the series began."
1090,7,Pretty underwhelming,Let me just start off by saying that i always rate movies based on the film and not based on my expectations. So all those 1 or 2 star ratings are understandable but they are more based on what you expected and what you got.
1091,3,Star Bores,"Other than a few good moments, it's he same old same old of recent youth-oriented movies: human and spaceship chases, fights, explosions. A video game and thrill ride set up. We get lot of marching storm troopers, actors, the obligatory alien bar scene. There's none of the interesting characters, touches of humor, or drama of the original. To see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher be interesting, watch their TV interviews, not this. The other actors lack appeal. Even if it wasn't a rehash of the firs few episodes, it would lack appeal. In comparison, I liked the Bond movie Skyfall, and all Hunger Games films much more than this. Caprica and Battlestar Gallactica are also much better."
1092,,"A New Hope (Episode IV), But With The Darkside Director, Studio And Lead Actors","If The Darkside's plan was to take over and rewrite Star Wars history and jedi philosophy they have succeeded to rewrite and revise history. This is Episode IV but with no sense of hope, dignity, integrity or entertainment value.<br /><br />It is as if they figured the people were excited and hopeful based on the force so they would make the masses turn away and lose hope and look elsewhere. That is episode IV. The other question is, are there really no better actors than these people that were in this film?? Really?? The wold is in trouble then. "
1093,8,"Spectacle, action and a good story - I really liked this film","30 years after the fall of the empire, a new dark force known as the first order are trying to hunt down the whereabouts of legendary jedi Luke Skywalker. A droid known as BB-8 houses a map which houses the location of Luke Skywalker which the dark side are keen to get their hands on. However, the rebel alliance are prepared to do everything in their power to prevent the force from accessing this information whatever the cost..."
1094,10,Best Star Wars Yet - to please both virgins and vets,How to please franchise fans old and new while making a good impactful and memorable movie?
1095,9,What a great comeback,"What a great return for the Star Wars Universe. Great new characters are introduced, classic ones come back and new forces are in play. The movie has great rhythm and actually offers a great crescendo. S hreat way to start things back."
1096,10,Thank our lucky stars they nailed it!,Let's face it people they could have quite easily cocked this one up. Anyone remember the prequels. Trade federashons? I can't even spell it never mind know what one is. We want a Star Wars movie that we can enjoy with our kids or enjoy like we were still a kid. Thankfully director JJ Abrams is also a fan and this comes through in every scene of the movie. Set some 30 years on from the ending of The Return of the Jedi there is the New order. Basically it's the Empire but with trendier uniforms. They're out to take over the universe. Led by Kylo Ren he is a kind of teenage Darth Vader. They're after the map to find the last Jedi Luke Skywalker. He's done a runner after his Jedi training programme went belly up. But so is the resistance led by Princess Lea. The map is hidden inside a droid (ring any bells?) which falls into the hands of a scavenger named Rey played by the beautiful Daisy Ridley. I could go on explaining the story but I reckon every man and his dog knows it by now. What I can tell you is that TFA is an absolute joy to watch. Performances by old and new cast members are great. I really enjoyed Adam Driver as Ren. He has some really unintentional comical scenes. Like when he gets bad news! There's plenty of nostalgia to relish. Particularly the scene with the Millennium falcon. There's some great comedy moments. Han and Chewie are like a well seasoned double act. The special effects are as you'd expect AWESOME! I would recommend you watch in IMAX. The sound is out of this world. Take note when Kylo Ren ignites his Lightsaber at the beginning of the movie. It burst into life with ear popping efficiency. I could go on because everyone is great in the movie. The only negative I can think of is we need more Luke but hey that's something to look forward to in episode 8.
1097,6,Pathetically average,"There is a lot to expect from a franchise that has produced 6 memorable movies so far and created some internationally beloved characters. Some have been better, some (I and II) have been worse. But if you decide to make a sequel to the original story, you have to do better than that. The fact that Disney bought Lucas films could be seen all throughout the movie, from start to finish- with a somewhat feminine looking villain-Kylo Ren, a few sad attempts at bringing in new characters and a lot of unnecessarily mellowed down scenes, just so the movie could be rated suitable for everyone to see- exactly what Disney were going for. All-in-all, The Force Awakens was a sad attempt to follow up on a legendary series, and the only thing that awoke while watching this movie was my desire to see a real movie, which is not watered down by the urge to shatter box office records and please children. If there was one positive from the whole experience, it was that it made me re-watch all of the previous 6 movies beforehand, which, unlike watching the 7th, was a real joy."
1098,8,I've got a good feeling about this,"Everybody knows it. Everybody loves it. The cast, the music, the sounds, the effects, its pure love. STAR WARS. Arguably the most iconic franchise of all time is back and wow, its back with a bang. "
1099,6,On par with the old films,"Now the title of this review is probably the ultimate compliment when it comes to huge Star Wars fans out there. Unfortunately I am not one of them. I liked the old films and I liked this new movie here just as much, without considering either to be groundbreaking or some other superlative. This new movie runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes and was written and directed by J.J. Abrams, who is mostly known for ""Lost"" and ""Star Trek"". It is the ultimate breakthrough movie for John Boyega, but even more so Daisy Ridley. And while I liked the latter, I thought that it was so nice to see Oscar Isaac as usual. Cool reunion also from ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" with Adam Driver here, even if the two had no scenes together. Fans of the old ""Star Wars"" film will appreciate the inclusion of Harrison Ford, who has lots of screen time, Carrie Fisher, who has solid screen time, and Mark Hamill, who has almost no screen time, but it is indicated that he will make a much bigger impact in the next film."
1100,10,The Magic of 1977 Star Wars Returns,"If you are a fan of Star Wars, and particularly if you grew up with it, this movie is just what you're looking for. It lives up to the hype. It is the movie we hoped for with the devastatingly disappointing ""prequels""."
1101,6,Age appropriateness and generational likes/dislikes,Just saw Star Wars. I give it 3.4 stars out of 5. So the best I could say is 6 out of 10.
1102,1,"Disappointed, even without the hype",There is no need to go into the specifics of why I was so disappointed by TFA. Read other reviews and it is all documented. There is one major plot hole that others have not mentioned. But it seems that IMDb are blocking any kind of spoilers so I can't write it here...
1103,,Laughably pointless and horrendously horrible video X- ),"It is truly hilarious how worthless Bad Robot/payola geek vids like this even qualify to be included on this site, but then again this site also includes some of the single worst Star Wars related media of all time such as The Last Jedi 🤣 🤣 🤣"
1104,10,The Force Awakens,"The Force Awakens was released December 15 2015, it also depends where you live, in some countries it came out the 16th or 18th. It was made by the director J. J Abrams, who was the mastermind behind the last two Star Wars movies aswell, The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker."
1105,10,Amazing movie,"This episode is great, as a huge fan i was so happy with this one"
1106,9,A breath of fresh air .. Star Wars has returned from a Galaxy Far Far Away...,"I have waited ever since the initial teaser was released, and from then the hype has been building. It i s safe to say J.J Abraham's lived up to and exceeded expectations to bring us THE best Star Wars Film ever. "
1107,9,Heroism Remains,"It's been 39 years since the words ""May the force be with you"" were uttered. During that time we've had two sequels and then gone back to see the earlier portions of the story of STAR WARS told on three more films. Some were good, most were great. We were witness to an unspeakable evil and the birth of a new hero. There was magic when that first film came out, an unexpected mega-giant of a film franchise where story always came first. That legacy carries on as we venture into a new set of heroes combined with the old."
1108,7,Strong reboot,"Star Wars VII is a strong reboot of the series. Once the fan hype settles, it will be recognized for what it is: derivative of the original, but well made. That puts it above Episodes I and III, at par with II and VI, but not up to IV and V. A nice 7/10."
1109,8,"Superior to the prequels and an overall great film, but not quite on the same level as the original trilogy.","Ten years after the lesser STAR WARS prequel trilogy wrapped up with the mostly solid if not perfect REVENGE OF THE SITH, George Lucas' ever-popular space opera saga gets yet another trilogy in the making, this time in the hands of J.J. Abrams, the man behind the magnificent SUPER 8 and the equally enthralling STAR TREK reboot."
1110,6,good but not enough,every thing is good except the story is not good enough for star wars series.
1111,9,The Force is strong with this one,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens​ is the Christmas gift we all have been waiting for. JJ Abrams did with Star Wars​ what he did with Star Trek​ - staying within the canons of the franchise and playing safe, yet coming up with a fast paced entertainer that will wipe out all the bad memories of the last three installments of Star Wars."
1112,7,Not a bad film but be warned it is an Episode IV remake,"This is Disney's first venture into live action sci-fi since the risible Black Hole of 1979. Having made such a complete cow-pat of that movie, and having paid multi-billions for the Star Wars rights, it is understandable that Disney's execs wanted to play it safe this time, and play it safe they did. They hired a director with form for breathing new life into a tired old franchise and used the most successful and charismatic of the previous six movies as a frame on which to hang the same plot for the latest."
1113,1,Not something we haven't seen before. All eye-candy! No content!,"Not surprised. The franchise could not get any more worse after a so-so prequel trilogy. We did try to like it but it just didn't fit in well with the 1st trilogy. When you think you are going to see a fresh take on the Star Wars saga, it fails horribly. We are made to see a remake of the first 3 installments with lesser plot imagination, no character development, scenes xerox copied from previous Star Wars -- its all eye-candy. Very much frustrating to see a legendary film shredded into this big mountain of crap. This film is for the kids. The type of film you wouldn't bother watching 10 years from now. This film is made to sell Disney merchandise. This film is to milk the brand Star Wars. Fail!!!"
1114,,Disney did an excellent job,Disney did an excellent job. Only this is not the sequel. It is a strange reboot featuring past characters as old men and women. It is the first (fourth) part A New Hope with some elements from the second (fifth) going even to rip off a scene from The Highlander.
1115,10,I might become a Star Wars fan!,"I liked the first two films (A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back), but while I could certainly enjoy them and appreciate the MASSIVE cultural impact of both of these (Return of the Jedi can get lost), I was never really a Star Wars fan. "
1116,9,The old and the new unite,"Although I never really was a Star Wars fan, I thoroughly enjoyed the original movies in the seventies and eighties. Now more than thirty years later, the original cast is back with some new ones, and it's fantastic!"
1117,9,"Chewie, we're home.","Oh are we ever. I loved this movie,Star Wars feels like Star Wars again. some may say that this is a rehash of A New Hope and there are some,but I don't think it's overdone. The new characters are all great and you care about them. Daisy Ridley was really great but the standout to me was Adam Driver,wow. He played Kylo Ren perfectly,he showed his evil side,his battle with the light side,his anger and his conflict. Driver really nailed it,especially in his scene with Han Solo. Best scene in the movie."
1118,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie review,"With the upcoming release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" i've decided to make a review of this movie.<br /><br />""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a movie directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, and many more. This movie takes place after ""Return of the jedi"" back in 1983 and is about the resistance has to complete a very important mission for the destiny of the galaxy and the first order has to stop it. <br /><br />Let's talk about the positive things, the visual effects are fantastic. J.J. is a director that is known for his ability to combine the CGI effects and the practical ones at just the right level, and it shows. By the way this is a very well directed movie and very well edited too. All this together with John Williams's score, you do feel like Star Wars is more than back into the big screen.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are some of the best of the entire saga with out a dude. John Boyega as Finn is fantastic and Daisy Ridley is magnificent as Rey. She is easily the best part of this movie. Adam Driver was awesome as Kylo Ren, one of the best movie villains in recent years. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is very good, and the friendship between Han and Chewie still there and is very fresh.<br /><br />This is a very funny movie, in my opinion this is the funniest movie of the entire saga. And almost all the comedy comes from BB-8, which is awesome and i loved it in this film.<br /><br />""Episode VII"" has some very good battle sequences and the sound mixing was great, you feel the action almost directly in your face and is awesome to see.<br /><br />The easter eggs and references to the other Star Wars movies were also great, and there are shown with respect to the saga and the fans of the source material. I like the fact that the references there are not in the entire movie, which i'm very happy. Because this movie had a danger to doing that like ""Jurassic World"" did it that year, but thanks to the force, that didn't happened.<br /><br />I loved this movie,but it does have some flaws. For example, Snoke and Maz Kanata. This movie has this two CGI characters here, but they don't matter all that much. There are scenes when we see Snoke talking to some people and is not that interesting or important. The same thing happened with Maz, she was and old lady who sometimes talks about other Star Wars things, but is not interesting. But, don't worry, there are not in the entire movie.<br /><br />This movie is one for my favorites movies of Star Wars and it is i the 4th place in my ranking of the Star Wars movies. I've already watched ""The Last Jedi"" and is amazing, but I need to watch it a second time before i do the review. Those are my thoughts of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" and thats way i'm going to give it a 9/10."
1119,6,Maybe there the droids im looking for?,"To jump straight into this review I can say that the visuals are fantastic and basically flawless, this film is fantastic on the eyes and will definitely keep you invested to keep watching. I was also happy enough with the acting, everyone played there role pretty well and for the most part there is alot to enjoy, this is not a bad film at all but in saying that here is how the penny drops..."
1120,10,This IS the sequel you're looking for,"Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. The Breaking Bad of film. I'm still stuck on deciding which is better between this and The Empire Strikes Back, which speaks for itself. (Hi Lewis) Go see this film, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, because you will become one. I'll definitely be seeing this multiple times, and I cannot wait to see the future of Star Wars in Episodes 9, 10 and the spin off movies. And thankfully, there isn't any Jar Jar Binks or young Anakin Skywalker. Instead we have interesting, diverse and excellently played characters. What a film."
1121,6,Super average,"I tried this out to see if I'm still into Star Wars and it's possible I'm just not or not into sci-fi anymore. This didn't make me want to finish the trilogy that's for sure. That said I did really like Rogue One, they did a really good job with that one. This just seemed unoriginal and trying to play of the nostalgia factor having Han/Leia/etc come back. The end did surprise me though and for that reason alone I'll probably try 8. Oh and Rey was pretty hot so there's that."
1122,8,The Force has indeed awoken.,"After three long, uncertain years, Star Wars episode VII is finally here. Going in to the cinema last week didn't even seem real. Over a year since our first teaser trailer, audiences across the globe finally got to see their first taste of new Star Wars in 10 years (and over 30 since some good Star Wars!)"
1123,7,"Good movie, NOT great",*Minor Spoilers* 
1124,5,A New(er) Hope(less) Mash-Up!,Why? 
1125,,Vibrant Funny and Enjoyable,It's not a bad movie. I don't really understand the point of all this hate. It has a pretty good story though not unique with good pacing. We are also introduced to some new characters which were well written and likable. Good camera work. Great CGI and chereography and acting was very good. Few flaws and inconsistencies. Has the original trilogy aesthetics which was very nice.
1126,8,An enjoyable Re-Introduction into Star Wars,I'd like to give it a 8.5.
1127,8,"A force revitalized (or at least, replicated!)","At last, after the unedining tedium of George Lucas's portentious prequels, J.J. Abrams gives us a new Star Wars film we can like, aided by Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter of 'The Empire Strikes Back'. 'The Force Awakens' is a fast-paced space-romp in the spirit of, and paying considerable homage to, the original movies, brining back many of our favourite characters while also introducing new ones (with a nod to modern political sensitivities). Perhaps its biggest problem is where it goes so far beyond simple homage so in places you could almost believe it was an alternative treatment for the script of 'A New Hope'. Of the new cast, I thought John Boyega seemed the most natural; the old cast do come across as old (but then, it was almost 40 years between the movies). The movies takes a bit of a while to find its rhythmn, and Kylo Ren, the conflicted villain, is interesting but not wholly convincing (although arguably Darth Vader had problems of his own). But it's fun, respectful, contains at least some new stuff and is arguably what the world was waiting to see when Lucas gave us 'The Phantom Menace' instead. Ah, well."
1128,8,Force Awakened.,Star Wars : Episode VII : Force Awakens is a monumental film for any film fan.
1129,9,A Strong Return,"10 years since the last Episode of the Star Wars saga, fans counted down the days until the release of the 'Force Awakens' bringing us the next adventure for the Jedi and the Republic. Most exciting about the drop of Episode 7, is the new characters, questions over their involvement in the Galaxy. Filming, which began in 2014, saw scenes taken place in Iceland and Abu Dhabi, before being wrapped in November of that year. Impressive about the new film, is the theatrical release poster, picturing characters old and new, colour and action, gravitating people to the movie. The hit film begins thirty years after the Galactic Civil War, the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the Mew Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who has gone missing. On the desert planet of Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, played by Oscar Isaac, receives a map to Luke's location from Lor San Tekka. Poe Dameron, is cleverly characterised, his heart is on his sleeve and his leadership skills are evident, there is no doubt of cheekiness and confidence in his work, making him so reliant and comfortable to be around. Stormtroopers play a significant role in the opening scene, but in the saga altogether, their intimating, cloned features make their in-sync movements rather satisfying, when they march, it is almost like a parade of soldiers. Their armour is made up of only black and white, covering their whole body. Stormtroopers carry the nickname ""bucket-heads"" and - after the Battle of Endor - Remnant Stormtroopers, were the elite shock troops of the Galactic Empire. The troopers were fanatically loyal to the Empire, making it impossible for them to betray the Imperial cause. Their signature armour partners the E-11 blaster rifle, proving at times more defensive than offensive. The white armoured soldiers commanded by First Order leader Kylo Ren, raid the village and capture Poe, who was acting suspicious whilst watching the destruction of his planet, Kylo kills San Tekka. Poe's unique, round droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger named Rey. Our first impressions on Rey is that she is independent, fierce and tired of living her difficult life, working for very little in return. She at first is reluctant to the droid, but is encouraged to go with it, in the quest to find Luke Skywalker, a man who she's heard about many times. Kylo Ren tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Ren is portrayed as a dark, evil villain, who is supposedly the main to Revive the work previously carried out by the Empire. The character, performed by Adam Driver, sees the American actor execute his mental struggles and anger to perfection, as we see numerously, when something doesn't go to plan, it usual ends up with him beating a room with his fire, lightsaber. Stormtrooper FN-2187 is seen at the war zone in Jakku with blood on his helmet, following the death of one of his fellow troopers, this singled him out from the others, focusing the viewers attention on that one trooper, he seemed out of place and uncomfortable in the law of the First Order, reinforced when he looks around at the fire and conflict, questioning his life choices. The Stormtrooper is captured taking his helmet off, a rarity in the saga, his face overwhelmed by what he has witnessed. Disillusioned by the First Order, he frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, after Poe confesses his Piloting skills. A worrying start eventually sees the pair leave the First Order's ship. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name ""Finn"". As the two become quite the partners, with Dameron piloting and Finn on the shooting system, they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, much to Finn's disagreement. Their TIE fighter is shot down by a First Order Star Destroyer and crash-land. Finn survives, turning to see the ship in flames in the middle of the desert, assuming that Poe died in the crash. Finn, wearing Poe's jacket, comes across Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an air strike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the prestigious Millenium Falcon, parked unattended and escape the planet. The Millennium Falcon features as an iconic starship throughout the Star Wars franchise. The idea came from a George Lucas seeing a half-eaten sandwich and an olive on someone's plate very close together, Lucas thinking that would make a good starship design. The powerful starship is best bragged about for its speed and efficiency, many characters mention to the ship's owner Han, that it completed the Kessel Run in under 15 parsecs, which he corrects by stating it was under 12. Other connotations to the amazement is how complicated it is, we see many times damage to it, difficulties with the hyperdrive and at times, a delay before travelling at light speed, backing up Leia's famous line: ""You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought"". It's distinctive shape offers a small height, allowing it to fit into tight spaces thanks to its flexibility. The first 'originals appearance' comes from Han and Chewy, in a tense scene, the ship seems to be discovered, only to be boarded by Han Solo and his Wookie partner, ""Chewy we're home"". Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack profusely, but the group escape in the Falcon. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke allows General Hux to use the weapon for the first time. The pair just mentioned share the same wicked ambitions to dominate the Galaxy, Snoke an ancient, wrinkled creature who sits tall watching the First Order carry out their business. Hux is a straight-forward man, says things as they are, his harsh tone when speaking enforces his power and want to succeed. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo, who Kylo states means nothing to him. The significance of Ren being the son of Leia and Han, begs the question why he turned to the dark side of the force, very little has changed about Han and Leia regarding their characteristics but their son's betrayal to the dark side, could cause potential mental insecurity to the couple, however, we are yet to see any physiological struggle from Han or Leia. Aboard the Falcon, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the Dark Side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meets with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers assistance getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Rey is drawn by the Force to a secluded vault, presenting the strong sense of the Force within her, she finds the iconic lightsaber once belonging to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods, confused and terrified. Max gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping - a key transition in the film, and the saga. Starkiller Base destroys the New Republic and its fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. The droid plays such an underrated key role in the film and the job of peacemakers, taking the light off C-3PO and R2-D2. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by the resistance X-Wing fighters led by the very much alive Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. It is clear that the two are very similar, they have an unrequited connection and we are unsure why. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a guard. At the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking the main facility. In a similar predicament to 'A New Hope' with the Death Star. Using the Falcon, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey and plant explosives. Han, in a tense scene, confronts his son Kylo Ren, and implores him to abandon the Dark side, much to Leia's encouragement. With the roles reversed from Luke's confrontation with Lord Vader. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately refuses and kills his father, highlighting his brutality, leaving a very angry Wookie who watches from above. Chewbacca - devastated - shoots Kylo Ren and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator. The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey into the woods. Finn uses the safekeeping lightsaber to ensue combat with Ren. Kylo's lightsaber is especially unique, it appears to be infiltrated with flames and is structured in the design of a sword. The battle is so Finn can distract the villain and protect Rey, before Ren knocks him unconscious. Rey takes the lightsaber and channels the Force to defeat Kylo in a duel. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley (Finn and Rey) were both fairly unknown at the time, both English, despite Boyega performing with an American accent, the two resemble the attributes and acting qualities seem from Ewan McGregor and Mark Hamill in past episodes. The pair during their battle are separated by a fissure as the planet surface begins to splinter. The snow covered forest sets the perfect scene for the battle. However, Snoke orders Hux to Eva hate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca rescues Rey and the unconscious Finn, and they escape aboard the Falcon. As the resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes. On D'Qar, Leia, Rey and Chewbacca mourn the death of Han, knowing they had lost a great man. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey uses to find the oceanic planet Ahch-To in"
1130,6,It's okay,"The acting of John boyega and daisy ridley is just terrible. Their caring seems limited to breathing quickly and looking panicked. Whoever casted them should never work in film again as they are nowhere near good enough to carry a massive franchise like Star Wars. The story is basically a new hope, with more cgi and poorer acting."
1131,10,Perfect! Hands down...Best One Yet! Haters are out in full Force,Let me start by saying I didn't know what to expect before going to see this movie. Last night we were standing in line and you could feel the anxiety of everyone looking forward to this film.
1132,7,Can I copy your homework? I'll be sure to change it so they can't recognize it.,"It saddens me that this sequel dips lower than the prequels in originality. The directors and writers were so insecure and scared that the only way they thought they could make this a success was to copy ANH. As a result, character become imitations of greater characters in the past."
1133,9,There has been an awakening... and it's wonderful!!!,"Finally Star Wars is back in full force. Beautiful acting, stunning practical effects and a great story. Although there are many recognizable plot devices it doesn't really hurt the film, since there is so much new stuff going on. Now that the theme has been set, there are a lot of paths down which the next installments could go. My only complaint is that 2 hours and 15 minutes really isn't enough to explain the major political conflicts and certain scenes therefore seem a little rushed, in order to progress the story. But I guess you can only cram so much into one film. Hopefully that will be explained a little better in episode 8. All in all this makes for a great Star Wars."
1134,7,Good,"Everyone complains that it is a copy of the previous but I personally don't care, the presentation of a female hero as the protagonist is very interesting, in addition to Finn one of my favorite characters and I want to know more of him. The villain Keylo is a risky ... I like it because it is a kick to all of us who expected a great villain opting for one who livesunder the Darth Vader shadow and is presented as a mediocre villain almost reminds me of what happened Metal Gear Solid in its second installment."
1135,2,More Like the Force Is Derailed,There may be spoilers in this write up. 
1136,,Boycott Disney and Star Wars - they are SUCKY,I hated it.
1137,9,Best Star Wars Since Return of the Jedi,"I had the amazing opportunity of seeing this the day it premiered in theaters (December 18, 2015). After waiting over a year and 4 hours in line, I was ready to see this movie. When I sat down and the movie began, I silently said a prayer that it wouldn't be another Phantom Menace. And boy it blew me away. I would say in the blink of an eye that this was the best Star Wars since Return of the Jedi. Every moment of this movie had me on the edge of my seat. It was utterly amazing, and I watched this movie like it was prey. I am not exaggerating at all. Of course it had problems, otherwise it would receive a 10. It's main issue was (as I'm sure you've heard) is the similarities with episode IV. However, I address this by saying that fans wanted movies to be more like the originals, not the prequels. Now that it is like the originals, people are complaining. It's near impossible to please some people. However, the one aspect I thought was very weak was the Starkiller base. As a character says in the movie (no spoilers), it's basically another Death Star, and we've already seen two of those. Other than that, this movie was practically flawless. It definitely deserves a 9.5 or so (or an A) and I suggest anybody see this movie."
1138,10,JJ Abrams delivers on high expectations with a true Star Wars movie!,"Star Wars is back, as JJ Abrams achieves a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. "
1139,10,The Best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back,"J.J. Abrams did a masterful job with this Star Wars films. I won't mention anything in the film. I'm mainly writing this in response to the huge amount of reviewers on this site that claim it is a terrible movie. You are either art house movie goons or you are an aspiring movie critic who thinks they are smarter than the masses(and real movie critics, who by the way loved the movie)."
1140,9,Let's enjoy this while it lasts,"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is without a doubt the greatest piece of Star Wars content to be released by a major studio since Return of the Jedi. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best science fiction films to be released in that time frame as well. J.J. Abrams, the creator of Lost and more recently the man who revived an aging Star Trek franchise, outdid himself. Forget all of the hoopla surrounding George Lucas' distaste for the new film. He had his time, and when he was called upon to continue the saga he disappointed the fans. J.J. answered the call and hit a home run."
1141,6,"Likable Reboot, but.....","Hard not to have spoilers in this particular case, because anything you say is one. "
1142,8,A solid work with a few opportunities for improvements (until next time),Do not read this if you have not seen the movie! 
1143,7,Good but it has some problems...,TFA is the movie that brought back Star Wars and got me into Star Wars so it will always be special in that respect. This movie is so fun through out. I absolutely love the First Order and Kylo Ren. Rey is good and the lightsaber fight in the snow at the end could use more screen time but it is so goooood! It is annoying with the whole repeat of A New Hope but still a fun movie.
1144,10,The Force Does Awaken,"I just saw this in Imax 3D and I have to say I enjoyed it very much. Not everyone who sees this will be pleased, that would be impossible. I honestly enjoyed every second of this movie. My favorite character was Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver. I think Adam portrayed this dark character really well and was believable. I also found BB-8 to be adorable. I found this film overall very fun and also it has great action sequences. I recommend this highly. It moves very well in it's pacing and has amazing cinematography. Even if you're not necessarily a big fan of the films, I think this is definitely worth seeing. Also seeing it in Imax 3-D is the way this movie should be experienced."
1145,6,Disappointing...no original content...,"I have been an avid fan of Star Wars since I was a small child. My brother and I grew up on the original trilogy. I was also a still a kid when the 2nd trilogy came out. I was ecstatic to find out that this epic and my beloved childhood favorite would be continued. Though I enjoyed I-III as a little kid, well at least the first one maybe (I was 9), I would argue they're a travesty as an adult. I was hoping this movie would be better than I-III...and it was, but by a very small margin. This is mostly because it was less cringe-worthy. Sadly...I-III, despite the known outcome because of its predecessor trilogy, have a one up on this movie...god I can't believe I'm saying that. Why? It's because they at least have original content. Yes it sucked in its execution, horribly, but it was original. The Force Awakens is not."
1146,2,How can so much money be thrown at a film like this and turn out so bad?,I came here expecting to see only rave reviews of Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens. Im pleasantly surprised.
1147,,"George Lucas made something for art, imagination and hope","Disney bought it from the sell-out (older and richer) Lucas and transforms Disney here into the usual Hollywood dreck riddled and burdened with remakes, reboots, reloads."
1148,9,Like a lightning bolt to the heart,"This film invigorated an interest and a curiosity I haven't felt in so long. I've never been so gleefully entertained at the cinema in my life. Maybe I have been but not in this way. It is a film that excites, enthralls, captivates, wonders, breaks your heart and everything in between. The best part about that is that it earns those moments and executes them with the urgency they deserve. The laughter, the tears, and the joy are all there in a way that purely inherent to the script and Abram's direction. Since it is Star Wars there are some familiar faces like Harrison Ford's ""Han Solo"" but it doesn't rest on nostalgia by integrating them into the film. It's earned by the narrative and the 30 years that have passed between films. The only noticeable flaws for me really are just cosmetic nitpicks. It's like a lightning bolt to the heart."
1149,8,I might know a bit the reason why this series has fascinated everyone.,"Although it was the first time I watched Star Wars series, I was so excited! Above all, it had a really nice pace! I felt it was like comic for boys."
1150,8,'The Force Awakens' meets reasonable expectations; it doesn't have to be a classic!,"Many commentators and reviewers appear to have queued for 'The Force Awakens' in the expectation of seeing the next '2001'. When you remind yourself that the 'Star Wars' franchise is and always has been an action- adventure composed against the backdrop of eclectic sci-fi, you'll probably realise that J.J. Abram's latest contribution isn't out of the ordinary, meeting many reasonable expectations and exceeding others. The action in 'The Force Awakens' (there's a lot of it) is markedly better than that of the previous three 'Star Wars' films. The first time a character uses a lightsaber, the viewer is made instantly aware of Episode VII's departure from the prequels. There are no impossibly fast flurries (which makes sense in the context of the story), and the camera-work is easier to follow. As a result, towards the end of the film we're given a fight which I believe is the most well-presented since Kenobi and Jinn's showdown with Darth Maul in 'The Phantom Menace'. (I think the showdown between Anakin and Kenobi is overrated.) However, I couldn't help but notice that the space combat is overlooked a little in this film; we're expected to acknowledge the above- the-clouds action as an unquestioned presence, it seems. Combining this with the absence of a battle on the scale of Hoth's or Endor's may disappoint some viewers who have been awaiting the return of 'Star Wars'; yet, it should be remembered that this is simply the first instalment in what looks to be a promising trilogy. Complementing the action is a highly competent cast of familiar and new faces, a almost-but-not-quite-annoying presence of humour, and an array of imaginatively rendered landscapes. You've probably heard that 'The Force Awakens' repeats old material and rehashes the plot of earlier films; I noticed, too, but I was sufficiently engrossed to not care. (Was 'Star Wars' *ever* adored for its narrative? Stripping it down to its bare premises reveals a plot hardly more enthralling than that of 'Flash Gordon'!)"
1151,8,Star wars sequels #1: the force awakens,"While I don't particularly love them basically starting a whole other franchise, I guess I will just have to roll with it since after all, it is the start of the sequel trilogy, and it's a good start, so it's a great in terms of a movie, but only good in terms of a sequel."
1152,7,Good movie,Good movie<br /><br />Good movie<br /><br />Good movie<br /><br />Good movie<br /><br />Good movie<br /><br />Good movie<br /><br />Good movie
1153,9,JJ Did It!,"Yes, this film has obvious similarities to 1977's ""A New Hope,"" but its well written new characters breathes new life into the popular generational saga. Veteran actors returning to their popular characters offer feelings of nostalgia throughout. Well acted, emotional, and heart racing are just some of the ways to describe this film. Props to JJ Abrams. Lets us not forget the most important character of all: John Williams score!"
1154,6,Storyline Fatigue meets Political Correctness,"I am a big Star Wars fan and have watched every movie in the theaters since 1977. Unfortunately, this movie is ""storyline fatigue meets political correctness"". Many of your responses on the initial trailer are correct. To all of us Star Wars ""fan bois"", even a saltine cracker tastes like a ritz cracker when you are hungry enough. Although the movie spoilers were kept secret, you can easily see everything coming a mile away. Still, some parts and with good acting can draw a ""feel"". But, many other parts are tiring. I see yet another movie ripped apart by political correctness and it is a shame. This movie does carry on enough to look forward to the upcoming Star Wars movies which I am hopeful."
1155,8,It is a nostalgia fest.,Not going to spoil anything.
1156,6,"Just a concise opinion. Rest assured, you can read a myriad other reviews online. I thought that an extensive contribution would be pointless :)","""Hope is not lost today... it is found."" "
1157,5,Absolutely average,The Force Awakens started out as 'a new hope' for the Star Wars franchise. 
1158,,A good start.,A visually great story that introduces many new characters and can hook the old fans as well as new people to the franchise.<br /><br />The story is obviously similar to A New Hope in order to make a safe starting point for new things to come.
1159,8,The Force Is Strong With This One,"I saw this film twice already. On the December 30th 2015 and on the January 3rd 2016 and it was cool. I mean I love the original Star Wars, saw Return of the Jedi when I was 6 years old and fell in love with the Ewok cause they were so adorable and I wanted to take one home. Now The Force Awaken the biggest film of probably ever [1.4 Billion so far, eat it James Cameron] was entertaining, cool, awesome, BB8 how could you not love that little orange and silver ball of fun and fun. Now I will admit that it's a rip-off of Phantom Menace and New Hope. If you've seen the film you know what I mean by that. I liked the girl Rey and how she is a strong person in a world of sand and metal. BB8 already mentioned him but let's do it again, he's so cute and you cannot love the way he responds to everything like a child learning the ways of the force. Ha! See what I did there? Anyways I don't know why people are surprised that the film is making so much money IT'S STAR WAYS people. It will do well if it was a cartoon version of the film or clay animation so stop bitching and watch it, don't watch it. Lucas is still getting paid. I will be getting this film for sure on Blu-ray when it comes out."
1160,8,It's actually pretty good,"At first when I watched Force Awakens I didn't think much of it other than it being an entire reboot of A New Hope by changing around The Rebels to The Resistance, The Empire to First Order & Death Star to Starkiller Base. Those along with Kylo Ren who was beaten by a nobody ( At that time Rey was a nobody before we knew her to be the granddaughter of Palpatine) which pretty much ruined his character drastically and he is so whiny and pathetic. A Darth Vader Wannabe."
1161,8,"""It's true. All of it. The Dark Side, the Jedi. They're real.""","If there is one film that cannot and will not live up to the hype that surrounds it, it is this one right here. Much like Episode I: The Phantom Menace, there is simply too much riding on it and people will tear it down regardless and there are some people out there doing that right now. Some of their complaints are warranted, others are simply fan boys being idiots. "
1162,8,The Franchise Awakens...,"""Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" (2015), directed by J.J. Abrams, is the latest, much anticipated entry in a series that spans 38 years and counting. Every decade since the seventies has had its ""Star Wars"" and this, the first in a decade, is the start of a new trilogy. George Lucas, the original creator and director of perhaps the most iconic (and financially successful) franchise of all time, sold the rights to the series to Disney in 2012 and it is intriguing to see what ""Star Wars"" without Lucas is like."
1163,7,A Strong Start to This New Trilogy,"My original review of this movie was ridiculously bad. I don't know if that's the case with all of my older reviews, but after rewatching the movie and reading that pathetic review, I felt it needed a re-review. First I will point out what everyone else has: the story of this movie is not original at all and quite a bit is taken from A New Hope. The most obvious is the reuse Death Star plot. I am absolutely sick and tired of the same plot of ""some evil guys built a giant planet destroying space station."" There is so much more you can do with this series than that story or character wise. However, I will defend this a little bit. Kylo Ren, who I'm assuming came up with the idea to build Death Star three, worships the very ground Darth Vader walked on. So, it wouldn't be the only time Kylo Ren copied Vader in some way in the movie. Outside of the Death Star three plot, there are enough different elements for me to keep it interesting and I really love the new characters. Rey was significantly different from Luke and NOT a mary sue in my opinion. Yes, she is really powerful with the force when she uses it and but she is still a well defined character. Her sharp tongue and no nonsense personality make her entertaining me. Plus, unlike mary sues, she is flawed. Her most glaring flaw is that she's living in the past and refuses to move on and accept the inevitable which I personally found very relatable and engaging. Honestly, I think she is a better character than Luke in A New Hope. First of all, Daisy Ridley nails that performance while Mark Hamill always seemed a little bland and kind of whiny to me although he did get better in the later movies. Second, Rey has a more interesting backstory. I mean, she lost her parents at a young age and grew up completely alone for most of her life as a scavenger on Jakku! Luke was just kind of brought to Tatooine and raised by his extended family before leaving with Obi Wan. Third, as I've already mentioned, Rey is very relatable while Luke never really interested or appealed to me. Of the other new characters, Finn and Kylo Ren are the most interesting. I'll quickly discuss Finn first. As I mentioned earlier, having a stormtrooper as a main character is one of the few different things story-wise from A New Hope and it makes Finn a very unique character. He's not however, a dashing hero and more of a coward. I know some people hated that but I think it makes sense given his backstory and adds to his uniqueness more. Now onto Kylo Ren. When I first saw this movie in theaters, I hated this character purely because he killed Han Solo, who's not only my favorite character from the original trilogy, but also his own father. However, after some rewatches, I slowly began to find this character intriguing. When he took of his mask (physically and metaphorically), all I saw was a lost soul who doesn't know his place in the world, not unlike Rey. During the scene where he interrogates Rey especially, a very different side of this character shines through. In nearly every other scene in the film, Kylo Ren is cold, ruthless, demanding and honestly terrifying when angered. Yet in that scene with Rey, he was very civil and gentle with her and never really physically or emotionally harmed her. Even when she clearly angered him by revealing his fear of never being as strong as Darth Vader, he didn't hurt her, at least not intentionally and I don't think he wanted to. This side of his character really fascinated me because we rarely see it. Just that scene and maybe his scene with Han Solo. You know, before he kills him that is. On the topic of that scene, it still makes me cry. That will never change but I realized hating Kylo Ren purely for that was kind of shallow. Especially since from I observed, Kylo Ren found no pleasure or strength in killing his father. He just looked like he was about to cry throughout that whole scene. He's a very conflicted character is my point and it's not cringe worthy at all unlike Anakin. It doesn't justify his actions at all but it does make him interesting and a lot of that comes from Adam Driver's great acting. In fact, the acting in this movie in general is seamless to me. Not once did the acting seem awkward or flat which was one of my problems with A New Hope. Actually, that's not even the only thing this movie does better than A New Hope. I also thought the action and cinematography was a lot more intense and engaging. The action scenes in this movie involve a lot of movement, varied settings, and varied forms of attack unlike A New Hope where two old men tap lightsticks and a group of people shoot down crappy soldiers in tight hallways. Not to say that A New Hope doesn't have good action but The Force Awakens is superior to it in that respect. In conclusion, the Force Awakens did reuse an overdone plotpoint in Star Wars but is overall entertaining and engaging enough for me to enjoy it."
1164,9,"Entertaining, satisfying at least, Star Wars is back !",I remember seeing the first Star Wars in a drive-in in 1977. The last instalment directed by J.J.Abrams is sure a reminiscence of the first story...
1165,7,Star Wars Reboot,**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**
1166,9,One of my faves,"In 1977, I watched A New Hope as a five year old. The Star Wars mythos had me in its grip from the beginning. Now with my 9 year old son we are watching all of the movies in the release order. We just finished watching The Force Awakens. I see all of these negative reviews for the latest movies so I had to add a positive one. It seems like knocking the new Star Wars movies has become trendy like hating Nickelback (although I DO hate Nickelback)!"
1167,7,It's no phantom menace!,"Managed to avoid all reviews and discussion about The Force Awakens before seeing it which was quite an achievement. Can still remember the anticipation before seeing the Phantom Menace for the first time. The trailers to the Phantom Menace were amazing, but the film was not. The trailers for The Force Awakens were far from amazing, but thankfully the movie delivers."
1168,4,A marketing marvel....,I am not a huge fan of starwars series but i respected the idea and the innovation of Lucas arts and all its series deserved a grade above 7. 
1169,,"A conservative, overly familiar, empty, sanitised pastiche which contains precisely zero surprises","J.J. Abrams often likes to work with a single point of reference. With Super 8 it was Spielberg, Cloverfield was Godzilla, Into Darkness was The Wrath of Khan, Fringe was The X-Files. The same applies to The Force Awakens. This time it's the original Star Wars trilogy. Almost everything here is an analogue of something from those films, more often than not, Episode IV."
1170,8,huge mistake,"I m sorry iv been a huge fool, I first went to see star wars and didn't like it just seen it again and I snapped its amazing brilliant, unbelievable, I don't know what I was thinking."
1171,9,A beautiful setup for a new story.,"Some people seem to think this is nothing more than a nostalgia fest, and pure fan service. That Disney and JJ Abrams played it too safe. I don't think people understand what this movie is. The references and call backs were not about fan service. Well maybe they were a little about fan service, but what it actually is, is a farewell to the old and a greetings to the new. The reason for all the reference and nostalgia was to make sure that the Original Trilogy had its proper send off. Did they go a little overboard? Yes, but it does not take away from the new story. Some people also keep saying that this new story is too similar to the old one. That the characters and story mirror each other to closely. I don't see that as the case. Yes the conflict is the same, but the conflict is always the same, even in the real world. History repeats itself. The individual stories and conflicts seem very different to me. In the original trilogy it was Luke's destiny from birth that he must face his father and defeat him to bring balance to the force. This new movie starts with the force pretty much balanced Kylo Ren is not yet strong enough to cause such an imbalance. Rey's purpose in this movie, as the new champion of the light side, is not to bring balance to the force, but simply to fight a war against the dark side. I don't think people completely understand what the force is. The force is an entity, but the light and dark side are not separate philosophies of this entity. They are themselves entities that control the galaxy. They are almost like brother and sister in the fact that they are constantly fighting each other. This film, and I believe this new trilogy, is going to be about a war between the light and the dark. In which each has chosen their champion. This is not a story of balance and redemption, like the OT was, it is a story of war. Also for those complaining about how Rey, who had zero Jedi training, could so easily take on Kylo Ren it's simple. In episode four the force was described, by Obi-Wan, as something that both controls your actions and obeys your command. The reason Rey was able to take on Kylo Ren was because the light side of the force was using her to fight its war against the dark."
1172,10,The force awakens rose again with credit for George Lucas,I couldn't believe I was seeing another Star Wars . When I saw the opening crawl I was finally home in Star Wars again . I still give George Lucas the credit for bringing Star Wars back to life thanks to jj Abrams . Can't wait for more Star Wars films on the way
1173,8,Two underclass heroes revive the rebellion against despotic regime,"The fun comes from the action-packed plot and the great special effects. The emotion comes from the reappearance of treasured old characters and their original actors. First comes Han Solo and Chewbacca (""Chewy, we're home""). Then Han meets his old love Princess Leiea (""You hair is different""). Utlmately the Resistance — and we — reconnect with Luke Skywalker. The powerful Jedi is offered his old light sabre in the hope he will return from his retreat to assume the responsibilities of government. And yes, CP-30 and R2-32 also return. "
1174,7,A safe choice for J.J. Abrams,"The long-awaited seventh episode of STAR WARS is apparently shattering the opening weekend box-office record all over the place, a decade after the prequel trilogy and more than 30 years after the original trilogy. The anticipation is understandably high, since this iconic franchise has been transferred to Disney and under the helm of J.J. Abrams, this first instalment in a new trilogy is self-evidently decisive to reboot the story and carry on the mantle to both gratify hardcores and new audience."
1175,9,the right way to relaunch a franchise,"Before eyes start rolling, trolls start trolling, i LOVE star wars, i grew up with the originals, have seen them countless times, waited with enthusiasm for the prequals, was disappointed beyond measure when they lost the force, laughed scornfully when heard Disney got hold of rights, sneered at idea that yet again star wars was being sold to the highest bidder BUT i loved it and with shame i had to admit within the opening scenes that this was going to be epic. there are going to be certain individuals that will tear apart any attempt to relaunch a much loved story, but i left that behind and sat with wonder while my boyfriend gaped with glee. the outstanding contribution from the actors, extending through to the extras made each scene moving, exhilarating, a true space opera. part of what made Star Wars magical was the level of detail, the busyness of the landscapes, the feel of a very much alive galaxy far far away. this was back with new technology giving everything a polish. body language plays a huge roll, as it did with the magnificent Vader, we were reliant on the nuance of motion, a tilt of the head, a catch in the voice to get behind the mask of the new antagonist. (the voice acting was superb, deep and resonating with emotion). likewise without seeing the face, we are introduced to a storm trooper who sees with clarity what he has become. The musical score was ever present, swelling at times and yet unnoticeable as a separate thing. it became part of the landscape, and lacked the gimmicky trills and flamboyancy of the prequels (thank goodness) The space battles were glorious and not overdone. each one having purpose and power. the droids were funny and witty, restoring the humour as it was originally. The driving force of the story returns to the notion of family,the destruction of not having one, the loss of loved ones, and the idea that power and family are not compatible. some felt the antagonist Kylo Wren was spoilt and shallow, but in him i saw and felt the despair of a family touched by power (lets not forget the Jedi trained separated from all influence light or dark to avoid corruption) and in him we see that to have power is very lonely indeed. Cannot wait for the next installment, to follow the enchanting Rey on her journey. Don't let trolls make your mind up, watch it and decide."
1176,6,Bizarre,"Reminded me of the Get Smart episode Picture of Dorian Gray. We have Hans Solo as an old man, princess Lea with a drawl like someone with dementia, chewbacca, son of Darth Vader, a Death Star (name changed of course), the obligatory welcome home, and the Millennium Falcon with cobwebs."
1177,9,Star Wars VII: The Magic Reawakens,"Didn't quite ever claim Jedi as a religion on census form, but could have - until the three forgettable, interchangeable, poorly scripted and cast prequels soured the Star Wars experience."
1178,7,Satisfying but unoriginal reboot,"Everybody seems to either be jumping up and down for joy or chomping at the bit to dissect and destroy this film -- I thought it was just good clean fun, nothing as memorable as the original films but nothing to really complain about if you're a fan of this type of thing. The new characters are pretty well developed, especially John Boyega's ""Finn"", who has some of the attributes of Han Solo in the original film but who is also amusingly man-childish, which makes sense considering that his character has been locked up in a military academy and mopping floors on the death star in his spare time. It's charming when he flirts with Rey (Daisy Ridley) like a 14 year old with his first crush, and when he's reunited with pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), he thinks Poe is serious when he starts ribbing him (""hey, that's my jacket!"")."
1179,4,a real trash...,"Frankly, this review doesn't contain any spoiler. All I will say is, Force Awakens is a very bad summary of the previous Star Wars movies. There is nothing new, not even a single moment. From my point of view, telling this is not a spoiler but a sign that the movie is a real trash.The story is very predictable. Honestly, after the first five minutes, the movie lost me. There is no character development phase. If you don't know the previous movies, there is no way you can get the story. If you know the previous movies, you can predict each and every moment of the movie. In any case, bad plot, even worse story telling. What were they thinking? Lets make a bigger death star. Put Ford in the center of the story. Make good advertisement and everything will be OK. Everything went OK for Episode 7. They made quite some money but I don't think incoming episodes will get any of this attention. Moral of the story, overrated pop corn movie with nothing (I really mean nothing) special. Don't destroy your good old memories."
1180,,It's Star Wars for new generation.,That's what I told the guy sitting next to me in the theatre in South San Francisco off of 280 when he and I exchanged some thoughts on the then new Star Wars film.
1181,9,A spectacular return to the Star Wars cinematic universe.,"Though I will freely admit that I saw this movie through rose-tinted glasses, I can safely say that The Force Awakens, after two viewings, met all of my expectations. This is a pure action-adventure science fiction film, and its 135 minutes run at an absolute tear from beginning to end, with little quarter given. In short: it is, technically speaking, exactly what the anti-prequel crowd was looking for."
1182,8,I Was Very Disappointed-An Unimaginative Remake of Chapter IV,"O.K. BB-8 is not as bad as Jar-Jar Binks. Technically superior to ""A New Hope"" but essentially an obvious remake; not a new chapter. So much unexplained background. Why does Han Solos' son turn evil? Why is the Emperor a projected image of a giant ogre with a scared face? The New Hope is female, and who is she related to? (I suspect that she's the daughter of Luke Skywalker.) Too many painful deaths. Han Solo killed by his own son? Heroes and villains both die. Very much like a James Bond franchise. How many times did they essentially remake ""Thunderball"" with variations? At least three? Best enjoyed by a brand-new generation of fans. For us older die-hard fans, it's depressing to see everyone looking so old. Only the 'droids and Chewie seem ageless. Wonderful and thrilling yet redundant and unimaginative at the same time: 1. Similar evil villains. 2. Similar heroes. 3. Another Death-Star, only it's bigger. 4. Same battleships and same dog fights. 5. A Death-Star blows up. Again."
1183,8,"Remake of Episode 4, But Still Satisfying","Star Wars, the Force Awakens, is a movie with a curious mission-- basically an attempt to reinvigorate a cinematic series which at its height was revolutionary but which lost its way in its prequel trilogy due to bad decision-making and mediocre film-making. The new reboot remedies this essentially by going back to the fundamentals, by trying very earnestly to recapture what made the movies so appealing to begin with. "
1184,10,Not for super star wars fans?,"I really don't understand why hard-core star wars fans don't like this, I mean come on the original 3 movies barely hold up today, this was a great movie great new cast and great CGI."
1185,6,Remember the hollywood motto: Keep making sequels until the gross goes down...,"I like/have liked all the Star Wars movies and I did like this one, though not as well as the first three (IV-VI). Rogue I was written and produced to answer questions/fill in some gaps between III & IV. VII is just a rework of IV though VI. High octane CGI X-Wing vs. Tie Fighters; Rey lives on a desert planet in an obscure position, has The Force 'strong' within her and develops her skills with the force throughout; The map to Luke is hidden in a droid is a major subplot; Han leads another team to destroy a support position that leads to the death of the Super Death Star; etc... It was entertaining even if most of it was not original and there is too much CGI (CGI is nothing more than more sophisticated Saturday morning cartoons). Remember the hollywood motto: Keep making sequels until the gross goes down..."
1186,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens Jedi Review (Spoilers),Review by Golden State Haunts and Events
1187,7,An adequate return for the franchise.,The movie recreates the nostalgia of the first original movies in the story wars saga while also creating a new set of characters. The movie has some spectacular visuals then I felt it could easily be compared to a new hope. Overall though the film was pleasurable and is a must see for the general audience.
1188,10,A Brand New Hope,"After months of eagerly awaiting the star wars franchise to return and with mostly high hopes from the director ""J.J.Abrams"" I returned home from the midnight release of this classic movie with feelings a movie hasn't made me feel in a very long time. I returned home quickly removing my t shirt to cool down from the sweaty grip of the cinema screen, feeling almost relieved that it was over but desperately wanting more. The curtains widened and the classic rolling yellow letters appeared on screen accompanied by ""John Williams"" iconic soundtrack and after that everything fell into place. The return of everyone's favorite characters created immense amounts of nostalgia and I couldn't help but have a big cheesy grin on my face every time a familiar face appeared. The new cast were equally as good as the oldies and an exceptional performance from ""Oscar Isaac"" as to be expected, these new performances really held the movie together. The characters the new cast played were brilliant and fitted in great with the star wars story. The main winning point for this movie is the sheer fact that it most definitely is Star Wars, from start to finish it was good old Star Wars, Bravo."
1189,6,Nothing new in 30 years.Dramatic for a sci-fi film,"Nothing new in 30 years! Original film was a great success, because of creativity and innovation showed at that time. This new edition it is no more than just a remake of past success with absolutely nothing new: same older stars offer just a shy interpretation, with exception of Harrison Ford, with an active role. It am quite disappointed that action place 30 years after and you see exactly same aircrafts, same weapons,... nothing, nothing new. No evolution in 30 years. When first Star Wars film was first released there were no mobile phones, no Wifi, no PCs,... but now action in this film happens 30 later with no technologic progress within the history, no new ideas, almost same history. In the other hand Daisy Ridley, Rey, offers a great interpretation. I am sure she will become a great film star, while others with be forgotten, as it happened with Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher. Star Wars always push some actors (Harrison Ford, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor...) and others became forgettable. An entertainment film but very mediocre! Good for nostalgic people and young people, but very far (light years) from what it was first film and some sequels. Mission Impossible, James Bond,... have evolved . But it is incredible that a Sci-Fi film did not! Walt Disney's creativity seems frozen."
1190,3,Junkfood,"I've just seen New Hope...again. FA is a boring and stale remake nothing else. I will avoid Abrams movies from now on at all costs. He is the most untalented and unimaginative director I can think of. Lucas turned a wild but unique idea into a franchise. This movie was made only to keep that franchise running. Script, dialogues, jokes - all made for 14 year old brain dead, the violence in the movie was quite above that age. And they even brought back whiny Jedi boy as the new Yoda... how much BS can you feed to the masses and even be successful?"
1191,,Hard to evaluate,"This is one though movie to rate. Well, perhaps I shall start by saying that walking out out the theater, I found myself well entertained and I enjoyed the two or so hours spent so my impression is a positive one, but there were a couple of things that were also bothering me about ""The Force awakens"". Thinking about it a bit more, the movie, ultimately, feels unnecessary to the whole saga, but that is perhaps because it's more of an introduction to the new trilogy itself. Regardless of that, the movie plays things far too safe and is, as you surely already have heard or read, a rehash of ""Star Wars"" for the most part. There are so many parallels that I've keep wondering how the makers decided to run with it without the feeling of cheating preventing them to do so. It suffers from the opposite problems of the prequels, as weirdly as it may sound."
1192,9,A bridge between generations of Star Wars fans. JJ Abrahams got it right!,"After the prequels I was very sceptical about another Star Wars movie. Mainly because the prequels -despite the fact if you like them or not- lacked that feeling I have when I watch a Star Wars movie from the Original Trilogy. And to be honest, I was pretty sure it's impossible to create a movie in this age that would be able to give me that same feeling again."
1193,8,A pretty solid movie... I don't understand the sudden hate,"The Force Awakens, seventh episode of the Star Wars franchise, debuted in 2015, and I remember all the hype and how everyone was excited, after all, Star Wars faced a hiatus of 10 years, the last movie was Revenge of the Sith, in 2005. But most of the people were excited to see Luke, Leia and Han again in the big screen, and know what happened to the galaxy after Return of the Jedi. In the opening week of the film, I remember all the buzz. Critics are good, the audience loved, and everybody wanted to see what'll come next to Star Wars. Well, 4 years later, and I decided to rewatch the movie. Like in 2015, I enjoyed the movie. The movie is well directed, thanks to JJ Abrams, the writing is fine, the pace and the editing is amazing , the acting was on point, the visual effects are astonishing, but that is predictable, and from my point of view, that makes The Force Awakens a good and enjoyable movie, how I said in the title, it was solid."
1194,8,The Glorious Return of the STAR WARS Saga,"STAR WARS has made its glorious return. Real STAR WARS, not that garbage about trade negotiations or Gungans or whatever. Real STAR WARS with Luke Skywalker (sort of), Han Solo, no-longer a princess Leia, and the Millennium Falcon. After reinvigorating the STAR TREK film franchise for new audiences, director J.J. Abrams stepped into what could have been a disastrous end to his career with the seventh installment of the STAR WARS saga. THE FORCE AWAKENS was no doubt the most anticipated film ever as it brought us back into the beloved universe and continues the tale thirty or so years after the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. I saw it twice in theaters and I've watched it a few times more since it was released on home video, and I'm happy to say that my opinion on the movie hasn't changed much. THE FORCE AWAKENS is a good movie. I find it thoroughly entertaining as long as I don't think on it too much. It has some issues, as is expected of any movie, but it's so much fun to watch that I'm able mostly see past them. The beginning of a new chapter, and the passing of the torch to a new generation of heroes, THE FORCE AWAKENS is about the search for Luke Skywalker (who's gone into hidden seclusion since a pupil of his turned to the dark side) and the race to save the citizens of the galaxy from the First Order from their new super-weapon."
1195,10,Sublime experience,"The Force Awakens have exceeded my expectations by far. Is not only a beautiful story full of love for your old characters, but also a new story with lots still to unravel. Star Wars die hards won't be disappointed. Specially impressive were the special effects. Is not the typical shoot and boom, disappears in tiny little spots of light. Things get crippled here. There is a reality to the special effects, I don't know if is the fact that the film was shot in actual film, meaning chemical photographic process, props are real, there is real people inside the aliens, there are also actual miniature models of the ships. All that contributes to the ""vintage"" look of the film. Is like watching a sequel to Episode 6. Wait a minute, it is a sequel to Episode 6. So, there you have it, people. Go there and enjoy every bit of it. I'm watching it more than once. I already saw it in 3D, and loved it at first sight. Now I know everything that is going to happen, and I can go back and watch it again, but in 2D this time, to really savor every bit of it, and look for tiny details here and there. Special importance is to listen to the dialogs carefully. There is a ton of information, and they left a lot for the next two movies... or more..."
1196,6,"Much better than the prequels, but nothing special.","The Star Wars prequels were so bad that even a 10 year old could make a better movie, but JJ Abrams got so nervous that he decided to use the same story as in ""A New Hope"", but with different actors under different names."
1197,10,Absolutely Amazing,"More than 10 years after the last Star Wars movie as released, the Force Awakens was well worth the wait. The First Order is now a threat, thirty years after the defeat of Emperor Palpatine. Luke Skywalker has disappeared, leaving behind only cryptic pieces of a map to trace where he is. The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa, struggles to fight the First Order while searching for Luke. On the far off desert planet of Jakku, resistance pilot Poe tries to obtain a piece of the map to Luke's location, however Stormtroopers invade and Poe is forced to leave the map with BB-8, his droid. A scavenger, Rey, finds BB-8 and is unassumingly drawn into an epic journey, where she will come face to face with the evil dark lord, Kylo Ren, the infamous Han Solo himself, and... the Force."
1198,7,What's old is new what's new is OLD.,"First of all I was around and saw the first Star Wars IV release in 1977. It wasn't represented as part of a story. It was just ""Star Wars""."
1199,9,Awaken the force it is...(Yoda),"Star Wars:The Force Awakens. So this franchise that is about as iconic to the film industry as Titanic is to disasters, anyone and everyone knows it, has read it, or seen it. I wasn't born yet when the First film made its debut and even when Return of the Jedi came out I was still just a little guy, so it took sometime till the mid 90's when I had the wherewithal and understanding of the film. Of coarse as a teen you watched and it was good, you liked all the light-sabers, X-wings, and Tie Fighters, but little did you realize what's about to come. Graduating high school and here it is Episode 1:The Phantom Menace, drawing just as much buzz and fan fare as The Force Awakens, the story for the guys and gals that were in they're 30's when the first film was released was going to show its roots, This installment drew fans divided, some liked it, a lot did not. The story really picks up in Episode 2:Attack of the Clones, you see young Anakin Skywalker start his journey to master Jedi, learning the force from his teacher Obi Wan Kenobi. This story from beginning to end is just great, and it wasn't till Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith that now OK, yes I am officially a Star Wars superfan! Seeing the relationship between Anakin and Obi Wan, how The Dark Side twisted his mind, giving birth to The Galactic Empire, and Darth Vader. I can't tell you how many people had no idea of why Darth Vader where's the suit that he does, the helmet. If you don't know, just stop reading. So now in my 30's I have finally watched all films, all cuts, and Star Wars for me is indeed near and dear to my heart. I mean who wouldn't want to be in this future society with a lightsaber, and your looked at and revered like a CIA operative, respect. I wish in my daily life I could walk around in nice robe, have a weapon, and knowing others know that I only use my skills if I am threatened. And that's all without using and understanding the Force, I guess compare it to something that is tangible for us today, like deep meditation. Having a keen sense of danger, or when something is not right. I do feel bad for the men and women that felt just like me, and didn't make it long enough to see, yes, Episode 7:The Force Awakens. The story picks up almost 30 years after The Return of the Jedi, and the lead is a poor girl struggling to survive in a desert wasteland on planet Jakku, named(Daisy Ridley)Rey who one day here's a little droid struggling to escape from the clutches of a scavenger, BB-8. This little droid does more than hold his own, writer/director J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan and Micheal Arndt did an amazing job, and the personality they gave to BB-8 will leave you wanting one of your own, just like for everyone when I was too young it was R2/D2. R2 is an iconic figure and it's sure that BB-8 will be too. During her plight there's an ongoing struggle from the new First Order, the realigned Galctic Empire, are in search of this very same droid, suspecting it has the whereabouts of yes, who everyone is looking for, Luke Skywalker. During this one of the storm troopers has a battle of self conscious to see that what they are doing is wrong, Finn(John Boyega),he decides to escape, during this they capture a prisoner, a rebellion fighter pilot Poe Dameron(Oscar Isaac) together they escape and he tells them of his droid that he needs to find, aft crash landing and getting separated Finn finds the desert wasteland and stumbles upon, BB-8. This encounter is what takes the rest of the story off. The writing was great, the directing was spot on, obviously you can't please everyone so,there will be some to say ""should've had this, should have done that"", hell even I think that the scene where they go to the hideout and they walk into the bar, the music should have been that iconic bar tune that everyone has come know and love. J.J. Did give the fans most of what they wanted, he also made this HIS Star Wars, you did get the icons that everyone wanted, Han Solo, the Millennium Falcon, and Chewbacca. I loved this film, I would've changed only a few things, which ain't much and wouldn't have affected the story. I'm glad to see where the story is going, Episode 8 is going to have a lot of shoes to fill, because Mark Hamill will be a major player in it. Overall if your a Star Wars fan, without question your going to see it and like it. For those who read this review that aren't fans, and to those that are,MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!"
1200,7,In short,"I hope people saw episode 4-5-6 before seeing this, because is doesn't seem like it. I feel sorry for kasdan who had to endure through Abrams super hollywoodification of this epic saga."
1201,1,It's Basically Episode IV Again Not really a spoiler,"I get that it is called The Force Awakens.... but they didn't have to awaken the same movie that was already done, did they?"
1202,,Star Wars is dead,"The only merit of this film, I would say, is the return of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, which reminds us of our childhood memory. "
1203,9,A bridge to the next generation,"First of all, I made the perfect decision to not see any spoilers or reviews before watching Star Wars: the Force Awakes. I watched it without any prejudice nor being bothered by rumors or negative reviews. I only knew Han Solo and Chewbacca would be appeared in this episode, and that the time has passed to thirty years in the story after the defeat of Darth Vader and the Empire. I was a little worried it could be a bad film, since Disney bought the right to the Star Wars production, and George Lucas was not involved with the creation of this film. When I had a first look at the trailer, it looked good although I had somewhat of a bad feeling about the casting in which Disney tired so hard in choosing the characters not to be racist with the story."
1204,8,A cute gift to star wars fans,Compare this to episode 8 and 9 and its a masterpiece...i hope the people shredding this are doing the same to the last jedi as that is a disgrace of a film. This film obviously repeats the plot of a new hope but it is charming and well acted and full of hope and light and love for the originals. The next film however is the opposite. 1 gem in the trilogy.
1205,9,A very good sequel,***** NO SPOILERS *****
1206,9,"Simply Magical, A Dream Come True.",WARNING: Spoiler Heavy Review!
1207,6,"In short, A New Hope patch 2.0","Disney decided to tread safely, and financially, it makes absolute sense. The problem is, art always suffers from ""safe"". Then again, if you want art, don't seek it in a blockbuster. On the other hand, the reason Star Wars is so popular is because one guy decided to risk, mixing art with pop culture and risked again years later, introducing Shakespearean moral themes, deliberately strange dialogue reflecting Homer's techniques used in his epics to convey ""hidden"" messages to further emphasize the passive precognition of the Jedi. Not all the risks pay off or are noticed. Still, an artist takes those risks, and for that I am grateful they were taken by Lucas. Disney's approach on the other hand, while does have good elements in it, ultimately feels shallow."
1208,10,awesome,"While its not perfect by any means, The Force Awakens as a whole was incredible, just absolutely breath-taking. The cast and the performances were great, the characters were grounded and felt actually interesting while maintaining a skillful balance between nostalgia and future. Everything about this movie is just so perfectly executed and played out. As I said, the characters had real conflict and emotions that the audience connects with and relate to, literally no character in this film was uninteresting by any means. Sure a lot of it plays off of A New Hope and there some things about the movie that I felt were a bit off, mostly that Rey was able to pick up her use of the force and demonstrate it as if she was a trained Jedi as well as fight Kylo Ren with absolutely no light saber based training. But overall, I could not believe how good this film turned out to be, its easily one of the best films 2015 and Star Wars has to offer and would recommend for both new fans and old."
1209,6,"Good action movie, if not compared to originals","Yesterday I watched it twice on Dbox and 2-D to get feeling of both. Initial reaction, it was a good movie, and that's it. Not amazing or terrible. Now it did not reach my expectations maybe because even I did not not what was I expecting, however most of the reviews which say that it is not that good, I do agree with them somewhat(excluding the exaggeration). "
1210,10,A Graceful Sequel to the Greatest Story Ever Told,"Like many people, Star Wars was a immense part of my childhood. I watched with wonder the masterpieces of the Original Trilogy, and waited in anticipation for the Phantom Menace, a movie with expectations so high, an entire fandom would cry out in anguish if it were to let them down. And boy did it ever."
1211,6,Star Wars,"I will not be one of those people that give this movie a ""10"" because they are blind to everything and want to hype the movie. I'm not going to give this movie a ""1"" to force everyone out of the clouds, and down rank this movie as much as I can. What I will say is that this movie falls short of a Star Wars fan that has watched all of the movies countless times. I give this movie a ""6"" because this movie wasn't absolutely terrible, but it fell short of the expectations that the previous movies bring. So let's go into why I feel this way."
1212,4,Makes the prequels suddenly seem much better.,"This is the first Star Wars movie I've seen that doesn't feel like a StarWars movie. Not once. After watching this, all I could think was, heck, ""The Phantom Menace,"" Jar Jar Binks and all, was vastly more original, exciting, and fun. I like the new protagonist, and Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have some good moments. Did I mention that everything in the movie is a retread, mostly from A New Hope? Did I mention that it's a bloated two and a half hours long, but only seems like six? Did I mention that it never once achieves that sense of soaring wonder and elation that even the prequels occasionally achieve? This is sad."
1213,,Wonderfully enjoyable but overly derivative,"In the beginning, we had what we learned was to be a middle trilogy (1977-1983). Then, after a long wait of 16 years, we had the prequel triptych (1999-2005). Now, after a delay of another 10 years which has been particularly painful for fans to endure, we arrive at the beginning of the sequel triplet. George Lucas, who conceived the whole project and directed and wrote four of the six previous films, is no longer on the scene, having sold the rights to Disney, replaced as guiding spirit by J J Abrams who directed, co-produced and co-wrote. The expectations of fans placed on Abrams have been absolutely immense but this is the man who heroically reinvented the ""Star Trek"" film franchise. So, has he succeeded? Most assuredly and satisfyingly - but at a certain price."
1214,8,"Some New Ideas, but Not Nearly Enough","I was definitely excited for this movie, as were most people. When I finally did see it I was a little disappointed. "
1215,9,"Don't listen to the nitpickers, this film is a thrill ride","After reading reviews on here, it stuck me that the majority are negative?? I saw TFA last night and I have to say I loved it! "
1216,10,Amazing,"When it comes to SCFI movies I not really pleased but Star wars is by far the best I have been I huge fan of the series ever since I first watch episode 1 that was released back in 1999 with that annoying character jar jar binks which every one hates but I like. This movie is by far a great follow up too the last six films. This movie has great moments in it which I love. BB8 is wonderful as a new character and member to the star wars gang, he has mix of R2D2 and C3po in him which is what I love about his character. overall this is movie you should watch if you are in the mood "
1217,10,Too Much Hate than it's being given!!!,I think this movie gets way too much hate from fans. They say it's too similar to the original Star Wars film. 
1218,6,The War is Salvaged: Episode VII,"A deserved Billion Dollar movie? Absolutely not. A deserved Record Breaking movie? Again, not a chance."
1219,9,Finally a real Star Wars movie!,"The first real Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi, and better than the aforementioned. Not better than IV or V, but a solid/excellent member of the franchise."
1220,6,"Poorly written, uninspired Disney cash in.","In late 2014, a trailer for the first Disney Star Wars was released, teasing new characters, planets and a promise of adventure, 10 years after the release of Episode III."
1221,10,The story continues,"Some one once asked me if I liked one of the prequel films, I cant remember which it was but thats irrelevant to my feelings, to me it was just another bit in a very long story, a story I have lived with for nearly forty years, so any episode is just another bit of that story and accepting the first trilogy as worthwhile means any before and afters are simply backing up that original concept . There is no book , there is no founding tradition beyond those first three films so whatever happens we are stuck with what the guys with finance give us its that simple . Its a franchise still evolving unlike bond or the bible we don't have a back reference point beyond the Lucas imagining of Ep4. All that said I enjoyed this awakening but with the success of the star trek revamp I was fairly sure JJA would do a professional and thoughtful job of continuing the saga satisfactorily. In minutia, I thought all the cast performances were excellent. new and old well blended. The sfx were superb, but what else would we expect.The production values beyond the sky and the emotional content almost too much to bear at times. I confess I didn't 'get' all the script and I doubt many 12 year olds will but for me a few more viewings should sort that out. I thought period continuity was really cleaver and gave me great comfort at times. I hesitate to say, just go and see it but I think you wont be disappointed if you do and then you can talk about it with all the rest of the world, although 20 years ago I did meet a man who didn't know what Star Wars was, quite refreshing but unlikely to happen ever again in my life!!!"
1222,7,"Short on originality, but made with enough quality to be encouraging","After much reluctance, I have decided to present my basic thoughts on the much anticipated (and polarizing) new installment of ""Star Wars"". I'm not going to go through any formalities or introductions for this franchise or its cultural impact, nor should I have to. Anyone reading this should have a sufficient understanding of such things. The fundamental question on the minds of the masses is whether ""The Force Awakens"" succeeds as the initiatory chapter in a new story, and for me the answer is, mostly, ""yes""."
1223,1,Star Wars Broken Not Awoken,"With hope that Disney would not ruin this movie as the done many others, I hoped that this one would one of the few Disney movies that was good. I was so disappointed already when the episode 7 text rolled over the screen. This would make anyone with some circulation think that it was to continue off where episode 6 ended or at least have some links to it. No this is a totally Disney project of moneymaking nothing else. There is no force, no logic, no humour, no drama, just a mindless chase movie that is slightly more fun to watch than a dog running after it's tail. The essence of star wars is not present with exception the scenes where Harrison Ford was in. It was Han Solo and that was about the only good thing about the movie. They should have made episode 12, reboot and exclude the old characters as the storyline is broken and full of holes that can fit a death star in it. For the love of god, another death star? Oh sry death planet.. they made such a good scenery and costumes for the movie, but it's just empty. The movie would be better without any dialouges at all as this is the worst I have seen in ages for a high budget movie. I give it 1 because one point for good scenery, cgi and costumes. The rest is mindless junk, but that is what sells sadly. This was the end of the Star Wars for me. The circle is now complete. Sad ending to such a good saga."
1224,,"A real blast at the movies, but not without faults","I've been waiting since 1983 to know what this gang gets up to after Return of the Jedi. The prequels are stone cold awful... Ep III being the least poorly done. I sat down at the theater with my 2 kids, with a full 12 months of hype and product placement in my mind."
1225,8,Back to a winning formula,"The first Star Wars movie, ""Episode III: A New Hope,"" set the pattern, characters, plot, and setting for all subsequent ""episodes."" With ""A New Hope"" being by far the best of the lot, it made sense for the producers, after losing sight of what made that such a fantastic film (great visuals, not taking itself too seriously, classic good guys vs. bad guys, action-packed climax, etc.) to try to go back to that winning formula. The new story has a lot of ""in jokes"" which someone who hasn't seen Episode III wouldn't get. It also has certain character roles repeated with slight twists, i.e. social misfit who's real adventurous and skilled with weapons-Luke Skywalker in the first movie, Rey in this one - except Rey is female. Death Star as center of villainy in the first film, super giant Death Star in the same role this time. X-Wing fighters blowup Death Star using plans smuggled to them by a cute droid: R2D2 in the first film, BB-8 in this one. The list goes on and on, but at least the script and editing are good enough to make the story entertaining, if somewhat repetitive. Many inconsistencies bothered me but one in particular. When someone is handing a light saber to another person, shouldn't it be handle first? That rule applies to guns, knives, and other dangerous elements but that doesn't stop Rey from handing the weapon blade-first to Kylo Ren. (I think Han Solo should have thought of that also when he was trying to get Kylo Ren to switch sides, with disastrous results, for Han.)"
1226,10,Appeal for Justice for Non-Jedis and Ordinary people,"The creators of the story should have done a little more justice to the character of Han Solo. As I could see Han Solo had a very troubled life. Most part of his life was spent in fighting. To me he seems to be the real hero of the story rather than the great Jedi's or Dark warriors. Didn't he deserve a better ending. He was an ordinary man. He never seemed to get the treatment he deserved from his wife. But that's OK most relationships in real life are like that. No father should ever have to die by their son's hand especially when he loves his child. Han Solo was never strong with the force although he had witnessed its usage and power. He didn't even know the way to come back from dead. Like the great Jedis Anakin, Obiwan, and Yoda. They had found a path to commune with the living men and disciples even after their death. "
1227,9,Good Job JJ! (non-SPOILER review),"I managed to FINALLY get around to seeing this long-anticipated 7th installment in the franchise over the holidays. I realize most have seen this already, but I'll still try to do a ""non-SPOILER"" review if possible. "
1228,8,I've got a good feeling about this.,The force is strong with this one.
1229,6,"Not a masterpiece, not original, but it's authentic and exciting","You know what you're going to get with J.J. Abrams: an effective and entertaining blockbuster, never short on excitement and rarely failing to succeed in its goals - because it never strays far from a pretty basic formula."
1230,10,Great Reboot to introduce to new audiences,Great entertaining film which tied together old characters and storyline with the new next generation of characters.
1231,7,Star Wars - The JJ Style,I really had a great expectations on Star Wars: The Force Awakens which directed by JJ. Especially JJ is one of the great director who best in sci-fi.
1232,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - A Review by Nathan Fischer,"Star Wars has never been as huge as it is today. That's saying a lot. The universe George Lucas originally created has only gotten bigger since the release of A New Hope. Now Disney and JJ Abrams brings us the next installment, The Force Awakens. For many fans, this is a way to right what the prequels did wrong. Well fans can breath a sigh of relief. This is the Star Wars movie we have all been waiting for. I'm not going to go in to huge plot details here in case there are readers who have not seen the film. But by no means will this be spoiler free. That is a warning."
1233,7,"Haters will hate, no cure for that","I spent the last half an hour reading first few dozens of reviews on IMDb. Every single one was bashing with the rate from 1/10 (big majority) to maximum 4/10. Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are a minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in the huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not a bad movie at all. Haters claim this is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still, it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it."
1234,1,"Boring, VERY BORING and without any magic of its predecessors","The history of Star Wars ends in ""The return of the Jedi"" and that's all. all was said. No doubt about it. The rise and fallen of a hero, and his redemption across her son. there's no more in Star Wars movies."
1235,,MCU is great,"We finally got to watch this fabulous, marvellos, fantastic film. MCU. It is by Mr Disney and Mr Abrams very kind and ncie geniuses.<br /><br />It was funny it was fabulous it was marvellos and we finally saw it because until now every time we go to theatre it is sold out completely and utterly with no chance of tickets. <br /><br />Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) is a riot of laughter and full of wars in the stars."
1236,8,Best science fiction film in a long time,I am going to point out first that this film does have a few flaws. But no movie is perfect. J.J. Abrams and Lucasfilm have created a love letter to all the Star Wars fans especially those who loved the Original Trilogy. I would like to point a few positives than I will explain the negatives. 
1237,10,An intriguing bridge between the Prequels and Original Trilogy,"It's back! And this time there's virtually no cheese, no trade embargoes, no long winded Jedi meetings, and no seizure inducing over-used CGI. I noticed that the plot wasn't anything new, but then I also noticed that I wasn't caring about that."
1238,9,Sars Warts,"""New emotions, new exciting faces, new exciting faces wake up. JJ Abrams is reborn a hope that inexplicably had died in the world. Fans! Calm! Jeffrey has done and the best way. Jacob to renovated, improved and matched what has been achieved by George"" "
1239,10,"""We're Home""",The good:
1240,7,Better than the prequel trilogy,"I believe it was 3 years ago when the announcement came that Disney bought the rights to Star Wars and announced that they were making a new trilogy of movies. When I heard this, my thoughts were ""this is a joke"". I continued to hold that thought over that period of time and the hype surrounding the movie was unfathomable. I honestly did not see how it would be possible to continue after the events of Return of the Jedi."
1241,8,Was the hype justified?,"I had the misfortune of watching all 6 previous episodes before viewing this movie. Both trilogies before this had very clear targets. Episodes 4, 5, 6 had the death of the Emperor as main purpose. And it was beautifully scripted and played. Episodes 1, 2, 3 had the creation of Vader as main purpose. Even if I did not appreciate these movies the first time I saw them, viewing them again, with full knowledge of the story, was a surprise really. They had a quite good overarching story, and the evil genius of the emperor was really well portrayed. Creating a conflict in which he was on both sides, it was a good script, and in the midst of action, alongside Anakin, Qui Gon, Yoda, Windu, Obi Wan, you tend to do the same as the Jedi: focus on the task at hand, and wait for the well planned and well played hand of the emperor to develop. Episode 3, and the last scenes were again, quite good. And then comes episode 7. What was decisive for episode 7, was the version of the universe it was set up in. I expected to see a universe more similar to episode 1. Full of life, and freed from the evil empire. I think this was my biggest disappointment. The fact that they made all the fight of such great characters (Luke, Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca) to be for nothing really. It is disappointing to see a character appeared from nowhere (Snoke) could in 3 decades make all good characters to appear as if they never won. How about a version of the universe in which they had 30 years of peace, and these old characters need no back story because it was peace-time? It makes much more sense than all that non-sense presented as explanations in 2-3 phrases over the duration of the film. Really, what do they plan to do, a 6.5 episode??? There lays the key to the disappointment of most Star Wars fans. And while there is hope for the trilogy, they really need to stop it with blasting Death Stars, especially with 0 planning. It was like a brain-storming over coffee is sufficient to destroy a heavily militarized huge planet. Come. On. I really dislike that they made the movie for kids, and marketed it as a sequel for fans. Think of it. There was no mention of a Death Star in the trailers, nor of this joke character Snoke. If I saw that CGI created pseudo-Sith lord, I probably would have passed on the whole movie. The lack of character development was obvious. I would have preferred a slower story, with no Death Star destroyed in the first episode, but with good characters. Even if we don't know much about her, Rey is the only good thing in the whole story. Kylo Ren for me just did not deliver. Even if he killed Han Solo, he just did not seem credible, even after that. Maybe if he had the mask on all the time. The same can be said about most characters. Harrison Ford was good, but my guess is that he did not want to be involved in the next movies, so they had to take him out of the story. It felt a rushed move. The whole movie is in a hurry actually. Hurry up, quick, there needs to be time to blow up a super weapon after we briefly introduce the characters. To conclude, I think this franchise was conceived with episode 6 as the last episode. The death of Yoda is a symbol to that. I am still hopeful for the future, as probably they have scripted a good finale for the trilogy. But taking episode 7 by itself, it is probably the worst so far. And that should be of concern to Abrams. He may choose to just sell us toys, but it will come at the cost of his name in the business. If he wrecks this up, many people will avoid his movies in the future."
1242,6,They owe us episode 6.5,I was absolutely sure this was going to be an epic failure. Disney. Star Wars. The horrible taste the prequels left us with. 
1243,8,Is this the best Star Wars movie ever?,"This shares a lot of the same structural problems as Episode I, but it's better made, more energetically assembled, and with stronger dialogue which helps make up for it. There are a lot of stories floating around in this thing which obfuscates the emotional core of the film, which does float to the surface by the end, though it's not quite as well built as it could be."
1244,6,"Messy and cluttered, but mostly comes together",I want to like this latest SW episode. I really do. However.... 
1245,4,Myeh.....,"It is difficult to be blasé about Star Wars if you are one of the millions who live with George Lucas' seminal epic rattling around in your brain. Even if you aren't, even if you're only a casual bystander, you still cannot deny that Star Wars is an experience, something special, a mythology given to those of us who were lucky enough to have spent our formative years in the last third of the twentieth century. It is fashionable to make fun of it, but those who dismiss it overlook its impact. Look at the movies you've been attending for the last three decades; look at the video games; look at the storytelling. It owes something to Star Wars."
1246,,"Yeah, it has problems, but the force is still with this series . . .","Saw this yesterday and I still have a good feeling from it, and can't stop listening to the soundtrack. I enjoyed every minute of it: the drama, the humor, the old and new, the special effects, and the overall energy and emotions that the movie transmits. "
1247,10,Really enjoyed it,"Episode VII in the ""Star Wars"" saga serves to reunite some of our favorite characters (and actors) from the very first film of 1977. Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo, as is Carrie Fisher as the Princess Leia Organa. Mark Hamill has a cameo appearance as Luke Skywalker."
1248,9,The $2 Billion Reboot,"The opening of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (PG-13, 2:15) was a big deal. That's right. I just won the Captain Obvious Award AND the Understatement of the Year Award – at the same time! (Yay, me!) But seriously, allow me to elaborate. How many movie openings see a significant percentage of Movie Fans show up to the theater in costume? How many films make people feel that they need to buy their tickets online as much as eight weeks in advance (as the Movie Fan Facebook Page staff did)? How many cinematic experiences generate a level of anticipation bordering on a heart palpitation? A movie that does things like this is called an ""event movie"", but ""Episode VII"" is the event movie to beat all event movies. The desire to see the film's latest trailers (which started coming out over a year before its release) could've broken the internet. Advanced ticket sales reached a record-shattering $100 million dollars in the U.S. and also set new records in Canada, the U.K. and Germany. And that's just the tip of the Millennium Falcon. All that pre-release hype is a lot to live up to! Did the movie do it? Read on I'll get to my summary and evaluation of the movie soon, but first, here are a couple things that I will NOT do. With apologies to all who have lived in caves for the previous 40 years or so, and anyone literally born yesterday, I'm not going to spend precious time and space recounting the ""Star Wars"" phenomenon or the major plot points of the previous six films. (That's what Wikipedia is for.) I also won't give as many details of the film's plot as I usually do. Since so many fans have so many questions and there's so much speculation about what (and who) is in this movie, even a moderate amount of detail would cross over into Spoiler Land, a country that I'm loathe to visit. Here's what I CAN tell you The story of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" begins about 30 years after the events of 1983's ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"". Luke Skywalker is the last remaining Jedi – and he's gone missing. The Galactic Empire that was destroyed at the end of the previous film in the franchise's chronology has been replaced by ""The First Order"" and the erstwhile Rebel Alliance by ""The Resistance"". Both groups are desperate to find Luke. The Resistance wants him to train more Jedi in order to check the rise of The First Order. The First Order believes that the killing of the last living Jedi is essential to their goal of galactic domination. Now, before this starts sounding completely like a two and a quarter hour outer-space version of ""Where's Waldo?"", here are a few other things you'll see in this movie This film brings back most of the main characters who were alive and still breathing (or, functioning – in the case of the droids) – mostly played by the original actors, while introducing a new generation of rivals, both good and evil. Daisy Ridley plays Rey, a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku. She spends her time in what looks like a junkyard filled with crashed and discarded vehicles from Episodes 4-6 and she harvests what parts she can to sell to a junk dealer to get enough food to survive. John Boyega plays a character who comes to be called Finn, a young man who's conflicted about where his loyalties lie, but who ends up joining forces with Rey on a mission – slash – adventure more dangerous and important than either of them ever imagined or even desired. Both characters also find themselves in league with Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), known as the best pilot in the galaxy. Following the template that George Lucas laid down in those original three films, J.J. Abrams, the new franchise co-writer (along with series veteran Lawrence Kasdan) and director, seems to have established these three characters roughly in the mold of strong woman Leia Organa (Rey), reluctant warrior Luke Skywalker (Finn) and cocky rogue Han Solo (Poe). At the same time, the characters on the Dark Side of the Force have their successors too."
1249,8,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a skillful blend of the old and the new which should more than satisfy most fans of the franchise.","Thank you Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kazdan, cast and crew for taking me back to the joy and wonder of the first Star Wars film. My wife and I were giddy with happiness and emotions bringing us to tears several times. We forgot how a popcorn movie can entertain and still touch you inside. It was a genuine roller coaster tribute to sci-fi, fantasy, romance, action, adventure, drama, thriller movies of many decades past. And I loved all the references to scenes, characters, one-liners and situation of the original paired with special effects in service of the story. The new young actors are real discoveries and the polished pros also turn in those subtle human performances that make us care. It reminds me of the magic that movies can have, universal and intimately personal -- all in the dark in a room filled with strangers for two hours we share a common experience... which only adds to the humanity in us all. Finally, it fills us with hope that good will defeat evil and what's wrong with that?"
1250,10,WOW! It's like finding your lost best friend from 38 years ago and it's better!,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is easily the fourth best movie of the franchise. It fits in just below the original series, but it is definitely better than any of the prequels. The acting is well done (unlike the prequels), and it offers a good mix of practical effects and CGI. This film isn't without its faults, but it continues the story in a compelling way that feels like a natural continuation of the saga. I would happily watch this movie again and I would gladly add it to my movie collection."
1251,7,Easily the fourth best movie of the franchise,"I'll share this review, Tirso Borja Medina is the real author. But I sharing his review, because I am 100% in agree with it."
1252,10,A wonderful movie... An absolute epic film... STAR WARS IS BACK BABY!,"The smartest restart or sequel, from plot to character to various prop details, full tribute. Let the film not only be a science fiction film, but a focus on time and memories."
1253,7,good,"Thirty years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his young allies face a new threat from the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order."
1254,8,Not a bad sequel.,"Like I said in the summary, ""The Force Awakens"" was a good attempt to balance the new and the old, or to create a bridge from the ""Original Trilogy"" to the new ""Disney"" Star Wars. I hoped that the best ""Star Wars"" movie was yet to come (which didn't happen). My initial enthusiasm compelled me to see it twice at that time. J.J. Abrams did an above average job in reestablishing the tone and feel of a real ""Star Wars"" movie. And also, it reached out successfully to both the older and newer fans. The critical acclaim and box office receipts showed that the TFA was a success. Of course, now, we have to take into account the opinions of the ""haters"" and/or ""trolls"" who have trashed TFA. I would only have to say that ""if"" the ""Star Wars"" they want was realized (as I understand what they were saying), it would no longer be ""Star Wars"" but it would be something like ""Battlestar Galactica""the 2004-2009 TV series, which would be totally different and not ""Star Wars."" I would say the negative opinions of these ""Haters"" and/or ""Trolls"" would be better served by petitioning Disney for a possible ""better"" director that they want for the ""Star Wars"" genre like for example like Francis Ford Coppola or Kenneth Branagh. In addition, they could also ask for a screenwriter they could see as acceptable like David Mamet or Paul Schrader, or somebody like that. But as it is, J.J. Abrams did an O.K. job with ""The Force Awakens."" It could have been a lot better, though. May be the force be with you."
1255,6,A good half and half attempt to balance the old and new Star Wars.,"Although i'm a fan of the first six movies, i waited for The Force Awakens to come out on Blueray before watching it. As so many old classics that get a modern follow up these days, you can but expect two and a half hours of disappointment."
1256,4,"The force awakens, but the creativity certainly did not","As a lifetime fan of Star Wars I've seen a few of the best films in mankind included in this saga and quite another ""meh"" choices. For any Star Wars fan that has seen the six films they can already see that you'll be way happier to only remember the original trilogy (ep. 4, 5 and 6), because the prequel trilogy was a complete mess (maybe except for the ep. 3). One of the main critics for the ep. 1 is the fact that it feels forced, has awfully boring characters, dialog and is the same story from the ep. 4 (which is already based in the stories of ""Dune"" and Kurosawa's films). The same can be applied to ep. 7. First question: should you watch it? If you have the chance, you could. Should you pay for it? Absolutely not. The film is, once again, a recreation of the ep. 4, Ray is the most inbelieveble character in the whole saga, she has more control over the force than Luke, came literally from nowhere and beats Kylo Ren in her first use of the lightsaber. The story is extremely cliché, the only difference between the revels blowing the death star is that this one is bigger (kind of like an advertisment: this film's death star is bigger and deathly-er!). Luke just dissapeared because, reasons? And while the idea of having two protaginists (Finn and Ray) was good it just didn't work, oh! And everything just doesn't make sense. Did I mention that Ray has no experience or training with mastering the force and suddenly seems to be more skilfull than any other character? Yeah, that happens too. Ray is a complete Mary Sue and this film is both mediocre and disrespectfull to the original trilogy (well, almoust everything after these were mediocre and disrespectfull). Don't spend money on it"
1257,,"Mediocre at best, not recommended",I wasn't around yet when the Original Trilogy was in the cinema's. I discovered the stories on my on the television in the living room of my parental house. I remember them on the small screen we had back then. I remember how big the story looked. It was magical. I remember every detail of the feelings I got from discovering Darth Vader was Luke's Father. I remember the death of old Ben and Anakin more than all the fighting scenes. 
1258,10,"Thrill, Excitement and Magic","For this movie, lets start by addressing the elephant in the room right away, the fact that this is almost a clone of A New Hope. Yes, I noticed this watching it the first time around, as I'm sure most people did. But you know what, it kept things interesting enough that I was able to overlook that. I loved Poe's character as the snarky but lovable badass rebel. I was really intrigued by Finn being a defective stormtrooper. And Kylo Ren made an awesome introduction as the villain, who was the angry, emotional beast compared to Vader being a cool, unfeeling monster. Of course, Vader will always be number one, but Kylo was really cool. I mean, the way he stopped that laser blast, come on. It doesn't get much more badass than that. BB-8 was a nice new droid addition too, even if he was essentially R2's replacement."
1259,8,The force repeats,"This was a very good movie and lots of fun. It's kind of funny listening to people say that this movie did not have the feel of Star Wars. As if they know what it felt like sitting in the audience in 1977 watching Star Wars. I was there at the University of Illinois at Champaign. It was great fun; the audience would sneer and hiss every time Darth Vader came on camera. Sheer entertainment. So if you think that this is some kind of remake or that it did not live up to your expectations of what Star Wars is all about. That's fine, but I can tell you this, for me The Force Awakens does feel and play like a Star Wars movie and it is the first one to do so in over thirty years."
1260,9,Much better than anything after Episode VI,"Well Mr Abrams sure succeeded on this one, walked in slightly skeptical cause of how disappointing the first two prequels in particular were. But man did I get blown away! It felt like Star Wars, you could see the attention to detail and the lack of CGI for the sake of CGI, the old cast were stellar and the new cast were really really good too as the new main characters. Never looked at the time once and never took my eyes of the beautiful worlds we were shown. Really gave me that feeling of exploring that galaxy far away again that I got back when I were a kid."
1261,10,"Walked in hoping it would be decent, walked out smiling","It is Star Wars - what did you expect? A lot of folks are bashing this film, but it is a pretty good movie. Again, it is Star Wars: it is the bad, almost non-existent plot; the horrible acting that feels wooden; the ridiculous dialog; and the over-the-top special effects. Star Wars was always a mindless, action adventure with a ridiculous storyline and terrible actors (except for Harrison Ford)."
1262,6,It's Star Wars,"I purposely waited 24 hours before writing my review because I wanted to digest the film that long to truly take it in and reflect before I actually reviewed it. I wanted the euphoria of seeing the next chapter of the saga on the big screen to subside some so that I can make an objective review, but alas the euphoria has not subsided and the childlike excitement is still at an 11! This is plain and simply a great Star Wars film! In fact, I feel it is the second best offering of the franchise (behind 'The Empire Strikes Back'). From the opening crawl to the epic and somewhat moving final scene the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. "
1263,10,J.J. Abrams Has Restored Hope to the Star Wars Universe (no spoilers),I was very skeptical about this movie considering the prequel trilogy was terrible. The little kid was annoying and they had annoying characters and the story line just bad.
1264,7,surprisingly good,"One thing is for sure, Star Wars is back and J.J. Abrams shows he can direct a film with so much hype and expectations. Seriously, I have never seen a film in all the years I've been around them that had this much hype. The pressure must have been immense for Abrams to deliver a Star Wars film that shows us why we love it in the place. It was also no surprise that this film made so much money. One thing was for certain that everyone who worked on this film whether it was Abrams or the clean-up crew, they knew they were going to get a good paycheck. I won't say how much it made, but trust me it made a lot. Now the real question is: Does this film live up to the expectation? Well, let me say this, that people are going to grip and complain and nit-pick at something to make it seem like a bad film. However, realistically this film is what I'd expect from a film titled Star Wars. I admit the pacing in the first half is a little slow with not much going on, but that's generally where you have character development. Since, a bunch of new characters are being introduced and old ones are being reintroduced, its all the more necessary. But this film wasn't afraid of getting down to business. When the last half kicked in, I was emotionally drawn in more ways then one. I must say as a huge positive is Daisy Ridley is amazing and so is John Boyega, they are for sure the next great characters to come about from this franchise. This film had some clichés but not a clichéd romance which I was glad for. No sappiness like in Attack of the Clones. This film will fit nicely with my Star Wars collection amongst the originals and Revenge of the Sith. This isn't the best Star Wars film, but it certainly runs all over the prequels especially Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones. Lets hope the next films deliver more of the same. Now to grade this film. Directing: A (Considering all the pressure for Abrams, he did a marvelous job.) Acting: A- (Ridley and Boyega, along with the majority of the cast did a good job.) Characters: B (Some were underdeveloped like Luke, but I'm sure the next film will bring more of that.) Music: B- (Not the awesome score I was hoping for from John Williams, but nice to hear the old scores again.) Special Effects: B+ (Not Avatar material, but good.) 3-D: C+ (I saw it in 3-D and honestly I would have had the same affect in 2-D, How to Train Your Dragon was more impressive in 3-D.) Sound Effects: A+ (Always nice to hear the nostalgic sounds again like the light sabers and gunshots.) Overall: A-"
1265,8,Better then the Prequels,"Directed by J. J. Abrams. Starring Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Harrison Ford, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher, Domhnall Gleeson, Peter Mayhew, Lupita Nyong'o, Anthony Daniels, Andy Serkis, Max von Sydow, Gwendolyn Christie, Mark Hamill. (PG-13)"
1266,7,Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015),"Let's put what's good out : the rendering is pretty. There are a few scenes that really feels like Star Wars. Usually involving exclusively the original cast. This is less bad than the previous 3 abominations, but that's not saying much. That's about it."
1267,5,"Shallow, lazy and weak nonsense for cliché teenagers","STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS goes back to basics, feeling like a lost film from the 1980's. As was the case with George Lucas' Episode IV, this movie never pretends to be anything more than an exciting, sometimes exhilarating, space opera."
1268,,A Long Time Ago... Again...,"This movie is amazing. There, I said it, I never thought I would say it, but I did. This movie does not have any glaring problems, it's well paced, well-written, well-acted, well-shot, well-directed, well-scored, interesting characters, old characters who have groan and changed in the 30 years since we've seen them and weren't shoe-horned in for nostalgia, a bad guy who is menacing, who you hate and who sympathize with all at the same time. Oh, yeah and it's pretty funny! And BB-8 is Jar Jar done right. Nothing jumps out to me. The things that people are saying such as Rey being able to pick up on the Force quickly is something I am 100% sure will be explained in the next film. At the end of the day this is an amazing movie that is at the same quality as the original trilogy."
1269,10,I don't use the word Amazing lightly,"STAR WARS : THE FORCE AWAKENS - In IMAX 3D. I said it before and I'll say it again. J.J. Abrams is really good at taking other people's ideas and making them work. Or reworking them. Or at least getting the right people involved to help him. But has never hit it out of the ball park for me. He has come close. But never Bang On. It's nice to see a Star Wars film with the techniques and feeling of the originals. Before Lucas went all nuts with power and digital ""WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE SETS"" ""WE DON'T NEED TO USE PEOPLE"" special effects. Nothing will ever compare to the original Star Wars. Nothing. This film was well made, directed, and acted. Fun. But these were not the droids I was looking for. smile emoticon I hope the next generation likes it more than me. I give it an 8.5 out of 10."
1270,8,These were not the droids I was looking for. Fun. But not perfect.,Wow great way to start the newest trilogy of Star Wars films it's fresh yet familiar full of fun little Easter eggs from the other films with both familiar faces and new ones.
1271,10,What a fresh look on Star Wars,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a big movie. It spans galaxies and multiple planets, pulls all of the right fanboy levers, and envelops you in a familiarity and comfort like diving head-first into a vat of mashed potatoes. The only piece lacking is an original plot, because nearly every major plot point is shamelessly taken from other Star Wars movies, if only to make sure no one will hate the new J.J. Abrams attempt."
1272,8,What it needed to be,I find the Movie not above average.
1273,6,Average,"Believe it or not, i love this movie. Its a great return to star wars for me personally, I understand not a lot of people will agree with me, but its what made me love the new characters, and was a great start to a new trilogy, Solid film. Overall, 9/10. Unfortunately, this was the 1 of the 3 sequel trilogy films that i actually liked. Episode 8 and Episode 9 were not my favourites that is for sure."
1274,8,This was the start of something great!,Well i think this is gonna be kind a weird that i gave The Force Awakens only 7 out of 10 but please hear my perspective.
1275,7,Return of The King ?,"This was the film that every Star Wars fan was wishing for!!! I know that some are criticizing this film for being nothing more than a remake of Episode 4. Though I can agree that there are similarities, it isn't a remake! It us part of a story arc, takes place 30 years after episode 6. So what if it hearkens back to episode 4? Weren't the prequels vastly criticized for NOT being like the original trilogy. What makes Star Wars so great is that it makes you feel a certain way, the prequels spent too much time with dialogue and plot that they became tedious. JJ Abrams is obviously a fan of the original trilogy. He takes what I loved about Star Wars and brings that feeling of adventure back. I couldn't stop smiling throughout. I love this film. Are there some things that missed? Yes, but mostly this is a Star Wars movie through and through. Is it pure nostalgia, absolutely. "
1276,9,Gets better with every viewing!!!!,"A droid containing vital information is being pursued by the bad guys on a desert planet. The droid's orphan companion meets up with a new friend, a smuggler and a wookie. Meanwhile, the bad guys have built a massive weapon capable of destroying planets. Luckily the good guys figure out they need to take out the shield then fly fighters at its core to blow it up. Also, there is an old Jedi who has exiled himself to a remote location and the main bad guy wears all black and a mask which makes his voice sound scary. There is the surprise death of a main character and ""surprise"" revelation about family members."
1277,7,Star Wars - Recycled Plot Awakens,"They had years, tens of years to think about a sequel and yet come up with this parody of SW. No greatness no wow moments no nothing. It's like even Mr. Harrison Ford preferred to quit this show seeing what it become. A genetic soldier designed to obey and follow has a sudden strike of conscience, A sith apprentice kicked in the nuts by a totally new in the jedi arts girl, a sith apprentice that once was Luke's apprentice, the best jedi in the galaxy... I guess the writers didn't see how powerful a sith apprentice is, in the previous episodes. Stale would be the word to describe this episode. Some remains of some years old good soup mixed with plenty of water, served to a hungry crowd. Poor choice of picking the actor for Kylo Ren. Very, very, very bad decision to pull off his mask. While the acting and cast was impressive, the script ruined all that. 8/10 for an action movie 2/10 for an SW movie"
1278,2,A slap on the face of SW fans,"Wee quick note... This contains a mega spoiler, if you ain't seen it yet look away."
1279,8,Let the Hate Flow through this review section.,"Watched my favorite Movie of All time Movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens which in The Greatest Movie of All time. The Cast Was Stellar With Newcomers John Boyega(AttackThe Block) as Finn ,Daisy Ridley(Blue Season) as Rey ,Oscar Issac(Robin Hood,Sucker Punch) as Poe Dameron , Domhnall Glesson(Ex Machina,Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows) as General Hux , Gwendeline Christie(Game Of Thrones) as Captain Phasma, Lupita Nyung'o(12 Years A Slave) as Maz Kanata, Warwick Davis(The Chronicles Of Narnia:Prince Caspian ) as Wolivan,Greg Grunberg(Heroes) as Temmin""Snap"" Wexley , Anthony Daniels (Bashki's Lord Of The Rings) as C-3PO, Kenny Baker(Flash Gordon) as R2-D2, Tim Rose(Just William) as Ackbar, Adam Driver(Inside Llewyn Davis ) as Kylo Ren ,Andy Serkis(Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes ) as Supreme Leader Snoke, Max Von Sydow(Minority Report) as Lor San Tekka, Simon Pegg(Hot Fuzz,Mission:Impossible III) as Unkar Plutt also Featuring Harrison Ford(Blade Runner) as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher(The Blues Brothers) as Leia Organa and Mark Hamill(The Flash) as.Luke Skywalker."
1280,10,All Time Favorite Movie Best of 2015,"I read a review on IMDb that said this film was over hyped, how could someone say that?! JJ Abrams did a magnificent job with this film by sticking to everything that's true about the spirit of ""Star Wars"" and the force. This film was great, not as good as ""Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith"", but it was good, nonetheless. And I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge ""Star Wars"" fan. It was great to see some of the original cast in this film. That made this film so much more believable and tangible and it also gave this film more of that true spirit of the original ""Star Wars"" films. The situation that was unfolding between Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and their son, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), added a dysfunctional family piece to the drama that was already surrounding the story of this film. To me this made the film even more tangible and made these characters even more believable. The characters of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) were a good addition to the series. Finn's personality in this film fits him perfectly because his actions proves he doesn't have what it takes to a stormtrooper and Rey's rugged personality fits her as well, being that she was left on Jakku to fend for herself. Over all, this is a great story and a great film. If you are a true fan of the force you will enjoy this film. I recommend it."
1281,8,Not As Good As Episode III But It Was Good!,"Are there really this many people that thought that Force Awakens was a 1/10? How is that a thing? That's like Gerard Butler levels of bad. Have you seen Olympus Has Fallen, now there's a 1/10 for you."
1282,10,"Near perfect, superb","This is my first ever review on IMDb, there are already many hundreds for this movie so I doubt it'll ever be read but anyway, I shall proceed ..."
1283,6,"There's mob hysteria, then there's reality ...","It's not a bad film despite the incredible similarity to A New Hope. That ws annoying because they rehashed the whole Death Star plot with Starkiller base. I was waiting for the villain to be some hot guy like Hayden Christiansen, then I saw Adam Driver. Disappointed! Daisy Ridley did a excellent job and of course Harrison Ford did too. That's one of the reasons why this is rated so highly. Another desert planet just like Tatooine, with a main character who doesn't know her parents, she meets a droid and the whole plot is repeated. That being said I do not think it was a bad movie but it could've been different."
1284,8,It's cool!,"30 years after the Empire was destroyed, an equally-malevolent empire, The First Order, has taken its place. The Resistance, lead by Princess/General Leia, is harrying The First Order as best it can. The First Order decides to hunt down the last Jedi knight, Luke Skywalker, who is in secluded retirement in a secret place. A map exists of his whereabouts and this is in the possession of a droid, BB-8, accompanied by a renegade stormtrooper, Finn, and an unassuming scavenger girl, Rey."
1285,7,Entertaining,"Ask a friend whose first Star Wars movie was The Force Awakens if they liked it. For them many details will go unnoticed and they will be left with lots of questions, but it will still be a great movie. It is packed with adventure, action scenes, emotion, character development, amazing visuals, sound and cinematography. The effects, scenes and actors were very convincing and we are introduced to interesting new characters, plots and mysteries. "
1286,10,I think fans need to understand movies are not entirely dedicated to them,"If you are a Star Wars fan, give this movie a second viewing before you make a decision on it. Judge it like you would if 'Star Wars' wasn't in the title."
1287,6,"The Star Wars movie we deserved, but not the one we needed!",This movie has absolutely no story. I nearly slept twice during this movie it's so bad. The movie is utterly predictable and boring.
1288,2,good graphics but that's all there is to it,"This movie had a lot of pressure on its back and rightfully so. It's star wars! But this movie had everything it had great nostalgia at the right times, it had comedy at the right times, and it also had drama and action at the right times. You could definitely see a big difference between this movie compared to the prequels. The shots were just so beautiful compared to the way the prequels looked. You could see the love behind the movie and all of the thought and care behind the movie. And for once in my lifetime I came out of a star wars movie telling myself That that was great. I'm not sure that it is the best, I need to see it more but I can't tell you for sure that it is certainly the second best and maybe, just maybe it is better than the wonderful empire strikes back."
1289,9,Star wars the Force awakens almost as good as The empire strikes back?,"I have read so many reviews comparing The Force Awakens to A New Hope I'm truly tired of it. First of all, it isn't the same story it just draws on many of the same qualities, something I would think long time fans would be thankful to see. I was 14 when A New Hope came out and like many of that era I saw all three of the first 3 movies multiple times and they set a standard that has never been surpassed. But for all the negative reviews based on similarities to A New Hope remember that when that movie ended we knew little of a) the force b) who the heck Luke Leia where and were left with more questions than answers. Such is how episode VII left us. We now know a lot of the stories back drop, but then we knew none and I guess ignorance was bliss. All this negativity about another death star, well the dark side powers rule with fear so why wouldn't they build another bigger, badder death star like weapon? One that could wipe out it's enemy forces in a few attacks? They did it 3 times in a row in episodes 4, 5, and 6 and I don't remember ANYONE complaining about that. There is a lot of story to still be told after episode 7, shouldn't that be the way it is with 2 more movies coming? Yes Episode 7 reminded me of A Hew Hope, but in a positive way. There was a lot of mystery as to the importance of Luke and Leia and no clues as to their relationship after episode 4, so why do people want to know everything after episode 7? Many similarities, shouldn't there be? This is a sequel so I would hope there would be a lot of similarities and gaps to be filled in for the next two movies. I will never enjoy a series like the original 3 Star Wars, but I'll never do a lot of things I did when I was 14 - 19 also. It was a huge task to get the series to a reset point where it picked up where the old left off but with many questions. The Force Awakens did it successfully and now we are all waiting to find out what the Heck Luke is doing sitting on a mountain when the galaxy is going to hell. If the story had just taken off in a new direction everyone would be complaining about that. I thought given the task at hand the movie was very good and very similar to A New Hope but with a completely different set of questions to be answered and adventure ahead. Remember, this is the start of a new trilogy about a new generation."
1290,8,Stop all the complaining and appreciate what has been created,"Not sure if I watched the same movie as MANY of these reviewers did. Could be possible that they did not grow up with the Star Wars films as I did - and do not have the same admiration and appreciation for the film as a series or group. Just wondering what exactly do some of these people want? Do those who give this such bad reviews want this to be identical to ""Mr. Holmes"" or ""The Theory of Everything"" - which are good films - but they are not in the Star Wars genre. Maybe they've seen too many X-Men movies? It's possible that these same people prefer to watch ""Hunger Games"" or the ""Twilight"" movies - and frankly they can have the cinema all to themselves for those series. Sort of surprised that Lucas did not direct the film - but I understand he has become older and is maybe not up to the task. Did enjoy the role Daisy Ridley played. John Boyega I could leave or take - he was only acceptable in his level of acting ability when compared to past actors in this group. There were some glitches in the film - but overall I was extremely pleased by this film. My only semi complaint was the lack of Yoda - which I am sure will be changed in the upcoming films..."
1291,10,I Enjoyed this film thoroughly (might be a spoiler or 2),Fantastic reboot of Star Wars. Blindingly better than the other new ones. JJ blew this out the water. Fantastic job. From the beginning I was almost jumping out of my seat in excitement. They've rebooted with a feel for the nostalgia and a feel for the new and exciting. All the negative reviews about it basically being Episode IV. It's a reboot guys. It wasn't THAT much like it. Yeah there were similarities. But it's got to have some throwback to the originals. It's this epic film series that people have trying to reboot for years. Finally it's been done right. The new characters were fantastic. The pilot was an unexpected character. Hadn't heard anything about him but he was cool. Just go watch it and don't think too much about the logistics of it. Enjoy the film
1292,9,Super super good,"Why i disliked it: 1)Lucas,in an attempt to create a modern,non prejudiced film,selects the two main characters to be a black man and a woman.I totally loved the character of Fin and was looking forward to see him develop as a jedi knight,maybe being tutored by Luke,but instead Rey ends up being the upcoming jedi knight which is,in one word,LAME!I just couldn't fit myself in the shoes of your main character Lucas,we want a MALE protagonist!no girls will watch your film,you have a majorly MALE fanbase,make a MALE protagonist! 2)Ultra disappointing final fight.Although they moved away from the fancy choreographies and made a more realistic fight,but i just don't buy that Rey,which AS STATED IN THE MOVIE has no training,ends up beating the most BADASS villain,who in previous scenes was shown that could block bullets and freeze people! 3)Plot resembled too blatantly obviously to episode IV 4)The ending scene i feel like was there JUST to show Luke,it served absolutely no purpose."
1293,7,Disappointing!,"Enjoyed it thoroughly, had all the elements the first trilogy pulled off so well. A fitting sequel to the original series! So glad no spoilers made it out, there were some excellent surprises lined up. Can't wait for the next installment! Well done JJ Abrams, pulled off George Lucas better than George Lucas. Enjoyed the performances of the old Star Wars stalwarts. An action packed thriller for fans and new fans alike! Less of a slick remake of the original theme like Star Trek but more a respectful updating and expansion of the Star Wars universe. It feels like an awful lot of the movie was put together by fans of the originals."
1294,10,Absolutely awesome!,"A very familiar, but solid film, and a solid return for Star Wars."
1295,7,A return to form.,"For those who think they know about Star Wars and deem this a reboot due to its similarities with A New Hope. They obviously have done no research into what they claim to be a fan of at all. The movie, just Episode 1 and Episode 4 are always meant to follow the classic template of the hero's journey as stipulated in Joseph Campbell's ""Hero With a Thousand Faces"". Lucas has talked about this time and time again and JJ Abrams clearly is fan enough to stick to that. "
1296,8,This is not a remake of Episode 4!! It is however the perfect start to a trilogy!,"The movie is not the best star wars movie ever ,, so people should just chill out a little .. to me it is the 3rd best star war movie so far after ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""A New Hope"", "
1297,7,Well it was good. Ranked 3rd on the Star wars movies. and one of the best action/Sci-Fi movies in the last 5 or so years ;) crushing records from the first day .,I have just watched the film after weeks or being too nervous . 
1298,2,Star Wars The Force Awoken Review,"I am a big Star Wars fan and I like almost everything about it, from the movies to the toys. Most people disliked the prequels from last decade feeling that Lucas was losing his touch. I liked Episode I just fine. Now Episode VII is a different story. Lucas made a mistake in selling his franchise to Disney. This story was OK but not great. The villain most of all feels weak and I cannot understand his intentions for turning to the Dark Side. It seems to me that Lucas and Disney have turned to the Dark Side. This Star Wars is for a different generation than my own but why did they forget about mine? We are the loyal fans from the good old days when things were done right. Now our favorite characters are forced to take a back seat while younger nobodies take the helm. Perhaps Abrams is the wrong choice for this type of production. I hope Disney changes writing and directing staff in a more correct direction for the remaining two sequels."
1299,8,Star Wars for A New Generation,(MAJOR SPOILERS)
1300,10,The third best film in the saga after Episodes IV and V.......................,"I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I clapped at the end. It blew me away !"
1301,9,I left the cinema speechless....,This is best movie of all time. It is now my number one favorite movie of all time too. I will always be a huge Star Wars fan. One of my favorite new characters in this movie is Rey. She is awesome and I can't wait till she becomes a fully trained Jedi Knight after she's done training with Luke. I also really like BB-8. He's definitely part of the protocol droid trio now. Also rest in peace Han Solo. You were a truly great character. Sure is a good thing Rey kicked Kylo Ren's butt after that happened. Also Starkiller Base is bigger then the first and second Death Stars. I still wonder how Maz Kanata got a hold of Anakin's and Luke's lightsaber which was lost on Bespin after Vader cut off Luke's hand. Best movie ever. Enough said.
1302,10,Best Movie of All Time,"""Nooooo!!"" was my reaction (aloud in the theater) when the film ended... I spent all the film waiting for Luke to be found only for him to not even utter a single word...!! Arg!!! Where was the ""The force is strong in my family, etc"" from the trailers....? "
1303,7,Nooooooo!,Waited 5 weeks to finally see this (the Christmas rush over) TODAY was the day.
1304,8,Bringing BACK the STAR WARS feel,Spend a billion on the CGI... And hire entirely the wrong people to handle the trilogy.
1305,7,They have no idea what they're doing,"I can only guess that these are wannabe movie critics who want to feel superior by trashing a movie that everyone likes. I suppose even Citizen Kane has its detractors. BUT the review of this movie is pretty straight forward...its a good Star Wars film, probably the best since the first 2. If you hated the prequels don't worry about this one, but then again you've probably already seen this one. And for those who say it uses to many plots points from the original...I'll just say ROTJ had another death star...how about that for a plot point... Last, as some one who saw the originals in the theater, I can say at that time there was nothing, and I mean nothing that compared to Star Wars. It redefined the terms action, scifi, and blockbuster all at once. When Empire came out, there was still nothing to compare, and propelled the Star Wars universe forward. This new film is a nice callback to those days, and yet is good enough to stand on its own. Again, cynicism is in these days...so I guess that's the reason for the negative reviews"
1306,9,I don't get the negative reviews from users on here...,"This movie is truly magnificent, returning the nostalgic feelings of the original trilogy and providing new and incredibly stunning visual power to a series that had all but declined since the release of the prequels."
1307,7,A Pure Star Wars Film,"Unoriginal, badly made and acting performances were subpar!! This movie just lacks the Star Wars factor. In every Stars Wars movie, the Star wars movie right up to the Phantom Menance in 1999, the feel factor was there. Somehow the pre-sequels following the that took on a dark feel and went off track . Sadly The Phantom Menace is way miles better than this crap. "
1308,3,This movie shouldn't have been made!,"I know I'm late to the Star Wars party, but there's an old say; better late than never. By now, many of us had seen what Abrams and Disney brought to us to the big screen, as it's currently breaking box office records left and right, and could possibly Avatar for highest grossing domestic film of all time in a matter of days now. It's been 10 years since the last Star Wars film, and boy, it couldn't had come out in a better time. Abrams and Disney bring us Episode 7: The Force Awakens. How good is it?"
1309,10,Disney and Abrams bring Star Wars back to full glory.,And...A new film rises. More fight scenes and great places. I think this is my favorite Star Wars film
1310,9,A New Return Of The Jedi,"I am not a Star Wars fanatic but I was excited to see this with my kids. I always worry that when a movie has this much hype that it will fail miserably. I couldn't help it... the more people built it up the more I looked forward to seeing it. Could it possibly be that great? Yes. I loved it, my kids loved it. This movie is above any beyond everything I had been hoping for. As a person old enough to have seen the original Star Wars in the theater, I cannot say enough about this film. Star Wars has gone back to it's roots. I don't want to have any spoilers in my review so I won't list any details. It goes without saying that the cinematography, special effects,etc are phenomenal. The cast is excellent, the plot is gripping, the plot twists are awesome, the use of humor is perfect. Seeing this was like coming home. I realize it sounds like I am a much bigger Star Wars fan than I knew. But the truth is I am a big fan of well done movies. I love all the little things they put in the script. I would like to go back and see this again just to pick up on all of the little things you miss the first time around. I just have to say, this movie is SO well done!"
1311,10,I literally loved everything about this movie,"The scariest movie of 2015 had nothing to do with the horror genre. No - for fans worldwide of the most beloved film franchise of all time, it lay in the mouth-watering yet trepidatious pending release of its newest instalment. These fans had already been burned once, the scars of a disappointment a decade old still glimmering. Dare they risk investing once again, for fear of agonizing disappointment (you know what they say about fear, anger, hate, and suffering)? To this cherished community: fear not. Star Wars is back, and it is worthy of the name. "
1312,8,Fear not: Episode VII does not try - it does.,"When we were introduced to Star wars with ""a new hope"", There was much about the lore we didn't know about. The empire was the enemy, The evil Emperor ruled the galaxy and Darth Vader was his head honcho. We only learned anything by mention from Ben Kenobi and a mention of the clone wars. But we accepted that in this universe that was the way things were and it worked."
1313,6,"Missing episodes 6a, 6b and 6c.","It's great if you can tell a fresh story every time, but most of the stories that haven't yet been told aren't that great. This film has come under a lot of criticism by people who fundamentally don't understand storytelling. One of the biggest critiques is that it's just a rehash of A New Hope. And that's true. It's the exact same story. But told better.<br /><br />It's a better introduction to the universe. While the originals all hold a special place in my heart, they aren't friendly to new viewers. You have to be trained to love Star Wars from very young with these older films, because they really don't withstand the test of time. However, this installment does. Because all of the characters are so enjoyable, Han's death is sadder, Rey's victory is sweeter, and Finn's injury is more tense. In New Hope, I didn't find myself caring so much about the characters, and while probably very intense for its time, the dry performances now make it a lot less high stakes. The Force Awakens is the kind of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat; none of the other movies really are.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie is A New Hope, indeed, but on crack. Humor that doesn't fall flat, likable characters, and of course, Daisy Ridley, the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. It reintroduces some of our favorite characters in clever and nostalgic ways, and ultimately, that makes this a nearly perfect introduction to a larger universe. It's not too out there. There isn't anything too new and weird (that comes in the next movie), it's just a good old story that's told better the second time."
1314,9,Storytelling is not about telling a new story...,"JJ Abrams has a talent of making movies look amazing with wonderful effects. This movie has some good action, acting and effects. Other than that I can really see where the heart is in this. Is was made by Disney to sell more toys and merchandise to help expand their (often corrupt) empire."
1315,6,This movie in one word: Abramism,"We want the unrated version of Star Wars Episode VII: The force awakens.All of us are angry, because of J.J. Abrams. George Lucas will be proud."
1316,10,The unrated movie,"There is a significant difference between a film that is made as a film, and that which is made to be the first of a trilogy, and that is the defining difference between George Lucas' A New Hope and the excruciatingly derivative remake - The Force Awakens. While both films have a laundry list of similarities to the characters, concepts and story progression, where one is a fairly complete film, with poor acting and some one-dimensional characters, the other, and more modern rendition, fails on many levels to even find its legs."
1317,6,A beautifully visualized ode that falls short of finding the pieces,We have to give JJ Abrams credit here for he has done something that no Star Wars fan expected... he made the prequels look good.
1318,1,"All is forgiven, George","I watched the movie a few hours ago, I was not expecting so much before I went to cinema, but to my surprise it made me feel like I was watching original star wars trilogy. I mean it took me to my teenage and I enjoyed it so much. "
1319,8,Welcome Again,"Hardly original, but the Star Wars series is pulp trash, not highbrow SciFi... so we can forgive it that. Flashy camerawork, witty self-referential and 4th wall breaking dialogue, shameless fan service? Yes please! I watch Star Wars to be entertained in only the most superficial way... otherwise I wouldn't be able to re-watch the original trilogy. None of this was ever meant to be taken seriously. Watching this movie makes me feel like the 5 year old child I was back in 1977 watching the very first movie. Thank you for that J J!"
1320,10,"Does what's required, and rather well","This film is fantastic, and I cannot wrap my head around all the negativity in these reviews. They stuck with a formula that works, and it paid off way better than the prequels. I notice it's kind of the big Internet fad to bitch about big blockbuster movies, but I saw nothing to complain about with this movie other than a couple storyline events I'd include if only they didn't contain major spoilers. I've heard people say it's a reboot. No it is not. It is a true sequel, and yes, the storyline does progress a lot like Episode IV, but again, going back to a formula that worked and still works. I've heard people complain about plot holes. I'm just gonna assume these people have never watched a Star Wars movie as there's plot holes in all of them. My only beef with the flick is a huge spoilers so I won't list it. Anyway, I don't know what people expect. We are in the Age of Entitlement, and because of that people need to complain and complain and complain until they are 100% satisfied, and if not, then the movie or whatever else they are criticizing must completely suck. So, anyway, Episode VII gets 9/10 from me, and definitely deserves way better credit than what I've read. Sorry the movie is popular: doesn't mean you are required to hate the film."
1321,9,Deserves More Credit,"I try not to leave any spoiler, but you never know what's considered a spoiler:) If you liked the first 3 Star Wars Movies from 1977, 1980 and 1983 and didn't like the 3 that followed, YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT! I am 59 and this brought back a lot of memories, Harrison Ford (who is my personal favorite) was great and I am glad he didn't just make a brief appearance but had a real part in the whole movie. The new girl (Daisy Ridley)was very good as well. But most of all I like to thank Mr.Abrams for his excellent work of not only bringing Star Wars into todays world but Star Trek as well! He is the George Lucas and Steven Spielberg of today. I read a few negative reviews before I went to see it, and now I understand them, these reviews are from a few hard core over thinking fans that pick on ridicules little details that mean nothing to the average viewer like me, don't listen to them or you miss out on a really great, exciting, fun, SIFI, action fantasy! Yes, the story seamed familiar, and I am glad it did, the visual effect are superior, the acting was good, the story was good and continues where the first 3 star wars movies left off 30 years ago. well done, great entertainment with little jokes like we know them from Indiana Jones and similar movies. it's a MUST SEE! More power to the team that gave us this INSTANT CLASSIC, I hope they make the Billion Dollars they're shooting for!:)"
1322,10,Loved It!,"Didnt watch these films for a long time, as the prequel trilogy was a bust...how could these be any good, and boy was I right."
1323,6,The stupidity awakens,The first movie of the 3rd and final trilogy includes Han Solo getting killed by his son Kylo Ren!!!!!!!!!
1324,10,The beginning of a new trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"31 December 2015. In this reawakening of an old classic sci fi trilogy, a new generation is introduced to the original Star Wars (1977) phenomena and its moving onwards decades later. The audience is introduced to a new crop of rebels to a new younger generation of the Dark Force as well as the reemergence of original but older, aging Star War characters. The characters play out somewhat differently than the original with the charm of original Star War character interactions somewhat diminished in the newer plot outline. Harrison Ford continues with his charming humor, yet eventually its charm seems forced and a bit stereotypical, but even so his performance is charged with entertainment and delight. Carrie Fisher, now the reigning rebel monarch, presents a more mature yet captivating character whose presence continues to be welcome. The rest of the cast is mostly a rehash of the original Star Wars in similar guises but with a nice veneer of increasingly tantalizing special effects and 3-D imagery which however still has a ways to go to really push the potential of the visual envelope."
1325,7,An Updated Sci Fi Spectacle that Doesn't Quite Reach the Original,"Didnt realise the ratings were high even there are a lot of 0s but i thought great movie , hard to enjoy then cause there Disney , trilogy still lives"
1326,,8/10,"Well i waited to see it again before posting a review, and i am glad i did, after the initial concern that the plot was too close to episode 4 , on the second viewing it worked a lot better. i can see what they are trying to do, which is blending the folk lore from the original trilogy and then adding to it. i liked the fact that in the look and style they went back and gave a very realistic look in the sets and special effects, gone were the sterile and cold shinyness of the virtual sets and props from eps 1,2, 3. the humour returned and i think this sets up the next two eps very well. my only real complaint, and this is something i did not expect to want, is that it could have been longer. at both screenings the film just flew by, so its not a bad thing that we call came out wanting more, for all those that have said it is lazy and a repeat, go see it again with less expectations, i think you will get the emotion and fun that was intended"
1327,9,worth seeing at least a second maybe third time,"Let me start by saying I am a huge Starwars fan, I have been since I can remember. I even have Starwars tattoos on my body which I think says a lot to how much of a Starwars fan I am. Right on with the review (With no spoilers) I avoided all the hype and trailers as much as I can in the build up to this films release and watching the film it has good points and bad points."
1328,6,A 41 year old Starwars fans thoughts,"I do not believe that Star Wars is the pinnacle of human achievement, nor do I buy into the notion that the original trilogy contains great spiritual and philosophical depth. What the original trilogy does have is a unique charm, largely thanks to the good vibes between the characters and unabashed enjoyment of the weird and wonderful."
1329,4,Kind of okay isn't good enough,"It was 10 years since Revenge of the Sith, and we got another Star Wars film. No, it's not perfect, and it's not as good as the original trilogy, but it's definitely better than the prequels. New worlds, new characters, and I admit, yes, it does follow A New Hope, but it's still good. If you were disappointed by the prequels, this is the perfect remedy! The parallels between this and A New Hope are not a cop out, and it's not laziness. It's familiar territory, and that's what we fans have come to expect. I remember JJ Abrams as the guy who reinvented Star Trek and made Chris Pine Captain Kirk, and now he's done it again. Not only has Abrams made me a Star Trek fan due to his recent movies, he's made me love Star Wars again. I'm hoping Star Wars: Episode VIII will be good too, as will Episode IX."
1330,9,A welcome return to the galaxy we all know and love!,"Though I cannot say that i haven't enjoyed it, Force Awakens falls short of what could have been, with predictable dialogs, narratives and poor character development."
1331,8,A let down saved by the previous even bigger letdowns,"So, I went to see the new Star Wars with some friends. These were 135 REALLY-REALLY enjoyable moments of my life. It started right from the start with action. The story progresses at an enjoyable pace and it doesn't leave you bored. Whenever you were going to get bored either another action sequence started or a really nice joke came from nowhere. As for the characters? Rey is quite likable and it makes sense that she has both combat and engineering training, since she is a scavenger of robotic/mechanical parts and she lives on a planet with people that could rob her or kill her. Finn is also likable and his part is a plot twist compared to the previous movies. The Starkiller base was TERRIFYING and the movie had the nice addition of the old actors reprising their roles."
1332,8,Why so much hate?,Star Wars Episode VII
1333,9,Star Wars Episode VII,"This film is a good follow-up to the Star Wars series. However, it doesn't quite live up to that level of quality. A lot of it is repetitive and the new elements like the new characters just seem like typical blockbuster material. It feels like a more commercialised version of Star Wars that has taken its surface elements and used it to make a more conventional product. It's not bad. Just not great."
1334,7,A good follow-up but not stunning,"Although this film has a LOT of throwbacks to the original trilogy in its settings, scenes and characters, they all work well together and make a solid story, complimented by the great acting from lesser known stars. Great action scenes and special effects, and the story sets up enough promise to be interesting in the next film."
1335,9,"Like seeing an old friend, Star Wars is back on the big screen where it belongs.","I enjoyed taking my son to see this, as we are both avid Star Wars fans, but it was NOT what I expected, and I am still let down by it."
1336,6,"The Force Goes to Sleep, and makes a Mindless Clone Copy",Pre-Scriptum: always read reviews after watching the movie. Read reviews only if you don't intend to watch the movie)
1337,8,"As Dom DeLuise's said for Melbrooks ""Nice, not thrilling, but nice"". But still, I liked it. A lot!",NO SPOILERS! 
1338,6,"Good for non Star Wars fans, and a treat for Star Wars fans","There are so many negative reviews of this movie here that I doubt I could add anything new to them, so I'll just say that all the criticisms you've heard and read about The Force Awakens are correct. The problems fall into three categories: "
1339,1,Disney makes a Star Wars movie,Star Wars Episode Seven from the Adventures of Luke Skywalker. THE FORCE AWAKENS .
1340,10,Star Wars Episode Seven from the adventures of Luke Skywalker,"Let me say this I have never seen a Star Wars movie, but I saw this and I loved every second of it. JJ Abrams did wonderful of making this movie as good as it is. You won't believe your eyes after seeing this wonderful movie. Harrison Ford was great playing Han Solo. This is one of those movies where after you get out you will just want to go see it again it is that good of a movie. "
1341,10,The Force Awakens,"It was basically all a life long Star Wars fan wanted to see excluding the haters that existed, exist and will continue to exist to the end of time that will say that it completely ruined the franchise and that ""Star Wars is dead"" and will never enjoy a new star wars film no matter what it is as long as it isn't the ORIGINAL EPISODE IV FROM 1977. Despite having a few similarities to episode IV (A New Hope) it does't keep it back from being fresh, with a lot of adventure, a sense of nostalgia and rewarding every fan with what he was hoping to see. Glad they finally released an awesome Star Wars film after the disaster of episodes I-III that do have their good moments too, and we're waiting to see what is to come in the next few years with episodes VIII and IX. 100% recommended and even if you haven't watched a Star Wars film before, start by watching Episodes IV-VI then I-III and finish up with episode VII (The Force Awakens) to continue the story next year. Thank you all, hope you are a true fan and that you will enjoy the movie, may the force be with you (it has truly awakened)."
1342,10,Exactly what a life long fan of Star Wars wanted to see.,"Repeat after me. First of all, what's this spoiled millennial doing giving this movie an 8? The original Lucas trilogy was the best and I can't believe that Abrams had the nerve to try to copy it. This movie is a disgrace, even compared to the prequel trilogy."
1343,8,8 - Great,"From the first scene in Space a fan will notice the cinematography difference...The acting is good, the characters are good, the story flows somewhere, but where? I have been a fan of Star Wars since 5 and I wanted to see what happened next... All the basic blocks of Star Wars are present, but some are missing, which are the details... George Lucas is a genius... Even though people might hate ""Phantom menace"", you couldn't call it unoriginal, there was no fan service either. I will admit, I left the cinema with a lot of exact same questions that I had before the film... What happened to the New Republic? What happened to the Empire? What happened to Luke Skywalker?What happened to Imperial fleet?Who is Snoke? Partially you get the answers to these questions, but those answers are lazy.It also seems like the republic hasn't built a single capital ship in 20 years, nor it bothered to develop the new star fighter types. Don't get me wrong, the film is a hell enjoyable ride for the three quarters of it, but then you just get a rehash of the ""New Hope"", I've seen this in ""Into Darkness"" before. It also seems that JJ does not quite understand the concept of the ""Jedi"" and the ""Force"". It seems like anyone can use a Lightsaber and fight a trained Sith fighter in ""Force Awakens"". They tried to make the new villain as similar to Darth Vader as possible, but failed. Vader wasn't a psycho, he was intimidating. There was supposed to be a Jedi fighting Kylo Ren to protect the new characters, unfortunately they can take care of themselves without one. Who needs the Jedi training when you can kick the ass of the main villain 5 min after you took the Lightsaber? The Death of one of the main characters was as much as unnecessary as the 3d Death Star. Overall I am sure this film will find new fans and probably gather a few billions in ticket sales, but the Universe it portrays is not as detailed as the one George Lucas created..."
1344,6,The Force is Calling to you...,A good start for the sequel trilogy keep up the good work
1345,10,A great movie,"This movie itself was pretty enjoyable. The action, the visuals, the acting, the characters were all fine. Kylo Ren is basically carrying this whole trilogy with his character development, which is way better than what Rey has. Adam Driver embodies that character, in a way nobody could. So, that's a positive. The story seems way too familiar. They basically copied Episode IV, which doesn't mean, that it is bad, but simply that it is not creative. Rey does not have the power and charisma to be a main character. I mean, Finn was off to a great start. A stormtrooper who can't kill anybody, because he doesn't want to stomach it. That would be a great arc, if he wouldn't laugh and cheer after killing a stormtrooper literally 20 minutes later. It seems like this movie and the following ones, were all made for the money. Overall, you will have fun, but don't expect any great story or arcs."
1346,7,The start to one of the worst trilogies of all time,"After three horrendous ""Star Wars"" prequels, it was unclear if J.J. Abrams would be able to deliver a worthy new entry to this cash cow saga. Thankfully the director delivered a well constructed seventh entry into the ""Star Wars"" canon. New characters along with some familiar faces in a brand- new story tying to the franchise's roots, but with twists. "
1347,9,A Return to Form,"Even tho in a completely different style, Episode VII still manages to bring something new to the Star Wars ""table"", even tho many, rightly so, judge the movie for being, simply said, way to millenial. There is again a gender swtich, which goes with the modern flow, but still, it does not ruin the vibe, the only things being wrong are those that do not respect the way the saga evolved. There is blood shown many times, which is totally off, since we did not see any blood even in Episode III, which had the most gore. Also Rey uses mind control without moving her hands at all, which is completely opposite to the Jedi way, we've seen Obi's gestures many times.Then there is the fact that she did not require any training at all to use her powers, while Anakin and Luke worked their socks off to become what they have been. I was also very dissapointed with the fact that Solo died, but it gave weight to the movie, deeper meaning which made it more important for the complete picture in the end. I was so happy to see Luke back again in the last scene and I can't wait to see what comes next!"
1348,7,It kinda blends in after all.,"OK people. You may be young. you may have no idea about decent storytelling. You may think today's ear-garbage which is called pop music is fine. You may connect with everything - everybody with your smart phones anytime. But you CANNOT say this is Star Wars. Far from it. Even if this wasn't an assault to original SW universe, it would still be a very BAD sci-fi movie."
1349,1,So Phantom Menace WAS a good movie anyway!,"In 'Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens', director J.J. Abrams gives us what he's best at - a good but not great sci-fi film that is entertaining and breaks zero new ground."
1350,8,Star Wars Redone,SPOILER-FREE
1351,9,"""We're Home""","Going in,I never had big expectations on this outing as such, since, imo, there was no need for another episode our episodes for this so-called 'epic' saga, that was not intended to be 6 episodes in the first place...and the main twist wad spoilt due to the delayed release of the movie in the local market....just so you know..."
1352,,Cue the drumroll,"Sometimes if you want the most chance to get a decent idea of a movies quality, please just look at the overal score on the movies page. That's where all normal people who seen the movie give it an honest number based on howmuch they liked it."
1353,8,Don't read reviews,"First off, to those people who think that this is just a remake of A New Hope, it most certainly isn't. There are many similar aspects, but in all honesty, isn't that what we all wanted? Everyone loves the Original Trilogy so much, why should we complain if there are some similarities? That doesn't make any sense to me. These people were just expecting too much in my opinion. They cannot be pleased with anything."
1354,10,One of my Favorite Films EVER,"I closed my eyes, ears and waited for the day to come. I was spoiler free and knew nothing about the plot. Yesterday went to see it with my wife and elder sister who are fans too. Excited, waiting to be amazed. Awesome casting I must say. Finn, Rey even Kylo Ren, I loved them and I loved their characters. Also BB-8, a perfect design... It had a cute personality too. Light Saber duels was the most realistic and epic ones ever in all the Star Wars movies. No stupid choreography like Revenge of The Sith or a simple A New Hope thing. Duel with Rey and Ren was the most realistic Light Saber fight ever. Really amazing cinematography. Good job. And so on... Everything seemed perfect and the movie started beautifully. I was watching A New Star Wars movie. And for the first one hour, it was real, new characters, new stories, everything went perfect. The joy, the laughter, seeing the elders, made me cry. After the first half, I turned to my wife and said ""It was amazing""."
1355,6,"First Half Was A Dream, Second Half Was A Nightmare.","Okay, before I start rambling on about how amazing this movie was, I would first like to say a few words to a select personnel. All of you who voted for a one, or anything four or lower, and wrote your review with how much you thought it sucked, you need to back off. I bet all of you would say that this movie was better than the prequel trilogy by far, but you picked out every bad detail in this movie just to ruin it for others, and yourself. You have to realize that yes, the movies aren't going to be as good as the originals. I hate to break it to you, but Hollywood isn't perfect either, so whatever you have to say that isn't good or is the finest grain of unnoticeable detail that you thought sucked, just keep it to yourself."
1356,10,A Great Comeback No Matter what Anyone Else Says,My main problem with the film is that it lacks focus. Finn and Rey's characters are both good but it feels like the writers had trouble deciding which is the protagonist.
1357,7,"The Force is strong, but not a Jedi yet","To be honest I am not the biggest fan of Star Wars films, but with ""The Force Awakens"" J.J. Abrams made one the best movies of the year by building a respectful and entertaining film. Sci-fi adventure at its best, nostalgia, dazzling special effects and lots of good humor. And of course with J.J.Abrams, comes a load of money on the box office, because always his projects are a treat for eyes. This movie is a rebirth in exciting galactic entertainment and the most important, stays true to the original series, for the elders to remember, while updating it for a new generation who is ready to meet Star Wars. Definitely a must see film."
1358,8,A rebirth in galactic entertainment.,"Not flawless, but close enough. Plenty of moments gave me goosebumps. Very true to it's origins, it will boost your experience if you've recently seen the first trilogy (again)."
1359,7,Reawakened my inner fanboy,"I was so looking forward to this. The only word I can use to describe this movie is ""SHIT"". I have been an episode 4,5 & 6 fan all of my life, I will never watch another. I can't take any more disappointment. Nw I have to write 10 lines to submit this, but for the respect of 4,5 & 6. I can't, because only negative thoughts come to me about this movie. Rubbish! Map to LukeSkywalker? What a load of crap. Rubbish! Does JJ accept that this was as bad as it was? Are we going to get our money back? Are we going to get the weeks and weeks of excited anticipation back? Was it written by a child? I could go on with something more intelligent, but this movie only deserves the insults that it gets, because that how I felt while watching it..... Insulted."
1360,1,Why oh Why!,"An extremely entertaining film. I was completely captivated. I already can't wait for the next instalment. It is filled with non stop action all the way through. It has everything you would want in an action film; explosions, flight scenes, good VS evil (or put another way the light side of the force VS the dark side) as well as some laughs. Yes, it can be argued, that the storyline resembles the past films and yes it has some cliques in it (such as Hans Solo's son being called Ben) but that didn't take anything away from my enjoyment. As a side note, if it turns out Rey is Luke Skywalker's daughter or some other clique like that, that will be disappointing as it would be nice for her to have more of an original back story. Despite this, I can't say much bad about this film. I really loved it and will definitely be buying the DVD when it comes out."
1361,,A fantastic action film whatever anyone says.,"I'm not a Star Wars fanboy (or fangirl) - I enjoy all 6 films and I watch Star Wars Rebels. I wasn't ultra hyped like many about Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I hope it's for good because I enjoyed the film. I like how numerous times you're reminded of the other films. The good guys were great characters, especially Finn and Rey. The acting was great. The action was entertaining to watch. The CGI was awesome, as well as some backgrounds. I liked that we meet some new creatures and travel to different planets. What I didn't like about the film was the villains. Kylo Ren wasn't that cool after we get to know more about him and Captain Phasma could've got a badass role in the film. There might be some other flaws that I missed but from BAD 1 to EXCELLENT 6 I give SW:TFA VERY GOOD 5.25. May not be the best film of 2015, but it isn't a fail."
1362,9,"Entertaining, even with flaws","Star Wars: The Force Awakens seems to get an awful lot of unfair criticism nowadays. I used to see this movie in more negative light, due to its lack of originality, but there's far more to it than that. For example, Kylo Ren's a relatable and sympathetic villain, and far more than just a ripoff of Darth Vader. Aliens is also a great movie even though it incorporates similar story elements to the first movie."
1363,8,JJ's cool.,"For a starter, I'm not really a Star Wars fan. However, I enjoy the movies but now after seeing The Force Awakens, the way I look at the films has changed. I feel more familiar with the franchise than ever before. A feeling I haven't had with any other film released in 2015."
1364,8,"A generous, energetic and brilliant return to a galaxy far, far away...","But here we are, after years of rumours that actually date back to around the time Empire Strikes Back (no really) was being made we have Episode VII. I got to admit while George Lucas selling his company was a surprise, knew he was retiring but I did not see that coming. However Disney right away announcing a new trilogy was not a surprise. But while this new film is slow to get going early on, when it gets going it feels like Star Wars is truly back."
1365,10,"Slow moving at the start, contrary to word of mouth isn't all that much like previous film but when it gets going, boy does it get going",The Force Awakens is an excellent film in that it successfully introduces a new era of Star Wars to a new generation of fans.
1366,7,A good spiritual sequel,"Being a survivor of the date rapes that were ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the clones"" in 1999 and 2002, The Force Awakens was certainly a good surprise (I didn't bother to show up to watch the third one in 2005 as the beaten-wife-syndrome had worn off at that point)."
1367,8,A New-New Hope,"I've seen every starwars movie while it was in the cinemas and from the special edition releases onward, I've seen each one at a midnight opening screening. This one was no different."
1368,7,Pretty good but not groundbreaking,"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with the start of the film on a Tatooine-like planet, Jakku, as per usual. It follows the thrilling journey of the brilliant Poe of the Resistance and Finn of past Storm trooper relation, at first, as you are thrown into the blistering excitement. But then there is a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic — with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc)."
1369,9,Pretty much perfect in everything it sets out to do.,"Spoiler alert: The original ""Star Wars"" made cinema history, and movie magic, but it was a clever, shallow mash-up of many other films. In fact, the movie it most resembled was ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" a spirited Hollywood entertainment with relentless and irresistible pacing and a fabulous score, and no depth or resemblance to reality. "
1370,7,"Forget the sour grapes - ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is fun!","I went to theater expecting nothing, when i saw the Disney bought my favorite franchise, and the director of movie is to be J J Abrams i really nothing expected, but the biggest hit for me was when i heard that all cannon and expanded universe is no more and the Disney will write their own stories. What was wrong with old cannon and expanded universe. You got really nice stories and ideas in video games, books, comics, all better than this unimaginative Disney money maker. First order and Resistance? are you kidding me. After years of fighting we still have the same rebels, isn't republic restored?, this is the most lame story ever. Back to the movie. The movie is typical Hollywood blockbuster, there is no emotions, feeling, acting is nothing special, CGI okay not too much used like others Hollywood and marvel flicks, but still to much for me, not interesting characters, bad design of ships, vehicles, especially new star destroyer, also didn't liked the new look of stormtroopers, whole First order looked boring, something is really lame about them, it is not empire or remnant of Empire i know. You then got Snoke what the?, the most stupidest character in history of Star Wars even Jar Jar looks better, but the worst thing in the movie is that from beginning to the end The Force Awakens wants to be A New Hope, A droid with the hidden message, massacre of civilians in village (resembling on massacre of Lars family), force sensitive on remote planet Jakku and many many other things. For all fans of old movies, you will be disappointed like me, better play old video games, read comics and books and create your pictures and story in your head it is better than this fraud, i really didn't like prequels by Lucas but even this movies are better five times than this, even Disney animated Rebels had better story and characters than this. I only gave it a three because of John Boyega he was okay in his role as Fin, Harrison Ford was okay. All in global they destroyed totally star wars universe and i didn't even had a feeling that i am watching star wars..."
1371,3,Unimaginative Hollywood moneymaker,"Fun movie. Saw this in Omnimax so it was super immersive. Rey is a great character to rally behind, and I'm excited to hang the series on her."
1372,,Fun but forgettable,"This movie was a blast to watch, but in all honesty, Mad Max: Fury Road was the best action movie of this year."
1373,8,"Somewhat of Remake, but loads of fun, has plot weaknesses","Before I talk about the movie, I'd like to talk about canon-related material. A lot of times if we see sequels to a movie, or sometimes like Star Wars they do prequels. A lot of times even while those stories might fit in with the original story, there are slight inconsistencies and plot holes. A small example of that is in the first Home Alone Kevin is supposed to be 8, and in the second one which is supposed to take place a year later, he says he's 10."
1374,10,Feels More Canon,"*** CONTAINS SPOILERS *** I am beginning to think with all the shade being thrown at this movie that Star Wars fans have become the new Star Trek fans, working hard to find fault with just about anything that doesn't fit their pre-conceived imaginations. Have we not forgotten the utter betrayal that began in 1999, the year that essentially split fandom straight down the middle with the release of ::shudders:: 'The Phantom Menace'?? I've read some things that straight up made me laugh, like how TFA is somehow WORSE than the prequels, that Finn is the new Jar Jar Binks, and that this movie was somehow boring."
1375,10,"The Force Awakens, and the Haters Keep Hating","It's not surprising to find so many different opinions about the same movie, given not only its broad reach but also the recent changes this saga has known. Many of the first trilogy fans would just plainly refuse to see it changing hands, and would abhor further modifications."
1376,8,Rebirth,"So you had been driving past that burger joint every now and then but the memories are mixed and you always stopped short at going in from the memories of the pale aftertaste, the disappointment from your last visit. Still, there is this vibrant -positive- association that you have from childhood... a promise, something new! And then the day comes where you see the opportunity unfold, and it is only logical that you stop by for a burger."
1377,7,Imagine giving McD another try after 10 years,"Make no mistake - this is an entertaining and vibrant movie. But for those of us who sat through the original trilogy, the 'Force Awakens' seems very familiar. Some of the bits and scenes that made episodes 4 through 6 so popular have been resurrected and get replayed : the desert, scavengers, cute robot with girl, cute robot with very important information on the run from the dark side, Darth Vader Junior (needs training), and of course the Rebel Alliance with Solo, Wookie and the Princess popping up. Big final action scene is all about attacking a mega version of the death star with lots of rebel space fighters. Not much of a plot ,but a sight to see. It's a matinée for the 2st Century."
1378,8,Entertaining rehash,"First let me say that I was entertained by the Star Wars 7 Force Awakened. It was exciting to go see the movie. Everybody acted well, special effects and funny comments were OK maybe 50/50 or less hitting at right time and delivered correctly. Everything was really good, except that I swear that I had seen it ALL BEFORE. There was very little that added to the Star Wars creatively and innovation wise. On one hand I am disappointed and, on the other hand, I was still entertained, so I gave it a 6. They did give proper honor and shout- out to the 70's with Kylo Ren's hair in all it's feathered glory. They made Fin's character rather weak. John did great with what they gave him, but they gave him very little to work with. Rey was much better and Daisy did everything and then some with it. Harrison and Carrie did what we expected of them so that was good. Maz and Chewy were delightful. Still kind of like watching an origin movie of your favorite Super Hero,where you know all the details, but in this case, it's like you have seen the exact same movie, but it added 10 more minutes. Possibly, more like watching Blade Runner for the first time without the narration. Yes, that's it. Exactly like that."
1379,6,"Rethreaded. Like re-watching Blade Runner for 1st time without narration,",********Spoiler Free********* 
1380,9,Star Wars is indeed AWAKENING !,"Star Wars Episode 7 while boasting a great cast, wonderful visuals and a fantastic score from John Williams. Fails to take the franchise to any new places, or live up to its predacessors."
1381,7,Probably the most anticipated film of this Decade.,"Minor Spoilers! I am a Star Wars fan and was a member of the Star Wars fan club that was based in the US. I was 11 when I saw Episode IV-A New Hope and loved the OT because the first trilogy gave me memorable characters and scenarios that the prequels did not. Just hearing the score and the themes for each scene like Darth Vader marching in, Leia and Han Solo's romantic moments, epic battles in space and down below gave me thrills. What made me watch Episode 7 was the fact that I would be seeing the old characters and I thought they would be depicted in ways that would make their send-offs as memorable as when they were still the main leads in late 70s to early 80s. Unfortunately, this film never took what motivates a character to behave a certain way seriously so there were a lot of senseless behavior and unexplained scenes. It was okay to kill off Han Solo but they could have made his death more heroic as befitting the epic tradition of Star Wars. Rey, though a natural, should not be portrayed as someone who could easily harness the force without training. Sadly, I agree with those who hated this film. It is more a remake or a reboot than a sequel. My classic OT is a hard act to follow after all. This new film lost the heroism and soul of the OT because it seems the generation today prefers mindless action scenes reminiscent of The Man of Steel and The Amazing Spiderman. I don't think remakes or reboots today can capture the essence of the original stories I grew up with so I should not be fooled again and again, grrrrrrr......"
1382,2,A New Hopelessness,Act 1 - 7.2
1383,,Star Wars: Episode VII (2015) - 7.6,"I seriously don't understand all the negative reviews on here. People who claim to be Star Wars fans are giving this movie a score lower than the average rating of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This movie is not only competently made, it is filled with wonderful, interesting new characters and breathtaking action sequences. The story has real heart. I was completely captivated and along for the ride within the first few minutes of the film. Folks are complaining of too many call backs to the original trilogy. Some very small elements are admittedly a little over the top, but the nods to the past are implemented with infinitely greater taste than than they were in the prequels. If you're a fan of the original films then you will love this movie. If you're obsessed with the extended universe and are butt-hurt that they killed it off, then no movie made 30 years after the originals will ever satisfy you. Turn off your computer and go read your Star Wars books. You're blood pressure will thank you."
1384,10,Don't give in to hate!,"Before anyone suspects me of not liking it (even though I already rated it 9/10), I've got to start by saying this one might be the best of the entire saga thus far, and I did like all the previous episodes. I think this one brings together all the best elements of the Star Wars franchise, that is the biggest comics saga of the modern age, the best characters written for such a saga, grand scale CG and a great story of the fight between good and evil, inside the human hearts and outside among all living beings."
1385,9,"So, it's a wonderful movie, but what the heck is sci-fi about it?","Listen, I gave this film an 8 and that is both generous and fair. I went into this movie with a hunger, and left feeling like I was served and appetizer. JJ killed it with Mission Impossible and Star Trek, but instead of leaving with that same ""Belly Full"" feeling as those films, I felt like I paid for a fuller meal than what was served. Ultimately the 3 trailers built a hysteria that the film didn't deliver."
1386,8,May the Hype be with you!,"The oddly woe-begone haters and whiners are missing the point (and for that matter so were the denser than usual Oscar voters (( a loud, mechanical, and soul-less revamp of MAD MAX is better than this...???? in 50 years that will be a footnote and this will be a classic! ))."
1387,9,"Not a remake, not a retread...it is a rebirth.","Why there are so many poor reviews I don't know. This movie is exactly what it was advertised to be and in no way was just a remake. Yes there were similarities between this movie and particularly Ep IV but these are all intentional nods and references not lazy reuses. The most obvious ""reuse"" is the fact that the First Order has a new planet destroying weapon that the Resistance must destroy. But the writers even found a new way for them to do this besides just an X-Wing flying in and blowing it up. Also, Kylo Ren's mask and speaking isn't a lazy re-imagined version of Vader. He himself worships Vader and is obsessed with being like him. This movie did a brilliant job of taking new actors with a new story (this is Star Wars for the new generation after all) and combined them with the original actors and clever references to the original trilogy. The dialogue was perfect for this movie (and very much in JJ Abrams' style) with just enough witty banter and clever one liners to keep you amused amidst all the serious action. And finally that brings me to the action. It wasn't over done, it was believable, and was perfectly reminiscent of the original trilogy. What the prequels did a bad job of was throwing in a bunch of action because they could leading to several unnecessary, over the top fight scenes that left you rolling your eyes. This movie is wonderfully devoid of those elements. It is its own wonderful movie but is still definitely Star Wars. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, any younger future fans, fans of a good action and adventure movie, or just anyone who wants to get the bad taste of the prequels out of their mouth. See it! You won't be disappointed."
1388,7,Don't listen to the bad reviews,"With Empire Strikes Back being my all time favorite movie, loving the entire original trilogy and being a huge fan of the franchise, seeing this one was exactly what I wanted after Return of the Jedi. This is the Star Wars movie we have been wanting since 1983. The reason I gave it a 10/10 after watching it once is because I can't find anything I didn't like. I am going to watch it again tomorrow and after that probably some more times and maybe my opinion will have changed but everything in it was great."
1389,10,2nd best Star Wars so far,"Star Wars 7 was a movie I've been wanting to watch for a long time. I initially wasn't expecting anything great. I decided to just give it a go. The dialogue is far better than Lucas's previous work(prequels)9/10 Story seems decent, but could've been more engaging. 7/10 The acting is very great from these new actors, I'm looking forward to their other 2 movies. 9/10 Soundtrack is basically the same as every Star Wars Fans. 8/10"
1390,7,"Not the best Star Wars, but worth a watch",I thoroughly enjoyed this film even in it's most preposterous moments.
1391,9,It was fun! Even if a bit redundant. (Spoilers Ahead),"This could well be the toughest review I have had to do. I don't know whether it is because of me now reviewing films, I have become more critical of them. But for me, I felt The Force Awakens was good, but nothing more than that."
1392,7,"Good, but nothing more than that.","In an age where film-making is ever more commercialized and insulting of people's intelligence, The Force Awakens comes along to put the final nail in the coffin of bold, imaginative screen writing. These writers were given a golden opportunity. A beloved franchise had lost its way with a trilogy of ill-conceived prequels. A hiatus ensued that allowed for critical reflection, and time enough to prepare a script that honoured the mythology of the earlier episodes, while marking a fresh departure in terms of new characters, story lines, surprises and updating for the children who are coming to the third trilogy that will be their Star Wars. That was the mission: clear and unmistakable."
1393,2,the death of screen writing,"My favorite is the guy in the black outfit and mask. It's sad to have a favorite character, like a villain, and see them do terrible things. He's not as messed up as the worst villain possible. Some villains have a soft side or just aren't as terrible as others. He looked very enticing being very thin, as well as tall and attractive. His voice sounded cool in the mask. I was surprised he wore the mask, as he was fine without it, tho he also seemed really cool with it."
1394,10,"""The Force Awakens""","I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy and was dismayed by all but the last half of Return of the Sith when it came to the prequels. Making a film that was better than the prequels was easy, the question would be how close to the originals could a new Star Wars film get? Could it even be better than them? "
1395,8,Star wars is back!,I thought it would be wise to right a positive review on this movie after seeing all the negative ones all these internet trolls have posted.
1396,10,The Force is strong with this one.,"It took me two viewings to really decide how I felt about this one - having been a Star Wars fan since Empire, and having been so totally caught up in the year long hype for this, my first viewing was almost surreal. The second? It all came together and I had a great time. I'm not going to comment on whether or not this is a legitimately great movie, but I will say that I love it. I find it fun, action packed, intriguing and it absolutely satisfied my Star Wars itch and is (in my opinion) a worthy successor to the original trilogy. The new characters were lots of fun and I'm looking forward to seeing them develop - especially Rey! There were lots of moments that had me wanting to fist pump, several that had goosebumps rising on my arms and lots where I was grinning like a Cheshire cat - Poe and Finn's escape, the first flight of the Millennium Falcon, the attack on Takodana, the final battle between Kylo and Rey... Both me and my family enjoyed every second of this, with my 10 and 12 years old sons both being amazed at the running time because ""it felt like just an hour!"" This movie was everything I wanted from a new Star Wars film - it was familiar enough to be nostalgic, but new enough to be a continuation. It was mature enough to not fall into the trap of the prequels, but had enough humor to lighten scenes. It answered lots of questions and also raised some great new ones - leaving me wanting more. But, most of all, it's fun and like the Flash Gordon reels that George Lucas has stated inspired him to write Star Wars in the first place it was a rollocking adventure that didn't take itself too seriously and dished out exactly what the majority of the audience wanted - thrills, spills, laughs and action. Gone are the tedious politics, gone is the annoying slapstick and back is a full throttle space adventure. Awesome!"
1397,10,A welcome return to fun for the Star Wars saga!,"I am seeing a lot of the hate out there on this film, and I see some of what they are saying, but man, calm down people. I was 6 when ep 4 came out, so I grow up with Star Wars. The prequels were total garbage, so anyone who includes anything positive about the prequels in their review, or mentions that this film is worse than the prequels, is just using hyperbole in my opinion. "
1398,7,I liked it...,"JJ Abrams nailed it. The movie had extremely high expectations. Considering the hype, I would say I was satisfied. The visuals were very well done and did not make your head spin (like most high speed CG movies today). Daisy and Boyega performed very well and I look forward to their performance in next installment of the franchise."
1399,8,JJ Did It!,"I went into this movie expecting another mindless action film that would closer fit into the trend of a Marvel movie rather than a Star Wars. While not devoid of action, I was pleasantly surprised to find there is a healthy balance between plot and mind blowing spectacle. "
1400,7,Better than the Prequels,"The Force Awakens has effective twists throughout and makes for good watching. Some parts are very effective, like scenes on Starkiller Base. Very disappointed with how they don't utilise the original cast as well as they could have."
1401,8,An intruiging beginning to a new era,"Basically the same theme, the same scenario, but different time."
1402,7,"Still, it was fun to watch",I have seen two other Star Wars movies. I very much enjoyed them. This one was boring. The plot: some people fight each other. Most of the time is spent watching CGI explosions and tiny CGI spacecraft swarming about like mosquitoes.
1403,4,a disappointment,"Personally, I do not understand the bad reviews and what people expected. I don't know how you could have made this movie better. I have read reviews criticizing the character development, however, as with every other Star Wars movie...the characters develop more over the series. For me, that has always been one of the things I have loved about Star Wars films, is that in each new movie, you uncover new layers of the characters and learn more about them."
1404,10,What I have been waiting for.,"This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year but I was cautiously optimistic for it with all the disappointments we have had this year but I'm so glad to say I LOVED this movie and is my third favourite movie of the year (one being The Martian and two being mission Impossible) the film starts out perfectly by introducing us to several of out main characters and I instantly loved Poe, felt for Finn and was scared of Kylo Ren. The chemistry between Poe and Finn was excellent. The action scenes were so well done and was surprisingly hilarious with BB-8 being the funniest and Finn being a close second. The pacing of this movie could have gone horribly wrong with their being so many characters but gave everyone as much runtime as they needed and cut to different subplots at all the best times. Every performance was great with Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley delivering stand out performances and Harrison Ford, Carrie (can't remember her last name) and Mark Hammil all giving their best performances in years. The ending was SPECTACULAR I loved everything about it Mark Hamills one scene was perfect and so emotional and wanted episode 8 now. In the end I loved this movie and leaves me so happy that this is the beginning of a new era and gave me waiting for anything else in new trilogy."
1405,10,Lived Up To Every Expectation,"What makes a movie good? The passion behind it. I am a huge angry video game nerd fan. However, I can acknowledge he made a bad movie. I think he can see that himself. However I could see the effort behind it. I could enjoy it for what it was. The same goes with Ed Wood. A terrible terrible director with possible the worst movie of all times. Still, it is worth seeing just to see the passion going down such a bad movie."
1406,10,Imagine this without knowing what star wars is.,"So I finally saw one of the best movies of recent memory in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This movie refreshed the franchise by equating itself with the original trilogy. Unlike the prequels, Episodes 1-3,Episode 7 matched form and atmosphere with the movies that made the franchise a household name. For those who have not seen this movie, please go into this movie expecting CGIed brightness and sterility, and be pleasantly surprised at the grittiness and more real feel! My only real problem with this was the ""threat"" felt too familiar and like it was done the same way; had they done that one aspect differently the movie, in my opinion, would have deserved 10 of 10 stars, everything else was new enough to feel fresh and C-3P0 still had a red arm like he got in the prequels, which felt out-of-place!! My only possible spoilers will be that there was little use of R2-D2"
1407,9,The Force is strong with this one!,"It's like John Carpenter directed the people directing this movie and they didn't know it. They created a...thing, that nobody except 13 year old girls that haven't seen the originals wants. The actual action bits and special effects are good, and the movie, without considering the plot, is pretty entertaining, but it just leaves a smudge on an amazing franchise."
1408,6,The thing.,"As I enjoyed the prequels to the Star Wars movies, I didn't hesitate on going to see this in the cinema, despite some others saying it was too colorful and plain Disney, should we say. Well, to be perfectly honest, yes, this was very colorful, bright, and not dark in the slightest. It's got humour and a lot of moments that may stick in your mind, and the movie went well with popcorn. Does that sound good? Well, it depends. This movie is unrealistically happy and obviously made by Disney, which I really didn't like about the film. However, I walked out of the cinema, enjoying it anyway. Is it better than the prequels? No, it isn't. Is it better than the original trilogy? Of course not. However, if you don't consider this a Star Wars movie, you'll be pleasantly surprised. You'll like this even more if you enjoyed the prequel trilogy. However, if you hated the prequels with a passion, you'll think this movie is the worst movie ever made. So, yes, I did enjoy the movie. That's only because I LOVED all first 6 movies, though. Please, if you go to see this movie, don't expect a nostalgic throwback to Empire Strikes Back. Expect The Phantom Menace sort of story with good special effects and a whiny teenage villain. It may sound a bad movie, but it isn't if you aren't too fussy about your movies. Of course, though, if this is a Star Wars movie, you probably will be a bit picky on it. So, don't go to see this movie if you're expecting a masterpiece. Just pop some popcorn and enjoy a kinda forgettable movie with some unforgettable moments in it. I hope this review was useful, and I do plan on making this review longer to explain a bit more on my review. Also, sorry for repeating a lot of things in my review, but it's so hard to write 10 lines in a review when you aren't exactly passionate about the movie, or if you have a passionate hate on it. I thought that this movie was good, however you need to know what you're going to watch first. It's basically the average 21st Century blockbuster with loads of clichés. I hope this review was useful to you."
1409,10,"If you liked the prequels, you'll find this movie decent","Only the opening crawl justifies the price of the ticket. The Force Awakens is a fantastic experience, made me feel like a child again."
1410,7,"If is not broken, don't try to fix it. J.J. Abrams made another Star Wars film, seriously, again, exactly the same movie.","The seventh chapter of the Star Wars Saga unfolds with this highly anticipated sci-fi extravaganza. The Force Awakens deviates from the CGI fest and subpar writing of the prequels and mimics the mythology and realistic practical effects of the original trilogy. Although a lot of people have a problem with the similarities between The Force Awakens and A New Hope; The Force Awakens is still an awesome riveting sci-fi spectacle filled with explosively stunning visuals, impeccable pacing, great comedic moments, and a somewhat similar yet still refreshingly kinetic story with old faces along side new ones."
1411,9,Star Wars: The Inner Nerd Awakens,"Ok so this movie starts off great. Nice visuals, Kyle Ren stops that blaster shot and a very nostalgic introduction to Rey. So we're all set. Then things take a downward turn in logic and the cracks widen the further we get into it. Rey is given an illogical amount of insight into Force power without any answers as to how she's able to do what she does. And don't give me that read the books or supplemental info crap. Movie info should be contained in the cinematic story. Then we get to the Finn character and his sudden amazing prowess on the lightsaber. All this and a craptastic fate for everyone's beloved Han Solo and we have a mild disappointment. That's not to say it isn't fun if you put the whole script lapse on the back burner. JJ Abrams certainly knows how to make a good looking turd however. So turn off your mind, relax and flow downstream in a warm puddle of piss. Beautifully shot and a good cliffhanger too."
1412,7,Looks Great But Horrible Lapses In Story Logic,"Because of this movie,I miss George Lucas so much.I think this is copy, and paste from episode 4 ,but way much worseeeeeee compare to the old1. I don't like characters.I don't like action sequences, especially lightsaber fights.I love practical effects ,but in this movie some effects look so bad like from the 60s.Come on!!!. Music is very average and has nothing to do with beautiful scored from Episode 1,2,3!.Where is Duel of fates?. In the end I just want to say that this is no more Star Wars movie as we all knew from the past.Its rather Star Trek movie but in the worse way. So many bad decisions in this movie I found."
1413,4,The force is so week with this one.JJ.Abrams You fail!.Its not about that this movie is so bad.Its about that this is the worst Star Wars movie ever !,"JJ Abrams is brilliant: Same formula as the original 3 You have a scavenger who discovers, in this case she is not just a scavenger, but has the force and a mission. They rebooted the Sith, with what are now called the first order."
1414,10,JJ Abrams is brilliant: Same formula as the original 3,"If I'm being honest this is probably my 3rd favorite of all the Star Wars films including the spin-offs. The reason is, as my headline reads, nostalgia. I got goosebumps upon seeing all my old childhood favorites like Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, C3PO and R2D2."
1415,9,Nostalgia Nostalgia Nostalgia,"J.J. Abrams delivers a near-perfect film, which truly personifies everything that made Star Wars such an amazing saga. The film pays its homage to the originals through its story, which shares many similarities to the original Star Wars: A New Hope. However, Star Wars: The Force Awakens never gets caught up in the Star Wars nostalgia as it introduces a lot of new elements that really help distinguish the film. It proves to be by far the funniest Star Wars movie yet, as all the jokes seem natural and don't impede on the overall tone of the movie. The movie also features stunning visuals as practical effects make their triumphant return to the Star Wars franchise. However, the best quality of Star Wars: The Force Awakens lies within its characters. Thanks to some fantastic casting, as well as great writing, Star Wars introduces new characters that may prove to be just as iconic as the originals. In conclusion, Star War: The Force Awakens brings the franchise roaring back to life, perfectly mixing the old with the new."
1416,9,The Force has truly Awakened!!!!!!!,"If you are fearful that we have another Episode I on our hands, fear not! JJ Abrams has done the same brilliant job he did with the Star Trek reboot. "
1417,9,"Good Job, Mr. Abrams!",This really is a new hope for Star Wars films so why is everyone hating on it? 
1418,7,Great movie,"The seventh entry in the Star Wars saga accomplishes its most important task. It recaptures the spirit and the feeling of the original trilogy. The use of CGI is sparse, only really obvious when viewing planets and the main evil weapon from space and when looking at cavernous depths inside huge structures. Like in the originals, this gives the movie a sense of realism and relatability clearly lacking in the prequels. Gone are the feats of force use that made lightsaber wielders move at ridiculous speeds in the prequels and we're back to paced duels that hearken to those between Luke and Darth Vader. Gone also are the ship to ship jumps that Anakin made simply to unnerve Obi-Wan. The force-wielders here are not gods battling gods, their danger seems much more palpable. "
1419,8,Star Wars Is Back!!! (with some casting and story issues),"OK, I must say, actually as some have said, that's not that perfect movie, but come on, say that this is the worst sequence or a a remake... A droid carrying classified rebel information, a villain wearing a mask and with a synthesized voice, a powerful machine even bigger than the Death Star that can destroy planets, light sabers fights, aren't these the essence of Star Wars!? In my opinion it just sounds perfect, J.J. Abrams just tries to keep the essence of Star Wars and also tries to show what Star Wars is for a new generation of fans. He gathered the most important elements from the other six episodes and inserted in this one, and now everybody has enough new elements to workout in the next sequences like linking the space between Episode VI throughout VII etc. I really miss some more breathtaking scenes, so that's why, in my opinion, it doesn't deserve a 10 grade, but I really liked it. There's a lot fun that we don't see in the other episodes and the script itself is not that bad... I must say I read some topics before watching the movie and I was really afraid in being disappointed with the movie, but fortunately it didn't happen. I'll for sure will watch it again and again and again... It really worth the ticket and expectations! "
1420,7,Awesome,Bottom line up front...The Force Awakens is a great movie! 
1421,10,A starting point for an epic new trilogy!,"I couldn't believe it. The one thing they shouldn't have done they did. They completely redid A New Hope. I mean, that's all you can really say. A New Hope is much more thrilling than this. "
1422,6,"Same Thing, except less thrilling music","Unimaginative parroting and reshuffling of core narratives seem to be JJ Abrams' trademark. 99% of the production value was spent on replicating that original 70's look (where even Lucas decided to go with something fresher), and signing up those 70's actors who are in their 70's now. I can't find one original spark: *SPOILER ALERT* the metal mask of the bad guy looks like General Grievous (I believe) mechanical head but really makes no sense as a mask here. Now instead of daddy, bad guy is son whose inferiority complex is not being evil enough. Let me elaborate on this for a second. 'I'm your father' is the quintessential scene of Star Wars. It was a shock moment at the climax fight of the movie. You cannot possibly stoop lower in writing creed than rehash that scene rendering it a mere cultural reference. It certainly does not make for the attempted climax. And to round off the empty progression, he had to finish with a cameo of the original 'son'. The rest of the movie is summarized quickly: sequences of boring fight scenes, gratuitous genocide without much emotional or plot impact, and absolutely terrible acting throughout by the two main protagonists. Daisy Ridley makes even John Boyega seem to possess uncanny depth in comparison, whose only emotional statements are confusion and urgency."
1423,2,What Force,I didn't gave it a 10 because of one problem anyway it's still the best movie of 2015. I actually liked it I really liked this movie I think that it was really good and it was my favorite movie of 2015. OK so I will admit that the visual effects were cool and really good and it was cool to see it in 3d
1424,9,Best movie of 2015,(Spoiler Free) 
1425,8,"It's just part one of a 3 part trilogy, keep that in mind.","It is exactly what I longed for. It brings a breath of fresh air for the Star Wars universe (one can only watch George Lucas's horribly edited original trilogy so many times). I love the diversity in this movie. It wasn't until this film that I noticed all the previous Star Wars movies' main protagonists are white guys. It's about time the main character of Star Wars is a bad*** woman. It's humor is well done. There's an obvious chemistry between the cast members. It is an absolute joy to hear the new John Williams' soundtrack. The special effects are freaking gorgeous. It's a perfect blend of both practical and CG effects. Kylo Ren, even if you hate him later in the movie, you can't deny that he's as intimidating as well as interesting. The acting of Kylo Ren feels like it's what Anikan in Revenge of the Sith should have been. The emotions and fights feel real. Nothing is over-the-top and ridiculous. It's tense and keeps your heart hammering for the characters. If you haven't seen it, please do. May the Force be with you."
1426,10,The Force is Strong With This Film,"OK. So many haters on here who have only been a member for a day now trolling. No spoilers here, no point. Get off your butts and see this movie! You will laugh, you will cry, you will want to jump out of your seat and scream (in happiness) Forget about the prequels, this is the Star Wars universe we deserve. Film of the year. Off to see it again tomorrow. The chemistry is there, the directing superb. Already biting my nails waiting for episode 8. As for people moaning, I don't know why. I guess people just like to troll. Some people need to just chill out. Still buzzing over the movie. Finn was awesome. Ray stunning. Poe kicked butt. Kylo the baddie of a new generation."
1427,8,Back to the best!!!!,"I loved the opening, made me feel like a kid again 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... ' The action sequences are breathtaking from beginning to end so much so that you almost don't have time to realize the lack of originality in the rehashed plot, yet another ""death star"" -couldn't we have had some ""new"" threat to deal with? Did not like the casting of Adam Driver as the bad guy and child of--&-- but did like his modified voice, seeing all the well known actors in assorted cameos took me out of the moment. Liked the two new leads, good chemistry and will work together well in future sequels, particularly the defecting Stormtroopers storyline (Finn) which was really the only original thing going on here."
1428,7,I've got a bad feeling about this.,"To the hater people who think they are ""real"" Star Wars fans hating on this film and the prequels you just don't appreciate what they are their for. Prequels are cool way of explaining events you heard about in the original trilogy but never understood. This movie is very stays dying exactly what I wanted it to be. A perfect blend of using today's technology to liven up some eye candy but also focusing on the plot. There were some pretty obvious similarities to episode 4 but enough different where I wasn't to angry about it. A key aspect they did in this film was they had plenty of surprises and you were always on your toes. This film also does the perfect amount of connections to the old film without going overboard. I really enjoyed this not one of the best Star Wars ever but very good and I was happy with it."
1429,8,Very satisfying movie,"The best thing about this movie is the delightful and nostalgic reappearance of the original Star Wars cast, robots, fighters and similar battle sequences. There are so many references and to the first 3 movies that fans will have a blast noticing them. The tone and humor of the original trilogy are well captured. "
1430,7,Grand revisiting of the past - the future doesn't look that great though,"This movie was excellent and they couldn't of done it better... I'm 27 years old & I've loved Star Wars since the third grade... It was very entertaining and exciting! People that are posting bad reviews are obviously extremely picky and it doesn't seem like anything can please them, but hey that's what opinions are for. They can't make a movie and please everyone but they sure made one that pleased the majority including myself. It felt like I was watching the original Star Wars and the new characters were very likable. The plot was outstanding and my fiancé and I enjoyed every second!!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend for everyone to go and see that hasn't watched it."
1431,9,Awesome Movie!,**** Contains Spoilers****
1432,6,"Unimaginative, Yet With Glimpses of Passion.","Right I have seen tons of reports in the new and on social media saying this is awesome, its wonderful, its brilliant. We it's none of the above. "
1433,1,"Basically a reboot, not a new film.",*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS*
1434,8,"Star Wars is back, yet not without flaws","I'll tell you right away. I'm an Oscar Isaac fan. That's just why ZV7 weighs 30-40 percent more for me than it would have weighed without it. Well, I can't calmly relate to a person who so chicly played just an enchanting, brilliant, convincing scum in ""Forbidden Reception"". Play in such a way that you cease to understand that the actor and the character are different people However, now we are not talking about Zack's work. We're talking about Jay Jay."
1435,10,I'll tell you right away.,"It's been a decade since the release of the last ""Star Wars"" film, but the ""The Force Awakens"" isn't very interested in the George Lucas prequels. Instead, the new picture is a continuation of the Original Trilogy, attempting to pick up where 1983's ""Return of the Jedi"" left off, hoping to rekindle a bit of the old big screen magic with familiar characters and dramatic situations. Co-writer/director J.J. Abrams embarks on a daunting challenge of nostalgia and world- building with the feature, and he's wildly successful with his revival efforts,triumphantly jump-starting the franchise for a fresh round of sequels and spin-offs that hope to play to all ages and degrees of fandom. As a series starter pistol, ""The Force Awakens"" packs substantial firepower. "
1436,,The Force Has Awakened!!!,This movie was amazing it is the perfect follow up to the original trilogy. the writing and acting was perfect along with the special effects. it is great to see old characters return as well as meet brand new characters. this movie is a must for true Star Wars fans.
1437,8,Perfect Follow Up,More revelations bringing together the old and new Jedi generations<br /><br />Fun and exciting to watch for the whole family<br /><br />Good clean film
1438,8,Inspiring new adventure,"I just got done reading a bunch of reviews and wow, close but a bit harsh. Here's a quick honest review that isn't based on immediate hatred."
1439,6,"Not as bad as Some Say, Not as Good as it Could Have Been","A broadly Glaswegian accented space pirate berated Han Solo and the Glasgow audience I watched 'Star Wars: Episode 7: The Force Awakens' with took it to their hearts. It is a people pleaser. JJ Abrams comes at the Star Wars universe with both a fan and auteur's eye. Fan's, in the sense that he has focused in upon a story that revolves around the ""lunchbox"" characters of Star Wars. Auteurs in that he retains an individual look - this is a Star Wars universe stretching right back to the abandoned concept art of the original movies and using them to set the tone for worlds, environments and creatures. "
1440,9,"Frank Drebin, Young Training Day and Hermione fight Spoiled brat cosplayers","Only for respect to Star Wars will not put score 1. The story is well enough, but I expect more about the casting of the new artists. The girl is excellent choice, but the fat afroamerican is bad choice, also the evil new Wader is funny guy, which is not suitable for this role. Maybe he must not put down the mask. There was no new special characters and machines. The kill of Han Solo was not good scene, very simple and not appropriate. I know the expectations are big but this movie is not reaching the middle level for Star Wars movie. If you want to make another SW movies have to think if it is right. Star Wars is not just another movie, don't push the money machine just for the sport."
1441,7,Bad casting,So this review will be a bit of a change from others on this site at the moment. I am going to review the movie of course but I am also going to offer some brief thoughts and insight into the current early signs of audience backlash against this movie in the month and half following its release.
1442,8,"Wow, didn't take long did it?","It has been ten years since the last entry of arguably the most popular science-fiction film series of all time. J.J Abrams who brought an amazing vision with stellar special effects and visuals to the screen with his hit films such as Mission Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009), Super 8 (2011), and Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013). This year, Abrams brings his incredible vision to the long-waited sequel that would continue the epic saga of the Star Wars Universe. Set thirty years after the events of 'Return of The Jedi', when Luke Skywalker brought down the Galactic Empire, a new threat known as the First Order lead by the evil leader Snoke (played by Andy Serkis) and his ally Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) arises, along with the Resistance in attempt to capture Luke Skywalker who has gone missing, and his whereabouts are unknown. A young stormtrooper named FN-2187 a.k.a Finn (played by John Boyega) escapes from the galaxy with pilot Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) to search for mini droid named BB-8, who has the map to Luke Skywalker's location. When the mission goes wrong, and Poe and Finn are separated, Finn meets a scavenger named Rey (played by Daisy Ridley). Assisted by Hans Solo (played by Harrison Ford) and his furry friend Chewbacca, Finn and Kylo must fight against the First Order and save the galaxy once and for all. "
1443,7,Satisfying attempt on continuing the Star Wars saga,"Not only was this movie a pointless (and tedious) remake of ""A New Hope"", it was poorly done; the script of a ten year old who had seen Star Wars the day before."
1444,3,Crushingly disappointing,"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy."
1445,8,The Glory is Back,Whoever came up with this is such a genius.<br /><br /> I wonder which genius came up with this. I mean just the name Star Wars is so cult. She must be a beacon of humanity and hope. I heard a rumor that she was an assistance (more like guide and masseuse) to Steven Spielberg who did a favor to him and gave the project to Spielberg's groupie and acolyte JJ Abrams. What a genius connection.
1446,,Hollywood is in great hands,"Episode VII picked up where Episode VI left off (pretty obvious :D) and it is like 20-30 years ago after the original trilogy. I was surprised that this movie did not rely much on CGI, but instead JJ Abrams relied mostly on practical effects which is awesome. Now to the characters: the original characters have returned like Leia, Han, and Chewbacca. Among them, Han pretty much changed. He is still cocky, yes, but he has matured since the original trilogy. Leia, well, she is a general now ha! (Not a surprised though) And Chewie is still the same. The characters are also good. John Boyega's Finn is likable and there is also Daisy Ridley's Rey. The two have great chemistry despite the fact that they are both unknown actors. Then there comes Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron. He is like the best big brother you never had. Kylo Ren is the most bad-ass of the cast and he is the villain. Wew. Judging the from the trailers alone, it looked like he was gonna be another Vader but surprised to say that he is not. He is more human than you think. And then there the dick space Nazi and other characters that I'm not gonna reveal because SPOILERS! The soundtrack and the sound effects will give you goosebumps because it's too nostalgic! grin emoticon The only gripe I have about this movie is the story and some elements of it. This film feels exactly like the original which is a plus and not.There are scenes that you know will happen because I feel it was copied from the original. Just wait and listen to Han's joke about the Death Star- like system."
1447,8,The force is strong with this one,"So, all apprehensions aside, there I was like the zillion others on first day and first show in plum seats at an IMAX screen. Eager once again to listen to the swoosh of the light sabres and the bleep bloops of the droids, I was lost in wondering . Brought back I was by the familiar music. Jolts were sent through to the hippocampus and by the time the Epic prologue text started sliding into the abyss, first episode of welling up with goosebumps was all but seen through. As the minutes passed by, I could see Abrams sticking to the stereotypes of the original trilogy. Picking pages off Episode IV, in showing the attack of the villain upfront in a show of might and attitude, followed by introduction of protagonists in some daily routine event. It was all so familiar the making style, with minute hiccups. We all were let know that we are once again in a Star Wars movie. Period. Each of the old characters was being received with cheers and whistles and tears. All in all a very busy half an hour. As the reels went by, the allegories started to become more pronounced, indicating that the film is a part of the original puzzle. The transition to 30 years ahead was decently achieved . Now, since the promotion of the movie, it was being sold as the star wars for the new generation. Even though it is, there is so much adhering to the old storyline that the old fans will find themselves engrossed much and boasting less about star wars of the 70's. The nostalgia was all expected, but I liked that Abrams hasn't played too much off the introduction of the vintage characters and let them reprise the nuances of the characters as they go about exploring the unexpected turn of events as they come. 10 points for the blend in. One of the major possible failure was averted in the tech department. The technological advances in the story were kept to the minimum, since a period of 30 years accounts for little, when it's all happening long ago in a galaxy far far away and almost at the peak of it's technological evolution."
1448,8,Star Wars Episode VII : A sight for sore eyes,"This movie is AWESOME. J.J has directed a fun, action filled Star Wars film that feels like the original trilogy, but also feels very new, Ridley and Boyega lead the acting pack in the film and in turn give us some great performances and new characters to love in the franchise. Ford and Issac also deliver great performances, and Driver feels very whiny, but he does great with what he's given. The beginning and the middle are great, but the third act is very repetitive of A New Hope, but that said Lucas loves rhyming in the SW universe, it's like a poem, so I don't mind it that much because there is plenty of new stuff to detract from that. All in all TFA is a solid Star Wars film there rejouvenated the franchise and shows us that Disney can take care of our beloved universe."
1449,9,There has been an Awakening,"Don't get me wrong: Ep VII is nothing like the soul-less, computer-game-cut-scene-esque mess that were the prequels. But it ain't no ""Empire"" either - I'd go as far as saying that even ""Jedi"" was a better, more original and ultimately more interesting movie. "
1450,7,Too close to the original,This movie has been highly praised by critics but criticised and slated by the everyday casual movie watcher. I'm here to tell you that this movie is vastly underrated!
1451,10,The Force is strong with this one!,I will not give away any spoilers about the important plot points and events but I still like to warn those who wish to know nothing. If that is the case I will start by saying this:
1452,7,Star Wars is finally back!,"Star Wars VII truly met the hype and excitement for the reboot of a saga that has been timeless. This is because of the how Star Wars impacted American culture through as Vincent Canby calls ""(i)t's both an apotheosis of Flash Gordon serials and a witty critique that makes associations with a variety of literature that is nothing if not eclectic: Quo Vadis?, Buck Rogers, Ivanhoe, Superman, The Wizard of Oz, The Gospel According to St. Matthew, the legend of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table."" This is because how this movie invokes all of these amazing tales to be amazing. Also Star Wars is a highly recognized film within our American culture with it making the top one hundred grossing films at filmsite.org. Star Wars VII is set thirty years after the fall of Emperor Palpatine and the crippling of the Galactic Empire. The rise of the First Order causes the force to truly awaken. And new heroes were born when old ones failed. Although people might say that Star Wars VII is not as good as the original trilogy the following reasons prove otherwise. This movie is filled with the nostalgia of old characters returning and the similarities to Star Wars IV. The new elements make good use of the Star Wars universe to be very interesting.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> This movie is filled with the nostalgia of old characters like Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker returning. The entrance of the Millennium Falcon was great as it shows how the force guided to one thing after another and it was just by luck. Next, when meeting Han Solo, he says that the force and Jedi are real. This gives off nostalgia with relating back to him, in Star Wars IV, saying that he did not believe in the Jedi or the force. The most exciting entrance is of the Resistance because as the heroes are in a almost defeated position against them, the Resistance use their ships to defeat and make the First Order retreat. Not only is the nostalgia excellent but the new elements of the characters and plot line are great.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The plot line of trying to find Luke Skywalker and defeat the First Order's Star Destroyer puts a very entertaining spin on the Star Wars IV plot line. The magnificent light saber duels and other battles are full of tense moments and that has a hint of space soap opera. The grand music by John Williams full of brass fanfare gives a strong feeling in tense situations. The light but filled emotionally charged flute melody of Han Solo meeting Princess Leia brings us happily back to them two in the original trilogy. The beginning, that has a resemblance to the opening of private Ryan, is amazing as Finn's amazing acting with realizing the evil of the First Order and J. J. Abrams depiction of the darkness of their war like World War II is a wonderful opening. With that the introduction of Kylo Ren using the force to stop a laser blast is surprising as we never saw a Sith do that before. Also as people say that Disney would make Star Wars VII have a happy ending, like most of their movies, there is a very tragic event in the movie that would strike any movie watcher sad. Finally, the amazingness of the resistance being able to defeat an entire star destroying and planet sized weapon was fun to be able to see how that unfolded. Star Wars VII does not disappoint to Star Wars fans missing old characters and the grand thrill of a space odyssey. On contrary to these reasons, there are some people that do not feel this way and feel a varying degree of dislike for the movie.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Many movie reviewers feel like that it is not as good as the originals, a representative from this group is miller-93442. Although he criticized about Finn, the storm trooper, his use of ""Just clueless"" should be used for his view on Finn and how he does not take into account his growth throughout the film with overthrowing his old stormtrooper ways and protecting his friends in this ""sword fight."" Also the ""technology"" not being improved is countered by the ""starkiller base"" which was made to basically show that there is greater technology. His ignorance in not carefully analyzing the significance of the saying ""Luke was on what appears to be earth"" does not take into account the main goal of the entire movie finally achieved. Finally he does not take into account the point of this movie to be nostalgic. Sometimes there is more heart and soul to the movie than what an individuals bias is.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The nostalgia of the this movie was greatly executed for maximum enjoyment. When I watched Star Wars VII, on opening day, me and the audience clapped in excitement for every time that a classic character appeared. The plot line integrated with the new characters were very dynamic, changing throughout the film, and interesting to watch. The bad reviews does not take into account the film and has their own bias inserted. Star Wars is back and ready to take over the box office with its new friends."
1453,10,You Will Watch Star Wars VII,Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**
1454,7,New but same and familiar set up,I'm not sure i have spoilers here but - BE WARNED SPOILER ALERT.
1455,4,"I wanted to love this movie , but i can't","It has been many years since the Rebels have officially defeated the Empire, and now a new and more powerful version of the ""Empire"" has risen and Luke Skywalker has suddenly disappeared. With some old friends as well as some new ones, they all embark on another journey to defeat this so called ""First Order"" and their current Jedi leader, bringing back the force as they go along. This was not too bad overall, with a similar story/concept as the original Episode IV that brings us a similar beginning to yet another Star Wars trilogy. Of course with today's version of Hollywood special effects, it certainly was visually engaging and stunning. Interesting cast of characters, including Finn as well as Leia and Solo. Some of the acting I will admit seemed a bit deficient, but overall it was better as the film went on. Since this is episode 7 out of 9, you'll leave wondering what will happen next for sure."
1456,,"Derivative, but acceptable","Those complaining about this movie being too similar to Episode IV A New Hope simply do not understand what this movie is trying to accomplish. This movie is meant to parallel the original journey undergone by Luke Skywalker and friends while simultaneously creating a new cast of characters for the next generation to grow up with, and look up to. And they accomplished their goal. Rey, Finn, and Poe are some of the most likable characters I have seen on film in some time, and I look forward to following their adventures in upcoming movies. Overall the best judge of a movie is how well it can hold up as a film on it's own and not with the rest of the series it belongs to. And whether or not you have ever seen a StarWars movie before I believe you will enjoy watching StarWars The Force Awakens based on it's own merits, it's compelling cast, beautiful cinematography, and epic space battles."
1457,8,"One part original story, one part remake, all together great movie.","So, yes - it's been some time since I wrote here... And I'm sorry to have left this website without any update for a long time. But changes have happened for good and this is good. But everything has its time and now it's time to pay my respect to Disney's Star Wars..."
1458,8,The Force of Star Wars,"First, I loved the film. The fun was back, the action was back, the Force was back. It sets up the conflict for the next two films. The cinematography is outstanding and the CGI isn't invasive."
1459,9,Great start for the final trilogy...but...,I was so disappointment but only when it ended...why did it have to end :'(
1460,9,A good film with a great cast,"Taking you back in time, the original trilogy of this probably the most popular science fiction series till date began with Star Wars or Episode IV – A New Hope in 1977, followed by Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI - Return of The Jedi released in 1983. A prequel trilogy to these original three films was released later as Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II - The Attack Of The Clones (2002) and Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith (2005). Here though the response to the first (award winning) three parts remained more than the later ones, still the series went on to become the most successful film merchandise franchise with books, television serials, video games, comics, toys and more entertaining the enormous fan following in the last four decades. "
1461,6,"It reminds you of the simple, enjoyable spirit of the original 3 part series as a tribute, without any new or path breaking surprises.",Am I the only one who expects after every time they ask rey who she is and she replies with Rey that they ask:
1462,9,Rey who?,"Now being a huge Star Wars fan I was obviously excited to see how the sequel trilogy is going to pan out and what has happened in the thirty year gap between Return of the Jedi and the force awakens. Maybe being brought up as a child on the prequels might have been a blessing in disguise as I wasn't going to have my expectations too high but obviously better than the prequels. Now positives film the film, there are many of them however the main ones personally are characters and certain scenes that stand out. Daisy Ridley is fantastic what a talent that JJ Abrams found really good solid performance that was believable at all times. Next John Boyega again brilliant performance all around, solid accent all the way through and the story really made you feel for the guy. However the two stand out characters for me are Han Solo and Kylo Ren played by Harrison Ford and Adam Driver respectively. Both of these performances were just a step above the rest in the depth and complexities, Han with age and witt helped by brilliant writing from JJ and Lawrence Kasdan. I also would like to take a moment to compare Darth Vader from A New Hope and Kylo Ren from the Force Awakens. Kylo for me, just comparing them on there first films , is a much more interesting character with a history/background and is far more complex than just being a villain. The final positives for me are all the action scenes in the film are made fantastically and are a perfect blend of practical and CGI effects, also the cameo at the end by Luke is good but brief. Now onto the negatives...yes there are some. I personally have three major problems with the film. The first is the comparison to A New Hope, which for me personally there are too many of. I didn't mind early on a couple of nods to the earlier films but after a while it became boring and generally unimaginative. This links into my next negative Starkiller base, which is a bigger death star. The specific part I don't like is about the destruction of multiple planets, which is very weak. The reason it is weak is because the story never goes to those planets nor does it have anything to do with the characters apart from being the new republics centre. The final negative I have is involving the final lightsaber battle, specifically the miraculous recovery of Finn from a lightsaber cut straight up his spine, in my mind there is no way he should of survived. Also the sudden master jedi skill of Rey to partially defeat Kylo Ren, somebody who had been trained with the force and the dark side and is in his thirties. If there was more build up I wouldn't mind but considering thats the first time she picked up a lightsaber it just doesn't sit right. Finally this film is better than the prequels...phew, however I don't think it is as good as Empire but is about on par with Jedi, Episode 8 should be interesting lets just hope it doesn't follow Empires story line too much."
1463,7,Star Wars is back.........However??,Episode VII fully redeems the infamous Star Wars prequels. It wouldn't be surprising to learn that JJ Abrams and Lawrence Kasden studied the prequels' many misfires and used them as a guide for what not to do in crafting a new generation Star Wars movie.
1464,9,"Redeems the Prequels and Offers ""A New Hope"" for the Franchsie",The expectations too high? Maybe.
1465,6,Please wait while the Force awakens...in 2017...maybe...,"Original Review (Short): This movie is not a remake, but a simple rehash of the original trilogy. Star Wars Force Awakens has the same plot as Star Wars New Hope. It follows the same format. This movie is complete garbage. Star Wars fans should be angered that they are getting cheated, but they are just too $tupid to realize it. Fans praised this movie as Disney butchered Star Wars Expanded Universe, and replaced it with this cr@p. Star Wars Force Awakens is not a creative film, but a cash grab. Disney is wh@ring Star Wars, so brace yourself.Things are about to get worse. P.S. J.J. Abrams is a complete hack. He basically resold you the same sh@t. This time Abrams just added fancy visuals to entertain the plebes. Only idiots would praise this film. This movie has absolutely no substance. Update: My review was deleted,because I hurt somebody's feelings. Objective Review (Short):"
1466,1,A Movie Worshipped by Plebes,"It's beautiful to look at and the cast is awesome. The new villain Kylo Ren is fantastic and the two new leads are wonderful. The pacing is spot on, the nods and tributes to the originals are perfectly placed. I loved the movie. I do have to admit that my only issue is its lack of ""soul"". George Lucas IS Star Wars and separating this new franchise from him and his creative force was a huge mistake. His ""presence"" is greatly missed here... I was 6 years old when my parents took me to see New Hope on opening day, and I've never been the same again, so I'm not being closed minded in my opinion, I just felt like something was missing and in my opinion that someone is George Lucas. "
1467,10,STAR WARS for a new generation,"Yeah, I know how people who haven't seen this don't want to see any spoilers. I will only write one small spoiler here (I'll warn you when it comes, so read on), but i will tell you what I thought of it. It was actually the first live action (Not clone wars animated stuff) Star Wars theatrical movie since Revenge of the sith. So how was it? "
1468,8,"The most anticipated movie of the year, and how it turned out","This movie was tremendous. After the first 40 minutes, I was glued to my seat, mainly because the theater staff did a bad job cleaning up after the previous screening. But still, I found myself totally engrossed in this adventure before realizing what was ahead... the original cast!! For the first time in over 30 years, I was actually able to be reunited with the set of iconic characters who'd been such a huge part of my young life. I don't care if this story was in some ways a rehash of the original Star Wars. After years of being mired in prequel hell, it was just so great to watch the characters I could root for again. And the new characters are interesting, funny, and charming as well. Besides, if you're gonna rehash any movie, Star Wars is a great pick!!<br /><br />So what the hell is everybody's problem??<br /><br />What exactly would satisfy all of you??<br /><br />You all seem to claim to be big Star Wars fans, yet you've s**t on every episode since Empire!! How can you really consider yourselves ""fans"" of Star Wars if you only like 2 movies out of 10? I mean, is it possible that all of your opinions are completely backwards? Maybe Star Wars is just as great as it's always been, and YOU are the ones who suck."
1469,10,"It's STAR WARS, jerks!!","Can't believe how good this was. Disney did a great job keeping to the original appeal and premise of the original. OK, learning how to fly a spaceship or use a lightsaber on the first try is a little hokey, but who cares?! They incorporated the old cast in brilliantly. The new ships and technology are awesome despite their Star Wars-ish impossibility. "
1470,10,Thank you Lucas for selling SW to Disney...The Force Awakens = Awesome!,"The Force Awakens is without the shred of a doubt a well made entertaining blockbuster. We can go on and on about how its to much like A New Hope (which it was) but in my opinion at least it brought us enough new stuff to chew on for most of that to be excused. In conclusion The Force Awakens is refreshingly entertaining, well developed film that I for one loved."
1471,7,"Not a a Film to Inspire Generations, but still Really Good","With no involvement by George Lucas, and very different ways of advertising, I didn't know what I was walking into. And the second the floating paragraphs started, I knew that this was gonna be good. But was it? YEAH! Now let me get this straight - This was not at all a perfect movie. I actually have many problems with how JJ handled a few characters. But it was good for the most part! Han Solo was handled poorly in my opinion. He went in the wrong direction, and I was very upset to see that. But Harrison Ford did an excellent job as always. Luke Skywalker was also handled bad in my opinion. They barely had him in the movie, and I didn't like what they did. But some positives, John Boyega was really good! I loved Finn and I think that he has a really bright future ahead of him! Oscar Isaac amazed me in Ex Machina, but now, he takes it one step farther. He delivers yet another fantastic performance. And BB-8 was really adorable. Definitely my favorite Droid ever! Carrie Fisher came back, and she did a very good job as General Leia. And Daisy Ridley, who has done barely anything before, easily had the best performance. I loved her and to see what they did with Rey was amazing. She stole every scene she was in. And she's really pretty. Kylo Ren was a really mediocre villain for the most part, until he acted the way he did about 15 or 20 minutes before the end. That action made me hate his guts. But he was scary, and Adam Driver did good! Maz Kanata was not at all what I wanted. I expected her to be Yoda-like, but I didn't really see that in her. Captain Phasma, General Hux, R2-D2, and C-3P0 were not in the movie as much as I would've liked, but hey - there's 2 more movies! The effects were great in this movie! The score is beautiful as always. And the best part is that it didn't answer all questions. It gave us a hint at what's to come, but doesn't answer all theories quite yet. And that's all I wanted. The lightsaber battle towards the end was really good, and it had high stakes. Not like the battles from the prequels. If you're looking for this to be as good as Episodes IV or V, then don't watch this, because it's not as good. But it does show that good Star Wars movies after 1983 are indeed possible."
1472,9,"If you're looking for another Episode V, don't watch!","I thought this was an Enjoyable watch. The Star Wars World is already a Great setting and it was Fun to watch the New Generation of Characters and their Stories Unfold. Finn, Rey, Poe and Kylo Ren were Great Additions to this Establishment."
1473,7,Star Wars: The New Generation 🔫,"My story is far from a new one in the realm of movie goers. I grew up in the 80's and 90's and a family member introduced me to the Star Wars trilogy I instantly feel in love with the franchise, from the action to the cheesy hat tips to serials of the 40's and more subtle nods to directors like Kurosawa I was stuck a fan. I often argued with friends which one was better, why the Ewoks aren't that bad, and what gave lead these characters to where they ended up. The story while simple was fulfilling a little epic about how a regular joe saved the galaxy."
1474,8,A shot a nostalgia.,So this movie starts out just like the original - media res.
1475,6,Media Res Redux,"Having been one who waited in long lines to see the original Star Wars in 1977, seen the growth of Empire Strikes Back (best of the series) and Return of the Jedi (Starting to show some odd signs of digression, like Ewoks, but still powerful) then suffering through Episode I, which minus Jar-Jar (and midichlorians) might have been a tolerable movie, I was thoroughly thrilled to hear that Lucas was NOT going to be involved in the writing of future SW movies. Well, I was not disappointed with the editing, special effects or the acting in general, what I was VERY unhappy with was to see Episode VII as basically a typographical repeat (reboot) of Star Wars (now called 'A New Hope'):"
1476,4,Worst of SW series with exception of Jar-Jar Binks,"Dear lord, there's nothing more furious than a disappointed fanboy."
1477,8,Save Me From Fanboy Hate,"**SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE. BUT REALLY, GO SEE THE MOVIE ALREADY**"
1478,10,The Perfect Diving Board for Jumping Back into the Star Wars Pool of Awesomesauce,"Before I saw it I read some of the lower reviews. For the most part they complained that this was a remake, reboot, steal (choose our pick) from Ep.4. Alright. Without giving anything away I will admit there are (broadly speaking) some thing that must be spawned from ep 4-6. What I can say is that for me it didn't matter. When you see them you will know what I mean. Rather than being a carbon copy, they enhance the feeling of familiarity. Like when you see a dear friend after several years only to find out everything you liked about him/her is still the same. JJ Abrams has taken his mission seriously, sure enough. ""Fan made"" comes to mind, but in the best possible way. As you know most of the old cast is in it but that's not the best part. Well, perhaps with the exception of Han Solo... What really carries the film is the younger main characters. A match made in heaven for sure. The cinematic effects are a blessing to see. Lucas's old concept ""used space"" is back, with a vengeance. The organic feel from 4-6 only miles better. Of course they have used CGI but carefully and only as an enhancement, never as a rule. No more shiny ships that looks like as from a cheap video game. The only ""but"" I can really think of that's bothering me a little (and I do mean ""little"") bit is the gap between ep.6 and this. Yes the story is suppose to be 30 years after but still. However this may be saved up for ep.8? A side from that there's really very little against it. In short: If you loved the original three, you must see this. You'll love it!"
1479,9,The interest awakens!,"I have never been a huge Star Wars fan, however I am a huge film fan, So I went into Star Wars with no expectations despite the massive publicity. It's probably not needed to put much of a synopsis in this review as actually it may well spoil the film and confuse the reader (and reviewer)."
1480,8,"Not out of this world, but worth the journey","The movie is not great unfortunately. Its passes as merely OK, I would rate it 5.5 / 10. The humor IS forced, cheese ridden, cringe worthy in places and truly terrible in others. The movie starts off nicely and gets progressively worse as it unfolds. "
1481,6,Basically just an acceptable remake of 'A New Hope',"0.1 A film-critic fan boy is an obnoxious adult who spends time nitpicking movies searching for quality. Unfortunately, the FCFB does not realize that most movies are supposed to be enjoyed."
1482,10,Dear One-Star Terrorists,"This film is derived heavily from the original Star Wars, but—as the source material is pretty darn good—I still enjoyed it. I was disappointed that the climactic battle was almost identical to that in the first film. "
1483,7,Could've been better,Here is my spoiler-free review of Star Wars: The Force Awakens...
1484,10,Absolutely Perfect,"The Force Awakens is enjoyable to watch, but not original at all. The Force Awakens is a duplicate of the original Star Wars! The movie's script has another Death/planet star weapon which explodes. An escaped droid with a secret message. Another Darth Vader, which we can call mini Darth Vader. Awakens' story cumulates with another rebel attack ending. More light saber duels, an a character dies in Obe One fashion! However, not a bad film! What works well for The Force Awakens is: Retells the Star Wars story well. The beginning starts off strong with an evil dark side attack on a village. The introductions of new characters stirs excitement for the viewers. Who what they are and what they are doing? Preplexies the viewer. Regrettably Minus the new Vader, the new characters becomes stale and add little to the redundant story. What saves the storyline is the reintroduction of Hans Solo/Harrison Ford. Ford's charismatic performance save the stale script. Fisher and the rest of the old cast creates the old magic and momentum for the 2nd half The force awakens. The old cast ending creates excitement for next instalment. Worth watching! B B 8 is cute character worth watching. Fun to watch for a new generation of fans."
1485,7,Watchable,"... Has arrived. Fuelled by a hate campaign against it's original creator, an outpouring of irrational love for it's original release (by a squadron of people not yet born)... and enriched by the childhood memories of people whose 'childhood' was nowhere near as important as they think it was. Star Wars is back... and it's like it never went away."
1486,5,The most over-hyped movie of all time...,"As you can expect, from the trailers shown, this movie looks amazing! JJ Abrams, like he did with Star Trek, does a great job making a film that star wars fans can enjoy whilst also making it relevant and interesting for people who do not know the history of Star Wars. This is one of the best films in the franchise. Fans may have been worried that, after a long time away from the big screen, we were going to get another Phantom Menace. This is NOT the case!! Overall this is a very entertaining movie to watch and I'm confident that this will break the 2 Billion mark, watch out Avatar!"
1487,10,Star Wars... Just go and watch it already!!,"I really liked this movie. I really wish I had someone to talk to about it, but I'm the first to see it and I don't want to spoil it for friends & family. This is basically the sole reason I'm adding my review to the MANY that already exist."
1488,8,I Only Had One Problem With The Entire Film,Star Wars is back
1489,10,Pretty much what all I could hope for,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is the seventh movie in the Sci-Fi franchise and sees the return of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, as Hans Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia respectively. The screenplay is by Lawrence Kasdan, JJ Abrams and Michael Ardnt, with direction provided by JJ Abrams."
1490,8,A Supercharged thrill Ride,"We meet here again our well known characters of the previous episodes some of them of course older namely Han Solo and Princess Leia and we meet also the humanoids and androids some of them also already known. This movie figures once again the fight between Good and Evil, the Force of Light and the Dark Force in a succession of brilliant images and sequences and prodigious and stunning special effects mainly with the frightful flights and chasings of the spaceships. And in between, now and then a sentimental note of friendship and comradeship is introduced which softens a bit the atmosphere of the almost permanent violence. The visual atmosphere including the figures of the humanoids, androids and material gadgets is very imaginative. A movie that keeps you thrilled all the time you stay watching it."
1491,7,Brilliant images and sequences,"It is true. The dark side remade the original trilogy and won. The first sign was that the rebel alliance which was the winner at the end of Episode VI is now somehow the rebel alliance again!?!?!? With that confusion aside, the reboot is pathetic and sad. Disney hired remake specialist JJ Abrams and he predictably made a boring mess with very bad actor. The lead actress is ugly rubbish and the story is a joke (and fill of one-liner jokes)."
1492,,Spoiler Alert: The Darkside Won,"just wonderful, it's not an exaggeration to say that this movie is great and one of the best of all time, I really loved it, left me thrilled several ways, have incredible and beautiful special effects scenes, no matter the negative criticism of people demanding, this movie is perfect and nostalgic, I want him to be the greatest film in box office , I really liked the new characters too, and are sometimes funny scenes to entertain the public, anyone is going to love this movie, and I really don't understand why some negative criticism some people,everyone can watch this film without fear, he is great, and in my opinion, is the best Star Wars already created"
1493,10,The movie of the year,THERE ARE BIG SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!
1494,6,A proper Star Wars Film....with a couple of flaws,"<-Contains minor Plot reference, nothing important->"
1495,10,Similar but acceptable,"This is the first sequel in the Star Wars franchise in 32 years. A long time ago in an era far, far away."
1496,7,"""It is a time of sacrifice...Good and Bad""","After all of the hype I received on this long awaited, umpteenth sequel, I was expecting a miracle... IT NEVER CAME. In fact, I got more enjoyment eating my big bowl of popcorn than sitting through his boring rehash of the original. Mr. Lucas' creative well has obviously, sadly, run dry. EVERY, SINGLE SCENE OF THIS OVERPRICED TURKEY WAS A DIRECTLY REHASH OF THE FIRST ""STAR WARS."" Even Stevie Wonder could see it. George simply took the entire cast from the original, found new, unknown actors to portray Luke Skywalker, even R2D2 and Darth Vader (why did he have to wear that black Dark Lord getup when he was young and in perfect health?), then did the entire thing all over again. I won't expose the ONLY surprise of the entire film here, only to say that NOTHING could resurrect this remake into anything but a dim, dull reincarnation in movie sequel Hell. I took the Blu-Ray disc I had purchased for $20. and used it for a Frisbee, launching it off my apartment roof. It was the only thrill of the entire, completely unnecessary experience."
1497,3,Hype doesn't trump Reality.,"I actually really enjoyed this movie. Yes there are a lot of plot holes in the story, that story is pretty well the same from Episode IV, but they had planned to make the same story from the foruth epiosde. The best part of this movie would have to be the actors, they actually did a very good job considering what they were given. I do understand why a lot of people didn't like it. To me personally I don't mind that they hated it 'to each his/her own' For me personally turned out to be a good one. I do still prefer the original 3 over this one. I do find if you compare yes, this movie is utter crap, but if you don't compare it actually stands on its own as a good movie."
1498,8,"not great, not bad","The Star Wars original trilogy films have been my favourite movies for a very long time. Episode VII, The Force Awakens, is absolutely a perfect fit in to the Star Wars universe. "
1499,,This is Star Wars,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was the much-anticipated installment in the ""Star Wars"" franchise which featured the return the classic characters of Han, Leia,and Luke. These three characters had not been seen on screen since the 1983 film, ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."" Like the actors who played them, all three characters were roughly thirty years older; and, the depiction of the characters was believable and age appropriate. The return of these characters to the screen was a real treat for ""Star Wars"" fans. Han and Chewbacca stole the show in virtually every scene in which they appeared."
1500,8,"The Much-Anticipated Return of Han, Leia, and Luke",The Force Awakens promised a lot and delivered more for both a first time Star Wars viewer or a die hard fan of the series.
1501,10,A Wonderful Return To A Galaxy We Missed Dearly!,"My first experience of seeing the original Star Wars was on VHS during the 90's. And when I saw the Phantom Menace, I will admit I thought it was great but as I got older I started noticing the big problems and they got more noticeable through more prequels. After I watched the Revenge of Sith in theatres, which I consider to be one of the most depressing movies ever, I shunned Star Wars because I thought it ended on a bad term and no future movies would made. But then I heard JJ Abrams was chosen by Disney to be the new director and I started thinking about giving Star Wars another shot. And with each trailer I became more and more optimistic. And now that I have seen the Force Awakens, I can now honestly say I care about Star Wars again."
1502,8,The Force Awakens made me care about Star Wars again.,Despite the huge love there is out there for 'Star Wars' after the lukewarm response the prequels gained rebooting the saga was always a risk. Especially when there was so much hype about how 'great' this film was bound to be.
1503,7,It all starts again,"After waiting so long to see a new Star Wars movie, and facing the lemons from the Prequel Trilogy, I came into this movie with some trepidation. Thankfully JJ Abrams handled it well, and the result, while not great, is a good movie that reintroduces us to a galaxy far, far away, shows us how it has changed over the several decades since Return of the Jedi, and leaves us looking forward to its sequel. (How that worked out, you'll have to read in my view of The Last Jedi)."
1504,8,A promising start to the Sequel Trilogy,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is entertaining, maybe even good, but as a long time Star Wars fan you have to be a bit disappointed. "
1505,7,a fantasy blockbuster lacking ... fantasy and imagination,I don't write a lot of reviews because it seems like a waste of time if I agree with the consensus with nothing new to add. But in this case there seem to be a lot of negative reviews that I totally disagree with.
1506,10,The Best Star Wars Film since Empire Strikes Back,"""A flurry! A superficial but lively work-in-progress is proceeding."" So wrote Norman Mailer in THE SPOOKY ART, his book on writing. STAR WARS was, arguably, the first ""first-person shooter video game-"" before the vg as we know it was even invented (Pac-Man doesn't really count, as the graphics were of the Caveman-wall-painting variety); and STAR WARS: THE FARCE (RE-)AWAKENS is about as close as I'LL ever get to watching a full-blown vg on the Big Screen. Like Mailer, ""I can sit with an empty mind."" But movies are a VISUAL medium and, when the Visuals are un-engaging, all the Moviegoer is left with is the story- which, in this case, is mostly refried beans. Beat for beat, we've seen almost everything here BEFORE. With R2-D2 and C3PO waiting patiently in the wings, why re-create the former in the form of ButterBallBot- just another toy to market; another in an endless line of ""actionless figures"" to send the foolhardy scrambling to the nearest toy store...? If the movie has a single saving grace, it's the Stormtrooper who has had ""a bellyful of killing,"" a disillusioned Hatriot who has tired of the sight (and smell) of Blood. (Of greater interest than his ""sudden conversion"" would've been a sequence- or two- showing him GRADUALLY becoming more and more averse to his occupation as he slaughters innocent after innocent, face to face as they beg for their lives. Or something to that effect. ""I saw The Light"" just don't cut it.) In the final analysis, THE FORCE AWAKENS lacks the Magic of ORIGINALITY (which could be ventured of the entire series but for the first two installments to hit the screen); it's the NEXT installment that will truly tell the tale. (Perhaps my biggest problem with this one was its running time: after 30 minutes of television commercials, the 3 hour running time had me literally draped over my seat in exhaustion.)"
1507,7,The power of the Farce...,"While this film didn't quite cause me to shoot baffled glances, eyerolls, and chuckles with my neighboring theater-goers like the prequels did, it certainly left me feeling underwhelmed and a little embarrassed to have spent money on something so cynically aimed at getting me to do just that. There's just very little new and interesting here, outside of a compelling opening scene which features A) Max Von Sydow, and B) some welcome development on what it means to be a storm trooper. After that first 10 minutes though FORCE AWAKENS sadly goes strictly by-the-numbers, and hits many of the exact same notes that STAR WARS (and yes, I'm aging myself to refer to it not by its episode number) did including Death Star destroying a planet, cantina scene, droid with important data stashed on desert planet, game of holographic claymation chess, heroes sneaking around Death Star lowering shields, etc etc. There were a couple new things, like the first killer CGI tentacle aliens yet in a Star Wars movie, but they come and go so quick that you'll forget about them immediately."
1508,5,"A New American Tradition; Another ""Meh"" Fantasy Blockbuster for Christmas?","This film was boring. There was nothing new in it.<br /><br />Some consider the fact that it was a major movie and yet the actress was so sucky as something new. I don't think so. Most of these new actresses have no talent or formal training and are just here for some mystery. It is not casting couch either. They look terrible and the directors are not strong to begin with.<br /><br />Yes, Star Wars is over and done."
1509,,I am thinking of piercing my ears too,"This was far the best Star Wars film since A New Hope,and Empire. The performances were captivating, and the story follows the Star Wars lore of family. Folks that do not understand this, and are quick to call it a rehash of the originals, clearly don't understand Star Wars as a whole. "
1510,10,Most captivating Star Wars film since the originals! (Minor Spoilers!),"Star Wars: The Force awakens is the latest installment of the Star Wars series. I must say that when I heard,there's a new Star Wars movie coming, I was kinda thinking that it won't get good at all bit I was proved wrong but this film. J.J Abrams did a good job"
1511,9,Exceeded my expectations!,"As a stand alone film The Force Awakens is good fun with enough action, story and old acquaintances to keep you entertained.....where as the The Last Jedi, in stark contrast, is just too slow and boring with new characters that have the charisma of brown cardboard boxes and gaping irreparable plot holes."
1512,8,"The old gang's back together for one last time, good fun. 8/10","There are no spoilers in this, which makes it vague, however if you are going to see the movie this is what you need to know, it's not specifically about the movie, but the experience."
1513,10,"Nearly a perfect masterpiece for fans, fantastic continuation of the old series.","C'mon, we all knew that this film couldn't live up to the high standards the original Star Wars films set. We also all knew that the ""magic"" of the originals wouldn't be largely intact in this new film."
1514,6,"Entertaining, not fantastic.",In my opinion this movie is better than what I expected it to be.
1515,8,"Well done, Mr. Abrams - Thank You!","Despite what some think. I thought it had a good story, until the end. I mean did anyone really buy that Rey just all of a sudden was a Jedi Master, with absolutely no training? Even an injured Kyle should have easily defeated a female scrapper, who had only heard about the force, but had no idea she even had it until days earlier. Or even worse that an ex storm trooper could just pick up a light saber and actually land a hit against someone trained in the force. Ending really stunk. And the "" relationship "" between Rey and Fin, had no substance. I mean why exactly did they like each other that much? All in all, it was slightly above average in my opinion."
1516,6,Wasn't terrible,"You don't need to trawl too far into the internet to realise this film has polarised fans. People are either defending its magnificence to their last breath, or calling it a 'remake in all but name.' A 'bland rehash of already overused ideas.' It doesn't take a genius to realise that Star Wars: The Force Awakens does indeed borrow heavily from A New Hope, and some elements from The Empire Strikes Back. Entire story beats, set-pieces and locations are lifted from the original and moulded into this new story, or even given new names as if we wouldn't notice (Tatooine/Jakku)."
1517,8,"Is this a galaxy far, far away, or somewhere we've already been?",Contains spoilers.
1518,7,"This movie would have been wonderful, if it had been original.","After all those years, you learn that star wars will be back in 2015, you wait for one more year and guess what? you are back in 1977 instead of 2015!"
1519,2,Back to 1977,"The movie's nothing that new. While people may complain that this is very much like Episode IV, people can enjoy the movie as homage to this movie, thus reminding them of why they came here in the first place. If people are unhappy that this is way too similar to Episode IV, those who watched that movie ages ago will likely not remember everything, so it's like a modern rewatch of that movie."
1520,,Enjoyable for what it is,Now I went in the theater with incredibly high hopes. There was no possibility that this could fail. I refused to believe that. And I was right.
1521,9,The New... New hope.,The film is a masterpiece of escapism entertainment and so what if the template was borrowed in part from previous Star Wars movies (especially the original trilogy) – those movies worked!
1522,10,I can feel the hate swelling in you now! A review for the fans.,"There are a lot of new characters where lineages of Jedi and rulers brim with revolution, politics, technologies, and ethics. Technologies have become larger yet more ergonomic during the brief exchanges amongst factions and the pictures from the bird's eye view. The large imperial weapon, awakening of key Jedi figures, and each fighters discovery of new skills and self-confidence seem reminiscent of ""A New Hope""; same strategy, new fighters. If this movie foreshadows relatively similar sequels of drama and action like ""A New Hope"" did, then the next two movies may really squash the box office. Predictable landscapes and battle strategies remain threats to earning the kind of awe and respect which the ""A New Hope"" earned. Each battle, each new Jedi, each inevitable victory for good or bad tilts the scales of justice and power and tests the innocence of the Jedi."
1523,8,Jedi vs Cosmic Despotism,"The Star Wars franchise returns, with the beginning of an all-new trilogy. I have to admit, after the lukewarm reception the prequel trilogy got, I was worried that this movie wouldn't be up to snuff. But boy, was I wrong."
1524,10,Feeling the Force like never before,"Three decades after the events of 'Return of the Jedi', it is up to a young scavenger and a former storm trooper to save the day as the Evil Empire threatens to rise again in this seventh 'Star Wars' film. Whereas 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' suffered from pacing issues and underdeveloped characters, this entry is a well paced, exciting ride and the new characters are excellent. John Boyega is superb the former storm trooper in question and even with his helmet on, his emotions come through his actions as he gradually decides to rebel and flee. His mixed emotions when fleeing are great too; part of him wants to be a hero for once, while the rest of him is humanly scared. Daisy Ridley is even better though, emulating all the youthful enthusiasm of Mark Hamill in the 1977 original and more as her character, Rey, comes to realise unknown powers within her. Promising this sounds though, the plot more often feels like a reboot of the 1977 film than a sequel to it. The trials and tribulations of Luke and Rey are near identical, including coming into possession of a droid with a secret message. Adam Driver also seems uncomfortable playing the equivalent of Darth Vader in black mask no less. He has some unintentionally funny moments as he lets his anger get the better of him, destroying expensive equipment with his light saber (he comes across as a bit of a spoiled brat). For all its drawbacks though, 'The Force Awakens' is difficult not to like. There is a fun new droid on hand, the film includes winks at the prior entries without ever being too cute and the final shot is solid, if an obvious set-up for the next 'Star Wars' to come. Great special effects and spectacular sets do not hurt either."
1525,7,A New Hope Awakens,"The adventure continued with the Star Wars gang! Han is back, as well as Leia, but Luke is not found. This movie surrounds him and his whereabouts. He is the last Jedi. This movie showed how great Star Wars is with the updated technology of movies looks amazing. The story is interesting. Rey being a scavenger and Finn being a run away stormtrooper. Han Solo is great as well. His old character was perfectly captured in this movie. Abrams took Star Wars to a whole new level. Kylo Ren is captured as a real bad guy. He shows darkness as Adam Driver plays it perfectly. I loved this movie inside and out."
1526,9,"I loved this movie, great start to a trilogy.","It has a lot of great elements like amazing acting, cool action, amazing effects, likable characters, emotional moments that sometimes work well, and it's a good return for Star Wars. But it has a lot of problems like a story that's just a new hope all over again (I get that they want to bring Star Wars back in a way that's new but familiar but they could have put something new in the movie), the humor is more hit and miss, a middle section that while fun drags a bit, and Han Solo's death being predictable and unsatisfying. Not amazing but a fun watch."
1527,7,"Pretty good, but needs work","MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS, NOTHING ABOUT THE STORY"
1528,10,Heading back to the Star Wars we know.,"Just watched star wars the force awakens. Incredible graphics, but in terms of story flow and character development, there's nothing like a Spielberg/Lucas film. Too much talking scenes. Unclear goals. Too many parts are taken from episode 4. Again, characters are not well defined . in terms of comedy, there were some good moments with Harrison ford, but not quite like his younger self. Leiahs character wasn't defined as well, just felt like fan service. The force felt like a super power instead of something you learn and tend to. The new Droid didn't do much. Not like r2 where u can see it knows it's stuff. They should get Spielberg on the next one 6.5/10"
1529,6,Nothing like a Spielberg,"Not too good, the cgi was fairly plain to see. The character Snoke should have been replaced by a vision of Darth Vader. It should have suggested the crippling psychological problems this 'dark' character Kylo Ren should have had. The saber, and everything works, sometimes the cgi works. But I'm not watching a cartoon, I thought I'd be reading a star wars tales of the Jedi comic book when I saw the general appeal of the character Rey. Instead I get a Luke sky walker rip-off. Not a gem at all, sure better than the last 3, and entertaining but I know star wars when I see it. And I seen it too much. I would have even approached the comics even more with rise of the dark empire as a prequel, not this..the order is already ruined for the next 2 movies. Why not in the far future? Why is the first movie the last? How in fact does star killer base become a planet? Why not make it a moon, or something I don't know...inhabitable. I think even superman is on board with this one. Not only did Kylo Ren ruin his film career, the whole cast did."
1530,5,After watching this movie...I thought,"I can only imagine how incredibly difficult it must have felt for the writers and visioners of this film to meet the expectations of that stunning amount of Star Wars fans that have emerged during the last decades. Of course, this would be an impossible task, and reading some of the prior comments here on IMDb only confirms that. One reviewer moans about too much resemblance to the original trilogy, apparently thinking that resemblances between the destruction of the death star and the starkiller base justifies a rating below the infamous holiday special. Another reviewer thinks that it's just another Hollywood mass-production and desires more elements found in the trilogy. One wants the sequel to focus on the old characters, others want it to be new and fresh. At least everyone agrees that this film is a remarkable, fresh improvement from the prequel trilogy! "
1531,,If only the prequels were executed like this one...,"I was quite disappointed when I heard that J.J. Abrahams would be directing episode VII of this epic saga after what he did with Star Trek, which even though average as an action sci-fi, was a pretty bad Star Trek; as it had nothing to do with the franchise created by Gene Rodenberry. Therefore, I was expecting the exact same with this movie, but to my surprise what I found was the complete opposite: he kept this movie so faithful to the original trilogy that many of the complaints from the people that didn't like it come from this angle. I personally like that he kept this movie so close to the originals, but I have to admit that the storyline –without getting into spoilers- is almost a remake and the rolls of the 4 main characters can be easily extrapolated to Han, Luke, Solo and Vader. Apart from that, and as well as with the originals, you are going to get a lot of action and fun, likable characters –new and old- and a lot of nostalgic elements and scenes from the original universe; but without being forced down your throat as part of the plot."
1532,8,"Not a masterpiece as the originals, but far better than the prequels","After Return of the Jedi in 1983 we have been asking for more Star Wars movies. What we did not realize was that we never really wanted new Star Wars adventures without Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and especially without the Millennium Falcon. We found this out the hard way in 1999 with The Phantom Menace and the next two chapters."
1533,8,This will begin to make things right.,"After much discussion, we couldn't agree on whether this episode can stand alone. Since one can't un-know what one already knows, it poses a difficult question. I maintain that in order to enjoy this one fully, you have to have a knowledge of the story's history and the relationships between the characters. There are many references to the prior movies and I wonder if someone doesn't know: who Darth Vader is, who are the Jedi, what the force is, what the Death Star was, the relationship between Han and Leia, who Luke Skywalker is, if this movie would make any sense at all. MC is on the side that says you don't have to know any of those things to enjoy the movie. In any event, the new management of the franchise (Disney), has stayed true to the story, the style and the characters and pays all the homage that is rightfully due. The introduction of new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) indicates the series is in very capable and likable hands. Although, with the exception of the aforementioned new characters, there is not a single thing that's new: story-wise, character-wise, action-wise or direction-wise. We've seen it all before. Perhaps they're waiting for the next two episodes for innovation and change. That said, it doesn't detract one iota from the entertainment value. It is well made, well acted and directed. The score was not as rousing as in the previous films and only hinted at here. The action sequences were the same as always. It didn't appear that there was any attempt to create an emotional response, a feeling of excitement, suspense or tension. Is it the best one yet? Not so sure. Also not so sure it lived up to all the hype and anticipation. Score: 8. Go. But I'm not going to force you. (Yeah, I had to.)"
1534,8,Nothing new in the Galaxy,"I caught ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" in 3D at the movie theater. ""Wow"" and ""Outstanding"" come to mind. It had all the formula moves from the original ""A New Beginning"", yet in 3D and better graphics. The 3D effects for the space scenes were outstanding. At one point, one of the space ships seem to come right off the screen and into the theater. The acting is so much better than the last 3 movies. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher do an outstanding job of reprising their roles. The new girl ""Rey"", played by Daisy Ridley, did a terrific job as the new Jedi. I think that Fin, played by John Boyega, has some room to grow, but not bad. The other actors carried him just a bit. Fin, do better next time! There were lots of great cameos from actors that I like; Andy Serkis, Simon Pegg, and Greg Grunberg to name a few. This movie does what a Star Wars movie should; make me want to watch the next one as soon as possible. I feel very confident that this series will be worth watching and adding to my collection."
1535,9,Star Wars done right,"Seeing that I'm more of a Harry Potter fan, after seeing this movie, I feel drawn to it, the actors (new actors) that were chosen were perfect, and I especially love Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver (Rey & Kylo).<br /><br />This movie was rather interesting graphically, and certain scenes would leave me on the edge of my seat. It's rather riveting."
1536,7,What I think.,Second paragraph of this review contains ending fight spoilers*
1537,9,"Everything was great, but the fight at the end was disappointing","I can understand the frustration of people watching this and realising that it's just a remake of the original film. However, I personally think giving this film 1s and 2s out of 10 is ridiculous. It really isn't that bad. There are some good battles in there that are hard to take your eyes off, they supplemented the new characters well with some of the old ones and did touch on the old films very nicely I thought"
1538,7,It's not that bad,"From the start of the intro to the very end of the credits, I had goose bumps all the way. Ignore the hate, because this was in my opinion the best Star Wars movie so far, I just can't wait for Episode 8 and 9."
1539,10,Brilliant!!!!!,I have seen TFA twice now. Both times I came away very impressed with the visuals. TFA is a gorgeous movie to watch. The practical effects mixed with CGI where necessary created a beautiful and believable backdrop for the movie. The fault with the movie lies in the somewhat muddled story that tries to combine the old with the new and doesn't always succeed.
1540,7,Visually Stunning With Muddled Storyline,"This was a disjointed mess! I am not going to spoil anything but only the scenes with Finn and Rey made the least bit of sense. The original cast was so awkwardly used and poorly scripted that it was embarrassing. Carrie Fisher needed to lose about 20 more pounds, it was sad seeing her that fragile and overweight, I felt bad for her."
1541,3,This is not the Star Wars you are looking for...,"When Finn looks up at the sky while on Takodana, he observes the real time use of the First Order's Starkiller weapon, which is being used against a number of Republic Planets. Han also looks up and sees the planets' outlines in the sky. Given that this weapon was being fired from a different star system (with the star of that system providing the power), there is no way for Finn or Han to be able to observe light from the weapon in real time, as the light source would be many light years away. Also, they are supposedly in a different star system to that of the republic planets that were the target of the weapon, therefore there should have been nothing for our protagonists to see at all."
1542,,maran-mantra-specialist-for-enemies,"By no means did I dislike the movie. However, the truth is the truth and the whole movie of the new Star Wars was pretty much a retelling of ""A New Hope."" Just too many similarities. The only problem though is considering this a bad or a good thing. I will reserve judgment with that because of the other new Star Wars (Episode 1-3) where they really went to our minds like a wrecking ball. This similarity in plot could mean a good thing for the next two Star Wars. Like it or not, this Star Wars was definitely ""true to the roots."" "
1543,8,A New Hope Retold Again with Better Graphics,"The main character is introduced sympathetically so the audience can identify with the situation or dilemma. The hero is shown in banal home. Something causes them to be involved in the action. The hero tries to turn away from the adventure however is forced anyway. They then come across a wise traveler who gives training, equipment and important advice. The hero commits to the adventure and faces tests, allies and antagonists. The small group of people go against ridiculous odds to face this evil and confronts death or a great fear. The hero takes skill learned by facing death. At the climax, the hero is severely tested once more. By the hero's action, the polarities that were in conflict at the beginning are finally resolved. See! It's a rip off of a movie in the same franchise! Well, that's not what I'm getting at. What I was really describing was Joseph Campbell's A Hero's Journey, a summary of that structure for many epics. I am astounded by the hate this movie gets. Many people accuse it of being unoriginal when really it is taking a story structure that works and is using it to convey different themes and different characters. This movie is a piece of art with a blend of practical and computer effects. The dialogue is filled with wit and humour, not to mention, it's authentic. The characters work so well together. Han has a whole depth to him putting him above the original's Obi-Wan. His chemistry with Rey as a father figure works so well showing a dynamic we never got in the originals. Finn is entirely original, a Stormtrooper finding his moral place. We haven't seen it and it adds a new dynamic to show The First Order isn't just an army, but a bunch of abducted kids into thinking this way. Kylo Ren is a much deeper villain than Vader. I agree he is whiny, but like Luke in the original, he now has room to grow as a character. It also works seeing how they set him up as being spoiled by power and living in the legacy of Vader. This also sets up Starkiller Base as being believable because he wants to repeat what's been done. This also leads me to my favorite thing. It took a story and used it to convey entirely different themes and moods than the original which are the two most important aspects, when done right. It brought up a good theme of legacy, which also parallels the directors working in George Lucas'. Additionally, there are lots of family dynamics explored bring up what is a good father? Again, we didn't have that in the originals. Another prominent theme was in both Rey and Finn-that of letting go of the past. This worked for me and had the right emotional impact. I admit there are flaws, but much like a Nolan movie, each flaw is there because it was needed to further the plot quickly so they could explore the characters, themes and lets not forget the incredibly well shot and edited action. Because it accomplished these overarching subjects, I take no shame in saying it did what it needed to perfectly."
1544,10,Plenty new themes and characters transcending the flaws.,"I, like many others, was filled with excitement and anticipation for this movie. Even if the last few films were bad, it's Star Wars for god sakes! One of the largest movie franchises makes it's long awaited return, it's bound to spark a lot of attention. But as for the actual movie, was it good? Yeah. Was it fantastic? No. Was it an instant classic like episodes 4-6? Maybe for some, but not for me."
1545,9,A quality edition to the Star Wars franchise,"Spoiler warning If you don't want to see a spoiler, just scroll right on by."
1546,8,Star Wars is Star Wars again,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, but with The Rise of Skywalker coming out I decided to re visit it. This movie is just fun. The whole time you are cheering and on the edge of your seat. However Rey as a character is riddled with flaws. We learn she has potential but we don't see her go through anything to unlock said potential. The action scenes are great but some of the other scenes feel boring and slow. Still, a fun movie. 7.5/10"
1547,7,A Action Packed Way To Get People Back Into Star Wars,"Well I must say that there were some things in this movie that was unexpected, and without going into detail and mentioning any spoilers I will say that I was impressed. I just can't believe that there has been so much negativity about this movie claiming the story made no sense and the acting was horrible. Well I will have to say that I disagree. A New Hope was laid out the same way where you were not left with a whole lot of information until Empire Strikes Back was released, and I think that most people forget about this and how it was to see the first one. All I have to say is watch this one from the stand point that the story is not ever and there is plenty more development of story and characters. I do believe that this will be one of the best trilogies of all time, and it will make all the more sense when the next installment is released. I only have this a 9 instead of 10 because I did feel there was a little more missing or maybe I missed it but who knows but, I can tell you I will be seeing this film a few more times and I'm sure it will be better the second time as you can catch more of the story now that the excitement of the new movie is gone. I will say go see it and if you don't like it, then you do not have any concept of what a good film is. Props to J.J. Abrams for doing this the right way!"
1548,9,So much controversy,"This is the best in the Disney trilogy, but that's not that hard. It's still an enjoyable movie even though it's basically just a rehash of a new hope. This movie set up a good amount."
1549,7,To this day one of the best theatre experiences I've had,"Disney bought Lucasfilm from George Lucas back in 2012 so owned the rights to STAR WARS. This was their first dip into making a new STAR WARS film. Hey, I gotta tell you I loved it as it was really the first time for me since seeing RETURN OF THE JEDI that I was excited about a STAR WARS film. I saw it twice at the theatre which is a rarity. But it does come with flaws."
1550,8,Something Fans of the Old Star Wars Should Enjoy,"Ever seen what seems to be at first glimpse a cool, bad ass, Sith villain in control of an army turn into an annoying, psychotic, nerd with daddy issues and inability to beat a stormtrooper with a lightsaber ?"
1551,6,"Cheese, lots and lots of Cheese ! But very little meat !","Unlike many moviegoers, I couldn't care less about the STAR WARS franchise these days. Sure, I grew up with the original trilogy, which I still know and love, but George Lucas single-handedly destroyed the goodwill surrounding those movies with his mishandling of the prequels. The good news is that THE FORCE AWAKENS - a genuine sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI - is better than the prequels, but only just. Because this is a deeply flawed movie that gets ten things wrong for everything it gets right. While it's a delight to see Harrison Ford effortlessly breezing back into one of his most iconic roles, the rest of the production is a mixed bag of good and bad, of the woeful and the wonderful."
1552,5,Where to begin?!,"I came it with mixed feelings for this film not knowing what to expect. The intro was pretty good, introducing the character of Kylo Ren and Oscar Isaac's Pilot for the resistance character. All in all, the intro was handled well, as was the introduction to the female lead Rey. It hit me that this was going to be a good film when Rey and Finn get in the Millennium Falcon and do their thing to get away from a couple of First Order baddies, I got emotional and from then on it was an emotional roller coaster. "
1553,9,I was prepared to hate this film but I enjoyed it. Emotional Experience.,WARNING SPOILERS 
1554,8,This is a star wars movie. FINALLY!!!!!,"I dislike scoring in absolutes. But I try to give merit to where movies stand relative to what was promised or expected. 'Fury Road' was a great movie, it just was not a Mad Max movie, hence my low score. 'The Force Awakens'? Best Star Wars movie to date. Period. Empire Strikes Back had stronger high points, but this one is more consistently great."
1555,8,True to the franchise,I don't know why this movie has been bagged so much by viewers. Maybe they think their view is more important than the professionals. I think not. This is a fun movie to watch and it follows the tradition and goes back to what the originals are meant to be.. FUN!! 
1556,8,some people have taste in their butts.,This review will eventually contain spoilers but I will give fair warning before they begin.
1557,6,Felt a little disappointed,"For me, this is probably the most easily accessible and entertaining Star Wars movie. From the pacing to the humour and the nostalgia, this is a very easy-to-watch film. One thing that JJ Abrams does really well is that he creates these films that are rollercoaster rides. Every 10 minutes you go up the hill and down through the whole rollercoaster. Even when you're going up the rollercoaster and things slow down there's jokes along the way to keep you engaged. For the most part I enjoy all of the new characters. Poe brings the charisma, Finn gives this very organic and natural energy to the screen, Rey is like the new Luke Skywalker and it's great to see the legacy characters in the film. However, there are a lot of plot conveniences and overused plot points."
1558,9,Most entertaining Star Wars movie!,"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... George Lucas created an iconic movie series that spawned millions of comic books, novels, fan-fiction series, toys, and fan-boy arguments. Sometime later, the Disney corporation decided, ""Hey, this is cool, we wanna own this!"" So, like the greedy sons of bitches that they are--as if they didn't already own enough stuff--they bought Star Wars. The first thing they did after was spit in the faces of the fans who enjoyed the Expanded Universe by rendering it completely non-canon. After that, they said, ""Hey, it's okay, because we're gonna release a new series of films that'll make people forget the Prequel Trilogy."" Personally, my issues with the prequels surrounded Jar Jar Binks and Attack of the Clones. I really didn't see anything else wrong with it, because despite Jar Jar being the worst character in Star Wars, I don't think he should be held responsible for the failures of an entire series, if any. But I digress. Let's dive into this new film and see what Disney has in store for us die-hard fans."
1559,7,Is this a sequel or a reboot?,"Wow! Just seen Star Wars! There's a princess and spaceships and flying around. There's a robot and another robot, three or four robots - a lot of robots, and there's a bad guy in black who has a red sword and they fight, and then they're flying around in spaceships again, and one of them is a stormtrooper who doesn't like being a stormtrooper, 'tho I'm not sure why, and things keep blowing up, and they're walking around in a desert saying ""It's the Force"", and there's an old guy with a beard helping them and a big, round star destroyer thing that all the spaceships have to go and fight. Wow! Another robot! Not too sure what he plot was about, actually. Was there a plot? WOW!"
1560,9,Wow!,Rehashing Star Wars:
1561,7,Eco-friendly Star Wars: Successfully recycles both previous trilogies,"Recently saw the latest ""Star Wars"" (7) exploits, and although it was not quite as disappointing as I had feared, it left much to be desired as a stand-alone film. Through the first 15 or 20 minutes or so, there is really no story whatsoever, just a bunch of unrelated characters jumping around doing things that are also unrelated. In fact, by the time you get to the end of the film, you discover that there was really no story in the first place, only the THREAT of a story based wholly upon the original ""Star Wars"" saga, and what there might be to come. There are some interesting action scenes in the film, which are well-done, but if you remove all the action scenes, you've got about 10 minutes of anything that tries to resemble a coherent, sensible story - maybe. If you never saw the first ""Star Wars"" movies, you would wonder why anyone made this film and what it was about. You have characters you don't know and don't care about doing things you don't understand and don't care about for reasons that are unexplained and you don't care about. It's like one big trailer for some future movie, which it no doubt is - all about the money it makes, and it's made plenty - because everyone was sucked in by this shadow of a ""Star Wars"" story due to its name and the chance to see the original iconic characters in action once again, which you really don't. They could have put the ""Star Wars"" name on anything at all and it would have sold big, which is pretty much what they did. After you SEE the movie, you are left with more questions than before you saw it. Why is there a First Order? Didn't those guys get tired of having their buts kicked twice from the original saga? Don't they know everybody hates them and doesn't want them in power? Why would anyone want to start up another group of power hungry morons? And then, why would anyone follow them? Why does Kylo Ren seem to hate everyone, when he was obviously raised as a person of privilege? Why would Rey want to get involved in this fight, when there is nothing in it for her? And from then on, you can pretty much question why everyone does ANYTHING in the movie, because you never know. Characters run around feeling and doing things that are related to nothing, and we're supposed to get involved in that, except we can't because we have no idea why they're doing it! Everybody GUESSES at who these characters are and why they're doing what they're doing, but we never know! Altogether, this is a hodgepodge of elements thrown together to elicit nostalgia from the audience about the original superbly-done trilogy, but unfortunately this doesn't even come close to that standard. The only credibility it has is in its REFERRING to the original saga, otherwise, on it's own, it's not much of anything."
1562,2,A hodgepodge of elements thrown together to elicit nostalgia of the original trilogy.,Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens focuses on Nostalgia of the original trilogy using elements and aspects from the original trilogy to introduce both old and new characters. 
1563,8,A good mixture of nostalgia and new,"*** NO SPOILERS *** The build up and anticipation for this film is unlike anything I've ever experienced. I was two years old when Star Wars was released and by the time I was 12 had watched the trilogy countless times. As I got older I would revisit them, and marvel at what quality films they were."
1564,9,Feel like a kid again!,"I must say I am very pleased, 10/10 ( Batman:Begins 11/10 )"
1565,10,Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"Just so you understand where I'm coming from with this review, I am a proper Star Wars geek and have seen all of them, most multiple times. I am, however, not an all-out fangirl."
1566,8,"Nice movie, J.J. played it safe... a little too safe, perhaps?","So, it appears that a lot of people don't like this reboot, judging by the first couple of pages of reviews on IMDb. And to be honest, I kind of get it. The thing is, and what a lot of these reviewers seem to forget, was that the original Star Wars was never really a serious film, or particularly well made. But, we all watched it as kids, and we all loved it growing up, as it played with our imagination and showed us something new. Perhaps, what most of us need to do, is be a little childlike when watching Episode VII, and then you might appreciate it a bit more."
1567,7,A Solid Reboot to a Childhood Favourite,This film was at like 9 I believe before 2019 and got a bunch of cry babies scoring it a 1 to bring it down. Wth is going on
1568,10,Why are people trying to bring down the score,"I am not by any stretch trying to bash Star Wars, here, since it is a beloved franchise of mine. However, it falls very short of expectations and I'm not alone in that regard."
1569,7,Rude Awakening,Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
1570,9,An epic achievement,"I came out of the film with mixed feelings, sadly more on the side of the negative than the positive. I was really looking forward to this new release since I saw the first teaser around a year ago. I thought that we could finally restore balance to the force... sorry!, to the saga! after the disaster oft he second trilogy. I really think that it has been a lost opportunity to do so, in spite of JJ efforts. If for true villain of the second saga was no other than Lucas himself, I think that the new Emperor of the dark side is now Disney. To start with the good stuff I can say that visually speaking this one is undoubtedly the best of the whole saga, JJ has done a remarkable job here, probably the best space fighters fights ever known in sci-fi movies, I don't think that a better job could be done here really. There is nothing too wrong with the plot neither, only, if this was the first stars wars movie, which is not. For a 7th episode they really didn't need to constantly go back to the classic material, which makes it all so predictable as well as forced. It really seems to me that most of this plot comes from Disney marketing dept focussing to much on the young audience and the merchandising. Regarding the new faces on this saga, Ridely and Isaac give good overall performances (very much Star wars) while Boyega and Driver are pretty disappointing and, in the case of the first one, truly annoying most of the time. A final comment, I went to the avant premiere (16th of Dec), so, all die hard Star Wars fans at the screening, well, not a single clap at the end of the film..."
1571,6,Some of the best with some of the worst of Stars Wars,"I went to see this on day one - expecting great things, yawn."
1572,5,The force flops,J.J. Abrams did an amazing job with this movie. I find it a lot of fun and a really enjoyable watch. I love all the new characters introduced and find the stories of Rey anf Kylo Ren particularly interesting. I also love how they have introduced the new characters and built up the mystery surrounding Luke Skywalker. The film is stunning and the use of practical effects breathtaking. What an achievement.
1573,8,Such a fun time,"I just do not. I am a real American MAGA man. So i watched Star Wars. I am not a lifelong fan or whatever, but we decided to watch a movie for the Holidays. Well, this sucked. It was stupid. Not only the characters and how they are affected was jumbled and illogical the acting was terrible. Who are these actors and actresses? Where is the skin? Show me some action."
1574,,I Simply Don't Like Masculine Short-Haired Chicks With A Chip On Their Shoulders,Ranking- 8.0 This Film was just great when I watched it I felt soo good about it mostly when I saw Han Solo in it I remember from the other films when he was in it. This film just shines in a way that people would love it. This Film is like Star Wars Episode 4 but a bit different. This is my second favourite Star Wars Film and it was spectacular
1575,8,What a Film,"I already knew from the beginning that when I walk out of Star Wars, I wouldn't be disappointed. And I was right. The plot is kind of Star Wars-like. The Imperial time has repeated itself. A lone sand-digger Rey(Daisy Ridley) is trying to earn cash. Together with the R2-D2-like robot he runs into Finn (John Boyega), who turned down the route of a Storm Trooper, who has escaped with the pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac)."
1576,9,The film is really good looking.,"So finally the wait is over. I waited so long for this movie. After watching the trailer, I couldn't wait for movie to be released. When i watched it, this movie exceeded my expectation. I hope the same will be felt for all other fans. I have watched all 6 star wars movies. Every one of them is my favorite. To speak about story. story-line is great. Screenplay is superb. CGI effects are mind-blowing. Acting part is also good. Harrison ford is great actor. Daisy Ridley has performed her character well. All of the action scenes are great. A must watch movie. Cant wait for another movie. I can watch this movie again and again. There is not much noticeable cons in this movie."
1577,10,Awesome ! Enjoyed a lot.,"With all the built hype around this new episode of the beloved space-opera, it is safe to say that if your expectations come near as immoderate, you shall assuredly meet with disappointments. First of all, I have to admit, that I am not a hater of the latest George Lucas trilogy, neither consider it as something special. These prequels were admittedly well made CGI feasts, very long and child- friendly at some point (The Phantom Menace), but also essential and very committed to the tale that had to be told: the morbid seduction of the dark Force. Within the years, these add-fillers to the saga, gave birth to a permanent lack of satisfaction for these movies and became the routine of an established complaint towards Luca's lost vision and doubt of his skills. Firstly as a storyteller and secondly as a filmmaker. "
1578,6,If only I had more time (and mood) for whining...,I enjoyed the movie. I don't care what other think it was good to me.
1579,9,Enjoy,Not a huge fan of star wars but I have seen the original series many times as a kid and saw all the prequels in the cinemas upon release. My personal opinion on this movie is that it did not meet the hype that it generated - not even close and that to me is quite a disappointment.
1580,6,A paint by numbers continuation of the Star Wars universe,"I really cant stand the hate about this movie. I've been a fan of star wars since a child and sincerely loved this movie.It is a love letter to true fans and anyone who wanted the revival of a soulful star wars movie, which in my opinion lacked the punch in the prequels. JJ Abrams did a wonderful job on this movie and I'm looking forward to the other two, (never rated a movie on IMDb before, but saw the backlash and had to share my opinion). Also, this movie is not afraid to take new bold directions which left doors open for the trilogy to take off to some interesting ideas. I myself was very surprised at all the twist and turns this movie took which left my jaw on the ground. Who is supreme chancellor snook? Who are Rey's parent's? Why is Rey so in tuned with the force? The groundwork has been laid and what a foundation to build from."
1581,10,A lot of hate for a great movie,It's absolutely hack unimaginative re-telling of the original films but it's pretty fun and has some great looking scenes. Rey is boring and Finn's comedy is bad but I think Kylo Ren is an unorthodox villain which is pretty cool.
1582,6,Good but super tame,"There is only few things which work in this movie - lead actress is on top of her role, and scenes where she gets Luke's saber and last scene when she hands it over to him. And, I can say intro scene was decent."
1583,1,"Huge disappointment. If Lucas seriously wounded the franchise, Disney killed it totally.","A long time ago in a galaxy not too far away, a young American director created a sci-fi epic which went on to become a cultural icon. A universe was created that captured the imagination of film goers across the globe. And the merchandising that accompanied this mid 70's blockbuster was spectacularly unprecedented. Sequels (and prequels) followed, generating more money than what is probably collectively owed by the Third World. When Disney forked out $US4 billion to own the franchise, it should have come to no surprise to anyone that a shed load of films would follow, along with all the hype, the merchandising, theme park rides, console games and goodness knows what else. The first step in this new journey has been taken, and the first offering for this current generation has been delivered, with predictably stunning financial results, and generally positive reviews."
1584,,The force is just hanging on in this one,"So here's the thing.... Abrams made a very decent Star Wars movie, with a great story line, with a strong male lead and a strong female lead. Yes, it certainly had elements of A New Hope, but that is to be expected because we have a new villain who had to be introduced, and new characters."
1585,8,Great Star Wars Movie,"Let me tell you i felt that for sure. This film is a well crafted example of what i expected from star wars' new installment. The first half of the film was good . It was not excellent but it still was more than building up of characters . This new installment of star wars gave you tears and joy and is full of emotions. This is the most Human Star wars in the whole series. I could see the emotions in the eyes of Kylo Ren , the inside conflict that resided in him. The conflict between good and evil. Don't listen to the other reviews which says that this is the exact replica of star wars episode 4. But let me tell you this this film had everything that episode 4 didn't. I mean this is one of the best introduction of a villain . i really liked the actor who played kylo ren. i liked daisey ridley, john boyega in their respective roles . the starting of the second half is somewhat repetitive but the climax is mind blowing . AGAIN there is a DEATH STAR. I didn't particularly like the death star story but still everything else was in its place. so let me tell you don't listen to those mumbo jumbo freaks who write wrong reviews but go and watch star wars and you will come out of the theatres with joy that you have felt in a long time. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU."
1586,10,There has been an Awakening. Did you feel it ?,"Star Wars could have been a repetitive boring film. Yet it was saved by the incredibly gifted and beautiful actress Daisy Ridley. I'm surprised she was not given supreme credit, for Daisy is the driving force in this film. She is the ultimate hero! The force is definitely with Daisy Ridley. What is so amazing about Ridley is that she would have seemed so miscast for the part of Rey. At first glance Ridley looks very much like a young Audrey Hepburn, and has a British accent that could be tailored for Shakespearean roles. Yet Ridley triumphs and makes the character Rey hers and Ridley rules this film. She injects fresh new life into the Star Wars films, something that was sorely needed. She should have been nominated for an Academy Award for her captivating performance. Yet alas sci-fi films don't receive acting awards. A shame. This is one instance where an award should have been handed to Daisy Ridley."
1587,8,Ridley rules!!,Guys... I feel the need to write this review because of all the ridiculous amounts of 1-4 star reviews people are giving this. I'm rating it 10/10 because honestly I loved this movie and there was nothing wrong with it.
1588,10,Awesome... Why all the hate?,"Whether (or rather how much) you will like the latest Star Wars instalment (Episode VII: The Force Awakens) will largely depend on how old you are or how much you liked the original. A lot of people hated the 'prequels.' I did, too. But then I was born the year the first Star Wars came out and grew up through the eighties on the exploits of Han, Luke and Leia. Therefore, when episodes I, II and III came out, they really couldn't live up to the originals. I felt – like many – that they relied too much on computer special effects and the characters were just two dimensional."
1589,7,The Force is still pretty strong with this one,"First a little history. The first three movies (SW1-3 :: 1977-1983) are about episodes 4-6. The second three movies (SW4-SW6 :: 1999-2005) are about episodes 1-3. Got that? In my world Star Wars fans are split down the middle: some prefer the first three movies while others prefer the second three. There is no right or wrong here it's just a matter of preference (eg. some people hate Jar Jar Binks while others hate the Ewoks; some loved watching Yoda training Luke on Dagobah while others preferred the martial arts of Darth Maul; some thought the first three were targeted at kids while others thought the politics of the second three made them more appropriate for adults). IMHO, SW7 is better than the first three and at least on par with the second three."
1590,8,SW7 is worth watching,"The Force Awakens marks the true return of the Star Wars saga. Packed with high visual effects, a cohesive story and a hard ending, this is a movie worth seeing in theatres."
1591,6,"Decent popcorn movie. Better than the prequels, not Empire or Return.",Firstly this review will NOT SPOIL the film in terms of plot.
1592,8,A Step in the Right Direction,"The film gets a seven and not a 5, 6 because I am a fan and this film has attended to and dressed the wounds of the pre-quills. "
1593,7,go see it I don't think you will be disappointed but equally you probably will go only the once,"On a dry, desert planet a small, rolling droid conceals information vital to the Rebellion and is hunted by Storm Troopers from the Empire. The droid is discovered and protected by a teen named Luke Skywalker. Whoops! That's the plot of the first Star Wars movie. This movie is completely different. The teen is female and her name is Rilo Kiley. The droid is called Rolling Beach Ball 8 (RBB8) instead of R2D2. The Empire is called the First Order and the Rebels are called the Resistance. You can see it's completely new."
1594,5,The Farce Aweakens,"I am so happy to say Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is every bit the sequel that the original trilogy deserves."
1595,9,*Some Spoilers* Star Wars is back.,"Let me get one thing straight as I am writing this review for all online users to read. I don't ""like"" Star Wars, I... fricken... ""Love!"" Star Wars. Star Wars has played a huge part in my upbringing, being born in 1990 I was exposed to the original films on VHS at a very young age and since then couldn't look back as I simply jumped a almost everything Star Wars. Also to some of you reading this may think, yes I was very young at the time and was easily fallen victim to enjoying what came next, 'The Special Editions' and the 'Prequels'. Now, I might not hold the most popular opinion to say the least 'I couldn't necessarily care less about the various changes George Lucas made to his films', even if that was the most complete version(s) of the films he made. Even with the Prequel Trilogy I definitely enjoyed them when I was growing up in the noughties. Looking back on them now (as an adult) I fully acknowledge they're certainly not the best films ever made, neither are they the worst (and can certainly understand why a certain generation was disappointed by them). So really..This franchise has always been my greatest source of sci- fi/fantasy escapism, I've lost count how many times I've seen all films. There was even a time between then and now I was obsessed with a load of the expanded universe material such as various novels, comics and video games, etc I may have collected."
1596,9,A New Beginning to a New Arc 'A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far Far Away...',They are from tasteless imbeciles that want to corrupt and sully us.
1597,10,Ignore the negative reviews,"30 years after the defeat of the galactic Empire, two young strangers unexpectedly cross paths and must work together with the rebel forces to defend the universe from a new sinister threat."
1598,9,A Force To Be Reckoned With,"For devout fans of the original Star Wars movies, the Star Wars franchise has truly shifted to the ""dark side"" with the reintroduction of the saga to the up and coming post-modern millennial generation. The hand-off of Lucasfilms by George Lucas to Disney only a few years ago yielded a new Star Wars product thus ""completing the circle"" by driving a spike into the hearts of the optimistic devout fan base. True commercialism, mass-production, and new-aged political correctness can now rule the day! Anyone familiar with 'The People Vs. George Lucas' documentary can understand the angst of the original Star Wars fan base toward the bastardizing of their beloved film by their beloved director. Many old-school fans identified with Star Wars on a 'religious' level as a coming of age tale of well-defined good versus evil in which the main character is on a quest to find himself, fight the evil empire, make peace with his past, heal himself as well as his father, and ride off into the sunset! This was the expectation of a movie set in the end of the ""modernist"" era: clear character development, strong motives, excellent plot, and breath-taking settings. The fans at that time could closely identify with a film like this, and as history would prove they did in record numbers. This same generation that had high expectations was then let down with the Star Wars prequels as they realized that not only their beloved story, but also the film industry, and American society had changed from the world they once knew. A laundry list of complaints were heard round the world as noted in the documentary 'The People Vs. George Lucas'. They were the wrong films, at the wrong place, at the wrong time! "
1599,6,Star Wars for Millennials,"Oddly humorous at times, three unknown actors hit it out of the park. Daisy Ridley was a charming and exceptionally talented Rey. The new characters give us a lot of story to look forward to going forward. While fan theories abound with regard to back story, we were more than satisfied with what was revealed in this chapter. Great to see old favourites and frequent Abrams collaborators. I have only one criticism, and that is the new friends seem to form a very strong bond over a short time. This may be explained later, however, here it does not make sense. There should have been more history shared by our original characters in order to work this kink out. Solid showing by JJ with full respect paid to the franchise."
1600,9,Fantastic New Chapter,"Its taken two reviews to have any chance to comprehend a review on this film. No movie has been more hotly anticipated in my memory (having been six when Phantom Menace came out) and as such I needed to see whether the positives held up on second viewing or were just positive from nostalgia. The answer is that the positives are very positive, whilst the negatives are negative but don't ruin the movie. I could make strong comparisons to Sicario and The Grand Budapest Hotel in my taste for this movie - superbly crafted and perfect across the board in every sense but the story. More on that later."
1601,6,Gorgeously crafted but a little too safe,"This movie takes place 30 years after Return of the Jedi, and a lot of things have happened. You'll see new characters and familiar ones too."
1602,10,My review for Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"Not bad, definitely worth checking out but I struggle to find Rey to be an interesting character."
1603,6,Not bad but I find Rey to be a weak and bland character.,The only reason I give this anything above a 1/10 rating was simply for the fact that it was star wars to a certain point. 
1604,5,"In a more intelligent galaxy far far FAR away, Abrams would have been outed after star trek.","First off this title is mainly pointed at myself because although I grew up loving the original 3 star wars, but was lost at the prequels and the franchise just became a chapter of my past. I am sure some can relate, but needless to say once I found out Star Wars was coming out with another movie I got all nostalgic and excited in hopes of it capturing my inner child again. I am going to try and write this review as I do so many without giving any spoilers because in all honesty if you even remotely liked Star Wars at any point this is a movie worth seeing. I am not going to give you a synopsis or any character details, just the meat and potatoes as to what made this movie great for me. What I really enjoyed about this movie is that is had that old feeling that the original 3 had, but at the same time introducing you to a new story that I am hopeful will be explained over the next how ever many movies they make. A lot of reviews are giving crap that this is just a reboot of the first Star Wars filled with plot holes and what not. I saw it as something that grabbed pieces form the original that made it so great and recognizable while bringing forth a new story that would leave the viewer wanting more. You get new and old faces, and a plot that sprinkles in a lot of details from the original episodes. I mean they kept so true to all the details that even Chewbacca with old age had fur that looked like a mature dog that has some seen some crap, which I though was awesome. The visuals were unreal, and I found myself so many times with just a smile on my face when we were soaring along side x-wings and TIE fighters. Lets just put it this way, I went to see it with my girlfriend who only saw the original star wars, and bits of Episode one, and she left the theater enjoying it almost as much as me. It has a story that I think was made the way it was to also capture a new generation of star wars. The kid or adult that can watch it, enjoy it, and want to go back and watch all the original ones to really appreciate this work of art. Don't get me wrong there were times where I sat there and got a little bored, and questioned a couple of things, but it was not enough to have me sit here and say well this is a monumental disappointment. At the end of the day I loved it though, and highly recommend to go see it, especially in Imax 3D. We have a new evil villain, and new hero, and a whole new story that I can not wait to get into further and have more questions answered. I 100% plan on seeing it a second time, maybe even a third or Fourth, and Star Wars has once again not only captured my attention, but my inner nerd child as well."
1605,9,Amazing movie for a mediocre fan,This movie is on par with the original trilogy. The new characters fit in perfectly. Kylo Ren is an amazing character. Harrison Ford returns to perfect form giving a great performance. The story line opening is the best that could have been chosen. Maybe only downfall would be there isn't any character theme music such as the great imperial march. The ending leaves u wanting more and is set up for a great story line. Jj Abrams u are a genius mixing new and old elements.There is a good sense of humour in this movie to with plenty of laughs. Another great character sure to be loved is Poe. The new new main characters Fin and Ray have perfect star wars charisma.
1606,10,Perfect,"Bare with me please, I am going to give some background on myself and my personality, so that you can understand why I rated the movie and what I expected of it. This review contains NO actual spoilers!"
1607,8,We got the movie we deserved,"Was great to see the old blend in so nicely with the new and give us the star wars movie we have been waiting for. Was it perfect? was it the best Star Wars movie ever? well only time will tell I guess but one thing for sure, it was one hell of a fun ride. Went with my 12 year old son and he loved it to as well as the rest of the crowd in the theatre. Everyone clapped when the credits rolled."
1608,10,Fantastic addition to the Star Wars saga!,"If you like Star Wars, you're going to love this movie. That aside though, if you're looking for a good family movie that appeals to grown-ups and kids alike, but without any cringy silliness, but also (by nature of being a family movie) without overly sophisticated plots, then go enjoy this movie!"
1609,7,Well done continuation - just like a Star Wars movie is supposed to be,"About the controversy of ""instant Jedi"", I would like to offer my theory or explanation for non-believers: 1. Rey's power had been awaken for the first time when she touched Luke's saber."
1610,10,Jedi Rey,"This is a decent film. It successfully wipes the slate clean of Episodes I-III. It brings us back most of the characters from Episodes IV-VI that we loved while handing the baton over to the next generation. And most importantly, it ""feels like"" a good Star Wars film. It focuses on broad emotions instead of scientific reality. "
1611,6,"Captures the feel of a good Star Wars movie, but lacks originality","And that's what The Force Awakens does...over, and over, and over again."
1612,10,First rule of marketing: Give the customer what he wants,"I would just like to put it out there, that I am not what you would call a 'fan' of Star Wars. So for fans, I guess you can stop reading now. I do not actually think I have watched a full Star Wars film before now, thus, I do not get the references or who the characters are. This review then, would be from a point of view of a casual viewer. "
1613,7,"Great visuals and interesting characters, but a generic narrative.",....as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in terror....and demanded their money back.
1614,4,I felt a great disturbance in The Force....,"Spoiler Free Review: I laughed many times, in a good away. I got choked up a few times. I marveled at the wreckage from prior battles. I laughed some more, especially at one of the new characters - actually 2 of them made me laugh quite a bit. I mulled over new relationships revealed and still not yet revealed to us. I wanted to stand up and cheer at times (others did). I left feeling set up perfectly for the next film. Overall it was a fantastic time at the movie theater - which is what i hope for with a movie like this. It has a closer feel to the original trilogy, yet in a league all it's own - not better or worse - just different. "
1615,9,Great Fun,"OK, so I was not disappointed much. I do wish that the original story line was followed. It seems as if this version was intended for the new generation who possible know little about previous works. I fell in love with star wars in the 90's."
1616,,Not a huge disappointment,"Sometimes, when I write a movie review, I struggle to find a starting point. Some movies require a little background or description to help illustrate my points. It can be a pain if the movie is bad or convoluted. It's worse in the case of the latter because I risk giving away too much of the plot. Fortunately for me, Star Wars: The Force Awakens does not fall into these categories. I don't have to say very much at all about the plot to recommend it to you. In fact, I don't think I'll even go into the plot at all for my review."
1617,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens was awesome; you don't have to be a Star Wars fan (you don't even have to have seen any of the other movies) to enjoy it.,"I went to the theatre this morning to go and see the new Star Wars film, and overall, I really enjoyed it. There were so many parallels not just within the story, with all the references to the older films in this one, but also just because of J.J. Abrams directing this film, like he did with rebooting the Star Trek films. This new Star Wars had more witty comments than any of the others, just as the Star Trek ones did. I enjoyed the new characters, and especially seeing how the trio from the original trilogy (eventually) all showed their faces here. The introduction with Poe and Finn leading into Finn meeting Rey and BB8 was a nice way to lead into the next generation of the franchise (both in the characters and in the fans!), and then bringing back Han, Chewie, Leia, C3PO, and R2-D2 later on was a nice way of having the adventure follow Finn and Rey and keeping long-time fans to wait for their favorite characters to show. The visuals were of course very nice - we've come a long way since 1977. It was an enjoyable story - Abrams was careful to keep it in the style and vein of what George Lucas would have done, yet it's done differently to suit Abrams' personal style. "
1618,8,A fantastic new film with a great new Williams score!,"I just came from seeing STAR WARS VII! Before I get started, I'd just like to point out that I have never seen a movie with as much hype behind it in my life! Disney has really pulled out all the stops and spared no expense in stoking the flames of this release. With all the merchandising and third party tie in's from makeup to jewelry to breakfast cereal to (no lie) oranges, this movie is set up to possibly be the biggest movie of all time! As a matter of fact, it's so set itself up that if it's anything less than that some will look at it as a failure. Directed by Hollywood powerhouse J.J. Abrams, the director of the Star Trek reboot, this new Star Wars movie seeks to blow more wind into the sails of the biggest film franchise of all time and wash the taste of the ill fated prequels from the mouths of Star Wars fans everywhere. So what does that mean for you, John and Jane Q. Movie-goer? Well, it typically means one of two things, either it is in fact the greatest movie ever made or it's a rotten piece of garbage that the studio is hoping for big numbers for in the first few weeks before people realize that it stinks on ice. Well folks, I've just come from the theater and I have to say that without a doubt, Star Wars delivers! Just to give you a bit of a background, the last time we we heard about the saga going on in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance had just defeated Darth Vader the evil Emperor Palpatine. The story in Star Wars VII takes place some 25 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire where out of the ashes of the now defunct empire a new evil has emerged in the form of The First Order, an oppressive force bent on destroying Luke Skywalker and his group of Jedi Knights who have since gone into hiding. At the same time a faction of the Rebel Alliance known as The Resistance seeks to find Luke and fight The First Order. This story is centered around The characters Rey and Finn, two misfits, played by relative Hollywood newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega and their journey to help The Resistance find Luke Skywalker at any cost. I'd love to tell more, but given the nature of this film, it's best to leave the details of the plot alone. Let's just say that they, along with Oscar Issac, who plays the hot shot X-Wing pilot Poe, do a great job of breathing some much needed new life into this franchise. At the same time, Domhnall Gleeson, Adam Driver and Andy Circus are famously evil as the quasi-Nazi First Order. This movie is not all new blood however, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and all your favorite Star Wars heroes like Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 make appearances here and they work well to provide balance between the old and the new in the film."
1619,9,Everything old is new again,"Back in 1977 I enjoyed the original Star Wars, all six passable follow-ups since have only left me wondering why I bothered with them. This time, for the last time."
1620,7,For the kids,"I watched it in the first 2D screening and i was really happy about how it went. Was it perfect ? NO! Was the original movies perfect ? NO! But was is a good Star Wars movie ? YES!!! I am still not sure where to put it but when i go after my ranking where i gave it a 8,7 it would be my 2nd favorite star wars movie after empire strikes back. Sure you can say you see a lot of the things coming, and they pretty much remade a new hope for some people but to be honest thats what we wanted. We all cried about the prequels and wanted the old star wars back and thats exactly what we got. A Harrison Ford who was PERFECT in this movie, i really hate this old fake characters but he having to wait 30 years to see this movie makes it so nice so ... well working. it wasn't him wanting a paycheck he really nailed han solo 30 years older. A lot i was scared of was done really well and the actors again was amazing. I saw it in German so i cant tell you about the English voices but the music the sound was amazing. Overall when i read a lot of the bad reviews here i see either people who wanted the best movie of all time not even recognizing the mistakes the old star wars movies had, or people cry about its to similar to star wars ... i don't get them sry."
1621,10,a perfectly fine movie which is STAR WARS,"JJ Abrams ""rebooted"" Star Trek (he admitted to knowing ALMOST nothing about the Trek universe). Fanfare, box office hit. And he and his script writers almost destroyed what Roddenberry, Braga and others did through the years."
1622,6,"A JJ Abrams product: a solid buiding, empty inside",I'm a Star Wars movie fan. I grew up in the '80s and caught the original films on video. I anticipated and enjoyed the release of the prequel trilogy. And when I sat down to watch The Force Awakens I was immediately brought back into a state of childhood wonder where heroes are common people who put aside their selfish wishes for the sake of the greater good. 
1623,9,A New Frontier in the Star Wars Saga,"It is a good movie, except it is not a good star wars movie like the original trilogy. )) There are too much coincidence that I found really annoying. Another death star (again). Another father son issue (again) but in reverse mode now OK. It took 3 movies to make a Jedi training on the original, half a movie on this one and 75 second on the next one. Really easy anybody can achieve it... Exactly why the trilogy ends because it becomes boring."
1624,7,has everything except a good story telling,"The new Star Wars episode, The Force Awakens has broken box office records around the world in ways that even the producers had not anticipated. Undoubtedly, the whole saga is part of our modern cultural phenomenon, in which parents and kids can enjoy together. So, it should be expected that ingrained perceptions have filled multiple thematic voids in this latest version of Star Wars."
1625,5,Buffet of special effects and disjointed drama plot that many people still like,"HAAAAAAAAA!!!! i just came back from watching this movie on opening day and my adrenaline is still pumping. Acting, dialogue, fight scenes were fantastic! "
1626,9,Emotions,All this negativity on review pages just made me write my first review ever :) 
1627,10,"Great fun, good return of the franchise","So, my daughter and I just came out of Star Wars. My short summary is it is a perfect mix of old and new, and an excellent movie, probably one of the top 10 movies I've seen in 5 years or more."
1628,10,"What movie did all the naysayers actually see? Don't listen, it is great!","A lot of the criticisms have merit, but some people seem to think that this had to be the best Star Wars movie ever - or else, in their minds, it had to be the worst. I don't understand why anyone would have expected a completely new story, thematically. Heck, the entire prequel trilogy was a hyper-extended foregone conclusion - this is the way of the Star Wars universe. "
1629,8,"Not perfect, but brought the fun back to SW","Impressive visuals, real blockbuster action, good acting and great jokes(when all preveios episodes had problems with all on the list), And also Star Wars Franchise(which had just 1 good movie(New Hope(thank you Harrison Ford, for playing for 2 others main non-actors))) got a fundamental scale increase. But it has problems with narration, main character, repeating motives and also a number of problems with character's motivatons and skills. With couple of quick and small improvements i would instantly give this picture one more star. Sorry, but partly messed up scenario and primitivity makes this movie just a good blockbuster. For an average person, who likes blockbusters and space operas, this movie should be 10/10. I was casual viewer once, casual person..."
1630,6,Episode VII just better then all previous episodes.,"When the ending credits rolled across the screen, I was shaking my head with disappointment. Too many plot holes, too many similarities to the original trilogy and rushed scenes make the movie a bit lackluster due to all the good reviews."
1631,9,The movie gets better the more you think about it,"Like a visit to an old friend, watching ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" fills one with nostalgia and provides a feeling of comfort. We have been here before, with the familiar plot lines and the usual environments. There's even a cantina scene."
1632,7,Some Old Friends And Some Old Stories,"Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens is a much waited film by the Star Wars fans. The film brings back its old cast - Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, and new cast like Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. Has the movie lived up to its hype and expectation? Oh yes it has."
1633,9,The Force Awakens - Review,"""The Force Awakens"" is a movie that unabashedly pampers to fans of the first trilogy and of Star Wars in general with lots of references, winks and I-think-I-have-seen-this-before moments that, depending on your view, will be deeply enjoyed or make you seethe in desperation."
1634,7,The nostalgia is strong with this one,"This critic may contain spoilers, so if you haven't watched the movie don't read it, from this point on is your responsibility, you have been warned."
1635,3,It didn't disappoint as I expected to be crappy,Definitely had that nostalgic star wars feel to it. The new actors were gfreat and the movie looked great as well.
1636,10,Great Movie,"What if the original Star Wars was made in 2015? The answer to that question is The Force Awakens. Quite similar in many ways to A New Hope, I really enjoyed this one. We get introduced to some great new characters (Poe is the best) as well as seeing the return of some of our favourite older characters, who are certainly older now. Different enough from ANH to stand on its own, this was a great entry in the series in my opinion that tries to recapture some of the magic from the originals"
1637,8,I enjoyed it,"This film generates interest in the minds of fantasy lovers from all generations. You do not need to be a fan of Star Wars to experience the hysteria and utmost joy that this movie allows a movie goer to appreciate. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not simply a movie created for the box office, nor was it created for Star Wars fans. This movie is the seventh installment for the hype that Star Wars has developed over the years. Star Wars: The Force Awakens proves yet again that cinema is not just a movie, but a culture. This movie allows all of its audience to remain on the edge of their seats and experience a roller coaster of emotions in each and every scene. It is one small step for a Star Wars movie, and one giant leap for all of movie making."
1638,10,Out of this world!,"I hope they link the next movie with the classic trilogy but also with the prequels, they have good points as well."
1639,8,I a mixed feeling about this,"OK, so I went to see it again. This time in 2d. Much better viewing and much better audience. After seeing this once and writing the review below I went back and read a few things, then went to watch again. STill have some issues with some parts but was much more enjoyable in 2d. Ready for the next one so the story can really begin. "
1640,7,Was this a bad fan film?,... They killed the force.
1641,,"JJ Abrams ANd Kathleen Kennedy Had Their Grand Premier Ball, But...","It was a really good movie, and it had a lot of humor and action,"
1642,8,"Awesome, But too similar to a new hope","So, the behemoth franchise Star Wars have produced another sparkly 2 hour long advert for their never ending range of merchandise, media and memorabilia.."
1643,7,Overplays the nostalgia card,"Ignore all the complaints on here. They are from people that have idolized Star Wars so long that the original trilogy have become a 20/10 movies, so when they get a 10/10 they trash on it. Ignore all the people that call it a ""Remake"" of episode 4, it's no more a remake than Episode 6 was."
1644,10,"Star Wars returns, for the first real time since the 80s..","I saw this movie in 3D IMAX, and it blew me away. You surely can't get any nearer to taking part in space battle than this. It was so captivating at the time that I didn't really think about the plot, or the back-story, or the acting. I came out of the cinema wanting to go straight back in and watch it again, and it's not very often I can say that. In fact, if it wasn't so stupidly expensive (£60 for a family of four? Sheesh!) I might have done just that. This is exactly the kind of thing that cinema was invented for."
1645,7,"What cinema is for (but why not just call it a remake, and have done with it?)","This is exactly what Terry Gilliam means, when he says, quit film school now, and go out and live life. J.J. Abrahams (Alias, which was great, but in hindsight one dimensional) finally falls through, and is exposed as a one dimensional director, with no real intellect to tell a good story. And, be careful, major spoiler alert: killing of Han Solo! Hello!? You just don't do that. You want to pretend to be original and daring by killing of a major Star Wars character, kill bad actor Mark Hamill (please don't kill him either), or kill Princes Leia (please don't kill her either), getting Han and Luke on a rampage, but you never kill Han. Han is un-killable. Especially the way this was done. The guy who shoots a bounty hunter, without a warning, gets mercilessly killed by his son!? I think not. And then what happened to the Storm Troopers who are supposed to be all clones? And now there is a black storm trooper who defects? Wow, who wrote this? The original storm trooper was also black, or colored, and I thought that was awesome (I mean he was Boba-Fett! how cool is that!?), but storm troopers don't defect, that is against all the George Lucas rules. And let's get one thing straight, Star Wars Part IV was not bad, mainly due to Alec Guiness and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) and the tension between Ford, Hamill and Fisher, but the real deal was Empire, NOT directed by Lucas. Empire was character driven... Hello! Wow, could this have been a 10 times better movie. What a loss. The only good thing, which gets lost in the one-dimensional acting (due to the bad script) and bad, bad, horrible story, is the non CGI special effects."
1646,1,"Great special effects, terrible story.","First of all, there's a lot of whiny, know-nothing, 'think-they're-fan-boy' nonsense written on here, that is to the word 'Review' what Bieber is to 'Music'. Take the hostile responses and the gleeful 'Its amazing!!' gush out of here, and what you're left with is probably quite accurate.. Overall, Id give it a solid 8/10. The introduction of the new characters is very good. They're rounded characters; Finn came across as funny, but not entirely likable, which was interesting. Not your indentikit 'hero'. Rey on the other hand is likable, and it was quite easy to find yourself rooting for her in much the same way you did for Luke Skywalker originally. By the end of the film, enough of her story is missing to suggest that the next couple of films will reveal a lot more of interest about her. Kylo Ren proved to be different kind of bad guy - some will criticise him for being tantrum -prone, but this is no Anakin of the prequels - he is plenty ruthless and sinister when he wants to be. It would also have been too easy to make him a facsimile of an iconic villain like Vader. Some media have suggested he could be more iconic than Vader - I wouldn't go that far, but he's definitely promising, and certainly a worthy villain to rank alongside Maul, Dooku, and the rest."
1647,8,"Amazing? Not quite, but it is VERY good.",Apparently the people below me decided to take their pen and clipboards to the theater to judge the movie while they watched it instead of just watching it and enjoying and judging it the second time around. I saw the movie three times and all three were just as equally fun. 
1648,10,"Well, if no one is going to defend this movie from the haters below I guess I will","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an excellent continuation of the classic Star Wars films we have grown up loving. The film is very character driven and this time follows the characters Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) as well as the classic characters of Star Wars. All of the acting is superb! It showcases the perfect blend of new and old cast to tell a great well rounded story. Unlike most blockbusters these days, there was meaning behind the awesome action shown in the movie. The villain of the film: Kylo Ren, portrayed by Adam Driver, was menacing but at the same time very believable. "
1649,8,The Legacy of Star Wars,"Star Wars:The Force Awakens has been one of the most hyped movies of all time, and it does a nice job living up to the hype that was given to us. JJ Abrams sets up a world for other directors to make into a world for all generations. It is not a perfect movie but there are no movies that are perfect ever."
1650,9,A great start to a brand new trilogy of Star Wars movie to enjoy for many years.,"this movie has great action and effects, and the new characters are interesting enough that I look forward to seeing what happens to them in the future. the beginning is fantastic, and for the most part the first 45 minutes or so are exhilarating."
1651,7,"entertaining, but too similar to the first Star Wars","The film is just excellent. Watching it without having read any spoilers before, this Star Wars film was the best movie experience since I watched the original ones in the mid-80s. Of course Abrams couldn't live up to the expectations of every single Star Wars fan.But he honored the series in the best possible way. Kylo Ren is a good villain.It gets obvious that he is Han's son very early on, so you can't criticize that. The revealing of Ren's origin is just not the main point in Episode VII. I left the cinema with the impression that I would like to see the next one immediately because I was so stunned when Rey finally found Luke. Showed me that the film really worked. He is not as good as The Empire strikes back but much much better than the Prequels"
1652,10,"Well done J.J, Abrams","Prequels? What prequels? J.J. Abrams and his team have successfully recaptured the heart, humour and humanity of the original Star Wars trilogy. As a fan of the saga since 1977, it's great to see a Star Wars film after all these years that swings the pendulum back towards practical effects, snappy, economical dialogue, and a breakneck pace. No boring Jedi council meetings, somersaulting CGI Yoda or stilted performances here - for me, this film is almost as good as A New Hope and Empire. ALMOST. I have one major problem with it that I won't reveal on a public website (and I'm sure a lot of Original Trilogy fans might agree with me about it). That one thing - which may cause controversy amongst us die-hard fans - prevented me from ranking this film alongside A New Hope and Empire. And in the Minor Problems Dept, well, some characters unfortunately don't get as much screen time as I'd hoped. But for the most part, it's a wild ride and well worth the wait. George Lucas might have forgotten what makes a great Star Wars movie, but thank goodness J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and their collaborators remember. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are great, the original trilogy actors are great, there's action galore, some nice little in-joke references to the original films, some hilarious comic moments, and overall the whole thing just FEELS very Star Wars. Great job, cool ending, I'm keen to see where the series goes from here. After 32 years, the Star Wars we all love is finally back."
1653,7,"Very welcome return to Original Trilogy-style storytelling, but falls short of true greatness","There seems to be a polarizing consensus on IMDb regarding Star Wars the Force Awakens. One one hand, we have the average rating of 8.6 based of 262,316 reviews this far (28/12/2015). On the other hand we have IMDb's own users mostly writing reviews where they are negatively criticizing the film's overall tone, targeted age group, story-line decisions and the borrowed story elements from IV. In this review I would like counter the in my opinion unfair criticism to bring balance back to the force on IMDb, this film deserves it."
1654,8,The force Awakens did what it had set out to do (MEGA Spoiler Alert!!),"There was potential to become a great sequel to the original triology, but if a movie leans on the characters who are coming back instead of the lead. It's a failure to me.<br /><br />I'm new to the Star Wars franchise, so maybe I'm wrong, but this movie didn't feel like LucasFilm. It felt like a Disney sci-fi adventure. It had a really good scene at the end, but also a Disney Channel love/friendship story in the beginning."
1655,6,"Star Wars, but not LucasFilm",** spoilers alert **
1656,1,I felt nothing,"I was excited about seeing The Force Awakens when it was announced. Also, I was kind of skeptical because the prequel Star Wars movies were hit or miss for me. George Lucas had some great ideas for the prequels, but they fell flat. The mix bag of good and bad performances also didn't help. So, I was a bit reserved about the movie."
1657,9,A fun blast to the past,"Months before I entered the packed theater to witness history in the making, I avoided any and all contact with the trailers and social media, because I don't have social media. I went in with all my knowledge of the old films. And I will admit, I was quite impressed with what Abrams had to offer."
1658,8,The Force is back....but a little too familiar,"I have been waiting for a GOOD star wars movie since i saw Return of the Jedi when i was a child. I loved the original series growing up, and have watched the series more than any other. I have read expanded universe stuff, watched some Clone Wars and Rebels, and have defended the prequels as child movies. The prequels were awful for many reasons, and i do not consider them legitimately adding to the cinema Story Line. However, with that being said...."
1659,9,"From a true, long, fan","I'll keep this as spoiler free as I can, but I am still excited."
1660,8,"A vast improvement to the Star Wars Lore, but still flawed.","The Force Awakens provided an opportunity for me and for all Star Wars fans: a chance at redemption for a series that more recently left a bad taste in our mouths. Like most Star Wars fans I accepted that it could not live up to the originals, but went in begging for it to be better than the prequels; the result was somewhere in the middle. "
1661,7,A vast improvement to the sequels and a promising foundation for the next two films in the series.,"I loved this movie. I've just left the theater and I loved this movie beginning to end. The acting was great, and the characters were the same. My only problem with the characters was they had some similarities to the original characters, but they had plenty new distinctions to them. The cinematography was beautiful, encompassing the audience in every scene. The plot did correlate to the original a bit too, but also had plenty new ideas. The special effects were superb, looking real in every scene. What the movie did really good was balancing/transitioning the old cast with the new cast. Also, don't worry, there isn't any remnants of the prequels brought into here. I can't recommend this enough. I loved this movie so, so, so much. It's not as good as ""A New Hope"" or ""Empire Strikes Back"", but better than the rest. In all, a very good sequel to an amazing movie that is very much worth your time."
1662,10,Worth every cent,"30-some years after Ewoks saved the day, the first order has risen(somehow without anyone stopping them...? Even though there is now a Republic? Who knew we'd ever be asking for *more* politics in a Star Wars movie...) in place of the evil Galactic Empire. Can the Rebel Alliance, er, I mean, The Resistance, possibly defeat them? Especially considering that they have, *sigh*, say it with me, yet another freaking Death Star?"
1663,7,Familiar whilst still breaking (some) new ground,"I understood what J.J. Abrams and company were trying to do. Move forward, but pay as much homage to the original trilogy as possible AND connect this last film to Return of the Jedi in a way that would make sense."
1664,8,Fun for the whole family,"I had hight hopes due to the perfectly picked director (Star Trek into Dumbness was a rare fluke though) and Disney's carefully crafted new continuity and they succeeded by giving me the first good Star Wars movie since 1983 and even the best one since 1980. TFA may not be a perfect film and it relies heavily on the structure of IV and V but isn't this what we all wanted to re-introduce the cinematic arm of the franchise? The film looks like the original trilogy, sounds like it and most importantly feels like it as it re-mystified the titular Force. Especially due to the Force Vision in the exact middle of the film which i consider the best sequence featured. The film even tried it's best to respect the now thankfully dead Extended Universe and it also looks forward the future by introducing new cinematic techniques and narrative content to the franchise. Chief among them is the villain Kylo Ren who exceeded my lofty expectation by becoming a worthy follow up to Darth Vader. Or should i say an inversion as he turned out to be Anakin Skywalker done right! I was glued to the screen every time he showed up and the film ended up being less predictable than expected. The other clear highlight is Harrison Ford who returned to form for the first time in 2 decades. The film is even very progressive by having a female protagonist who's gender is a non-issue, a vulnerable black man as a deuteragonist and it also easily passes the Bechdel-Test so we now have empirical proof that such films can make money. Eh Hollywood? Rey is ironically the new character i cared about the ""least"" as the film is only a setup for her Joseph Campbell-esque journey but i still like her a lot. The film is the funniest of them all too (who knew that C-3PO can actually be funny?) despite being the darkest but the humor should have been assigned to less characters and there is even an equally useless female counterpart to Boba Fett. There are actually a lot of villains in the film which lead to a well developed sense of danger due to an even stronger themes of fascism and the film may be slightly overstuffed in general but i have no idea how the scriptwriters could have stepped up their game as the deck was stacked up against them no matter what. ILM is destined to win awards for the mesmerizing effects but i suspect they won't be the only aspects of the films to gain acclaim due to the overwhelming positive reception form all audiences and the 2 hours flew by. My biggest takeaway is that the seasoned team behind VII managed to bring back the excitement and most importantly the magic so it wish it luck on it's journey to topple the very enjoyable Avatar. VIII will be guided by a Breaking Bad veteran and Rogue One is intriguing due to the premise alone so Disney's very own MCU finally got some competition. Battlefront is lastly fun, Rebels is an outright hit and so are the comics and a lot of the books so i commit no hyperbole by stating that the Disney acquisition managed to save Star Wars from creatively collapsing on itself. May the Schwartz be with you Disney!"
1665,7,Jar Jar Abrams reignited the Force,"I'm gob-smacked. I was expecting the usual slick JJ treatment to a classic that he seems to excel at (sublime nods to Spielberg / Lense flare / The subtle little touches to the amazing Star Trek movies), yet we have a plagiarism of episode IV, almost scene for scene and silly dialogue: I'm sorry but a Stormtrooper would never call someone 'bro'. It's full of dialogue lifted from Episode IV. I guess this is supposed to make the nerds clap in the cinema. There's a pseudo Darth Vader. A Pseudo Luke, who is now female and mispronounces Han as Haaahn (darling watch the movies and don't just read the script), there is a pseudo Emperor. All without explanation of where they came from: Guys watch Jedi: The Empire is defeated! Sorry; but as a self confessed SW nerd I just found it juvenile. I gave it 4 because for some unknown reason Harrison Ford agreed to be in it."
1666,4,Really?,"I like the first trilogy more than the second one (prequels), and given the quality of the prequels, I even thought that they were unnecessary. At least the last film of the prequels (Revenge of the Sith) is decent enough, but it rather looked like an animated film. Among the Star Wars films, I like Empire Strikes Back the most, and I though that it was an amazing feat given the technology at that time (of course, A New Hope was a monumental film and a historic one). "
1667,8,"Good film, better than the prequels, but not iconic enough","As a 30 something who grew up on the original trilogy and like so many others was utterly disappointed by the prequels I went into viewing The Force Awakens with great anxiety and reservation. This movie delivered in so many ways. I am not going to write a detailed or even general review of the film as I truly feel one should go into viewing knowing as little as possible. I have been frustrated with the amount of lukewarm reviews this movie has been receiving from fans. This is one time I think the critics are on track, as evidenced by the 95% fresh rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. I know, I know, we're sitting at 89% here on IMDb, and that's actually higher, (for now) than any previous Star Wars movie--including the much praised Empire. My advice is this: Try to sit in the theater and enjoy this movie. If you try to dislike it... you might just succeed. But I can honestly say this is the most fun I've had watching ANY movie in a long time. PS Don't take a hater/negative Nancy with you, go with someone who enjoys fun, exciting and well made movies!"
1668,10,Don't listen to jaded haters. (No Spoilers),I enjoyed this film because I love Disney and Lucas Films. This was unlike any other movie I have ever seen before. It was amazing to see all the classic Star Wars characters return in a new sequel with a new story line and cool special affects. I have always enjoyed watching movies made by George Lucas including Indiana Jones and all kinds of Star Wars movies. I give this 10 out of 10 and wish Disney luck in the future with Star Wars movies along the way. This is a movie you and your family will enjoy and remember forever. Disney has really grown over time with new ideas for movies and entertainment for everyone all around the world. Hope you enjoy Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
1669,10,An Epic Adventure Far Far Away.,"Most Star Wars fans are never pleased I guess. With the prequels they say it is not at all like the original, with Force Awakens, they say it is TOO similar. "
1670,10,"Yes it was similar to A New Hope, but that is the point...",A lot of cameos. A lot of throw back moments. I'm sure hardcore fans loved it. Probably my 2nd favorite Star Wars begins Rogue One. Corny acting and storyline but they all are.
1671,7,Corny in a good way,"Star Wars: The Force awakens was satisfying to watch after waiting for one year since the first trailer release. The film-makers have executed it with zeal. Elements from the previous episodes drawing nostalgia from the fans and introduction to a new generation of characters have been portrayed perfectly. Daisy Ridley who played Rey has a bright future ahead and this movie has given her the jump- start. The movie also deals with sexist stereotypes and proves that women are not powerless and can do anything equal to what men can do. Most Disney movies in the past have been about saving Princesses and this movie certainly doesn't involve that.I had another expectation of Disney where it always ends on a happy note proved me wrong. Overall, great film by JJ Abraham, he managed to not disappoint the old star wars fan boys and he managed to make it in such a way that people unfamiliar with Star Wars can also enjoy it. The Force Awakens has set a new Bar for the next 2 movies. I am sure people will have higher expectations and I hope JJ Abrahams delivers."
1672,9,Perfect Mix of Nostalgia and New introductions,"Star Wars is a science-fiction opus which is enjoyed, and loved by people of varying generations. To continue this magnum opus in all its glory and to further the inter-galactic extravaganza is a tough task, so obviously 'The Force Awakens' is not without flaws but it is surprisingly quite entertaining. "
1673,6,"Old meets the new in 'The Force Awakens' - entertaining, predictable, nostalgic","10 years after the god awful prequel trilogies ended, Star Wars fans were left terribly disappointed. That's an understatement actually. I was one of them. So going into this movie I was somewhat excited but also fearful. I was scared we might get another prequel-ish movie."
1674,9,This Is Star Wars! (Spoiler Free!),"Was really excited to see this. This movie had the budget and the special effects. The locations were awesome, the visuals great. The ships were flat out amazing. Soundtrack, thank you, it was tops. Without giving too much away I really liked the character development. Every main character has something they are struggling with, which I loved. Even pretty good casting. "
1675,6,"It was okay, but...","I have been a massive Star Wars fan since I was 5 years old and saw a New Hope in the theater in 1977. When I first saw episodes 1-3, I was a bit disappointed at first, but then I realized that I saw episodes 4-6 when I was a child and I watched 1-3 as an adult. With that in mind, I found that i actually enjoyed 1-3 more with each viewing."
1676,1,Worst of all the Star Wars films,"Maybe it's because I still grew up with my imagination (seeing Star Wars as a kid), instead of instant electronic feedback (don't get me wrong - I heart technology with the best of them) but I loved this movie! It FELT like the first three Star Wars movies to me. Personally, I don't care that this film doesn't incorporate this time line or ignores this universe or that. All I know is that I felt like I was being taken along with these new characters on a new adventure and I couldn't wait to see what happened next! There's also enough of our old friends in there that we feel that old, familiar camaraderie that has carried us through the first movies. I'm looking forward to seeing this one again and will be first in line for the next ones too."
1677,9,I feel sorry for those that dislike this movie for it seems they have lost the wonder and excitement that Star Wars has always held for me.,"I thought this was a more than decent way to start the new trilogy. I was expecting a little more but nothing will be as good as the originals. This movie is a huge step up from the prequels but does repeat some themes from the original trilogy. I thought the little details and look into the storm troopers was awesome. The movie is entertaining and a new spin on the series. I was really excited for this movie and for the next film to be a bit darker unfortunately the next film ""The last Jedi"" was an absolute flop and makes this film look bad because they are in the same trilogy."
1678,8,Decent movie to start the new trilogy,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS! If you haven't seen it, basically my recommendation is go see it, this isn't a movie you should miss out on seeing in theaters. It's very good, not great, but you'll enjoy it. Now for the review. I've seen a lot of reviews giving it a 4,3,2 and even 1 star, which is absurd. This is an entertaining movie with great production, special effects, acting, and direction. There are issues (I'd be blind to say it's not Episode IV on more than a few occasions) but they don't by any mean outweigh the good. The cast is fantastic, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have fantastic chemistry, and Harrison Ford IS Han Solo. Kylo Ren is not the Darth Vader reskin you thought he might have been, and while some complain he's just a brat, IT'S CALLED A CHARACTER ARC. He'll grow and develop in the coming episodes and his actions in this film promise an excellent arc to come. The scene between him and Han was the emotional high of the film (when Han called out to him by his real name, Ben, there wasn't a dry eye in the theater). Yes Han dies, but the fact that they got Harrison Ford back at all should have been clue enough for any fan that he was going to bite it in this one. And I'm okay with that, this trilogy is about the new characters, and they're fantastic. The action and cinematography is great, the special effects are solid, and the score, while not the best Williams, has its moments, especially at the end. Now there are some negatives with the story, such as Rey's sudden mastery of the force and her ability to defeat Kylo with no training, which seemed really really convenient. And while Luke's appearance had the crowd on their feet clapping, holding him to the last minute and GIVING HIM NO LINES was a lame considering Mark Hamill had second billing. Combine that with an appalling lack of the much-hyped Captain Phasma and a weird CGI squid fest scene and you have the negatives. So it's not perfect, but I'm looking forward to what's to come, and you should see it."
1679,8,"Not perfect, but you shouldn't expect it to be","Let me start off by saying, fan boys are going to complain and cry about anything little thing, don't pay mind to them and judge a film by your own accord. Now with that out of my system, Star Wars was a great, great film. My real only issue with the film is that the main story line is pretty much a replica of New Hope, but the character development was entertaining, the action was thrilling, and settings were fantastic. I don't understand the dislike of Kylo Ren, he was one of my favorite characters and Adam Driver gave a great performance of a weird yet powerful young dark figure dealing with issues as self hate and a battle within himself between light and dark. Rey has so much potential that I feel in part 8 she will excel more. Finn also, his comedic performance was fun. A nice surprise was from Domhnall Geeson as general Hux, I don't know but every time he was on screen the attention was quickly drawn to him. Could also say he was a screen stealer as his performance was captivity. Would've loved to see more from Oscar Isaac but I guess in part 8, and of course the old cast of Leia and Han were great to see back in action, they didn't miss a step. Overall a really fantastic film for a whole generation of Star Wars fans, young and old. RJ's Rating: 8/10"
1680,8,"There has been an awakening, we all have felt it.","So I packed my husband into the theatre and ourselves and nine other people settled in to watch Star Wars, The Force Awakens. Okay, I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled with the opening scrawl that seemed written by a high school drama club but, believe it or not, things improved from there. After reading all the spoilers about the film, which I truly don't care about, I wasn't expecting much from this, the seventh outing of this franchise. To be honest, it wasn't that bad."
1681,7,It wasn't that bad,"I went in to see the movie with great grin on my face! I felt like I'm 6 years old again, as 34 years ago when I see the new hope first. I really enjoyed the ride, then suddenly I was crying...."
1682,8,"Amazing movie, but I ended up crying! Spoilers!",I'm rating it 7 just because it was fun to watch the movie for the first hour or so. Otherwise I'd go for 5-6.
1683,7,There we go again,Seriously the haters really need to stop whinning it's getting very annoying very fast. This film was an awesome Star Wars movie one worthy of standing in the saga. 
1684,10,This move was awesome.,"After much waiting and fanfare I finally got to see The Force Awakens. Yay! As the movie played out, I got the eerie sensation that I'd been here before. Same plot, villains, heroes, action, ships, props, story line and scenarios. Like a case of deja vu, it was as if I'd seen all of this before: somewhere - sometime - somehow... Apparently 1977 called and wanted their blockbuster back. Sure, many of the faces and planets were different, and of course the special effects, especially in digital 3D were staggering, however like too many remakes in Hollywood these days, there was no originality whatsoever and it was very predictable. Like repainting the same old house a different shade of pastel and then sitting to watch it dry."
1685,6,Deja Vu?,"The dark side wins! This movie was so disappointing, so void of meaningful content, so vapid and so vacant of emotional connection...the force compelled me to create an IMDb account and give in to my true feelings online."
1686,1,Spoiler Alert - Disney and Abrams have Spoiled Star Wars,"In 1977 I was 17, I attended a Cinema in Sydney Australia and watched the new release of ""Star Wars (1977)"" now with the added words ""A new Hope"" ... Already a fan of Sci Fi I found the movie to be excellent fun."
1687,8,The force had a big nap,The Hype was gigantic with this movie. The trailer earned a world Guinness record for views in a period of 24 hours. I myself couldn't wait. All the toy companies started to take the franchise and made all sorts of stuff. I personally think that they made most of their money back with presales. That's how big the hype was. Imagine what the movie would be like. 
1688,,The Force is Strong with the Awakening,"It's good, lets get that out of the way (phew!). It overcomes all of its most unenviable challenges confidently. I can't recall another franchise tasked with conjuring up a cast of insta-classic, original characters like this - pretty much every blockbuster we see now is based on existing material. Even the Star Wars prequels relied mostly on stock characters (sorry padme). The nearest comparison I can make to The Force Awakens success in this regard is 1999's other sci-fi franchise starter, The Matrix, which went on to squander the appeal of Morpheus and Agent Smith."
1689,8,A great start,"As a non star wars fan, I enjoyed watching every part of the movie. It was fun, humorous, good acting (for the most part), cool action sequences, and overall visually stunning. However, the film was basically a rehash of a new hope. It had a pretty obvious plot, and it contained many plot holes. The biggest gripe I had about this movie was kylo Ren. Adam driver did an amazing job portraying him, and I loved his angry and intimidating personality, but what I don't understand is the reason as to why kylo ren desires to become powerful. I just don't see any purpose behind his motive. It just seems to be all forced in order to make a plot. Also, I was expecting Luke to have a decent screen time in this movie, but I was disappointed. He showed up during the end of the movie for a 30 second screen time and he doesn't even have any dialogue. The movie was good, but it could've been better."
1690,8,"Started strong, but ended weak","Star Wars episode 7 certainly seemed to continue the ring composition that we find throughout the Star Wars series. ... (SPOILER WARNING)... Rey's humble beginning on a dessert planet seemed very reminiscent to Anikan and Luke Skywalkers humble beginning on a dessert planet. All three characters leave their dessert home world to become a Jedi. All three of their characters go through similar experiences in each movie. This is interesting because all three movies are the first movie in their respective trilogies. All three of them have certain similarities with one another. Episode 7 has a cantina scene like episode 4 does. Another thing I would like to point out is that Rey's mentor/father figure in this movie meets the same fate Quigon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi met in the Phantom Menace and a New Hope. The mentor/father figure dies in each film. Which leaves our protagonists with new mentors. Obi- Wan in the prequel trilogy, Yoda in the sequel trilogy, and Luke in the new trilogy. It's interesting that Rey finds Luke hiding in exile, which is similar to Luke finding Yoda on Dagobah. It is also interesting that the mentor character in the Force Awakens falls down a large shaft when he dies which is similar to the way Darth Maul and Darth Sidious die. I noticed that the Phantom Menace, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens have some striking similarities. Specifically the climaxes of all three films. All three films have a multi-layered climax. All three films have a space battle, a ground battle, and a light saber fight. The battles are very similar by the way. In Return of the Jedi and the Force awakens we see that they need to destroy the shield generator from the ground in order to destroy the Death Star/ Star Killer Base. Phantom Menace does the same thing except in reverse. In Phantom Menace they have to destroy the space station from space in-order to deactivate the droid army on the ground. We are seeing many of the same ideas played with different chords. It's sort of like Star Wars is just a giant chiasm. The light saber fight in the Force Awakens sort of mirrors the one we see in Return of Jedi because in both movies the villain is trying to convert the hero to the dark side. We also get to see a sort of trench run take place at Star Killer base like it did in a New Hope. I noticed ring composition in the new film. Kylo Ren's character also sort of mirrors Anikan Skywalkers character. The chiasm continues."
1691,10,"The Force Awakens delivers, and is true to form.","For those who want a sense of what a J.J Abrams version of a Star Wars film is like need to look no further than the most recent Star Trek movies. Abrams himself said he wanted to turn Star Trek into a Star Wars style show. Such as the reaction of the Star Trek films, there is good and bad with Abrams inhabiting our beloved heritage. I was 13 years old when the original Star Wars came out. I went to see at least 6 times while it played for over a year at the St. Louis Park theatre (sadly no longer exists). "
1692,7,Too-Fast Pacing Almost Ruins the Magic (Minor Spoiler),Spoilers ahead!!!!!!!!
1693,10,A long time ago in a galaxy......,Never been a Star Wars fan. I just want to see a fun action movie. And it is good fun to watch.
1694,7,It's only entertainment and needs to be treated and consumed as such.,"There have been very few film screenings I attended where the audience applauded after the final scene. Lone Ranger was one of those and this was another. A film should entertain and move your emotions or give you something to come away with at the end. It should be enjoyable on some level (emotional, intellectually or both) and should make you happy that your time and entertainment dollar was well-spent. This film did those things for me and I will view it again."
1695,10,Good job!,"This wasn't a bad movie; it certainly wasn't like the prequels. Unlike them, it was much closer to the spirit of the original movies: too close. Instead of being it's own movie, TFA seems more like a shot-by-shot remake of A New Hope. The same basic story is there, complete with a third death star (""the starkiller"") and an x- wing raid on the station. It goes far beyond being an homage and simply repackages the original elements, to the point it feels like forced nostalgia, and that JJ Abrams (who is usually a great director) isn't producing his own unique creation, but is simply remaking a film from his childhood. Not only is it not original, but the scale isn't that grand. As bad as the prequels were, they at least attempted (and often succeeded) to have a grand and epic scale; vast city-planets, volcano worlds, massive space battles between huge fleets, and other epic features. The music, too, in the prequels was grand and sweeping, some of the best movie music there is, in my opinion. The acting and writing were certainly bad, but the movies themselves had ambition. TFA has enough ambition to be a re-shoot of ANH, and not much else. The locations (with the exception of the Starkiller) are small and closed in, there aren't too many new aliens, the planets aren't very exotic, and none of the music really stands out. The political setting, too, is underdeveloped (The New Republic gets destroyed, but you know so little about them that it's almost meaningless). This is Episode 6.5, not Episode 7. It isn't a bad film, but it's nothing close to what it should have been."
1696,6,Not what it should have been,"I had great expectation about this movie. Hell, who else couldn't have. I have never been a big fan of Star Wars, but I very enjoyed all the 6 movies thus far. Yes I think jar jar was kind of a pain in the butt, yes I think that dark Vader wannabe actor was very dull and bad, but I also think that the second trinity brought a lot of good thing, well known actors, very bad looking/acting villains (Darth Maul!!!!) and a quite enjoying entertaining, even if it might be a bit over the top."
1697,2,The worst Star Wars movie,There are not so much CGI. Prequels were ruined by that along with bad acting. I liked it very much that creatures were made for real and not by CGI. I'm not going to write long review so I just list things. First good things. + Rated PG13. + old characters return + acting is good + feels more like old star wars + one surprise Game of thrones style
1698,8,This trilogy is going into right direction,"I enjoyed this movie overall. It feels like a Star Wars movie, they succeeded in that. And for succeeding in that I have to say THANK YOU. In many ways it's more of a Star Wars movie than the originals. This might be the weird, corny, action-packed movie that George Lucas intended to make the first time. I'll never know how the original came to be what it was, whether through accident or intent, it was unique. Uniquely imaginative, awesome, and sometimes just funny, but it really meant something to me. It is a world where magic is real, and people can be truly special, and their lives can be truly meaningful, and the fate of a whole galaxy can rest in the hands of a small band of those magical people. This movie sets up a new cast of special characters, unlikely heroes, and a couple old friends, and it does it, very, very well. The end result is something that only a curmudgeon could find fault with, this film oozes quality, it feels like everyone involved gets it and runs with it. And run they do, from beginning to end this film is filled with FX and action. It's not perfect, but few things are. It's certainly made with care and consideration of the source material, and I appreciate that. Minus a couple unfortunate script ideas here and there it's a solid movie in all respects. Probably JJ Abrams best movie."
1699,8,"A very, very, very good homage to the originals","Being an 80s person, I'm obviously a fan of the original trilogy, AKA Episodes 4 to 6 (hence my IMDb nickname, lol). The prequel trilogy was not exactly my cup of tea with the exception of Episode 3, which shows how Luke and Leia came to the world as well as the transformation of Anakin into our favorite Lord Darth Vader!"
1700,10,What a way to introduce Star Wars to a new generation of fans!,"Obviously it's all a matter of opinions, however I feel a lot of the extremely high scores for this film are rather reactionary for what is, essentially, a remake of A New Hope. All of the same beats of previous films are there: The rogue apprentice turned to the dark side, the jedi master that trained him who has now hidden himself away, the Death Star at the end of the film (yes, it is just another death star) and, finally, the average hero taken off of a desert planet who discovers they've been in touch with the force this whole time. To top it all off, the twist in the middle of the film is that Ren is related to Luke and Leia, just to borrow some emotional punches from Empire, too. Who'd have thought? The problems in this film are quite noticeable and mostly concern the plot, given that there is simply too much going on at any given time and the audience is never given the time to truly relate and sympathise with what is going on. The Death star sub plot is extremely tacked on and doesn't feel weighty or meaningful, and the film really takes a nosedive around the time Leia is introduced, as suddenly there's so much to do/explain that none of it feels explored to the extent needed to make it have an impact. "
1701,8,"Retreading old territory, but in a good way.","The hype of this movie was nearly out of this world. Not as fever pitch as it was for The Phantom Menace, but it was close."
1702,7,The Force Kind Of Awakens,"First of all, I've got to admit that I had almost no expectations when walking into the cinema. Honestly, I only thought about how nice it was to be there with my friends. And oh boy, what an awesome experience this movie delivered!"
1703,10,Some of the Best in the Universe,"Star Wars? I am not going to summarise the movie, you can read that elsewhere."
1704,7,OK but does not live up to the hype!,"Like a never ending tube of toothpaste the star wars franchise just never stops giving and this episode was no exception. Its minty fresh goodness left a lovely taste in my mouth and a smile on my face as my buddies and I left the movie theatre, which these days I feel is becoming quite the rarity. "
1705,8,Nostalgia only goes so far,Not very convicing with this but i understand. This is a new story with some new characters and we can see also in this movie some old faces and some old names that can make us remember of the old movies. The story is pretty classic and i found the movie use to see a lot more comedy as usual and it was not very appropriate i guess. It didnt interest me at all. The action scenes dont make the movie interesting: the storytelling is stuck and the scenes just make the movie more spectacular: not the thing that i very like but thats ok and make it entertaining anyway. But like i said there are some old faces and some terrible events that make shift the movie in clearly a different story even if a the end we have a big surprise. Good but could be better. Still a good start for a new Adventure.
1706,6,Need more,"I had such high hopes for this movie but there are just too many things wrong with it to ignore, more than too much CGI and more than an annoying underwater clown who refuses to shut up the entire movie. First, who's the hero? Obviously they are all the heroes of the resistance but who is the main one? In 1, 2, and 3 the story revolved around Ben Kenobi, 4, 5, and 6 the movies revolved around Luke Skywalker. 7 we have two possible candidates, are they both it? One is shown wielding a light saber with no force powers and the other has force powers but no light saber. There is no clear direction, all we know is that two untrained people kicked the crap out of a trained Sith who is strong enough to stop blaster bolts in midair but not strong enough to wipe the floor with a guy who has no apparent abilities. The movie was so predictable on top of that, Han Solo would never just hand a detonator to someone else, he was a large, and in charge, kind of personality so you knew that this was the end for him. Also in what world do you bleed when you get burned with a laser bolt? There is a lot of blood in this movie for being struck with a cauterizing beam of energy. The planets that were destroyed with the new republic, was that Coruscant? What happened with the senate that prompted this new group of villains to arise? Who was the old guy that died in the beginning, why was he important enough to have the coveted map to Luke? Why isn't Leia a part of it of the new republic? None of it is explained, not even a little bit. Not to mention the movie should have ended about 10 minutes sooner than it did as well, it just dragged on, and on, for nothing more than a marketing trick."
1707,3,Disappointing,"How are some people actually hating this movie? Don't listen to the haters, they are all whining fanboys who know nothing about how a quality movie is supposed to be."
1708,10,stop hating this movie!,"This is indeed the best Star Wars movie since 1983. Given the low quality of the prequels, that's not saying a whole lot. Still, the old school Star Wars flavor is here as is the popcorn fun. "
1709,8,Old School Popcorn Fun,"Today, I was finally able to see The Force Awakens at my local theater. In all, it was a good movie. There were some areas that the film could use improvement, especially with the dialogue of one of the main characters. Also, I feel as if there could have, or really, should have been a switch with the actors for couple of the film's characters. Actionwise, the film does not disappoint. J.J. Abrams does a good job with keeping things going, especially in the second and third acts. There were moments in the first act where things felt too uneven. I have to say that I miss the 20th Century Fox fanfare music, because that was so much a part of the Star Wars experience. But, nitpicks aside, this film was a good return to form. I'm very eager to see what's in store for us when Episode VIII comes out."
1710,8,SW:The Force Awakens-A worth addition,"Warning! This review contains spoilers!!! (I am still almost speechless, so here a some thoughts about this movie / excuse my bad English)"
1711,10,"Tears of joy, wonderful experience!","When this film first released I would have rated it a 9, mostly out of the exhilaration of a new Star Wars film being released. However, after sitting on it for a few years, I believe it deserves a 5. The film follows the first Star Wars film too closely and feels like a rehash of things we have already experienced. However, with solid acting, decent to great characters (Kylo Ren), and having excellent effects, the film is competently made. However, in service of the greater Star Wars canon, it provides very little and, with the sequel trilogy complete, becomes a wholly inconsequential story. Most of what is introduced here is either borrowed from Episode 4 or is retconned later, thus I cannot suggest watching any of the sequel trilogy film other than for the spectacle. It is truly a shame, as this film, and the sequel trilogy, could have been much better with creative and passionate minds behind the camera and a concrete plan as to where the story would go."
1712,6,A decent Star Wars film,"It had been 10 years since the last entry in the Star Wars saga, and it was worth the wait! "
1713,9,10 years felt like so long!,"Look, there is no way in which one viewing of a Star Wars film can settle my judgment on it and that is the same for pretty much every film fan. It is too big of a thing, too exciting of a story for it not to compromise a part of my judgment at first screening. Plus, to say I was over excited and had massive expectations would be reductive. What I am saying is: take this review with a grain of salt, I may change many ideas on it once I see it again and let it be clear that the grade is very positive so I LIKED the film very much, but for now, here's my first impression."
1714,7,7.5/10,"The best out of 3 new films...This is not to say they were great, but I found something good in them that made the whole trilogy worth watching despite differewnt flaws. The most interesting part of the new story for me was Kylo Ren and Rey stories and evolution of their relationship. Kylo and Rey were the only characters who showed some character development and kept the moview together. This episode was generally made better that the next 2 and had few boring or unjustified scenes. I give this 8 stars. This is one star more, than I believe it really deserves as a movie, but I added one star for the most controversial and conflicted villian in all SW. This star goes to the actor, he created the best new character in the trilogy."
1715,8,I liked it more after watching other 2,"I was 9 when I sat in heightened anticipation in old Cathay awaiting a movie experience like no other in the year of 1977. It was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had. I only had a limited amount of vocabulary and movie experience under my belt, but I was wise enough to know that Star Wars: A New Hope was going to be a classic mentioned under the same breath as Casablanca, Gone With the Wind and the likes. Star Wars: The Force Awakens on the other hand will never be one."
1716,7,TFA Feels Like Comfort Food We Love So Much We Don't Mind Eating it Again,"Firstly, I don't think this is a bad movie: it's an entertaining enough way to spend two hours: but it's a terrible Star Wars movie, hence the one star."
1717,1,The Farce Awakens,"A step forward isn't necessarily a step in the right direction. This idea is exemplified no better than in the seventh episode of the Star Wars saga. Where the original trilogy was like a man in his prime, and the prequels a sad but fruitful mid-life crisis detour,""The Force Awakens"" plays like a franchise at peace with what it is."
1718,8,"A step backwards, into the right direction","First off, props to J.J. Abrams for pulling off this film! Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens was truly what fans were hoping for! I felt like a little kid when I was in the theater, and as the lights dimmed, and the opening signature Star Wars title sequence started all I could do was smile and think it was here finally! "
1719,9,Like seeing your best friend years later!,The portrayal of each character in this film makes excellent use of this concept. Maz Kanata has lived for over a thousand years and can learn the essence of an individual just by seeing there eyes. I believe that this idea was used throughout the entire film. Such vivid expression is used by each of the actors that it helps the watcher to really feel that they are looking into that character's life and the essence of who they really are.
1720,10,"""I see your eyes...I know your eyes""","First of all, it is a ""real"" Star Wars after 32 years. After Lucas deliberately destroyed his own franchise with ""prequels"" so that we learned our fearsome villain Darth Vader was actually a confused emo kid, finally a story that we can all relate to. "
1721,8,"Haters gonna hate, always",I watched it today and was happy to see Harrison Ford still there 38 years from his debut.
1722,7,"7/10, looked like it has been filmed in 1980..but we have 2015","It's a Star Wars movie through and through. Fans (and others) can rejoice, this is a watch you won't regret."
1723,8,A very solid entry into the Star Wars franchise,"Taking a step back and viewing The Force Awakens, the film isn't all that bad. Many things were left up for speculation for it to be solved in the next two films of the trilogy, which is expected considering how incredibly popular and beloved this franchise is. Thinking back to when it first came out, everyone loved it because they were excited for where it would be taken from there. And I think that's what makes this film passable. The feeling of revival to this franchise is exactly what it needed.<br /><br />It's no wonder that the film is quite similar to A New Hope, Disney wanted to play it safe to please everyone. In my opinion, I think the two films are separate enough to justify The Force Awakens' existence. This film's job was to create these new characters, and establish the time setting in the universe. I believe it succeeded as the characters are well done, and the time period makes sense in the context of the rest of the franchise.<br /><br />Obviously there needed to be cliffhangers and unanswered questions as this is the first film in the trilogy. By the end of the film, the remaining two films have the opportunity to go anywhere which is what kept people looking forward to episode 8. When you take the unfortunate existence of episode 8 out of context when watching the film, it can be enjoyable and will feel faithful to Star Wars. Let's just hope Rise of Skywalker is able to fix up the damage done by The Last Jedi."
1724,7,Solid revival of an incredible franchise,"After waiting to read all reviews before watching it myself, I am disappointed in all the negative user reviews from so many would be Star Wars fans. Really, 1 out of 10...really!!! That seems a little extreme. Was it really that bad to you? Is there any pleasing you; glad you're not paid to write reviews. I feel some of these user reviewers would have rated it badly no matter what was placed on the screen in front of them. Now, I will step off my soap box and begin my user review. I grew up watching Star Wars on VHS over and over again and playing with Star Wars action figures (yes, I took them out of their boxes), and The Force Awakens was the first of the new generation of Star Wars movies that I can't wait to watch again. It held Forcefully true, pun intended, to what makes Star Wars great. JJ made a movie that took Star Wars back to its roots in a galaxy far way, but one with which we are all very familiar. It made me feel like a 5 year old kid watching A New Hope for the first time in my living room all over again. I love the new characters and can't wait to see where JJ is going to take us."
1725,10,Great Addition to the Star Wars Family,"The first time I saw it in theaters I thought The Force Awakens was about the level of Return of the Jedi. In their own way they have the same problems, too much revisiting the past, funny and campy but sometimes at the cost of doing something better with the scene."
1726,7,"Good characters get dragged down by what is, essentially, a remake","There are plenty of YouTubers who have exposed this movie as being a low-quality rip off of many other great movies which won't be mentioned for the sake of avoiding spoilers. This movie is unoriginal and terrible compared to the original Star Wars trilogy. I would even rather watch The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith than this garbage."
1727,1,"Unoriginal Ideas Repackaged in PC with ""STAR WARS"" Label Attached to Milk the Franchise","After a decade long hiatus, Star Wars is back in a big way, this time directed by JJ Abrams, who does a yeoman's job of continuing the swashbuckling saga by re-connecting to the original trilogy. Back are Han Solo, ""Princess"" Leia, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2, even if some do a cameo."
1728,8,Thrilling adventure like '77 Star Wars but missing creativity,"Just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Having seen all the movies at least one time each, The Force Awakens was exactly what I wanted it to be. A nod at the aging stars of 4-6 and the setup for the next two movies. I typically do not write reviews....and this is not a review either. I just have to say I get such a kick out of the people that give this movie low ratings and share their vitriol filled breakdown of the film. I suppose it is why I only tune in for the first two weeks of American Idol. It's funny to watch a bunch of people lacking talent shaking their fists at why their vision of truth is not accepted by the masses. The damage you funny reviewers have done must be very disappointing to the JJ Abrams and Co. Last I checked the overall IMDb rating is a very, very low 8.7. Hilarious!!"
1729,9,Hilarious to see 1 STAR ratings,There's been much secrecy about the storyline and I applaud Disney and the filmmakers for being able to keep this such a strong secret. But maybe there was a bigger reason for the secrecy than just the plot?
1730,9,The magic is back yes ... maybe too much of it?,I've seen it at the Cineworld Dublin three times and it's absolutely brilliant! I just love it. I'd say it's the best Star Wars film I've ever seen.
1731,10,It's absolutely brilliant,"***Contains Spoilers*** First I like to say that overall I love the movie, but there are a couple things that stood out right away. I've watched it in 3D and 2D. I like how they tied the story to the other series, although it was a lot to cram in a two hour and sixteen minute movie. The majority of camera angles seem to fit the traditional movies, certain moments the camera moved too much. You can obviously tell it wasn't George Lucas directing, but still an awesome movie and made very well, credit to JJ Abrams."
1732,7,"*Spoilers* Enjoyed the movie, things could of been different.","I thought this was a great film, full of action. The special effects were incredible, it really felt like I was in the moment."
1733,10,Great film!,"I just want to say to all you people voting out there that IMDb has a ""weighted"" way of rating their movies based on votes. That means it's not just the average of all the votes put together. I'm assuming this means that all you folks rating this a 1 or a 10 are probably greatly diminishing the weight of your vote as outliers. This is a shame because most of the reviews i've read are 1's, meaning people hated the movie, and yet the rating, as of now, remains at 8.7."
1734,6,Your Ratings Aren't Doing Anything,"This is the first time since Return of the Jedi that I have been this excited about a Star Wars movie. I realize episodes I, II, and III were necessary to explain the origins of the story. But they just seemed to lack the enthusiasm of the original trilogy. Of course for me part of the lack of luster was Jar Jar ""Stepin Fetchit"" Binks and Hayden Christensen's wooden portrayal of Anakin. But all that has been forgotten with this newest installment. The new characters are great. It's wonderful to see the old favorites again as well."
1735,10,J.J.Abrams brought back the excitement!,"I went to watch this film with very high anticipation, maybe it was because of this I was a little disappointed. While it is a great film, with things such as, particle effects, fantastic direction, brilliant visuals and outstanding performances from all members of the cast. However there are things that this film suffers from, that stops it from being the best that it could have been."
1736,7,Great .. but not Amazing,"People want to believe this movie was good, in fact it wasn't."
1737,1,Stupidity is strong!,*Don't panic. There are NO spoilers in this review*
1738,10,A true awakening and a new hope!,"Original Star Wars trilogy are some of the movies I have seen maximum number of times since the VHS days. I can still see them with almost the same breath of freshness. In fact, just recently I initiated my wife into this cult. Now she too enjoys its rituals. The originals are so good that every time the creator George Lucas announces that he is going to make prequels or sequels to the originals, I say to myself, ""I've got a very bad feeling about this."" If George were Darth Vader, he would definitely say to me, ""I find your lack of faith disturbing"" and kill me. I was in fact not quite impressed with the prequel trilogy. To me it was like a CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) possessed body sans the original soul. Once bitten twice shy, hence I was not very excited about the sequel too. I was wrong and I am glad at being proved wrong. ""Be mindful of your thoughts. They will betray you."" J J Abrams has exorcised the excessive CGI demon from its possessed body and restored the original soul in it with a perfectly juxtaposed Yin and Yang. He has awakened the Force as Obi-Wan Kenobi predicted it, ""You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith and not join them. You were to bring balance to the Force, not leave it in the darkness."" It seems that Yoda's instructions were equally clear to Abrams, ""Do or do not. There is no try."" And so he did it. ""The Force is strong with this one,"" Darth Vader acknowledged."
1739,9,"""The Force is strong with this one.""","Firstly after reading other reviews the words ""you can't please everyone"" comes to mind. Episodes 1-3 were slated for being too CG and not star wars looking. JJ kept to the original star wars style very well in my opinion and now people are slating it for not being CG enough for 2015. The film was better for it. Aside from a good cast and it being an enjoyable movie, that's about as positive as I can be."
1740,9,Could have been better...,"What a huge comeback!! Just one of the best action movies I've ever seen! Combining drama with epic Star-Wars fighting scenes, Force Awakens truly surprised me. I was apprehensive that the big headlights given to this movie would end up disappointing me with a normal one but I couldn't be more wrong! Brilliant idea of George Lucas to get the same plot as in the movies before, since 1977, mixing up with a fresh new batch that reinvigorated the saga itself. Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint."
1741,10,An infinite journey that continues to blow away every expectations,I agree with a bunch of reviews on here that the movie just doesn't compare with the movies by George Lucas.
1742,6,Not That Great,"I have never written a review on this site before, but I thought it best to share what I saw last night in the new chapter of Star Wars. Lets note first that I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life even though I wasn't around to watch the originals when they first came out. My father first showed me Star Wars in the worst way possible, with the prequels back in 2000. From an early age, I enjoyed those movies, simply, because I was a child. It wasn't until I was about 16 years old when I realized how ridiculous they were. Of course, the originals were always my favorite, and after brutally making it through Episodes 1 and 2, it was actually Episode 3 that saved my loved for Star Wars. Yes I know that sounds impossible, but the connection into the originals was brilliant and I really loved that. When I was about 10 or 11, after having watched episodes 4-6, my love for Star Wars grew enormously and I never would have thought they would bring it back, giving all us fans years of excitement and anticipation. Now enough about my love for Star Wars in general, let's get to the main topic of discussion. Star Wars: The Force Awakens. "
1743,8,Sets the foundation for the future of the saga,"A disappointment ... plagiarized from various films of the saga in here and there The Black Death in x10 format and attack squadron as in the first film. The son of Han Solo (bad) who betrays her father on the catwalk. The robot that looks a lot like R2D2 that becomes attached to the promise girl Jedi. I would have hoped for a movie where there are the old players but began a new story, different, interesting, tied between the old and the new, instead of something seen and reviewed. They are definitely the best and most interesting episodes of the series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, or the film based on the series. Much more consistent with the actual story."
1744,6,disappointing...,"I was one of the unique people, that went into that movie theater with no information on the new characters that were being introduce, and had not read any of the Theory. only watching the 'Movie Trailers'... A hundred times. I was spoken to the face of Han's death, but had completely forgot about it by the time I got in the theater for some reason."
1745,9,I love this movie -- Very well made!,"Although J. J. Abrams settles the Force back between an overly familiar construction, he does it in such a striking way to give the fans a breath of classic refreshment. The fact that it seems to be a lazy reboot of A New Hope is bringing everyone a fair amount of disappointment. However, every little to large element is completely fresh."
1746,7,Its Flaws are Completely Overshadowed By its Ripeness,The movie quite nicely shows off some of the things that are possible with contemporary technology. It's a shame therefore that the script is so poor.
1747,4,Pitiful,I remember working at a haunted house setup at Tropical Park in Miami Florida where there was a section setup with characters dressed up as those from the bar scene from the original Star Wars. I was a volunteer to dress up as a character to frighten people walking through the large tent set up with a maze of scenes designed to frighten the visitors. But this was only one of many early memories I began recalling watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
1748,10,"Made me feel young again! Audience applauded, laughed out loud! A must see.",One of the most anticipated movies in recent years The Force awakens is a great addition to the Star Wars cannon and a mighty film in its own right. JJ Abrabs has the force with him and he totally used it to its advantage
1749,9,May the force be with you !,"I may have been the last man in my town to see this movie, but I finally took it in in all of it's 3D/IMAX glory... and honestly? I thought it was great, very entertaining. I don't understand all of the harsh reviews on this site lambasting this episode. "
1750,9,"Very entertaining, made for a whole new generation of fans...","I might be in the minority by saying that I actually enjoyed the prequels. However, for every amazing lightsaber duel, they ultimately lacked the heart and character that made the original films so special. The originals were and still are able to take you on a journey to a galaxy far far away. That's exactly where The Force Awakens shines. It retains the thrill of the original trilogy by introducing these wonderful new characters on a journey of discovering their identity. Let's get one thing straight; this is the finest experience I've had in cinema in the last three years, the last being The Dark Knight Rises."
1751,9,The force is strong with this one,"I had low expectations since the prequels were not very good. But this one was much better. It's a lot closer to the originals. If the originals were 10s and 9s, and the prequels were 5s and 6s, this is in the middle at 7-8. I hope the next ones can build on this and get us back into the 9-10 range. Well done. I've seen it twice so far. It's fun and entertaining. A lot of people say it's a reboot but it's really not. There are a lot of similarities, but there's also enough different and new. I would say they played it a bit too safe and that it lacks some originality, but overall very well done. "
1752,6,Better than expected,This movie should be nominated for an academy award; compared to what was to come.
1753,8,OScar winner.,"Firstly, it is worth saying that I enjoyed the film, there were a handful of moments that were 'wow this is a great Star Wars film', however they were few and far between."
1754,6,Average,Let's get the obvious out of the way. And this review will contain minor spoilers...
1755,8,"Great, not perfect. Still great.","I read many negative reviewers on here that refuse to get it. This movie was never meant for us super fans in the first place. When I saw A New Hope back in 1977, I knew that it had a limited life span that Hollywood would exploit and reboot after Lucas' brilliant original trilogy had finished. He knew that as well. In fact, it all went downhill for me after The Empire Strikes Back with Return of The Jedi getting a little too childish for my taste or was it really that I was I aging, maturing, while the story remained true for the intended target audience, the under 20 crowd? Yes, we grew up, and we expected Stars Wars to age & mature along with us. Well it hadn't and that was intentional. Now please, move on with your ridiculous ridicule that the plot was too similar to A New Hope, or the story had too many holes, or it wasn't true to George's vision. When you try and actually do better, then get back to me. "
1756,7,What Did You All Expect?,4 of 10. Rated 3 for now because the score so massively overrated on IMDb. Apparently Disney money can buy more than just the massive amounts to hijack the series from Lucas and convince the original actors to stick a light saber through their hearts and credibility.
1757,3,Didn't Pay Disney a Cent and Still Feel Cheated,"I've just returned from the cinema, and normally I don't do such things as sharing my personal opinion on the particular films online, but this time I'm going to make an exception."
1758,10,Absolutely Terrific!,"I was all hyped up for the newest Star Wars Movie after so many years, excluding the horrible prequels, but when i found out that J.J. Abrams was the director, my hopes were brutally dashed and thrown out the window, but at least Disney was gonna be distributing the Movie, then finally in December 2015, the Movie was released, and the end result was a success but it isn't all Perfect, here's why."
1759,9,A satisfying return to the series with minor problems,I am very tempted to give a 10 star rating.
1760,9,Good. well balanced.,"To put it simply, I feel like if this movie was released on its own, without any of the former Star Wars universe in existence, it would have blown people away. It really is that good. But, let's face it, we're all just being so overly critical about every detail of this movie (myself included). So, I'm going to give it the rating it deserves as a stand alone film but the critique it deserves as an epic saga."
1761,10,Close to perfect,"This movie is, more or less, what George Lucas would probably do with ""A New Hope"" in 2015. It lacks originality and it commits some of the sins of the first one (the story is simplistic, the dialogue is basic, the characters not groundbreaking)..."
1762,6,Technology caught up with Lucas' ideas,"In my view, SW:TFA is precisely what Star Wars fans were hoping for back when the prequels came out. Unfortunately, George Lucas himself was the obstacle, as he apparently had little understanding of what made the films successful in the first place."
1763,9,A Successful Recentering of the Series,"The first time I watched this I thought it was the worst in the saga but now on rewatch I find it the best after the original trilogy. This is the only Star Wars film until that point, including the original trilogy, in which I didn't cringe at a dialogue or acting at some point of the film. The set up of all the new characters and the world is so perfect while giving enough importance to the old characters just enough."
1764,7,Better than I remember,There was a moment in the film where my fears of this being another Phantom Menance were immediately quashed and a smile creased my lips and never left.
1765,9,"Welcome Back Star Wars, You Have Been Missed",Star Wars: The Series re-Awakens
1766,7,Episode VII is an entertaining ball of fluff.,"Maybe JJ Abrams got mixed up with Star Trek, to make ""alternative Universe"", but with this remarkable piece of secretion - movie only got me away from the Main story. Maybe the Rogue One shall be nice, we'll see - but it's good that it's not JJ Abrams behind it!"
1767,5,Shitty Star Wars movie!,"I grew up with the original trilogy of Star Wars. I am not a Star Wars ""nerd"", but I really enjoyed the movies and watched them over and over again. When the ""new"" trilogy was released (Episodes I, II, and III), I was disappointed. I'll admit to not even watching II and III. "
1768,8,Enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously,Another well directed film by JJ Abrams. Not a reboot like Star Trek. Well filmed with a lot of action. Great mix of new characters and old ones. Not without a few issues but overall a good Star Wars movie.
1769,9,Good start to the new trilogy.,"JJ Abrams took on something monumental here, with plenty of ways he could have messed it up. With Disney ownership things looked even more shaky, but their combined failure to wreck Star Wars may be the biggest surprise to viewers."
1770,10,A Real Tour de Force,"I did not know what to expect until I finally saw the introduction, then I know. It is exciting and also it is very dramatic and violent than the original of 1977-1983. I was also excited that they are going to bring back the original cast, and it was worth it. New characters are also introduced and a new villain is introduced, Kylo Ren is similar to Darth Vader, but more convinced. The locations and visual effects are good and looks stunning. I find that even though the 1999-2005 ones are ""Bad"", but this one might actually be similar to the original one, except more modern. The new characters are introduced very well. This also tackles more mature themes like torture, mass killings and the first order looks like NAZI and Kylo Ren is like Adolf Hitler. I really hope that this film win many Oscars in the next one, good luck."
1771,10,The new Star Wars.,first my English not good so hope from every body to excuse me don't like this movie the acting from the lead actors is bad the action scenes are poor and the jokes not funny from my opinion that isn't good start for the new trilogy the old star wars was the best and then start going from worse to worst hope they stop doing more of this series and left it in peace
1772,6,not good enough,I went into this film not expecting much. But boy was I surprised
1773,10,A Return To The Star Wars Universe That We Origionally Fell In Love With,Check out my reviews at http://moviereviews51.wordpress.com 
1774,6,Not exactly a sequel when it's so familiar to a new hope.,"Fans will say that The Force Awakens is a retread of the original 1977 classic, and to a certain degree they are right. However, the film's director J.J. Abrams is able to captivate the audience and balance an old story with a new story that will thrill not only kids but adults alike. From the new and old cast to the visual effects to the emotional storytelling, The Force Awakens sets up a new trilogy masterfully similar to The Fellowship of the Ring for The Lord of the Rings. To be honest, I haven't loved a new Star Wars movie so much in my lifetime since I first watched the originals and this one will definitely go down as one of the greatest of all time even with its editing and predictability issues!"
1775,9,"'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a Magical, Entertaining, and a Great Movie-Going Experience","Star Wars represented the return to simple values in the era of the Parallax View, Capricorn One, The Conversation, Three Days of the Condor, Klute, Solyent Green, and of course The Boys From Brazil."
1776,7,Back to the future,"Aside from the most obvious, predictable and least suspenseful way of killing off an important character and the entire movie being pretty much a blatant copy-pasta of the original trilogy, the Force Awakens isn't all that bad. It's certainly an entertaining movie (especially for younger generations) all things considered, but is it enough for the old guard?"
1777,3,It's not enough,"I'm almost 40, which means I saw two of the original three movies in the theater as a kid. I had all of the old toys, stupidly threw them all into the bathtub and wrecked them and constantly begged my parents for my own light saber. "
1778,8,"Way, way better than the prequels...review from a huge fan","I recall watching the release (and re-release) of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, as an all-day matinée in '83 when RotJ was first released. The thing i remember, as clearly as if it happened just yesterday, is the buzz, anticipation, and adrenalin rush i had knowing i was about to see all three movies at once. Now, how many people (outside cinema staff) can say they got to see all three originals, in one day, on the big screen? But i digress."
1779,9,The Force is strong with this one. Stays (mostly) true to classic Star Wars tenets.,"OK, so i'm going to start by saying ""its not perfect""!! "
1780,9,Back to what star wars should be.,"Star Wars VII is a great mix between the spirit of the original trilogy and the modernity of the prequel one. This movie has these moments when every true fan of the saga will cry, laugh or smile like an idiot! The emotion is here throughout the whole film !! The new characters are quite deep and get along really well with the old (and loved) ones such as Han Solo or Leïa. The little robot BB-8 is very attaching and expressive. The action scenes (space battles, lightsaber fights...) are well made and really absorbing. This movie is absolutely not disappointing and gave real goosebumps to the fan I am. (Moreover it doesn't feature Jar Jar or any Ewok!)"
1781,8,A great Star Wars,"While doing her routine search for items which will bring her daily dose of food, Rey saves a tiny droid which is in need of even more help. Carrying an important piece of information, it must be taken urgently to the rebels. Together with a new friend, she'll have to face many adventures until the BB-8 completes its quest before the First Order gets its hands on him."
1782,7,An average Star Wars movie,"Some of the pacing of the first 45 minutes of Star Wars The Force Awakens was horrible, i'll give you that. Meticulously cut 3-minute long segments of action and a more slow dialogue scenes. But boy does it get better. After i left the theater i was in awe; none of the faults mattered, because the movie as a whole was so pleasurable. It didn't necessarily ""feel like Star Wars"". But does it mean the movie was not good? No. I thought Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith ""felt like Star Wars"". Did i enjoy those movies? Not too much. So what does it all mean? Well, i think we've started to associate Star Wars with certain motifs, such as the music, the clothes the characters wear, the cinematography etc. and we must acknowledge the fact, that Mr. George Lucas has been somehow involved in the making of the previous films and that fact has brought a certain confidence and a sense of security into watching Star Wars movies, even those that are bad. I believe that George Lucas was and still is, the only person who has the right to make bad Star Wars movies, without them fading into obscurity. Many people loved the prequel movies just for the sake of the original ones. If someone else had decided to direct Star Wars Episodes 1-3 and they'd have turned out bad, instead of disagreeing with the films like people do now, everyone would have just endlessly hated them. There would have been riots and after Phantom Menace, there would've been no more Star Wars. But because it was George Lucas, who gave some of us the best moments of our collective childhoods, we took the new films and embraced them. But now was the time for George to step aside and let the new directors take the Star Wars franchise to another level. "
1783,10,"The first adventure movie of the decade, with some great acting.","Was the J.J. Abrams' led adaptation of the 7th Star Wars film any good? Yes, it was a lot of fun, especially addition of the newer talent of John Boyega, who I believe had a better on screen performance than fellow newcomer Daisy Ridley based on his charisma alone. Daisy Ridley's Rey ultimately isn't the damsel that Leia was (face facts, she did have to be rescued from the Death Star by Han and Luke, even though she did go on to become a capable soldier) and is also the main protagonist among the newer cast but there's a layer of some personality missing from her plucky cute tomboy heroine. Harrison Ford is also back as Han Solo, looking less ""scruffy"" but more old and grouchy. Han carries more of this film on his aged shoulders than most viewers seeking new content would probably care for but he's still a funny guy and his old man strength seems to hold up. Domhnall Gleeson as Gen. Hux of the First Order isn't the quiet and menacing figure that Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin was but instead seems to grimace and yells bland rhetoric at his legions of stormtroopers to instill confidence. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, who isn't a Sith but a Dark Jedi (which seems like a matter of semantics) is scary at first in full costume but seems more like an angstful teen at times, though not at the level of epic emo bad overacting by Hayden Christensen. There's just too much from the original trilogy recycled for this movie. Daisy Ridley is a orphaned wanderer on a desert planet, the Republic's military is an undermanned scrappy group of freedom fighters rather than a well organized military, the First Order are the Galactic Empire 2.0 with even the Nazi Salute this time with a genocidal weapon at their use and the Millennium Falcon is still a pile of junk. For the hardcore Star Wars fans and even the casual viewers who've watched the other trilogies, it will be a warm and welcoming return to a beloved fictional universe. Maybe with another film and the Rogue One spin-off there will be a little more room for some creative growth."
1784,6,Let's Get Something Out of the Way,"OK im not A fan of Star Wars but I've seen all the episodes till date and Episode VII is the best one since the original trilogy (IV - V - VI) i honestly think that the ""fan-made"" prequel trilogy about the origins of Dath Vader (A saga i called ""fan-made"" due the fact that Lucas only invent it because fans yell at him asking for Vader's origins) i honestly didn't like it very much"
1785,8,Don't pay attention... Judge yourself...,"The seventh installment of Star Wars is very fast-paced and entertaining to an extent. The events move quickly, the battles are generally over shortly and the characters are fun. That is the most positive I can be about this film."
1786,7,Poorly written but somewhat entertaining,"I liked the first trilogy when I was a kid. I still think that it is the best. The second trilogy was watchable but now that !! I stopped watching at the moment of Harry Han meets Sally Leia, but it was not exactly like this, in fact we were entering the geriatric service of Star Wars. The plot is very similar to the first trilogy. It must be the force that always forces the writers to find one lost soul in the middle of nowhere among all the planets of that solar system of all the galaxies and universes that can exist. It is not just finding the needle in the hay, more the nanoparticle Jane Doe of the needle in that hay. Hey, what's the hell. The rest is just vvvvvvuuwwwwooommmm Psschicscch toov toov."
1787,2,Very unsinspiring,"***No Spoilers ahead*** I don't usually leave reviews, in fact this is my first review, however I felt compelled to after seeing all the negative feedback this film was getting on this site. "
1788,8,"Great JJ, now don't get cocky!","J.J Did a good job. The crushing wight of expectation on this franchise pretty much broke George L, so with that in mind, I think that he did a very good job along with all the cast and Crew, to tell a new refreshing story that both involved characters that we have loved for many years and the force. Those who are true Star Wars fans don't need any more explain about the nature of the force. So as I watched and delved into the ever so subtle art form of relaying the nature of the force and the feelings that are contained within it. I was actually blown away by just how much story telling was going on in the subtext. "
1789,9,Haters gonna hate,"A very good start to a new trilogy. The Force Awakens introduces new interesting characters and the dialogue/action/CGI sequences are far better than the other Star Wars movies. The movie isn't particularly original, nor does it have a fascinating villain like the OG Star Wars films, but it has a great new protagonist and some powerful emotional sequences that allow us to bask in our joy of Star Wars."
1790,8,A very good start to a new trilogy,"Don't mind the 4K negative reviews on here. This was a great continuation of the star wars universe. J.J. Abrams revitalized Star Trek, and he worked his magic again on Star Wars. How anyone could give a movie with Han Solo in it a 1/10 is just madness."
1791,10,Wow,"JJ Abrams is really good at this: recycle the plot, reconfigure the characters and let the action take center stage. It is a simple formula, and it mostly works here. Despite basically being a remake of the first Star Wars - from the plot to the characters - this story feels fresh and fun most of the time. Part of that's performances, but most of it is Abrams' sense of pace: more action, less trade policy. The flaws from the original trilogy are all here, especially the plot holes. But it is hard to notice them when you are having fun reliving the movies of your youth. There are some eye rolls, but I'll take this over the prequels any day."
1792,7,"Recycled, nostalgic, and not half bad",This is the worst (Disney Princess gender switch) movie you never hoped for. The story is a bad joke....every 'action' scene is a bad rip off from the marx Brothers.(when you see it you'll understand) And when you think it could not get any worse..... the boyish looking tomboy goes off and says; I can do it. Wtf?
1793,,My eyes bleed!,"To start this review, first I have to say that objectively speaking, my vote would be 9/10, simply because of several flaws, but subjectively, every aspect of the movie that I enjoyed simply killed those flaws. Plus, everyone else here also writes only subjectively, so that's another reason for 10. Once again, the Star Wars Universe gave us a beautiful fantasy with interesting new characters and a new edition of the old ones that we loved so much. Also, what makes it better than the prequels, is the fact that CGI and all the other effects are perfectly dosed, making it not look like a video game. Despite of the fact that the story reminds us all of New Hope, it is NOT a remake, first of all, Starkiller base, yes, the task is to destroy it, but think of it, what else would the villains do if not a more powerful version of the Death Star. Next, Kylo Ren is nothing like Darth Vader, Kylo Ren is a completely emotional character, a villain with a personality with the light side in him (and not the same light side Darth Vader had in the 6th movie, Kylo Ren killed his member of the family) and also, he is an untrained human, at least not trained enough. Another thing is that the movie left us with a lot of questions that are yet to be answered in the sequels and the movie simply has it all, from fantasy elements, through action, drama, romance, all the way to comedy. It's the type of movie that goes much more into the characters themselves, their psychological than the story itself, despite of it being important. You have to watch this movie as a child, with your heart, not with your intellect and critical eyes."
1794,10,"A movie with 1000 flaws and 100 000 merits - If you turn off your nostalgia button and turn on your childhood button, you will surely enjoy it.","This was never going to be an easy task. We left our heroes 30 years ago, forever frozen in a state of happy ending. Any re-opening of the story, after such a long time, was going to clash with the fond memories and 'what happens next' fantasies we each had. Especially if that involved killing off characters we grew up thinking 'would live happily ever after'. Therefore, if one excludes cynical considerations (money to be made), JJ Abrams and the teams involved must be congratulated for their courage in taking on the challenge."
1795,7,Should one 'kill the father'? I've got a mixed feeling about this,This review will contain spoilers.
1796,9,Star Wars is back.Literally.,"Boy oh boy this movie is good. I came in with no expectations what so ever, unlike many of the fans, and came out exhilarated. For a Star Wars movie, this is definitely one of the franchise's finest."
1797,7,A fantastic mesh of old and new to provide a great movie,There is literally nothing in SW:TFA that is not directly lifted from the first 3 Star Wars Movies.
1798,1,Completely pointless and uninventive self-parody,"It has been a very long time since I saw a movie this bad and one might say that it is somewhat unfair that I write a review of it without having watched all of it. Yes, I deleted the file mid-way. Then again, I do not need to have taken nausea medicine to know it was a bad idea and I do not wish to lose any more time to this terrible remake."
1799,,Worst movie ever,"The Force Awakens is an exhilarating romp that is a joyful two hours of drama, excitement and above all, fun."
1800,9,"Exhilarating, joyful and a great cinema experience",First review on this site kinda as a response to all the negativity.
1801,9,Don't give in to the hate,The force is strong with this film. Bloody marvelous. proper Star Wars is back!!! Can't wait to see it again.
1802,10,Bloody marvelous,"This is one of the best movies of the year! It stays true to the source material while paying homage to the prequels as well. It s not stop action from scene to scene. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher do a great job reprising the roles that made them legends. Lets hear it for the new boys as well. Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac come alive on the screen and I cant wait to see what they do next. "
1803,10,10 Stars a Perfect homage to the source material,"Yes, I am cynical: I realize that the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy is a naked cash grab by Disney; now that Disney owns Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise, they naturally want to squeeze every last dime from it they can. I know this clashes with the artistic vision of Star Wars' creator George Lucas, who saw the prequels as a natural end to his franchise. That said, does that mean that the first of the sequel films is garbage? Absolutely not! In spite of being a cash-grab-of-a-film that did not need to be made, ""The Force Awakens"" is at the very least a fun and entertaining movie. It provides just the right balance of nostalgia and newness that young and old fans can enjoy. "
1804,7,Decent Space Opera; Gives the People What They Want,"When the prequels were initially released I was just a baby. Not until a decade later would I be introduced to the Star Wars universe. While visiting my uncle in Dallas, he was taking me through memory lane of his childhood. While doing so, he mentioned Star Wars. I didn't grow up under a rock, so I was familiar with the name, and a few of the main characters. He explained to me his experiences watching the Original trilogy, and what it was like in the theatre when Vader proclaimed to Luke he was his father in ESB. He told me what the movies meant to him, and this instantly made me wanna see what he was trying to sell to me. "
1805,10,The Force Has awoken... (Spoiler Free),"Who are we kidding, this is a retread of A New Hope. It's fun and interesting, but it's not original or worth the long wait. Lucas was a visionary storyteller, but selling to mega corporations like Disney, was not a great move for the fans. I enjoyed this film, but it is not even remotely close to Lucas's style. Say what you will about the prequel saga, at least it wasn't recycling plots, or replicating story beats. Another Death Star. That was done in the original saga. Great range of characters, but this is only for the masses. The sequel would deliver an original storyline and leave us in some interesting places for the concluding episode."
1806,7,Reboot of A New Hope,"It seems that after those prequels, Star wars finally got it right. The characters are great, the settings are great, an the story follows everything a Star Wars Movie should follow."
1807,9,This is the Star Wars We've Been Waiting For,"Overall bit better than Episode I, well executed and updated yet classic CGI Episode VII is great for all viewers. Predictable plot, predictable twists, lackluster re-skinned technology, and underwhelming cast pulls this movie down to a 7. If you are an avid fan of the franchise, this movie will no doubt be slightly disappointing but as a production it attracts new viewers to the franchise without overloading them with information and has levels to the dialogue that is friendly for all ages. It has enough Easter- eggs to reward veteran viewers and builds suspense over the unraveling of the gap well. The movie just answers enough questions to keep us interested."
1808,7,Almost great,Have never written a review before. Feel compelled.
1809,1,C'Mon. Are you kidding me? (SPOILERS),"The Force Awakens perfectly channels everything we've been needing as a sequel since Episode VI (1983), and by ""we"" I mean those who wanted more Star Wars films. Many Star Wars fans disagreed with a sequel being made as soon as it was announced, therefore they trashed it before and after it came out. So, we have three sort of people when it comes to watching TFA:"
1810,10,Everything it needed to be. Perfectly executed.,"I have watched this film twice, and both times I thought it was a fairly great film, this film has so many things that are done right that the average person is not going to notice. The first item that this film does right is the cinematography, this is brilliant because the photography of this film is done and it done without any flaws. The second item that this film does correctly is the editing, J.J. Abrams has managed to show other directors the perfect timing. The third item which I like about this film is the writing, because this helps with the pacing, although there are some plot conveniences but overall the writing is done to very good standard. Other thing that I like about this film is the acting, the performances are a very strong part of this film and the audience understands these characters and the actions that they commit on screen. The last thing that I like about this film is that the action sequences are done with brilliant timing and coordination. However like every film ever made there are problems with this film, my problems would be the audience doesn't understand why Kylo Ren hasn't completed his training because if he has been apart of the dark side as long as the narrative suggests, Snook should have completed his training with Kylo by that time his is seen on screen. Another item with this film is that the death scene with Han Solo, I don't have a problem that the character died but the death is quickly dealt with, and I personally think the death should have been extended. Overall this is film that a person should enjoy and I don't understand why people are getting upset about small things, I recommend this film to anyone."
1811,8,A Brilliant peace of filmmaking,"so today I watched the new star wars film. I have been greatly anticipating the release of this film for several months and was finally able to see it today. This is my opinion on The Force Awakens... The Film begins with the classic title sequence that is a quintessential star wars element; the sudden fanfare and the words 'STAR WARS' instantly made me sit up in my seat and now makes me expect the best as I personally associate that entrance with many happy memories of the first 6 films and it was an early indicator that Spielberg was going to stick to the book when it came to star wars. The film jumps straight into the action with a storm trooper landing party engaging in combat to retrieve a map that points to the missing last Jedi (Luke Skywalker) we also encounter the new R2-D2; the BB-8 droid (who features heavily in the movie) whom is an excellent character and an excellent addition to the star wars cast. In the first few minutes we are also introduced to the new Darth Vader who it known as Kylo Ren and also to the new Storm trooper design. The new outfit bears much resemblance to the old storm trooper but with a different life support pack design and also a new helmet shape. Kylo Ren proved an interesting character in the film but I was let down when he removed his helmet to reveal that he was just a normal healthy human with no life threatening injuries or mutilations. A new character to the Star Wars protagonists role is John Boyega or 'Finn'. Finn was an interesting character being the first ever storm trooper to defect to the resistance and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this initially bewildered storm trooper become the hero of the resistance. Finn also provides some humour to the film and closely mimics the same journey that Luke makes in terms of self discovery. Humour features more heavily in this film and I felt in some ways that this made the film cheaper in a way as it lowered it guard to try and keep up with the demands. Also new is Rey who I thought was an interesting and refreshing new character and is someone who is distinctly marked out to be a key player in the next few films. The film itself was littered with references to previous films both in the plot line and in small side references which I thought was a clever move to draw in the die-hard star wars fans. The First Order's base resembles very closely the death star, even to the trench run at the end of the film by the X-wings to try and destroy the base. For me Spielberg was following a New Hope just a little too closely as it was basically the same plot line. The Bad guys build a giant weapon that can destroy planets and the rebels have to stop them just in time before the rebels get blown up themselves. Sound familiar? Modern day CGI and graphics means that the battles in the film were exceptional and very clean cut. Although many traditional components of Star wars were still kept an exciting springboard has been created both in terms of plot and new content for the next star wars films. I would like to add my 8 would be an 8.7 but apparently that is to picky. Favourite scene would be the X-wings flying over the lake which was stunning. Overall a solid performance and a film that maintains the high standard."
1812,8,Star Wars A New Hope... wait a second.,"I just came back for the movie theater. I never wrote anything about movies before here, but now i feel like i have to, because this is the first time i got so overflowed with thoughts and feelings, i don't know what to do with them. After I turned two, my father got the original trilogy on VHS for Christmas. Sure, i don't remember that, but I remember the next few years, when i spent countless hours watching them and by the time i stepped into elementary school, i know every line by heart. I was a lonely child, due to both by nature and circumstances, and these films were my castle, a place I've always felt safe, even in the most fearsome times. (this isn't exaggeration) I'm sure that the movie is not without mistakes, that not everybody agrees with the casting choices or with the plot, but they're gonna write about it, so thank god, I don't have to. I just want to thank you, all of you, who made it happen, that I can relive some of my most precious memories. This film felt like coming home, and being welcomed, and i haven't felt like this in a very long time. Sitting in the theater with my father and crying and gasping at the same time was something that i only remember from my long lost childhood, and nothing can take that away, no bad reviews or overreacting fans. So, Thank you, and have a wonderful Christmas."
1813,10,"Personal thoughts, no spoiler.","No film has ever carried such onerous baggage as The Force Awakens. You cannot talk about it as a film without seeping into its role as the seventh installment in a franchise, and/or the first part of a new trilogy. The film is expected to both homage revered elements of the past (Han, Chewy, Leia, etc) and exorcise its demons (e.g. the white-heavy cast of episode 4). On reflection, this is a near-impossible task, but the writers and director do just enough here to create anticipation of a fitting climax to the Star Wars saga in episodes 8 and 9. The greatest achievement is the new generation of characters. Daisy Ridley as Rey is a feisty, pugnacious incipient Jedi, much less marzipan than Luke was when we first met him, and far more prepared for the fight. John Boyega as Finn brings comic potential and real spine. Marked out in the beginning by a smear of blood, a darkness in his backstory is hinted at, and should offer up narrative gold if correctly handled. BB8 is also marvelously animated and seems to be starstruck by R2D2. Darth Vader is gone but his spirit lives on, and seems destined to grow. The beloved characters from the original are threaded in astutely, and give the film most of its emotional kick, including a genuinely moving climax, that still hits you in the chest even though you see it coming. Less successful is the cookie-cutter storyline, about a droid carrying secrets that require the Resistance to blow up a planet-destroying weapon of mass destruction - shamelessly and embarrassingly cut-and-pasted straight from Episode 4. Star Wars also gets away with using coincidence far more than any other franchise, but still there is something egregious about the timing of R2 joining the action. Excellent production design sees the Empire (re-branded as First Order) become more overtly menacing and 1940s nuanced, and the planets seem to have culture and grit. Not an outstanding film then, but a competent one, that fashions to work in its own right while whetting the appetite for what is to come."
1814,7,satisfactory,"There are flaws and, yes, it is more of a reboot than a sequel, but after the complete trash that were Episodes I-III, this was a blast of fresh air. John Williams brought us fresh new sounds along with the familiar leitmotif. The visuals looked authentic and spectacular after the bleh of death-by-CGI of the previous three films. I can't say 'thank you' enough to J. J. Abrams and crew for finally getting this right after all these years."
1815,10,Finally!,"This is not a Star Wars sequel. This is primarily a remake of Episode 4. It is so jam-packed with original trilogy references and direct plot ripoffs, all trying to ram the nostalgia down our throats It gets to a point where it's actually overbearing and distracting from the movie. If you can look past that, it's a decent movie."
1816,6,An unnecessary remake of Star Wars: A New Hope,"I gave this movie a 7 because I do like the casting and the fact that Luke was brought in at the end. This gives me hope that Luke will have a greater role in future squeals. I hope so! My disappointment comes from a very shallow story line. I felt there was no depth to not only the story but the characters. Harrison Ford carried this movie and with his absence in future movies, I think I will rent the number 8. I would have liked to have seen Luke, Hans and Leia come together so that their chemistry could come through...something that Start Trek has done so well and JJ Abrams was able to recreated in the first two reboots. They should have given us more history on Rey and Finn. Where did Rey get her ""force?"" for example."
1817,,"Good, not Great","So to knockout any confusion, yes, I have seen the other Star Wars movies, but only a handful of times. The prequels and originals alike I have seen, but not very many times. That said, The Force Awakens was truly spectacular!"
1818,9,"Not a Star Wars fan, but still loved it nonetheless","There are two ways to review for Star War Fanatics and for Children<br /><br />For Children JJ Abrams couldn't come close to Lucas, Adam Driver with or without his helmet is no Darth Vader. There are no Teddy Bear heroes, and the overall story is a bit more convoluted than IV, V, & VI attain a 7.5 for 5-12 yo. 7,8, & 9 5-12 yo 6."
1819,6,CGI & Change the hero to female Plagiarism TRILOGY VS TRILOGY,Are they serious !!! 
1820,1,Worst star wars movie ever...,"Star Wars Episode VII, The Force Awakens was an exciting movie. The direction, the acting, the visuals and the plot are very much worth the wait. A very nice continuation to the saga. You can tell this movie is new, because the special effects far outdo any previous installment, but it manages to stick close to the original trilogy that many people loved so much. Overall, it fits perfectly with the original trilogy, unlike the prequels which seem out of place."
1821,,"Reminiscent, but stands on its own","1st-Hans death brought a tear to my eye! I loved seeing the characters back! Chewie was awesome!! Leia was good and Han rocked!! Poe Dameron was a kick ass fighter!! 2nd-I thought it was a very good film...yes there were parts that paid a homage to Episode IV but so what? 3rd-Its not a 10 but no way its below a five. 4th-Everyone needs to stop comparing movies. There will never be another Star Wars or anything like the original trilogy. So give that up. 5th and Last-You need to see the movie and not be thinking here is what I think should happen. Just go see it and relax and enjoy it. Before you know it, Part IX will be out and we will all be depressed"
1822,8,I loved it!,"""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..."" When those famous words appeared on the silver screen once again, followed by the galactic logo and title crawl, the crowd cheered and I felt like a little, excited kid all over again. Seeing the Star Wars logo in the theater again solely almost brought tears to my eyes. What followed was a film that was everything I dreamed it would be. Dazzling, exhilarating, funny, and heart-breaking. This film brought me back to the world of Star Wars."
1823,10,"The Best Star Wars since ""Empire""",But first...
1824,10,Why self-righteous old people and even whiny hipsters can't deface TFA.,"I won't make this long. Well after seeing the movie, I, like most of the others, felt that it was rushed and unnatural, meant mostly for the new generation to attract the audience and to appeal to them. And it still feels like it."
1825,8,Seems bit rushed,"When I first saw ""The Force Awakens"" (TFA) in theatres back in 2015, I left the cinema feeling cold. Nothing in the movie particularly impressed me except its visuals, and Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren. As a whole, I felt cold toward the movie, almost as if it was purposefully keeping me at arms length. However, I was excited to see future installments, specifically to see more of Kylo Ren. It's now 2021, and all three films of the new trilogy have been released, effectively completing the Skywalker saga; it's six years later, and yet I still find myself feeling the exact same way about this movie."
1826,6,"Visually stunning, but thematically underwhelming","It was the same story but a good story with a few new elements. The character interactions, the practical effects, the cinematography, the music, it was all good. The acting was great too. Daisley Ridley really shines in this film and John Boyega was way better than I thought he was going to be. Oscar Issac's Poe Dameron was instantly likable."
1827,8,Star Wars is back! It has some flaws but the good far outweighs the bad.,"Well, I heard this film was going to make billions and it made a GRAND opening in its weekend. But sadly, the force isn't enough for the newly-released Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
1828,7,The Force Has Awaken... for a short while,What a way to bring Star Wars back to life!! 
1829,8,Classic Star Wars from the crawl till the end scene!!!!!,"After looking at a few reviews of this title, I was really confused how so many people hated this movie when it has a 8.6 ATM. But what really confuses me is the amount of people who rate movie purely with the intent to downgrade a rating. Why not give your honest opinion? Either that or this people understand a movie as much as I understand of rating food (which is 0), you should at least take into account other things that aren't the story and how much you liked it. Because if you think this movie is a 1 star, then the originals are 2 stars each, because in terms of a movie they're better but not that better (Return of the Jedi is worst in my opinion). So about the movie itself, it is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in my life, in terms of visuals it's almost if not for two moments due to CGI, the direction of Abrams is amazing, it is not perfect in many ways, like the acting is average (Domhall, Daisy Ridley and Driver are fantastic, but others like Ford are kinda disappointing). The plot is perfectly fine, although if you seen the originals not that long ago you'll notice some parallels, but IMO that actually made the movie better, because it shows how rapidly people forget what they did wrong and do it again (I'm talking about the characters not the creators of the movie). Kylo Ren was perfect in terms of a villain, although he is not Jesus like Darth Vader (watch the prequels) he is better in many ways, he is humane, troubled and even scared. So overall this movie is not the best Star Wars movie ever, but IMO is not that far as people say. 9/10 stars would recommend"

1832,9,Great start!!!,"Despite some negative reviews on here, which kind of baffle me, yes there are parts that refer back to the original films, if they had done something totally different (like the prequals) people would still moan."
1833,10,"A great film, watch it.","Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is the seventh installment of the beloved Star Wars franchise, and it serves to remind us why we were so drawn to this universe in the first place. The movie is set thirty years after Return of the Jedi, with two of our original protagonists front and center: Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) making a brief appearance at the end. But this time around, they are joined by a new generation of heroes: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and a chilling new antagonist known as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)."
1834,8,The Force Awakens,"Whoever gave this a negative review either lost his mind or just wasn't in a particularly good mood, or he broke up with his wife or something. This film is just what one would want it to be, not boring like the prequels but closer to the classical original trilogy."
1835,10,The Force Is Strong With This One. {The negative reviews are wrong},"8.4 /10 from 463,377 users. It is one of those films I have seen when I was a child and instantly fell in love with it. Those things will always have a special place in your heart, they are somehow inscribed in your life, forever. It doesn't mean I will forever like them though. I have recently rewatched all of them and they were just meh... If not for the strong nostalgia, I would probably regret wasting time on them. I really hope for the best with this one, but hey... If it sucks, it sucks. I most definitely will not shove it behind some old feelings for the series. Enough of babbling, let's go~! "
1836,7,tgchan says YES~! / www.tgchan.pl,"After reading a lot of negativity on this site I felt inclined to review this film, I have seen it three times after all. "
1837,9,"An emotional return to a galaxy far, far away.","There is a moment towards the middle of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' when Han Solo says the following to Rey and Finn - ""It's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true."" - that particular line of dialogue to me completely and very clearly established and underlines the motive and the intent of JJ Abrams and Disney as a whole behind their collective approach in restarting the Star Wars Saga. Since the souring of the mood and the spirits of the diehard Star Wars fans triggered by the prequels, there had been a prolonged gap. The basic idea of 'The Force Awakens' is to end that gap by reaffirming the myths, the legends and the magic of Star Wars and reassure the fanbase with a film that symbolises the phrase - 'Star Wars(in its original form) is back !!!'"
1838,7,Bringing back Star Wars !!!,"'The Force Awakens' is great storytelling that is very reminiscent of the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, VI) with a new boldness that hasn't really been part of the saga since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. It also is a great introduction to new characters and new worlds. Yes, the story may have a few similarities to Episode IV and perhaps one or two references to Episodes V and VI. However, unlike others who have posted on IMDb, I do not believe this movie is nothing more than a rehash. When evil powers are conquered, they tend to find ways to (or at least try to) do it better the next time. That is why, in this movie, we see a new and more sinister presence from the Dark Side and a First Order with a far more powerful weapon than previous military powers of the Empire. How often has it been said that history tends to repeat itself? Therefore, the fight between good and evil may have similar stories but may have different outcomes. This movie is a wonderful addition to the 'Star Wars' saga and I know many people (including myself) who have already seen it more than once because they love it. And I believe there is something to be said for its success when this movie may surpass the $1 Billion mark (worldwide) by the end of this weekend! May The Force Be With You!"
1839,9,A wonderful addition to the 'Star Wars' saga!,"What an undeniably difficult task to direct this film. You need to appease a loyal and vocal fan base, appeal to a new audience and stamp your own mark on the biggest franchise in cinema history. I think overall JJ Abrams was successful to a large extent but also failed to take the risks that made the original trilogy so special."
1840,6,Well done JJ Abrams,Normally I like to write reviews on IMDb to push up some ratings & give some merit for movies I like. Rarely I come here to show my disappointment for a particular movie and that's what The Force Awakens makes me feel.
1841,4,Kind Of Disappointed! Poor Show!,"I would just say JJ did it! With great new leads armed with stellar performances, the original trio back, the iconic score, the visual effects a masterful blend of practical and computer effects, emotional depth, tiny bits of nostalgia present almost everywhere and fantastic villains, The Force Awakens is great way to resume the franchise. The opening, with many of the film's characters, is thrilling and establishes Kylo Ren as a villain to be feared upon."
1842,9,Best Since the Originals,"This is the story of mid 20s young adult female Rey, introducing English actress 'Daisy Ridley'. As Luke Skywalker, performed by 'Mark Hamill' in the 1970s, Rey must escape a father- and motherless desert planet in the ""Star Wars"" galaxy."
1843,9,A Skywalker Mirror,"While The Force Awakens is a great experience for a Star Wars movie, I will say as a movie it suffers from an expectations issue. Like many fan I was going into this movie with ""New Hope""s that J.J. Abrams & Kathleen Kennedy would return the franchise to it's former glory. I believe as a set up movie for a new trilogy it does this in spades."
1844,9,A good movie with over expectations (possible small spoilers),"I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. My heart was pounding in the more intense scenes. The theater collectively laughed at the humor, gasped at the plot reveals, and cheered for our heroes in the moments of triumph."
1845,10,An Amazing Action Thrill Ride With Heart!,"I've given TFA 6 out of 10 because for 60 percent of my time watching it I was entertained, the other 40 percent I was a little disappointed."
1846,6,Flawed but Entertaining,"Okay, OKAY, I have read through some of these comments and WHAT A JOKE! The lot of you. Every Star Wars fan since 1999 - 2005, has been sooking and crying wanting it to be like 4,5 and 6! So what does JJ do? Makes a kick off to a new trilogy, exactly how you wanted, a rehash of the original?? What more do you want from it? Cause guess what, ROTJ was more predictable than any of them, even sitting in that cinema, I knew exactly what was going to happen, but you know what? I didn't care!!"
1847,10,Tired of these fanboy hipsters!,"For those of you who have doubts about the ratings that are being given to this film - keep doubting them. Let the fanboys give their 10/10s, and let the haters give their 1/10s. But let me say this - having rewatched all the episodes, 'The Force Awakens' stands as the third best 'Star Wars' film in the franchise - just behind the original 1977 'Star Wars' and 'The Empire Strikes Back'."
1848,7,'Star Wars' is finally restored to its former glory.,I've seen it twice now and here's my input.
1849,9,Fantastic....don't listen to the wantabe critics,"I went into this movie with high hopes. J.J. Abrams did a great job of resurrecting Star Trek and there's no way it could be worse than the prequels. While it was definitely better than the prequels, the movie definitely did not live up to the hype, nor did it live up to even the level of the new Star Trek movies. It's not a BAD movie, it's just not a GOOD movie - overall, it's just average. There are four problems with this movie - a recycled plot, some poor dialogue, a few instances of poor acting, and a appallingly bad villain."
1850,6,The Force Aweakens,"I've only made it though half the film, but it's basically written for an adolescent audience, depicting as many cliché tropes as only Disney could aspire. The acting is overly emotive and exaggerated to compensate for the perpetually lacking dialogue, which is dull and boring; The characters speak in short phrases, similar to bleak IMs, in order to progress this spastic narrative forward. The characterizations are weak and inconsistent, but the action is relentless and intense to distract from all of the above. Pretty tragic thing what Disney has done to this concept with a production budget so large with such enormous potential. It's like if Star Wars met High School Musical."
1851,2,Terrible casting and dialogue,This is one really awful movie to watch. but pleases Disney stockholders and to me that is sad because it is such a terrible gender flip.The girl is just ugly. grow yer hair for heaven's sake and try to be attractive! I paid $15 for this!!!!!!!!!!!
1852,,JJ Abrams Makes More Dough For His Ex-Wife,"Ah, Star Wars, you really revolutionized film-making since the 1970's-80's and we missed you so much since then."
1853,9,There has been an awakening and I definitely felt it!,"Being a massive Star Wars fan, I went along to the midnight launch in 3D (UK) and I was completely blown away from start to finish! I didn't get to sleep until 4am and I was due in work later that morning... I've been back to see it again, it was that good!"
1854,10,A-Mazing!!!,"Watching Star Wars VII will definitely gives you the shivers! The movie manages to combine the new with old, paying a lot of respect to the legacy (New Hope) and prepares a new SW generation for the future. There's no ultimate bad and good guys here, there are gray zones and that's what makes the heroes so interesting. Yes sir, there are plot holes, but I guess most of them will be filled in the next episodes. As for now I am 100% emotionally satisfied, as J.J.Abrams delivered more drama that I was expecting. The music is the weakest installment of all, but still J.Williams delivered a magnificent space opera (go listen to 'Rey's Theme')."
1855,10,"From the ashes of LucasFilms shall be woken, A light from the Disney shall spring; Awaken shall be Force that was forgotten; The Star Wars is back as it should be",THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!!!!
1856,8,Anything we have not seen before?,"Let's first make it clear i'm not a devout Star Wars fan. But like the rest of mankind I do like the old trilogy a lot. I also hugely enjoyed the phenomenal Nintendo Gamecube games. So, i can still say I am a fan. The second trilogy was disappointing and lowered the status of the franchise. Still, watching it a year back, i couldn't say I wasn't entertained by the second and especially the third movie. I don't take a Hollywood product too serious. My expectations for The Force Awakens weren't that high due to the previous trilogy and maybe that's the reason The Force Awakens was a pleasant surprise to me. "
1857,7,The charm of low expectations,"The same thing that happens in ""a new hope"" happens in ""return of the Jedi"" so why should that matter when it's practically the same thing that happens again in this film.It doesn't make it any more less entertaining. no! The film is good, really good. but yes we have seen it before, it's part of the franchise. The acting is excellent, the visuals are spectacular, and you can tell there are more practical effects (with puppets) rather than silly cgi- characters. But there is a difference. It's more gritty than before. When a laser blaster is fired it's more like a real rifle than a children's toy. They have more stopping power than we used to. When a planet is destroyed we get to see the effect from the eyes of the soon to be exterminated. When Disney took over they didn't go for more child friendly approach, that's for sure."
1858,8,"Quick paced adventure, not a dull moment but some plot devices are repeated","I'm gonna be honest here. Star Wars: Episode VII was the only reason why I started watching Star Wars in the first place. Since it was so popular ($2 billion, seriously? I thought Star Wars wasn't a thing anymore!), I decided to take a look at the franchise and seeing how the original and prequel trilogies were, I was expecting this movie to also be somewhere across those lines. Turns out it is nothing like them. First of all, let's get the praises done with. The CGI is awesome. With that said, let's move on to the bad stuff."
1859,6,"10 stars for the CGI, -4 for everything else","i had the luck to see this film on the big screen and.....and i find Star Wars The Force Awakens a very good film, but it is not that great or perfect as some people say, still a good film, but why isn't bad or perfect as some people say?(At least for me )"
1860,8,The Force is strong with this one,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is best characterised by the film's impressive desert shot of the grounded Star Destroyers on Jakku. Like the rusting corpses of the once awe-inspiring warships of the Galactic Empire, J. J. Abrams' latest work is a husk of the original trilogy, relying on a near-fanatical fan base and some spectacular special effects to prop up an embarrassingly familiar plot through a two-hour runtime."
1861,6,Visionary? More like vision is scary.,"Basically, I would summarize: Disney is now a corporation ruled by lobbies that want to program the minds of children and young people while making enormous amounts of money."
1862,1,Disney killed Star Wars saga,As I watched this movie I had tears in my eyes of joy. It's fresh and new and at the same time visits familiar territory. I have always been a fan of the dark side of the force. This film makes the dark side feel closer to home then Vader and the Emperor off in a space station office. The thing about Star Wars movies that makes me hold my breath is the very beginning after the epilogue letters fly past the screen. Then the camera always shows some really cool space flight action. This does not disappoint and sends the message that the Empire (i.e. now called the First Order means business. I loved this movie and I want to see it over and over again just like the previous six movies. This is the best Star wars movie ever.
1863,10,The best Star Wars movie,"There are no happy ever afters, as long as someone can think of a new story to tell. The heroes from the original trilogy were last seen celebrating at the end of Return of the Jedi, but it turns out that they have had a pretty rough time of it since. It is necessary to the plot, because happiness doesn't generate much drama, but it makes the return to the Star Wars universe bittersweet. It also takes away from the original victories. There is still a big, bad bully and the Jedi have not only returned but have left again in the intervening years, leading to a situation not unlike the one before Return of the Jedi, be it with mostly new players."
1864,8,Warmly calculating,"First of all, I love Star Wars series because it is not SF, but it describes the family relation and the problem of virtue and evil. The background is imaginary, but we have the same problem as its core theme. In Star Wars episode VII , many people discuss mainly ""who is Ray? "" And I think she describes the figure of every girls live this modern society. She is asked "" Who are you?""by everyone, and also ask herself the same way. She cannot sure her identity, but she has strong mental power to live through life. This implies the way girls live their life . Moreover, Kylo Ren's inner weakness suggests human's weakness. His appearance seems to be very strong and evil, however, his true figure is very fragile. He cannot establish his existence and seems to have bemusement about which he belongs, ""virtue or evil?"". Such conflict often occurs when we live life. Anyway, I cannot wait the sequel."
1865,8,Love Star Wars,"Disclaimer: The following review comes from a guy whose penchant is horror (mostly); I have never been a die-hard Star Wars fan; I think George Lucas has terrible, HUGE hairand his tendency to change what he deemed ""mistakes"" from Episodes IV-VI: stupidity—when he should have spent that time making the prequels something worthy of all the efforts put into them (or worth watching EVER). EVER. The fact that the many computers rendering all the unnecessary prequel CGI (& ""special edition"" versions of the original trilogy) that looked like crap did not stage a Terminator revolt proves that computers have no free will. That is another review, but this is all I will write of it. Moving on Many heads of frenetic fans exploded like a Death Star when Walt Disney Pictures bought Lucas out of his own franchise. What would become of the charm Episodes IV-VI embodied prior to 1997 & the violation of the force aka the prequels? Many hiss at J.J. Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise, but I have considered the 2009 version rather enjoyable & Into Darkness an improvement. Still, his signature lens-flare-jump-zoom-please-the-audience-at-any-and-all-cost approach often sacrifices story & character. However, he is not an ignorant man. He seems to take criticism constructively, enhancing his abilities to new parsecs er-umm, I mean heights! Clearly a lifelong fan of the original trilogy, Abrams capitalized on Disney's $3 billion-dollar-purchase of Lucasfilm LTD by creating something that is and will likely always be to this generation what Episode IV was to those who came before us."
1866,8,Disney Abrams' Star Wars Episode 7: The Force of New Hope,"I admit to be only a mild fan of The Star Wars series. Yes, I saw the original back in 1977, and it was the best one. Still, I prefer THX 1138, and the original Star Wars was just very good. The worst one was (this causes the grossest confusion) the sixth one filmed. The one with Ewan McGregor was a horrible letdown, and just abysmal. This one is the seventh one filmed and it is at least as good as New Hope and The Return Of The Jedi. We have the storm trooper who defects,and this pretty woman who we can guess is the daughter of Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker. Right away we see the great actor Max Von Sydow. His part was cut short. Harrison Ford was as funny as ever. The other actors are not really well known yet, but they seemed to be good sidekicks to Han Solo ' s personality. It was neat at the end when the woman heroine just hugged Princess Leia and it ended with She and Luke Skywalker looking at each other, rather than admitting that she must be their daughter. The special effects were good. I think the movie was decent, but then again the original Star Wars was just a very good movie."
1867,6,Decent and Entertaining.,"Wow. Got to go see this on first day of release and it was unbelievable. JJ has lived up to expectation to the most anticipated film of this year. The way that he creates a whole new world with the planet of Jakku is brilliant. We all know how good a director JJ Abrams is but he has stepped up a level with this new film. I love the way that Han and Chewy get introduced into the film after the younger generation of actors enter the grand millennium falcon. I think that Daisy, Jihn and Oscar have really settled in nicely with the all the other stars like Harrison, Carrie and Mark as their acting was sublime. Lastly the way this movie has been filmed with all the special effects and fantastic costumes is beyond me because it pretty much looks real. He has made a perfect start to this powerful trilogy and I honestly can't wait for the Star Wars Epidode VIII."
1868,10,Perfect start to the trilogy,"Well, I don't really know what to say other than I was left a little unfulfilled. I don't even think it's as good as Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace."
1869,7,Not the special film I had waited for,"Waited in line for four hours opening night. WELL WORTH IT. You will not be disappointed. I've seen it three more times since then and I would go again in a heart beat. This is by far my new favorite movie. The only downside to my experience was that there was a blown speaker at the theater I went to. Can't wait for it to be released on DVD so that I can watch it whenever I want to. Even though it was kind of the same as Star Wars IV, it was still amazing. Would have also been better if Luke was in it for more than 5 minutes. Another problem I had was that a guy at my theater decided to yell out that Han was killed by his son before the movie started."
1870,10,Best Star Wars Yet!,"Some nice jokes, an old story, and a missed chance to create a real new story with new characters that have their own personality traits."
1871,6,Nice to watch but many missed chances....,"I really don't have to regurgitate the facts other negative reviewers have already written, it is ALL true! Plot is idiotic, characters are pale and uninspired, the camera work (live and CGI) is unimpressive, unconvincing. Director/production haven't even taken time to create all the puppets/characters they need, there's a staggering array of reused costumes in this production. Sad, very, very sad! Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher look like they should have stayed in a senior home where they live. Slow, uninterested, expressionless. The emo main villain looks like someone just told him he's grounded. There's not even a HINT of evil, even for a newbie dark Jedi. Greg Grunberg as a fighter pilot is an insult to all fighter pilots, real or imaginary. He looked like a headache from Heroes was still torturing him. Greg, the thing is called ""tylenol"". And lay off the hard stuff at least a day before shooting. The whole darn thing is a reboot of an already seen stuff, all of it, but with no quality and unconvincing. I deeply regret spending money on this POS! I may never see another SW movie again, especially if JJ Abrams comes anywhere near it! What a sad, sad waste of my time!"
1872,1,"Horrendous movie, I may never see another Star Wars again","Star Wars is back, that is the highest of compliments. JJ Abrams has masterfully directed us 40 years back in time to a dirty world in a galaxy far, far away. The nods back to the original trilogy are many, but never feel forced or makes you go ""enough already"". And the moments we've all been dreaming of were there including an amazing last scene. The new main characters Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and bad guy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are introduced in a fantastic way and I was blown away by the talent of Adam Driver who plays a very complex character that not at all feels like a new version of Darth Vader but very much his own character. The chemistry between Finn and Han, and between Finn and Rey I found to be great enough to ensure an intriguing new trilogy in the Star Wars universe. The movie does leave a lot still open which bodes well for Episode 8 and probably even Episode 9. Perhaps the only problem I had with the movie is that it does imitate A New Hope one too many times, but while being blown away by the fantastic shots of The Force Awakens it is not something that really takes anything away from the movie. The Force has awakened in a big way, and I would like to personally thank JJ Abrams for taking me back to my childhood."
1873,9,The Force Is Strong With Jar Jar Abrams,"So yeah, it draws heavily on Episode IV, but so what? It's been almost 40 years. I welcome this nostalgia-filled adventure that gives us everything that worked for the first trilogy and none of the mistakes of the second. It introduces new characters in that familiar universe and they are going to be the heroes for a whole new generation. Deal with it."
1874,9,Don't mind the haters. It is awesome.,SPOILERS BELOW!
1875,8,I think I saw most of this in 1977,"Star Wars is fun! I like it all. Even those movies in the future I already like! But Star Wars are basically a fight of The Good (Jedi) against The Evil dark Side! And I am sorry but the reality are not like that! For Example: If you think that Nazi Deutschland are evil, you need to study more about WAR History versions. Or you need to study the Winner who wrote the War History and the War History from those who lost the WAR! I am a Big FAN of Werner Von Braun! He worked for Hitler. Designing rockets. He also worked for NASA!! But I do not know what happened with his Heritage! Also will be Fun, if one day we Saw a Movie, that a Scientist create a machine that allow everybody to change gravity in a controlled way and moving objects! This could be the Biggest threat to both sides. The Jedi and the Dark Side. Maybe they join forces to kill the scientists!! Would be FUN!!!!"
1876,9,Fun,"I have one but two confessions to make. One is that I have never watched any Star War movies before this one. And two is that this was an accidental choice since the other movies were sold out.However, within 15 mins I knew I was not going to be disappointed. "
1877,7,Entertaining !!,"The Force Awakens is mostly a rehash of ANH with some ESB and ROTJ thrown in the mix. It has plenty of plot holes you can easily fly the falcon trough, but is so much damn fun nonetheless an just what someone who loved Star Wars as a kid wants to see after 30 years. Yes I've grown up and like other films better, but I didn't expect another Empire compared to A New Hope. And if you don't also you will not be disappointed."
1878,8,"Predictable, full of plot holes, But nevertheless: A whole lot of fun!!","It's finally here! Yes, this film does exist and isn't just a figment of everyones imagination. The most anticipated film of all time has finally landed. So, the question on everyones mind is, how good is it? (No, the question isn't, is it any good?) I think that by now everyone is convinced that This film will be good. But how good is it? The answer to this question is, it is perfectly adequate. Now, don't tear me to pieces quite yet. Here me out first and if you still want my head on a silver platter, that's fine. 'The Force Awakens' takes place roughly thirty years following the events of episode six or 'Return of the Jedi'. But this time we follow some new faces."
1879,6,"A good, if flawed, film.","OK, OK, OK. I wrote that title in case the writers/producers/director/whomever it is reads this (hey, maybe John Boyega will see this) and gets him to stop over-breathing for no reason in the next movie. Once you notice it, you can't un-notice it. It drives a boy crazy."
1880,10,Does Finn have Asthma? Why is he constantly breathing heavily for no apparent reason?,"UGH!!! I didn't believe when people said that this copy-pasted episode IV. They weren't kidding. I like Oscar Isaac and John Boyega (from other things. It felt like they were hardly in this) and I hope they end up doing more in this trilogy (I had to do digital gymnastics to avoid spoilers because I hadn't seen these until two hours ago). And that giant guy, Snoke, was also kinda cool. I hope he plays a role in the other movies."
1881,7,So boring it hurts,"This film is essentially a remake of the original Star Wars (episode IV) and, for me, it was a huge disappointment. The original film had many visual effects that were new and original. Working with the much enhanced palette of computer graphics, this film is visually boring and introduces nary an original image or sequence. The creativity that turned a space soap opera into the most influential film of its time is sadly lacking in this new opus. The film introduces a set of new characters for the many Star Wars sequels yet to come. And again, not one really strikes a creative note as a basis for future episodes. I loved the original three Star Wars (IV, V and VI). This film is a miss."
1882,5,A Huge Disappointment,"Over all, I am very pleased. 8/10!"
1883,8,Great fun but a few things could have been much better,"This was the 4TH best film in the franchise so far, behind the three originals, even return was a little bit better because it was an actual Star Wars film. This one was sort of like Star Trek meets Star Wars characters. It shouldn't even be under the scifi genre this was an action suspense/mystery movie? Why was it a mystery movie? Because they didn't explain the character origins of the MAIN CHARACTER. You thought Finn would be the main character because he was the focal point of the trailers and that he was introduced first and had a motive, BUT YOU'RE WRONG AS HELL. The actual main character is Ray which makes no sense because she isn't as interesting as Finn and she can pilot, scavenge, build, and USE THE FORCE?!! Why do they not explain this at all, she didn't even need a trainer to be able to use JEDI MIND TRICKS, FORCE FOCUS, OR FORCE RESIST. So in essence, instead of making Finn the main character with a motive and a back story, they missed an opportunity of making Ray the new Han Solo scavenger character... I know they're going to explain her origins more in the trilogy but generally, you need to have a main character that is all mystery, or explained enough to keep us interested and then reveal the rest later."
1884,,"Raises more questions than answers, good fun.","To start with,lets get a closer look to the characters. I think Kylo-Ren can easily overcome Darth Vader providing that he survives in the next movies and keeps being such a devoted personality to the dark side.After all, if you compare Kylo's first appearance to Vader's in episode IV I believe that Kylo is by far a more interesting and intriguing character.Now, lets pass to the main character, Rey.I reckon that Rey develops her character a lot as at first she seems to be incapable to react(when that fat guy takes advantage of her since he gives her no food) in contrast with her last battle versus Kylo where she kind of tears him apart. Gongrats to Daisy Ridley for achieving such a great change to her character. Speaking of Finn I think that hes a mystery which is going to be solved in the next movie-movies. I mean that everyone would definitely like to know more about his past and his training as a Stormtrooper. In addition, I cant say a lot about Poe as his played a little and I would like to know more about him before judging him. However, he seemed like a non-main character which is actually kind of fail as he was one of the first appearances of the film. As far as Snooke is considered I demand an explanation about his past and his real body in the next movie from dear J.J.Abrams. The most unappealing character of the film was Captain Phasma because we all expected her to be the new Bobba Fet but finally she was a HUGE FAIL. The story, and the scenario developed with a good flow as there were a few surprises(Han's appearance etc). However, there were some gaps. For example, how was the First Order recreated? Whats the origin of Snooke? I hope they will all be filled in the next movies. Last but not least, the special effects were simply awesome. To sum up, I would say that it is undoubtedly a worth-watching film and it can also compete the other six films."
1885,8,Very good comeback,This review contains spoilers.
1886,9,An outstanding reintroduction into the Star Wars universe,"I was thoroughly entertained by this movie, and it seemed too short (a good sign for me). JJ's job was to bring the next generation of star wars to a new audience, while satisfying the older audience, and tie the story lines together. He played it safe by not creating a bold new story, rather he focused on character exposition and depth. Also he set the stage for the next movies by opening up all sorts of questions and potential plot devices. The acting is simply incredible, on par with any major successful movie. If you're looking for a complicated storyline as in the prequels, you won't find it here, but this movie will make you FEEL. I'm happy for it. After seeing episode I in the theater, I was embarrassed for Star Wars and George Lucas. After episode VII, I am excited to see where it goes and feel like it can be taken seriously again."
1887,8,It accomplished exactly what it needed to,"This is even too good grade for this movie but its based on that I was sure Kylo will spare his father Han Solo but he killed him, rest of it was a joke"
1888,6,R U kidding me JJ? SPOILER ALERT,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a wonderful movie. The cinematography is amazing, the direction is great, the pacing is the right amount of fast, the visuals are beautiful, the acting is great, the fight scenes are extremely well done. The characters have great development and both the new cast and the old cast are exceptional."
1889,9,The Franchise Re-awakens!,"Im watching the films in chronological order and despite enjoying it a lot the first time I watched it, now I dont enjoy it as much because I feel Im just seeing a worse version of episode VI. Besides that I dont really find any of the new characters interesting and actually dislike them a little. This movie is also much more goofy than the originals or the prequels, there are too many jokes around and at the worse moments. Still, despite having tons of mistakes comparable to the other 2 trilogies, I still can enjoy it."
1890,7,Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V,"I'll keep it brief. J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt took one of the most iconic movies and used it as a road map, knowing that we all fell in love with it when we were 8 and knowing that we will all get that same warm and fuzzy feeling seeing it again 30 years later. Knowing that we've yearned for a return to form...and also understanding that it worked on the 8 year old's of yesteryear, it was destined do the same for today's youth. There was just enough laugh out loud humor, just enough nostalgia and self recognition of it, and there was also a sense that the new protagonists were fans of Star Wars themselves...I truly think (and hope) the writers should use this as a warm memory to Episode IX only to reel us in and shatter our expectations, changing directions and introducing both young and old to uncharted, yet familiar systems."
1891,10,Everything we thought it was and more....,"It's a shame that the writers were not afforded creativity over the storyline. Unfortunately movies seem to be written for absolute certainty of a financial return. There was a great opportunity to develop a new plot and explore the creative scope of the galaxy given our past knowledge and relationships with the previous characters. I watched this movie with great aspirations but sadly I could predict every scene and felt like I was watching the movie for the second time! It was great to see the old characters, just a shame to see them emerced in the same old plot.... we know how it unfolds!!! Here's hoping the next two installments are not replicated from Empire and Jedi, however I am sure creative originality will be scolded and substituted for ""the formula""..."
1892,6,Star Wars - May the Force be lucrative....,The spoilers are for those who did not watch the previous SW movies.
1893,3,Completely unoriginal story,"It was good, at the very least, but not a classic. A bit too safe and predictable? Yes, but then again again it was emotional and clever at times."
1894,8,Almost perfect,"After the prequel movies I thought that star wars as a franchise was doomed for the fact that it just flat out sucked. but with this movie I sorta ate my words. Now before i get into detail this review does some mild spoilers. Now let's talk about cast and characters and I honestly have to say they did a good job. Each actor and actress did a good job and overall gave a good performance and i felt that they all were the right choice for the characters. I mainly want to give props to Daisy Ridley, i think that she has a lot of potential and if she just keeps working hard i feel that she could become an amazing actress. I also felt like the new characters that they gave us were really well written and I think that all the time and effort they put into them was well worth it. It was also good how they developed the characters because I thought that this movie had a lot of good character development. I mainly liked how they made it to where the development of the characters was interesting and how mostly everything that happened to the character mattered and had a purpose which overall gave almost each character a decent character arc that I believe will get wider and better as the series goes on. But there was one character that i thought was a waste of potential was captain phasma and the reason why i say that was because we didn't really see much of her which is a mistake because they could have added a complete different side to character and really made her a part of the star wars universe but instead she turned out to be like boba fett unless she is still alive in the next movie. "
1895,8,good sci fi movie but an OK star wars movie,"Star war repeated itself, again."
1896,8,"Force awakened, how about the audience?","I'm not a big fan of star war series, but I did enjoy shocking when I saw episode of IV, V VI. After I grow up, I went to theater for episode I, II, III. That really killed my feeling for this series."
1897,8,"Much better then episode I, II, III but the story is still stupid","If you are a Star Wars fan familiar with the first 3 films and had liked them, AND did not appreciate the 3 prequels then you may appreciate the comments below."
1898,6,A viable popcorn flick,"Yes, this is not as good at IV, V, and VI but better than I, II, and III."
1899,,"Overall, good but not better than IV, V, VI","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams and is the continuation of the original Star Wars films that were released back in the 1970s and 80s. The film takes place 30 years after Return of the Jedi and tells the story of a war between the dark and menacing First Order, against a small group of Resistance fighters. "
1900,8,I can gladly say that it exceeded my expectations!,"The Force Awakens the first of the new trilogy was pretty enjoyable. Great cast, great sound and visuals. Having a movie that kind of retreads old ground is a problem I have but the characters do help carry it along"
1901,7,A good start with some hurdles.,"Sometimes the universe created by a genius becomes larger than himself. This is exactly the case. The legacy of Star Wars, so wonderfully established back in 1977 in the first film made by George Lucas, was not only fully respected in minute detail in ""The Force Awakens"" as introduced pounds of excitement, fun, wonder and cinematic quality. I always had to myself that the first Star Wars was the best of all episodes in the franchise, even better than ""The Empire Strikes Back"" because it was the film that established most of the canons of this series we love so much. ""Return of the Jedi"", closing the original trilogy, was also an excellent movie with excitement and entertainment. As for the episodes I, II and III, also directed by Lucas, I like them. Apart from midichlorians and Jar Jar Binks, almost unanimously despised by fans, in those stories Lucas introduced a lot of interesting ideas that will remain forever in the imagination of the Force universe."
1902,10,"Let's put it simply: The best SW movie, along with Episode IV","I used to think this was the weakest SW sequel. Yes, below 8 and 9. My thoughts used to be that ""It copies Ep. 4 almost word for word, it killed and disrespected Han Solo for no reason, and it just lacked impact in the long run."""
1903,7,"I was wrong, it's actually pretty good.","I Always liked the first three star wars movies and by that I mean EP's 4 5 and 6. They have fantastic story's, great characters, amazing music, and are a memorable experience.The prequels have a lot of haters and where considered to be bad films. I myself wasn't a fan of them due to there boring story lines, characters and writing/direction, but this movie is even worse IMO. The prequels at least had impressive action scenes and an epic musical score where's this film falls flat in all areas. This film was so over hyped and everyone was telling me how good the film was.So I said to myself you know what I am gonna go see it and after seeing it I thought to myself THIS SUCKS, REALLY SUCKS. Here's the reasons why I though It sucked"
1904,1,"Disappointing, Lackluster, No heart, No passion, and a waste of time",Easily one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I couldn't think of a single negative aspect to this film. All i know is i want to watch it again.
1905,9,Pfft trolls,"Just got back from watching it in 3D and bursting at the seams. The discussion on the drive home with friends was very animated to say the least, but the majority of this review draws upon a lot of things we were in agreement with. The movie is visually stunning. The effects are the best I've seen to date. The landscapes are incredible, you feel size and depth. It really helps with the immersion because of the realism of everything."
1906,8,Child in me was like PEW PEW. Adult in me whined a lot.,"After ten years, this movie brought new life into the star wars universe. The pacing is Incredibly fast and exiting. I was not bored for a second. Visualy its stunning, the soundtrack is great and the new charakters are interesting. The only downside, another death star😑."
1907,8,Aswesome comeback,"For what it lacks in complex story, this film makes up for with a good dose of Star Wars magic. Great performances by the majority of the actors, especially Harrison Ford, really took me back to Episodes iv-vi. "
1908,8,A near return to form,"I don't know where to start with all the different thoughts and the fact that I'm still processing this film. A couple of points. AGAIN, SPOILER ALERT It was decent, but there are some big flaws that need to be addressed. Just to make sure everyone knows: I did like the film, it's probably the third or fourth best Star Wars movie so it's still good, but I just have to confront these conflicts within..."
1909,7,"Decent, but with some flaws... Spoiler ALERT","I did not like this movie because even though Disney had enough money for special effects and good actors, they did not use any of it on coming up with new ideas. They had the same story line of episode 4 and then just tried to make it ""better."" Even though it has been 30 years since episode 6, there have been practically no new inventions. There were still: tie fighters, x wings, storm troopers and so much more. I absolutely hated star killer base because it's just the death star again! Kylo Ren was just a bad Darth Vader in my opinion. Even though I have rated this movie quite low, it's still decent to watch if you don't care about most things I have just listed."
1910,,Episode 4 all Over Again,"When I discovered that George Lucas was passing the torch on to Disney and that there would be a new director I was more than thrilled. I was even happier when I learned that JJ Abrams, A director that is very good at rebooting old beloved franchises (Star Trek), was going to take the reigns as director. I knew that if he did his homework and and took out the incredible amount of CGI that the prequels depended on and just took it back to practical effects, This could be an amazing movie. Did The Force Awakens deliver? YES a million times YES! This movie brought out all of my emotions: Sadness, excitement, anger, and happiness. JJ Abrams did a great job with the characters and made them all actually people. The effects are almost all practical and very little CG was used. The villain, Kylo Ren, was done masterfully and I am thrilled that he will be back in the next movie because as the prequels have showed, we don't need a new villain every movie, it makes things convoluted and difficult to follow. The original trilogy had it right with Sidious and Vader and it seems like this trilogy is going to do it right with Snoke and Kylo Ren. Finn and Rey might be two of my favorite Star Wars characters of all time, they are so likable and they have amazing chemistry, it doesn't seem forced like Anakin and Padme was. Now I'm not saying there will be anything romantic between them but it is quite plausible In up and coming movies. The biggest gripe I hear about this movie is that the plot is basically the original Star Wars plot. I don't really think you can argue that because with this being the seventh movie in the franchise, there is only so much more you can do. And even if it is a very similar plot, the plot from the first movie was AMAZING! So what is your complaint? The plot was just original enough for me to be able to get into this movie and enjoy the hell out of it. "
1911,8,The Star Wars movie we deserve!,"It's a fun movie with fun characters and a pretty fun story. I'm not going to act like it's a great movie, but it's not a terrible movie either. This trilogy is a big disjointed mess, but this movie alone is pretty good."
1912,7,It's alright,It May not be as good as you would have liked it to be. But the acting is far better than in the first reboot. The effects are awesome and the nostalgia is fun. I love it.
1913,8,Stop moaning you sorry wingers.,"I am a massive massive Star Wars fan, particularly of the original trilogy, like most people. When I heard that Disney were doing a Star Wars sequel trilogy I thought to myself ""oh here we go again, just another Hollywood studio cashing in on an already exhausted franchise"". When I saw the trailers for ""The Force Awakens"" I got my hopes up more than I ever imagined I would. I started to believe. And when the critics came out overwhelmingly in favour of the movie after the premiere my expectations went through the roof. Sadly, I think they got it wrong. The Force Awakens is a decent movie, but it is extremely flawed. This is where I think J.J. Abrams got it wrong:"
1914,6,I cant help feeling dissatisfied,"If you're going into this movie expecting the original trilogy, you will get exactly that. Not because the movie is original or well acted like the first three movies, but rather because the plot is identical. The movie had very few battle scenes, and one of those had a storm trooper fighting with some weird sword thing and the other had an inexperienced girl beating a supposedly powerful sith lord, Kylo Ren. Kylo Ren was much more like Anakin in Attack of the Clones than Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, so prequel fans (I know that's an oxymoron) can have something to enjoy too. I never thought I'd think these treacherous thoughts after midichlorians and Jar-Jar, but I kinda miss Lucas. Of the new characters, Poe is the only interesting one at all. Rey combines the blandness of Luke with the uselessness of Leia and Leia is pretty useless in this movie also. I only gave this movie a 4/10 because this movie was at least well made. In a year of disappointing sequels and reboots, The Force Awakens almost looks good."
1915,3,Boring,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is by far the best Star Wars film we've gotten since Empire Strikes back. It's a love letter to fans, from fans This movie was made with absolute love and it shines throughout every corner of the film - from the practical effects to the returning characters to the NEW ones we've now been introduced to. Daisy Ridley as Rey is absolutely fantastic. She's bad ass, independent, and the strongest female lead I've seen in a long time (save Jessica Jones), and Daisy Ridley gives a PHENOMENAL performance. John Boyega as Finn is strong, likable, and you cheer for him from the moment you see him try to save Po. He's relatable and always asks the hard questions, and by far has an extremely strong arc, from Stormtrooper to resistance fighter. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is villainous but EXTREMELY sympathetic. Kylo Ren is memorable, scary, but torn between the light side and the dark, making you question whether he is truly evil. Up there with Darth Vader, I expect awesome things from him in the next movie. The Story itself is fast paced, break-neck action combined with truly heartbreaking AND heartwarming twists throughout it. From the opening attack on the village to the final battle, it never stops, and it never lets you go. Even the quiet moments are so gripping you sometimes forget to breath."
1916,10,A Worthy Continuation of the Original Trilogy,"As I read the reviews, I realize the most people remember the original (Episodes IV-VI) from their childhood. Even when they re-watch it as an adult, it is filtered through those early memories. I was in my early 20's when the very first movie came out, and loved it - a really great sci-fi B-movie! But - I was old enough to see the really corny acting, obvious plot, and many of the other things that youngest viewers did not care about. When Return of the Jedi came out, I was able to take my oldest son (very young) and he was mesmerized! First and foremost, Star Wars is supposed to be fun! It's real entertainment, not a deep philosophical movie folks."
1917,8,Matter of Perspective,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a great movie that is completely worthy of the Star Wars name. Is it perfect? Of course not. There are a lot of problems, but the universe is rich, the villain is fantastic, and the rest of the characters knock it out of the park. JJ Abrams did a fine job returning the Star Wars films to glory, and it is far superior to the prequel films from the early 2000's. "
1918,9,Star Wars IS Back,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens brings back the magic that the prequels lost and never were able to find. I remember that when I was a kid, God was at the top, and then there was Star Wars. With this movie I feel that Star Wars is on its way up back to that level. The movie is not perfect, but it works for me and it meets all my expectations and gave me a few surprises. "
1919,9,The Force Awakes brings the saga back to the space opera levels,There was always an inherent danger in hyping this movie so much that people were (metaphorically) punching each other out over opening night tickets and threatening to murder anyone who breathes a spoiler.
1920,7,"A great action/ sci-fi film, an adequate Star Wars film","My advice is to watch it more than once. I saw it once in a theater and was mostly baffled by it, and came away with the vague impression that the entire movie was an intro to two younger characters and a dash to find Luke Skywalker. But now that it's available on DVD and I can watch it repeatedly, and replay difficult scenes, I can appreciate the more subtle nuances of the plot and I am better prepared for the future films in the series. "
1921,8,Now that this movie is available on DVD ....,"I think of myself as a big fan of Star Wars. I love this franchise and what it makes me feel. Maybe my appreciation would be too subjective, anyway this is it."
1922,6,This movie brought my inner child,"Where do I begin? This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life! Watching it felt exactly like watching the originals because they are similar in so many ways but still so different. The people who are hating on this movie are just butthurt people who had decided that it was going to be bad before even watching it! Of course the plot line is a lot like ""A new hope"" but is that not what we all wanted? A movie that is similar to the originals? Even though it is that similar to episode IV it was still an exciting and Star Wars filled experience. Of course this movie has some flaws and it is not completely perfect, but I really felt entertained while watching it."
1923,10,Star Wars is back,"I watched the trailers roughly a hundred times leading up to the day I saw the movie. To be honest: To me, the trailer was better than the movie."
1924,7,"Decent movie, can't live up to the hype",Disney killed any interest I ever had on Star Wars.
1925,5,A somewhat interesting start...Totally overshadowed by the awful sequels.,This is the true face of Star Wars! This indeed is STAR WARS !
1926,9,The force has really awoken !,"This movie was great. I was a little afraid they were going to ruin the star wars movies for me, but i was pleasantly surprised. I definitely liked how they brought Harrison Ford,Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill back. Most of the new characters were enjoyable as well. I say most because I found Rey quite annoying. Maybe it was her voice."
1927,9,Great movie,"I loved this movie, immensely. It was fantastic. Too many people let hype culture kill their experience or something else.. I didn't. I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I've spent so much time with Star Wars throughout my life and this movie was a roller-coaster ride of emotions and fun. I am very excited for the upcoming releases, don't let the negative nancies ruin the movie for you. A movie can have flaws and still be fantastic, I don't understand why some people can't grasp that!"
1928,10,A great Film if you understand context and managed expectations,"Whether you're a Star Wars fan or just someone looking for a entertaining movie to watch you will probably enjoy this film. However, being a huge, huge Star Wars fan I had some issues with the film and I rank The Force Awakens fifth in the canon. The Empire Strikes Back, A New Hope, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones."
1929,8,A New Hope Part II ????,J.J. Abrams is an exceptional mimic and director.
1930,7,A Mimic of Star Wars,"J.J. Abrams and Disney's Star Wars: The Force Awakens provides homage to the Lucas films of old with a fresh, well-cast, and action packed thrill ride for everyone to enjoy. With that being said, the film does a fair job of character and plot development, and will leave viewers with unanswered questions, which I believe was done by design. But now to the important info everyone wants to know."
1931,8,The Force Awakens relaunches the franchise with promise!!!,They started again with new characters while blending in the originals. But it felt too fast paced at times.
1932,7,Worthy,Star Wars is filled with references and influences. However how the whole thing was put together (mixing all kinds of different stuff ranging from Metropolis to age old myths and sagas to old serials to Kurosawa samurai movies) was strikingly original.
1933,8,Star Wars - A Myth,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I love the original trilogy and after some analysis I liked the idea of the prequels. If this was my first Star Wars movie I ever watched, than I would have really enjoyed it, but I'm no Star Wars virgin."
1934,6,No enrichment to the saga,"The Force Awakens... I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't love it either. It nails a few key elements that make action movies enjoyable, but it has a long list of failings to go with it (see my list of pros and cons below.) I found myself thoroughly enjoying the first 45 minutes only to feel my enthusiasm steadily drop for the next hour and a half as it became clear how paint-by-numbers this movie was turning out."
1935,4,The Force is Mediocre with this one,I have seen allot of bad reviews on Star Wars the force awakens. 
1936,8,Good film but played safe spoilers ahead,"Long scrolling banners of text at the start, iconic thundering orchestral music and a view of the mysterious stars beyond – All hallmarks of a Star Wars film. The franchise has seen six entries till date, bringing us a galaxy spanning tale of love, friendship and the ultimate fight between good and evil. The film gave rise to numerous memes, sold merchandise galore and birthed spin-offs in the animation industry. How does such an iconic series' resurrection fare in the form of Star Wars: The Force Awakens?"
1937,8,MicroReels Film Review - StarWars: The Force Awakens,"(This review contains a SPOILER at the end!) I watched it last Saturday at TGV Cinema, Cyberjaya."
1938,10,The best episode since the original trilogy,"As a filmmaker, talking about Star Wars is a topic very complex and very difficult, because this franchise manages aspects which at the end professional critics see him in a way and the fan boys see it otherwise."
1939,10,"A magical, exciting, epic, fun and nostalgia-filled adventure","Is it bad to say this is kind of boring? it is a good movie that has enough positives, its just too long for its own good"
1940,7,uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"This film brought me back to childhood and I'm grateful for it! I think it's the best part from 1983 until now, and fits perfectly in the series (that because I don't like the I, II and III). The new actors are good, H.Ford acting made me regret once more the passing of time. The special effects, the landscape are amazing and good humour is back. I would give from all my heart a big 10, but...there are a couple of things who stop me: - the final battle is imported entirely from IV part - second...oh my God! when Kylo Ren takes off his helmet (bad idea), I didn't know whether to cry or laugh. I thought I saw a young wizard from Harry Potter series who woke up in the wrong movie... - two young warriors, who have never held a sword in their hand and who believe that Jedi are a myth, fight with Luke sword better then new Vader...then why we need Jedi training? The force be with you!"
1941,8,Finally!,There is a little part of me that was never going to be satisfied with The Force Awakens and it is the little piece of me that is still 6 years old and remembers watching A New Hope for the first time and my mind being blown as the camera pans across a planet and two battling ships come into view. 
1942,6,Like catching up with friends after 20 years,"If you've watched the original Star Wars, you know the plot to The Force Awakens- a droid containing vital information to the Rebellion is placed under the care of a lone person on a desert planet who is then tasked with the safe delivery of the droid to the Rebellion without any unnecessary entanglements with the evil Empire, who pursue the same droid and its custodians. There is even a planet-destroying battle station at the end for the Rebels to destroy. Just replace the faction names with Resistance and First Order, replace the droid's name with BB-8 instead of R2-D2, and replace the character's names and the names of the planets and battle-stations they are on, and boom, you've got The Force Awakens."
1943,8,"Derivative, but thankfully it derives from an enjoyable Star Wars film.","Disney's debut and return of Star Wars to the big screen is a fun, thrilling, and visually stunning crowd pleaser. Its characters are extremely likeable. Its jokes are very funny. Its action is thrilling and visually stunning. The acting is very good. There is a lot to like about this film without feeling bogged down at all as the film moves by rather quickly. Despite this there is a major plot hole towards the end of the film, also the film lacks any form of originality. This film despite its unoriginality is an enjoyable love letter to the original trilogy, and just like its predecessor is endlessly rewatchable."
1944,7,An excting but also unoriginal love letter to the Original Trilogy,"J.J., the Green-Lit Auteur, Had a very handy Knack, For taking beloved Stories, And giving them his reboot Smack,"
1945,2,J.J. the Green-Lit Auteur ...,"May contain a spoiler. Just saw Star Wars VII The Force Awakens. I was like a child anticipating Christmas which was exactly the time frame the movie was released. When I heard that the original cast was going to reprise their beloved roles I just knew it would be a winner. In the time of 3D, this seemed very appropriate to experience the film in all of its glory. The movie ran for what seemed like an hour before I saw one of the original cast. Chewy and his buddy were up to their old tricks and seemed like nothing had changed in their MO but this time there was a story behind their scavenger ways. They did what they did best and saved the day for the young characters. The princess was also doing what was her calling and that was commanding the rebels against the dark side of the force. The new young heroes had secrets and mysteries surrounding them but they seemed to go together like peanut butter and jelly. The goal of the dark and light side of the force was to find Luke Skywalker. Where was he? Where was the heart of the original series? Where was the boy who saved the day? Where was the man he had become? That was the quest. Why was he hard to find? There is a twist in the story of good versus evil and it is not what one would expect but neither was the auspicious beginnings of Darth Vader. The dark side is very seductive and it takes from one those who matter the most. I have to say that I was getting very agitated with the resistance not finding Luke sooner in the movie. I left the theater let down a little for how the movie ended. There will definitely be a continuation. There has to be else why bring the original cast back at all? So many questions left unanswered. So much action and special effects. Industrial Light and Magic has not lost their touch. I found the film came one little hair short of what it could have been had the original film makers had the reigns instead of Abrams. Did it have the original heart? I kept saying all the way home in the car, ""help me OBI Wan Kanobi, you're our only hope"". I did sincerely wish Obi Wan was there to help these rag tag rebel resistance face their Darth Vader and the Empire."
1946,8,Reuniting with old friends and meeting new ones in a galaxy far far away.,"1. I LOVED the story and thought Rey was a fab strong character. 2. Was disappointed with the lack of nostalgic reference to OBI-Wan, Amadala and other major former players in past episodes; lack of humor; lack of originality - rehash of scenes from previous episodes (like the bar and Death Star) but too much like the original with minimal change; too much shooting and not enough use of laser swords (For goodness sake, that's what they are known for!; lack of a believable connection between Rey and Finn 3. I was surprised at the major scene but it spiced up the storyline. 4. I will go to the next episode since VII left us hanging like V did."
1947,8,My review,The new Star Wars film must be good - only one person got their phone out during the entire running time!
1948,8,"It may be a reboot, but it's a joyously enjoyable one","The Force Awakens is, in a way, a re-telling of the first Star Wars movie. Those looking for something completely new might be disappointed. Those looking for a blow-by-blow account of everything that ever happened to Luke, Leia and Han Solo will most certainly be disappointed. That said, anyone just looking for a great movie experience will love it."
1949,9,Birth of a New Heroine,"There is an essence of Star Wars that has made it more than just a film, but rather the dominant myth of our culture. That is the promise of adventure, the depth of its world, and the resonance of its central drama and spiritual struggle. All these can transcend shoddy dialogue, pat storytelling, and intermittent tonal missteps."
1950,6,Surrogate Star Wars: Competent but shallow trope-fest fails to recapture magic of originals,"After a long wait of 10 years (32 years if you were not a fan of the prequels) Star Wars is finally back bringing with it a media circus of adverts, toys and even branded cereal. With the expectations sky high, the important question is does the film match the hype. As a fan of the series, I am happy to say it does. From the very start, the booming volume of the iconic Star Wars theme and the first line in the crawl of 'LUKE SKYWALKER HAS VANISHED' you sense you are in for a great experience."
1951,8,The Fun Awakens,"With a series as beloved as Star Wars, anything is possible. The Force Awakens, the beginning of the sequel trilogy, is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of all time. The fact that it reeled in a record breaking $250,000,000 opening weekend in the U.S. alone is a testament to the popularity of this franchise. So, was it worth the wait? That's an interesting question. For many people, myself included, the nostalgia blinders came with the movie. The anticipation before the opening crawl and the euphoria that that classic opening note brought was an unforgettable experience. This movie brought out happy memories of watching the Original Trilogy for the first time, and the wonder and mystery that the galaxy of Star Wars brought us. However, the movie relies way too much on the nostalgia factor. The best and most memorable things about this movie (aside from that scene, of course) were the opening crawl, the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, the first appearances of the original characters (especially Han and Chewie), and the scene with Darth Vader's helmet. Aside from those things, it's a carbonite copy of the original 1977 movie, with the exact same story arc. There's very little originality, which is a massive detractor. Even the ships and vehicles are exactly the same, with a few exceptions. Of course, Starkiller Base is just another Death Star, even if the way it works is awesome. Even the character's roles feel recycled from the Original Trilogy. Rey is Luke (the desert dwelling, force sensitive protagonist), Finn is Han (The guy who tries to stay out of it but ends up coming back in), Poe is Leia (The one with the droid with the important message), BB-8 is R2-D2 (said droid), Han is Obi-Wan (The mentor who fought in the previous war), and Luke is Yoda (The Jedi who is now a recluse). While this is bad, it doesn't mean the characters are bad. They're not entirely recycled, but the roles they play certainly are."
1952,7,"Too Nostalgic, but Still Good","By looking at the list of actors in this movie, it's no surprise or spoiler as to who's in it. And that's part of what makes this movie great. It's a fantastic way to introduce the new characters to the franchise. "
1953,9,Loved it!!,"Star Wars lives! Or at least, continues ..."
1954,6,"Give them what they want, not what they need",Star Wars marvelized!
1955,3,"Star Wars marvelization, a sad discussion with lot of spoilers.","First things first. I grew up with Star Wars. As an 80's kid, it was a part of my childhood, sparking the love for all sci-fi. I'm a big fan of SW saga, in fact i loved the prequels and do not even mind Jar-jar. That being said, i was somewhat worried that Disney's re-boot to the franchise might go in a different direction, which would make the movies too mushy and childish. On that point, i am pleased to say, i was wrong. TFA delivers some very dark moments that children are not suited to see (rounding up and the subsequent massacre of innocent civilians)."
1956,8,"A trip down nostalgia lane, Good but not great","This movie brings back the fun-filled Magic and excitement of the first two movies and (THANKFULLY) avoids the excessive CGI & stupid characters (ala Jar Jar Binks) that made later movies painful to watch. I'm doing my best to avoid any spoilers; so I'll only discuss in general terms. The closest I'll get to plot specifics is to provide rebuttal to reviewers who have criticized this movie as being a mere ""remake"" of Ep. IV & V. As an actual ""Sequel"" to the first series; it would be absurd to produce a movie that didn't include many of the same ship designs and other technology from the earlier films. It's not as if all of those ships would conceivably disappear and be replaced over a supposed 30 year time frame."
1957,10,J.J. Abrams produced a sequel that is faithful to the Magic of Episodes IV and V (before Special Editions),Well the Force Awakens is certainly far from perfect because
1958,8,Not perfect but still very good,"I'm a Star Wars fan, but not a die hard fan. Maybe that's why I really enjoyed this movie. I was never bored and the characters where very likeable and well written and I liked the plot. Perhaps the die hard fans are being too hard on this movie because it didn't give them what they had imagined."
1959,9,Really very good,I'm not going to act like this criticism is not justified for this movie but I swear some people are just jumping on the bandwagon to hate it or just hate it because it's Disney or because of TLJ and TROS. This movie may have flaws but it's still pretty good. Let's just start with the flaws.
1960,7,Definitely not the best SW movie by any means but not abysmal by any means as well,"A few things could've been annoying for some most choosy (or hateful...) viewers. But according to this huge challenge that Abrams had to raise up to, one just have to admit that he (with Casdan's help) really had the guts to do... what he did in the movie. TRULY amazing work. Inspired/Based on the Ep.IV structure? Yeah... so what!? There's still so many other aspects in this film, that reducing Ep7 to be a simple ""copy"" of the IV, is just stupid and insulting. "
1961,10,Abrams nailed it,"When it comes to the Star Wars franchise, it's vital to take a step back to see what has been delivered to us. In this case, it's fine swashbuckler with some minor flaws. The temptation here (and I have fallen into it) is to see the characters as transpositions of the original. Rey is Luke, Finn is Han, Kylo is a budding Vader and so on."
1962,7,A fine reboot of the Star Wars franchise.,"This happens with all Star Wars movies. The two new main leads Daisey Ridley and John Boyega both were miscast. Daisey Ridley seems to just be not believable enough as the new lead actress in this saga. John Boyega is over-acting the whole time and they both really bring the overall satisfaction of the movie down a whole new level. Just like the prequels before them, with newcomers at the time Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman were both too young to be able to pull off the weight for the roles they were cast into. It's the same with these two new actors, they both were ridiculously miscast and their acting was pretty awful. However everything else in the movie did definitely deliver I would say. I think Adam Driver as the new villain Kylo Ren was the best new addition to the Star Wars Saga. I loved the movie but boy do they go wrong in the casting department. I know in the next movies they'll probably be a little bit better but for now they really need to hone in on their acting talents because it's pretty pretty shitty."
1963,8,Great movie but needs better leads,"It amazes how many fanboys take the time to register for this site and write a review, criticizing those who had the gaul (intelligence) to criticize the movie, while calling them haters (without realizing that they're fanboys by definition). Let's call this movie for what it is: A newer, weaker, more politically correct Episode IV. To say ""you're just nitpicking because your lonely and you'll never enjoy movies"" is basically calling yourself an insecure nerd going through nerd rage syndrome, and dismissing the need for ANY kind of movie criticisms. Sorry fanboys, but this movie was mediocre, and judging by the comments I've read on here, you'll get 2 bad reviews for every good reviews. If your new favorite movie's claim to fame is ""it's better than the prequels"", then you obviously can't pick them very well. If your entire review is toward anyone who didn't like the movie and calling them idiots for it, then you lead a sad existence. This movie was mediocre, get over it and quit nerd raging. It's embarrassing."
1964,6,"Quit crying fanboys, it was mediocre","I have been waiting for years for this movie to arrive and hoped that it was as least as good as the second trilogy (Episodes I-III). So I didn't have unrealistic expectations, and yet was still so disappointed. I honestly cannot understand how this movie is currently showing an 8.4/10 rating on IMDb. Really?"
1965,3,"Really, really not so good","I am huge Star Wars fan since I was a kid growing up at 90's. I was 11 when Phantom Menace was released, went to see it and never liked it. More I watched the prequels the more I was disgusted by them. So eventually I get to conclusion that it's better to forget 'em. I still love the original trilogy and I have seen them million times."
1966,,Ultimate Star Wars experience for newer generation,Some will say that the movie copied Ep.4 . And surely thats not deniable. But still I LOVE THIS MOVIE
1967,9,I love it,"Disney has a track record of producing movies with plots that are fundamentally sound, although sometimes lacking in creativity. Good Disney movies, of which they are many, make up for any shortfalls in creativity with excellent execution. In this sense, Star Wars: The Force Awakens continues this Disney trend. There is nothing in the plot of The Force Awakens that will shock or surprise hard-core Star Wars fans, or those just discovering the franchise. Indeed, for those familiar with the original movie masterpiece, it is hard to ignore the similarities between the original and The Force Awakens as the latter races towards its climax. But movies are all about the suspension of disbelief, and because The Force Awakens delivers the goods in terms of brilliant special effects (particularly if you see it in 3-D), edge-of-your-seat action sequences, intriguing, likable characters, and structurally a sound plot, it is easy to forget that deep down you know how it is going to end. It won't tug at your heartstrings, but it is a great way to kill two hours."
1968,8,Disney Refreshes Star Wars Franchise,"I just returned from the opening midnight showing of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I'd say first off that the movie seems pretty typical for a J.J. Abrams movie: strong on character development and action, but weak on plot. I'd say though that perhaps the plot had a little more strength than the typical Abrams movie, while the character development and especially the action didn't quite rise to Abrams' usual standards."
1969,9,"Not As Good as the Original Three, But Still Good","At the beginning you fear that the movie is shot just as every modern movie: no attention is put into the real filming and only to the actual action. After 6 minutes this fear disappears completely. You feel like you are watching an old Star Wars just in a higher quality. The battles are of those where you finish all of your popcorn's, actually after the first action packed scene you are empty handed and only your ice-tea still isn't opened. The actors and especially the close-ups transmit like no other movie the feelings, sadly this is up until the last 15 minutes. The end is, in my honest opinion, poorly made. That is on a acting and plot point of view. The final action looks like they forgot what they had to do and ends up in a strange awkward pause. What excels in this one is the filming: it is great from the moment you sit down till the screen goes white. In three words, do you need to go this movie? Y E S In three words, does this movie follow the steps of the previous ones? Y E S In three words, do you just want to back and watch it one more time? Y E S"
1970,9,Follows the legend,"Watched Star Wars : The Force Awakens at opening day with lot of excitement. Watching the movie i loved it but then at the same time i really hated it. The visuals were stunning, the same old classic humor was good, i was thrilled when Harrison Ford made his appearance, good to see Han Solo(Harrison Ford) being reunited with his Millennium Falcon even though he says that he may never gonna see her again in ""Return Of the Jedi"". The movie was overall enjoyable. But it did have few flaws or cons with the story and characters that kind a lost originality from earlier movies!"
1971,6,Heroes tho who are cursed with UNREST! (SPOILER : minimum),"I have now seen the movie a few times and I have enjoyed it more each time. That's the sign of a good movie. After living through such mediocrity, poor acting and bad storytelling of the prequels, this is truly a return to Star Wars form. The story unfolds very well, the characters are great actors and leaving you wanting to learn more about them. There are a few great movie moments that seem that they will become classics. I look forward to where the story is going to go. Abrams reveals in this film how much he grew up loving Star Wars. It shows from one edge of the galaxy to the other. The star I knock off is only for wanting more screen time for ace pilot Poe Dameron and what I saw as a slight misstep with the advertised chrome trooper, Captain Phasma. She was used more for a moment of comic relief and I would have preferred to have her be established as someone that you would never want to mess with. My hope is maybe they have her return in the future and make her a bit more intimidating. Or, introduce a few more new characters that join in with Kylo Ren who is the awesome new bad guy. So where do I rank it among all the Star Wars movies? I rank it tied at number 2 with A New Hope just below Empire Strikes Back."
1972,8,A return to Classic and Classy Star Wars.,"I used to give this movie a 9 because it was (in my opinion) one of the best Star Wars movies in the sequel trilogy, probably the only best. It brought me back as a Star Wars fan since it has been years since a Star Wars movie came out, it was similar to A New Hope but in a different take which could have potential for the next sequels."
1973,7,Re-reviewing,"This movie bring us a lot of things about the first saga, I really liked the new characters and the way of how to bring back the famous characters for the older fans it was amazing. I also had a very nice feeling of nostalgia. I'm very excited for the next movies because a lot of things will be explained in there. Have a one thing that the movie falls short, the main villain is a little bad, with your mask he is very creepy, but when he removes it, he doesn't makes anyone stay afraid. This is not the best movie of all Star Wars, but they got keep the quality and the most important thing of all, they got introduce the Star Wars for the new fans. I leave the cinema room with a feel of the emotion because the end is so spectacular. May the force be with you!"
1974,8,And the day has come..,"Star Wars: TFA updates the franchise with beautiful 3D, excellent casting, familiarity, and more than a little nostalgia. By and large it is a solid, entertaining movie that will please all but the most jaded of fans. For better or worse, this iteration asks to be judged on the qualities of earlier films due to the return of characters, visuals, ideas, music, and themes."
1975,7,Star Wars: The Reboot,"I have to say after seeing the movie I am quite disappointed. Why, you might ask. Well, the story is not well executed, there is no character development, the action sequences are very hasty, etc."
1976,1,"Sorry, but the movie doesn't justify the hype!","first, it's sad to see people not give an actual score and review, and instead skip all the points for a review score and jump straight to giving the lowest score possible simply because they were not pleased. It is understood that not everyone will be pleased or give a high score but this movie, realistically, is far from a one star movie. Yes it has a few iffy situations in plot and story but the acting was captivating and visuals were beautiful. I felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie and that's what matters. "
1977,10,Great movie and a great cast!,"Definitely the best film made for a while. It was so amazing how the force awakens was so true to the original trilogy, yet had been brought into 21st cinema. It was very pleasing to how progressive this film was as the female protagonist was simple yet strong and clever. The new droid BB-8 had so much character and we be dearly loved by anyone who sees this film. It was so lovely revisiting Han, Leia and Luke after all these years and they are as brilliant as ever. The visual effects were so realistic and spectacular, which went so hand in hand with the stunning sets and art design. JJ Abrams did a stupendous job that more the surpassed the expectations."
1978,9,Best film in a long time.,"One amazing piece by JJ Abrhams, Star Wars: The Force Awakens gives me nostalgia from the original trilogy, with the return of Chewbacca, R2-D2(even though he is present in the first three), Luke Skywalker, and of course Han Solo, but is still refreshing to deliver a range of new characters, such as Finn, a corrupted Stormtrooper, Rey, a scavenger from Jakku,a new droid, BB-8 and a brand new Sith Lord, Kylo Ren, who is coincidentally the son of Han. "
1979,10,A true Star Wars feel. *SPOILERS AHEAD*,I really liked it it successfully introduced a new generation to star wars and keep the og one entertained I'm not going to give spoilers because you should check it out your self.
1980,,its good,"This movie is the best possible Star Wars sequel we could have hoped for and perfectly incorporates Han Solo and Leia into its story. While I can sympathise with comments calling the film a rehash as a few of the movie set pieces are certainly influenced by episode four. However I believe that this was done to appeal to the fans, those who when the prequels came out complained that those were too unlike the originals and who are now saying this is too much a remake and not a continuation. Rey and Finn have been handed the baton by the obviously deceased Han Solo, who featured extremely prominently in what was an emotional finale for the much beloved actor. However I completely agree with the decision to kill him off, mainly because for years Harrison Ford has been fed up with Star Wars and that also the resistance and Luke will now have a huge emotional driving force behind them upon confronting Kylo Renn and Snoke. I also agree with the decision to only include Luke at the end and was happy we hadn't seen any promotion for him as this allowed for a Han Solo centric story and we now have a Luke centric story to look forward to along with the brilliant Rey, Finn and Poe. Overall I am very pleased with the outcome which feels very much like Star Wars"
1981,10,Why so much hate?,"I watched this movie rather late compared to some people. I did enjoy the movie when I was watching it and there was some nice humour. Good performances by Harrison Ford (Han Solo), and Daisy Ridley (Rey). "
1982,6,An Okay Sequel,"First and foremost, even IF someone has spoiled this movie for you or you read some of these butthurt 1-star reviews...go into this movie with no expectations, and you will be given a truly spectacular treat."
1983,8,"SPOILER-FREE Honest Review of ""The Force Awakens""","A good movie in its own right, though casting of Adam Driver as Kylo Ren was hideous. Guess they had to have one pretty boy for the kiddies but there's more charisma in the mask than the character. A few plot holes as well but overall not bad."
1984,6,A reboot by any other name ...,The original Star Wars trilogy had not been given a worthy follower due to George Lucas's Star Wars prequels failure to please audiences and a general failure for such a hyped and anticipated series of movies. The Force Awakens was given even more hype then the prequels and had great expectations to live up to because of th success of the originals and having to redeem the Star Wars franchise for the prequels.
1985,8,A great film for all ages especially for those who love the originals.,"I am a fan of original Star Wars (4-6) and I grew up with it. I knew it is difficult to repeat the success of something as original as Star Wars, unfortunately this happened to be true for The Force Awakens. The movie tried to satisfy fans by pick and mix elements of the original SW, then reshuffle and arrange them loosely and carelessly. The result is some impressive and spectacular battle scenes and pursuits, yet the story plot lacks cohesion and believability. It has many structural issues, and bad person Kylo Ren has far less charisma than Darth Vader. The movie fails to deliver anything substantial of originality, and I felt disappointed at the end. I hope they learn their lessons and get their acts together for the following sequels: there's still time! As a fan, I can only go up as 7."
1986,7,"Beautiful elements, incoherent plot, lack of originality","At first I scarcely liked the beginning, but then everything quickly became confusing and poorly slapped together. This is my main point. JJAbrams or whatever his name is (who cares) thinks that his very limited sub-directorial intelligence is good enough for everything that has the word ""STAR"" in it. Well, he is entirely wrong. He has ruined StarTrek and StarWars already (these two Universes have nothing in common except for the useless light flare adored by Abrams). In short, this movie was worth watching the first thirty minutes of it. Then it became an ugly-ridiculous-dumb rehash of SW|ST|ALIENS stuff. Abrams, you have no ideas of your own and your movies stink! I feel sorry for those losers who honestly decided to rate this recycled mess higher than I did. And my rating is based on the initial thirty minutes of this mess. NO thank to the Hollywood idiots for delivering another noisy mess of a movie."
1987,2,"Empty, disappointing garbage","In a world... where Mad Max returns with a masterpiece like Fury Road. In a world... in which Ash vs The Evil Dead and Jessica Jones are really a thing. In a world in which Star Wars has been dead to me since watching Episode 1 in cinema... there now comes a new movie and although I never thought it was possible it was even better than all those other impossible great movies, because it was even more unlikely to be just that great a film. Something clicked. Was it perfect? No! Was it the perfect movie experience? Yes! It just went with all my disbelief and replaced it with excitement and wonder. It was about heroes, villains and aliens from a thousand worlds. I was able to love that movie. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a miracle."
1988,10,Great movie!,"George Lucas just found the perfect replacement for himself. No one can do it better than J J Abrams. Though the new addition to the Star Wars franchisee is a just a smart and an intelligent remake of the first Star War movie, 'Episode IV: The New Hope', the series gets perfectly re-booted for the new generation of audience. Harrison Ford steals the show as Han Solo. The new character Rey played by Daisy Ridley is someone you will not forget. Daisy really shows some potential to be another legendary character of Star Wars. The magic of Star Wars gets a great restart. Don't miss to witness the war of good & evil in galaxy and to get spellbound ...again!"
1989,8,The Magic Re-Awakens,"I watched every Star Wars movie in a row and I think Star Wars The Force Awakens is a great continuation of the sequel. There's new characters which makes The Force Awakens a little more interesting. Plus there are some original characters in the movie which of course is very awesome. FN-2187 (Finn), Rey, Poe and BB-8 are the new big characters. There's also the new character Kylo Ren. He's the new antagonist of The First Order in The Star Wars Sequel. My favorite scene is definitely where Han Solo and Chewbacca walks into the Millennium Falcon and Han says "" Chewie, were home"". I think the Star Wars Saga isn't something for elderly people. At least most of em'. But could imagine that people from the age of 9-50 year old likes The Star Wars Saga. There's a lot of easter eggs in the movie. For example FN-2187. 2187 is the prison cell Princess Leia was in on the Death Star, in the previous movie. Fantastic movie in my opinion."
1990,10,Great movie,"Mark Hamill said that ""Everything's Changed but Nothing Changed thats the way it is"". Exactly I felt same way... J.J. Abrams took same elements from Star Wars: A New Hope and given as what we want & how we want it... it will be great, if they tried a new plot even though they had a time. But I liked everything about Episode VII from beginning to end. Especially we get mind blowing experience in 3D IMAX. Rey and Finn will be remembered like Leia – Han Solo. Speaking of Han Solo I was afraid that past few years Harrison Ford lost his mojo but he gave a wonderful performance just like original trilogy. He's smart, funny, intense & emotional in this film. I don't know why writers didn't utilize Leia & Poe Dameron Character that much. In episode VII, we get to see BB-8 which was the original design George Lucas planned for R2/D2. Finally Kylo Ren, we all know he can't become as good as Darth Vader. But even writers know that too.. so they planned Kylo Ren character brilliantly. He's balancing between Light/ Dark side to become Darth Vader. There is one scene where Kylo Ren use his dark force on Rey which is awesome scene.. And the negative of the film is Origin of Kylo Ren was same as Origin of Anakin Skywalker. But still there's suspense in Rey character. There's ultimate intro for millennium falcon. 100% entertaining – The Force Awakened Finally"
1991,10,"The Force Awakened.... ""Everything's Changed but Nothing Changed""","This is a perfect example of a movie you can enjoy, and not expect much more than that. IMO, it gets a little better than Episodes I, II and III (although the scenarios from those movies are much, much, muuuch more detailed) The special effects are, as expected, very detailed. It is a little disappointment to see how the script was not written with the same care. The dialogs are empty, and more than once, they don't go beyond oh's and ah's. I am missing those long conversations, with a script that has been written with more than 500 different words (""I find your lack of faith disturbing"") The story can get a little inconsistent, specially regarding the sith. And, the most infuriating part of the movie is the amount of ""funny"" moments they introduced in the movies. Honestly, sometimes it feels like watching the Pirates of the Caribbean, Star wars edition. I enjoy one or two jokes around the movie, but here, every single dialog is a joke. That's a bit too much. To sum up, if you go to see it longing for the old saga, you will be disappointed again. If you have in mind having a good time without trying to compare and criticize all the time, then you will like the movie."
1992,6,"It's an OK movie, but still far away from the old movies.","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the seventh entry in the Star Wars franchise. The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams, and stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Mark Hamill, and a lot more people. The Force Awakens as I said is the continuation of the Star Wars saga, where a new menace is facing the galaxy, and only our old heroes with the help of some new ones can stop them from conquering the galaxy. "
1993,10,An Awakening of the Star Wars Franchise,"'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' has been the most anticipated and over-rated movie for a decade, but is it worth the the hype?"
1994,7,That's not how the 'Force' works!,STAR WARS
1995,8,"10/10. doesn't deserve that rating, but i watched and really enjoyed with film","Star Wars was, and always will be, space cowboys. If you accept this then you will enjoy this movie. It was a delightful bit of entertainment and a treat to see some of the old characters and how they grew over time."
1996,7,Good flick!,In many ways this is simply a remake of the original Star Wars trilogy except there was a desire to make the heroes black and female for liberals.
1997,3,A bad remake of the Original,"When Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens opened in cinemas in December 2015, I thought that this was beginning of another great trilogy set of movies."
1998,9,More Enjoyable To Watch Than The Last Jedi,"Yes. I get it some of the old fans are disappointed. The feel that to much things were to obvious. Fact is many of those fans didn't go to the first movie in 1977. The Force Awakens had one daunting task to begin with, bring back the magic. JJ Abrams delivered. The FA makes it painfully clear that although George Lucas came up with the best science fiction story ever didn't really get what made it good. Just because he could look at it from a healthy distance. If he would have all the technology of the 90ties available he would probably never had so much success. He is a creator great at imagining all of it. But all as not so good at portraying dialog and emotions. JJ Abrams was first fan. He could feel what made his heart beat faster. Therefore he could make the right decisions of what to put into the FA. I hear many complain about the plot but all of them are crazy about part 4,5 and 6. All of those plots are pretty thin and repetitive. If I would be really rude to those plots I could summarize them as: a battle between good and evil and at the end of the movie, good wins by destroying the death star. Everybody was fine with it. Of course good and bad also happened to be family but guess what that's also the case in 7. In fact this movie is the perfect sequel if you look at the pattern of 4 5 and 6. Each time a death star is destroyed the empire rebounds with a new bigger better and stronger weapon. It fits perfectly that the Republic opted for a death planet. Now everybody who complains about similarities in storyline do not include the possibilities that can evolve from the cast of characters and their backgrounds. The FA needed to serve the older fans but also the newbies. I think that 10 to 20 percent have not seen the part 4 5 and 6. For them nothing is familiar. Rey is awesome. She is a genuine believable strong female character. With a both muscular yet appealing physic. She displays the right kind of emotions. The fact that she learns to do the Force on her own isn't a bad thing for me. It fits her character. As a scavenger she is used to try and do things herself. She is not a Luke who was raised in the warmth of a family. It was for that reason that Luke was firstly a kid that was spoiled a bit and got through most of his time wining. Rey doesn't wine. She does what needs to be done on her own. Poe is basically the pilot that Han Solo was. Witty and full of himself. He has all the potential to be better than Han in terms of character. Finn is interesting because he is basically scared as can be but has the inner sense for justice and will fight for if it needs be. My gut feeling says that he has the force. What makes Kylo Ren so interesting is the level of instability. He is more mentally instable than most of the serial killers in any other movie. Which could lead to interesting developments in the sequels. Of course the sequels will have a more elaborate part for Luke who will most likely act as a mentor for Rey. JJ Abrams did an excellent job in reviving that good old feeling. I think now and only now the franchise is ready for more ingenious plot-twists. If he had done that now we would be lost in space ourselves."
1999,10,Feeling 9 years old again. (spoilers),"OK, so I was a Star Wars fan since I was a child as many of you are. There is NOTHING that will ever meet the expectations I have for Star Wars as nothing can hold me (now that I'm 36) with the same child- like innocence and awe that I held for the first trilogy. Many of us saw A New Hope as children and the droids, aliens, weapons, etc. were all new and really cool. Now, I'm older and none of that stuff impresses me like it did when I was a kid. Let's get real - the first time I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the theater it was awesome as was TMNT II - totally thought Ninja Rap was cool because I was 11. I tried to show these movies to my kids - and was looked at with the subtle-yet-powerful disappointment that only a child can convey who looks at his dad rapping the song with Vanilla Ice. "
2000,9,Teared up several times...,*Spoiler-free section:*
2001,10,A great start,"They chose very safe route making this movie. If it was a road trip, all traffic laws were upheld to the letter. Not necessarily a bad thing and this was the movie to play it safely. I only hope they will break the formula in the next one and try something new. Of course it has to be said, what every other review will say, that this was a much better movie than the monstrous previous trilogy I-III. Doesn't really take much to beat those. Sorry Lucas. Nothing in this movie truly offended me and all references were played quite well and they didn't jump out. Except one of the best 3d effects I have seen to date in a movie and it was still part of the movie and not done simply because of the 3d. I must also mention that I felt really bored at times. Especially in the first half. I guess they tried to make it a slow buildup but didn't quite succeed. Still a worthwhile movie to be seen once. Maybe it'll work better for younger viewers but for me once was enough."
2002,7,It's a Star Wars movie,"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews going on here. I think people expect too much and think way too much. It was surely entertaining...go in there and relax and enjoy yourself. There were some dark parts..some funny... some sad.. very well acted for the most part, IMO. Its the 1st one, Im sure there will be more character development to follow. Everyone's griping about the ""incompetent"" Kylo Ren..but he is young. He isn't and shouldn't be expected to be as imposing a threat as Vader was in his formative years, hes just beginning to learn. I had fun and will probably go see it again in 3d this time."
2003,9,Entertaining for sure,"Force Awakens is dull, miserable and predictable. I really like JJ, but I can only assume he was emasculated by Disney, who, having paid a fortune for the Lucasfilm franchise wanted to make some of their investment back and thought the best way to do that was not to offend anyone. Consequently the movie lacks pace, a decent plot or any decent acting. The cameo by Harrison Ford sees him miserable grumpy and hopeless - in all of which he is proved right. Carrie Fisher (who I've enjoyed in other movies) seems genuinely incapable of speech and just stares bemused into the middle distance when she appears at all. The whole thing is a mess and we all waited years..."
2004,7,Dismal,"This is my first review on IMDb, and I hope someone gets some use out of it. Just got out of the theater, and I must say that I enjoyed Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I saw episode IV when it was released in 1977, and I've watched them all through the the years. I've glanced at some of the reviews here (seems likes hundreds), and most everyone seems to have jumped on the 1/10 stars bandwagon."
2005,9,"If you just want to be entertained, go see it!","""This review contains spoilers"" First of all, it's a nice thing to we have a new Star Wars Movie."
2006,6,"Good Story, Bad Scenario, Missing Opportunity","Warning, spoilers."
2007,1,puddu!,"Don't let the shrill minority fool you, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the greatest films ever set in a galaxy far, far away. "
2008,8,A masterful weaving of the old and the new,"First off I'm a big fan of Star Wars. I watched the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the theaters in 1980 and 1983 and I had the original Star Wars action figures, Boba Fett's Slave 1, and Luke's Snowspeeder toys when I was a little boy. So I'm true Star Wars fan. I watched this movie during Christmas week on IMAX 3D. I thought the movie was a modern reboot of Star Wars probably meant for the younger child audience who never saw the originals in the theater. But it was a pretty good movie a helluva lot better story than the dreaded prequels. I was worried at first that this movie would flop because I thought JJ Abram's Star Trek movies and Cloverfield was bad. But I was not disappointed. I only hope that the next sequels will be originally written and not take place on an ice planet or having to deal with a giant slug gangster."
2009,9,A Reboot of Star Wars A New Hope,I loved every minute of the movie! It was so good to be back into the SW Universe and it became my favorite of the franchise so far. In my opinion J. J. Abrams did a perfect job and the actors were great too. It was also so good to see Harrison Ford as Han again! The CGI and the music was fantastic too!
2010,10,Awsome Experience,"Well, this is awkward. I'll fore-go the usual 'huge fan of SW' etc, because anyone spending time to write a review of anything cares enough about the movie in question to do it."
2011,8,Between a rock and... a better place.,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, is something of a re-imagining of the original Star Wars film that hit the silver screen back in 1977. Of course the formula that won us over with Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford is not exactly there but this time first-time Star Wars director J. J. Abrams was tasked with rebooting the franchise after George Lucas sold his franchise over to the Disney corporation and Lost creator Abrams shot for the stars on this movie and hit it! He went with more big name, young actors that gave great performances in The Force Awakens including Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver in the lead as Rey and Kylo Ren respectively, protagonist and antagonist, that literally go head to head later in the movie. There are also strong performances in the film by Oscar Isaac and John Boyega, playing Poe and Finn respectively - the two buddies in the movie that make it easy for buddies in the crowd to identify with. I'd be remiss not to mention performances by Star Wars veterans Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, who reprise their roles as Han Solo and Princess Leia that guide the young cast through the movie. The way the film runs into trouble with diehard Star Wars fans is the basic end plot of the film, the Rebels - or Resistance as they are called in this film - are tasked with destroying Starkiller Base, very similar to the original Death Star from the first film only bigger. The trench run leading up to the destruction area is even similar to it and Poe taking it down in is X-Wing is very reminiscent of Luke doing it back in 1977 which is probably on purpose on Abrams part and supposed to provide a sense of nostalgia but may have been overkill for the diehards. Nevertheless this was a fun and very well done film that opens the door to more movies and an entire new era of Star Wars media. The action is great, the writing is great, the sound editing is great, the soundtrack by John Williams is superb, the directing is superb, and you can see why this movie is the reason why you go to the movies - fun with friends or family! 7 out of 10 stars!!"
2012,7,Star Wars Remakes Star Wars From A Certain Point of View,"It's a very sad thing indeed when people who call themselves 'fans' set out to do nothing but hate. I loved this movie the moment I saw it and I still love it today, putting it right under 'The Empire Strikes Back' on my list of Star Wars movies in order from favorite to least favorite. I get that some people don't like the idea of a woman Jedi hero or a black stormtrooper turned hero or even a movie that uses nostalgia to tell our beloved story from A New Hope in a new way. But ya'll are idiots. This film was well made, well acted, and beautifully crafted from start to finish. While I appreciated the prequels when they came out, they were nothing compared to the originals. This movie brought Star Wars back into my life in a way it hadn't been since Return of the Jedi came out on video. Thank you, JJ Abrams and Disney, for giving me my childhood back!"
2013,10,Why So Much Hate?,"So what did I think of the next chapter in Star Wars? To be honest, yes, the Star Wars geek in me was yelling in excitement on the inside. I actually did tear up a little when the scrolling credits started up. So as a fan, I loved it. It has been far too long that I have been wanting to know the next story but lets be critical shall we? I was not blown away by this film as many fans (including myself) was expecting to be. I found the story a little predictable at times and cliché. I found the comedy within the movie far too Disney-esque. Something I would expect and welcome in a Marvel movie because that is what I love coming out of my favorite super heroes mouth's but Star Wars? Not so much. Also, as a Star Wars fan I was upset with the lack of light saber action. On the other end though, I enjoyed the action sequences as a whole. From the ground combat to the dogfights in the sky; Star Wars delivered and it was quite epic. The returning faces were great to see as well in their respective scenes. So again, as a whole the film brought the pain and I enjoyed the majority of it. I have waited a long time for this as a fan and it fulfilled the void in my heart for a good Star Wars film. I hope for the next installment that there is much more force and light sabers. So here's to waiting a couple years for the next one to come."
2014,7,"Great for Star Wars fans.. ""Meh"" for film fans","I don't know how to start review, but let's go."
2015,10,Best Star Wars Movie ! Contain spoilers !!,Review: I titled this review after o have seen all three of the sequel trilogy movies. The new characters had a great introduction (though the sequels had trouble with their stories) This was also a great way to reintroduce Luke Han and Leia as fan service to the original trilogy fans:
2016,7,A promising Start,"While the movie had some cool moments as a whole it fell short. The main aspect of the movie that bothered me most was the heavy reliance on this being the ""setup"" film for the new trilogy. This exercise by the filmmakers took away from all that could truly be developed and truly flushed out. It seemed that the creators were concerned about setting things up that they neglected to present a compelling and coherent story. This became so obvious that by midway through the screening that I found myself no longer caring what was taking place. So, by the apex of the picture I was not invested in what was presented. I was not able to apply my sensibilities into any character or their plight because I wasn't given enough time or development to be able to do so. As soon as I was getting into a character they did something that took me out of what I thought the character was being developed into. Or the character within the chronology of the story stopped making sense for an amount of time until it sort of corrected itself. Or the characters just disappeared for no good reason and without adequate explanation and randomly show up again. So, I end up feeling cheated when I invest myself into wondering what happened to them. I just feel that they played it too safe and took no chances to make the movie truly compelling. There are a few qualities that I enjoyed while watching the movie. The cinematography was very innovative at certain points in the movie especially during the flying and ground battles. I enjoyed the fact that the score was more subtle than I was expecting. I also enjoyed some of the characteristics of Rey, Finn, and Poe before I was pulled out of taking them in by the happenstances I mentioned above. There is so much potential here! Nonetheless, I feel that if I am going to invest myself, time, and my money to see a blockbuster movie I should not be sitting in my seat imagining what they could and should have done while the movie is happening in front of my eyes. I don't like wondering and hoping about what the filmmakers will do in part two (VIII) when part one (VII) is not even over yet. Unfortunately, the movie came across as hollow and I left feeling cheated out of experiencing a noteworthy film. Hopefully the next film in the series will tie up loose ends and delve into the story and history on a deeper level."
2017,5,"""This is not the movie you are looking for.""","Very frequently, we can hear promises and vows, coming from movie creators and producers. They tell us, that their next movie is going to be unique, exceptional and, then it's going to delight all of us so much, that we will look forward to see the sequel (sometimes even more than just one). Unfortunately, most of these words turn out, as an elements of huge marketing machine, and they're not being reflected in final version of films in cinemas. That's the main reason, why we should be really happy - because, all of what J.J. Abrams has promised us, is being proved in Episode VII. And there have been a lot of it."
2018,9,Kids of the Force,---SPOILERS Ahead---
2019,8,A Great Start to the Next Generation,"A great addition to the Star Wars series. Good story, good acting, lots of action without the Shaky Camera (I really hate the shaky camera!) The photography was sweeping and excellent, no lens flares (like he butchered Star Trek with), minimal shaking camera, great colour! The characters were imaginative and fresh. The Nostalgia was great. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would go see it again without hesitation. The plot was ""Star Wars"" and the characters were great in their parts. The only reason that I gave it a 9 instead of 10 was i found myself able to predict the outcome of a couple of things but that's OK because I love being right. Harrison Ford played Han Solo as he had played it in the episode 4-5-6 series. Considering what he has played since 1983, he dropped right into the Solo Character with ease. I truly look forward to the next installment and hope J. J. is at the helm. (Just hide the epileptic cameraman and the lens flare generator. They spoil the show!)"
2020,9,Thank You J.J.,"Firstly, a note to the haters of this film, who refer to themselves as 'die hard fans' who have been bashing and nitpicking this film...the expanded universe is gone. Let it go. Also, the Thrawn Trilogy is gone too, and will not be made into a film. Let it go."
2021,10,Brilliant film! Star Wars is BACK!!!,"The cringe factor is strong, Its simply a disney formula written & approved by people with no knowledge or care for the original."
2022,6,Hard for Disney to do wrong.. the film sells by nostalgia alone.. HOWEVER,I was excited to see what was in store with this new addition to the franchise. All the hype of big movies typically falls very short for me. I was pleasantly surprised. 
2023,10,Best Since the Original Trilogy,"I rarely expect to get my mind blown by a movie. Not any more at least. The last time it happened, and how it ricocheted off a sheer what-could-possibly-go-wrong excitement and ended up as another disappointment and mediocrity, was with Man of steel. "
2024,7,The Force snoozed,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a epic space opera film directed, co-produced, and co- written by J.J. Abrams. The seventh installment in the main Star Wars film series. The Force Awakens is the first film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy announced after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm."
2025,8,Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a triumph.,"Thousands of reviews already, from haters and lovers of the film while the film makes tons (literaly) of money."
2026,7,"Contains enough nostalgia and CGI to get a 7/10, but thats all","The story is basically the same as in the first Star Wars but what was good with the first Star Wars that was made was not the story, which was on the level of a bad Punch and Judy show, and instead the philosophical content that shone through here and there and, of course, the presence of Alec Guinness."
2027,1,senile film in senile times,"""You must unlearn what you have learned."" "
2028,9,There has been an awakening... for the franchise!,"I am old enough to have experienced Star Wars when it was first released in the 70's. This is a better movie than the first, and among the better Star Wars movies. The Force Awakens contains:"
2029,9,*no spoilers* Great movie for kids and adults alike,What an incredible ride.
2030,10,Let's do it right this time!,"The movie was everything that I wanted it to be. It was funny, full of action, it went back to the feel of the original trilogy and above all it reaffirmed what people loved about the series. The costumes and the CG worked together seamlessly without looking fake or cartoony, like in the prequel trilogy. The light saber graphics were phenomenal and they add a lot to the cinematography."
2031,10,Excellent Start to a New Generation,The story is a rehash of all the episodes that went before with some exception: the Bad Guys are now called The First Order led by the Supreme Leader Snoke played by Andy Serkis. The main premise centers on finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) so that he cannot lead a rebellion against the First Order. Luke had gone into seclusion.
2032,7,Not Much New Here,"Why all the hate with this movie? I mean, when someone gives just one star to this great film, thats not a review, thats hate, why? simple, people who do this are just focussing on a few point they don't like, but what about the good parts?...nothing?, I don't buy that."
2033,10,The best episode I,"There are certain things that couldn't be said about any of these movies until 2015. First, there is no supervision from George Lucas, the creator of the series. Second, the new movie fails to do one thing all the others were good at, and that is the scale of things. From 1977 to 2005, they all worked hard enough to give you the impression how big and rich this fictional world is. Some planets look way bigger than others, some starships are way bigger than others, and there are big distances to cover while travelling. But ""The Force Awakens"" can easily give you the impression that the whole movie takes place in one little village where everybody happens to bump into one another because this village is so small it wouldn't be possible for different people to avoid each other. Especially, when you take into account how little outer space the movie features. Also, you could criticize some of these movies for bearing resemblance to previous ones. For example, ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983) has similarities to ""Star Wars"" (1977), and so does ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999). But those similarities would come in no more than a handful, while ""The Force Awakens"" is so familiar to the oldest installment in this popular film franchise it is dangerously close to being a copy, a clone of another movie."
2034,6,A beautiful junkyard,"I have to say I'm surprised to see all the negative reviews here. I just saw the movie yesterday and am still just bursting at the seams with excitement. I hadn't planned to write a review, but I think some positivity is needed here. I won't give any spoilers or plot points in this review."
2035,9,A positive review...,"I was just a bit too old when the first Star Wars films came out so wasn't a big fan and to be honest episode 4 , 5 and 6 just don't stand the test of time for me, anyhow to get ready for episode 7 I watched for the first time in nearly 10 years The Return of the Jedi earlier today in preparation for the Force Awakens. I could have nodded off to be honest if it wasn't for the occasional loud explosion. Unfortunately the same could be said for The Force Awakens too, OK the special effects are much better now than in the old days when they had muppets or puppets if you prefer ? but the expectations were very high for this new release , I mean JJ Abrams is bound to make this the best Star Wars ever right ? but alas not, this seemed more like a reboot than a sequel , the storyline was too similar and several scenes were very much a case of Deja Vu, was JJ Abrams trying to be too close to George Lucas's originals?. This film lacks the excitement and emotion that it should have, not once did I get goose bumps or have the hairs on the back of my neck stand up let alone any feelings of joy or sorrow and considering the effort that has gone in to making it this was a shame. I went for the 3D version and was impressed with the effects , although occasionally I did get some double vision where the contrast was high. I suppose most people born in the late 1960s remember seeing A new Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and have a nostalgic recollection of these being like nothing they had seen before and unfortunately you just can't reproduce that even with the biggest budget ever. We have so many great Sci Fi fantasy films to compare to now that if it doesn't blow your socks off it's going to be a bit disappointing. OK it's not all bad, Harrison Ford is better than ever and delivers some great gags, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega put in really good performances as the new blood who hopefully go on to do better things maybe in episode 8 and 9 ? I can't say too much without writing plot spoilers so go see it and make of it what you will. Hopefully you won't go in with such high expectations. I give it 7/10 but thought for sure it would be a 9."
2036,6,In a galaxy very close to the one far far away,Well after much anticipation I went to this movie and it was so deja vu. Why was it so deja vu is because it is the ultimate copy and paste job I ever seen I swear plagiarism could easily be made between this movie and the original movie let me count a few ways. 1. Both movies set on a backwater colony planet 2. Deadly force blows up planets 3. Droid with secret running from evil bad guys 4. Chief lead has mystic power 5. Respected actor tells way of this force 6. Respected actor dies near end of movie 7. Alien bar scene in both 8. Deadly death star/planet blown up by good guys 9. Major character in robes with moustache and beard 10. Good guys caught in a tractor beam
2037,3,Copy and paste,Here's a couple of reasons why and how THE FORCE AWAKENS works and succeeds.
2038,9,How THE FORCE AWAKENS works and succeeds,This movie makes it on so many levels. The new Kylo Ren though is one that stands out. The opening scene when he arrives is one of the best scenes in any Starwars movie. He is one villain to look out for. Jj Abrams the director and writer has found a perfect harmony of mixing old and new Starwars elements together to give a feeling that Starwars is back. The new characters of fin Ray and bb8 all make the grade as well by fitting into the Starwars universe. Good to see that C G I has been not overly used and the feel of the movie is similar to the original trilogy. Some reviews say that it's just a reboot of new hope but this is just being negative. There's definitely a storyline that could go anywhere into Starwars 8. Han Solo chewie and Princess Leia are all back and add to that nostalgic feel. Harrison ford in a few of his longer scenes is brilliant. There are lots of hand chewie humorous moments throughout the movie too. The old xwing tie fighter dogfights are bigger and better as well. Poe dameron the new wedge is sure to be a fan fav. The movie moves along at a good speed and always has u. The ending is a great scene and cliff hanger. 10/10
2039,10,Very exciting,"Writer and director made a good job of undertaking the enormous job of shooting a decent sequel to the Saga created piece by piece in the last 40 years. It is not easy for a 135 minute movie, 1) to introduce a new future, 2) introduce a new generation of heroes and villains, 3) while making a believable follow-up connecting past and present."
2040,8,A good follow-up for the Saga and a nice bridging job for the future,"I would say JJ has taken on a very difficult task in making this film and has done a remarkable job. It looks like everyone associated with making it is having the time of their lives. With a blend of CGI, puppets and live action, this film ticks so many boxes and has a look and feel of the originals. Very good performances all round especially the new characters. There is a couple of things that you could pick out on the negative side but I won't, simply because I've been a Star Wars fan like so many others since they first came out and I'm very happy with this result. Just go as soon as you can, lock yourself away until you do."
2041,8,Loved it.,-SPOILER ALERT-
2042,7,There is nothing new under the sun,"I being a devout Star Wars Fan since childhood having seen the first installment in 1977 at age 13, have eagerly awaited this new film and I was not disappointed. In essence this is a reboot of good old fashioned ""Star Wars"" story telling from the first 3 films ( A New Hope, The Empire Striked Back and Return of the Jedi ) set 30 years after the Empire was overthrown in Return of the Jedi. We get quickly introduced to 3 new likable characters, who get thrown together in a battle to save the resistance. We get 2 new bad guys and there cronies, the dark side of the force has awakened and is threatening to destroy the peace in the Galaxy. We get our old original characters back to, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbecca and Luke Skywalker reprising there roles in varying degrees along with our favorite droids C3PO and R2D2 along with a new cute likable rolling beach ball like droid called BB8. It is an easy to follow story, a lot of elements are like a trip down memory lane but I loved it and the new characters. You get the action, space battles and tongue in cheek humour along with fantastic special effects. This is a great film to suite a broad range of ages and introduce the newer generation to the Star Wars franchise. I recommend the movie ""Stae Wars: The Force Awakens"" as time well spent in good old fashioned ""escapism"" and the battle between good and evil, just go and see it and enjoy it! I loved it and went and watched it again. On a footnote, there seems to be a lot of reviews panning this movie, my opinion on that is that people need to look at the bigger picture, you can't bring back the youthfulness of the original actors/actresses from 1977's A New Hope, they are very aged now and ""old farts"" ( no insult intended ) and you can't have a cast from 1977 galloping around the Galaxy, doing stunts and epic space battles, when they are almost ready for a nursing home, it just doesn't wash and is not credible to make a movie on that basis, this is Star Wars - A New Generation for a new generation which introduces young actors/actresses, my favorite is the heroine Rey, played by Daisy Ridley..talk about girl power"
2043,9,"A Nostalgic reboot of ""A New Hope"" with new characters and old","Let me say the force awakens is a fun movie filled with action, drama and interesting twist. The problem it adds nothing new. It's basically a contemporary remake of A New Hope. It follows that movie basically plot by plot. And unlike good remakes it doesn't add any new weapons, concepts or ot points. There is an interesting new philosophy they began to add. But it does not forgive the overall redundancy the plot took."
2044,6,Rehash that again.,"If I was to write a review on Star Wars: The Force Awakens on IMDb, this is what I would say: that the fans are divided into three psychological categories, when it comes to the latest film: 1) The ones that are so into it, that feel grateful even for the prequels, even though they're smart enough to see that Jar-Jar is more destructive to the soul than a Star Destroyer... and they are positive, optimistic, and rather prefer to indulge into the sweet disposition of simply watching Star Wars for the great movie it is. (Like the fans of Federer.. they know he's the king, and still adore him even if he sometimes loses xD) 2) The unsatisfied ones, because they truly honor Star Wars so much for what it should be, that they feel they have the right to criticize everything they find inconvenient... like saying that this Star Wars has no original story and so on... (But I personally disagree with them, they forget this is just the beginning of a new story, thirty years after the Originals, and The Force Awakens is a foundation to the sequel trilogy... for them, I only have this advice, give it a chance and wait to see how the story unfolds in the next Episodes. ) 3) Amateurs... that criticize it by a need to be up to date with the newest films en vogue, that never really cared about Star Wars and don't value the impact it had in the science-fiction world."
2045,10,On The Force Awakens,I am one of those people who did a Star Wars Marathon for the first time in their life and then watch the Force Awakens.Of course I had high expectations going into this film which were fulfilled.However I still feel like it had some flaws which I am going to dive into straight in.
2046,7,Kinda of similar to the original series but still very well-done!,"OK, so last night I watched Star Wars VII for the first time. On a rental DVD."
2047,2,A train ... well... star destroyer wreck :(,"So, after 3 viewings, here is my short review:"
2048,10,My review after 3 viewings.,I don't really understand the negative reviews on here. People moaned that the prequels were nothing like the original trilogy and now they are moaning that this is too similar! Get a life guys!
2049,9,A great movie,"When you need to revitalise a sickened body, the first thing you need to do is cleanse it of the poison. The title 'The Force Awakens' seems to suggest that a period of rehab is needed before the franchise can return to the track set by the original trilogy."
2050,10,A scene-setter for the future,It has been a while since I remember sitting through five showings of Return of the Jedi at the local cinema. The Star Wars films had always interested me but this film resonated at so many levels it just became a part of me.
2051,10,Back to reality,The Force is strong in these younglings....
2052,7,The Force is strong in these younglings,"I don't have anything to say, but the return of the best characters of the saga make this one of the best episode of the saga."
2053,10,Good work!,"I just rewatched the movie after many years and decided it was time to review it. Why? Well, at the cinema i really liked it. It was a fast and fun ride, well made and never boring. Seemed like a good movie to me. Now i was able to see more problems of this movie so my rating got a little lower than before. The reason for this is dialoque, story, fan service. While the fan service can be fun at times, it was just a little too much. For the story, well, there are many holes in the story that don't make sense. It feels like they needed to find cool looking scenes and put them together without the need to explain how they got there. And they almost get away with it but when you rewatch them it becomes more and more obvious. And the dialoque needed some work too. They put some joke in there no one would really do in real life. It doesn't feel natural. It they didn't do these mistakes this could have been a really awesome movie even though its more or lees a remake of a new hope. In the end its a good movie but this one would not have triggered the same star wars hype like the original trilogy did."
2054,7,good but overrated,"I loved the first three star wars movies, and watched them when they came out on the big screen. I watched them again when they were updated and re-released. They were a lot of fun, but you have to be honest, these are not life-changing movies that really make you think. They're entertainment - good entertainment, but just entertainment. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that."
2055,9,"Wonderful, with a very ""first trilogy"" feel to it.","My, my my Here we are. Star Wars episode VII, the force asleep!"
2056,6,"Predictable? In french we say ""phone called""","What is going on with the 8.5 score on IMDb!!! Have people lost their minds! JJ Abrams has ruined the Star Wars franchise. This was a terrible remake of a new hope, there was no original ideas and all very predictable.. A droid keeping a secret yawn! Let's destroy the death star again yawn! There was no character development, everything felt rushed, Poe and Rye became best buddies with Finn instantly. There were stupid jokes across the film which I'm sure Disney came up with to appeal to kids who love the Avengers. The main character Rye magically discovers she has the power of the force and then has a full on battle with Ren and defeats him! Com'on Abrams, isn't this guy suppose to be the next Vader? So why did he come across as a complete wimp! Even Finn gave him a run for his money! please!!! I will never watch another Star Wars movie in the cinema again. Abrams you have sold out to Disney and destroyed the franchise. This was an opportunity for you to take Star Wars into a new direction but instead you ripped off episode IV and ruined it! Bring back George Lucus, at least he came out with some original ideas, they may not have all worked out but at least he had the guts to try something new!"
2057,1,JJ Abrams RUINS Star Wars but still gets an 8.5 on IMDb!!,"The Force Awakens takes place thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi. Darth Vader and the Empire were defeated and all was well. Director J.J Abrams and the rest of the cast and crew did a great job at keeping the rest of the story a secret. Until the nostalgic and amazing intro with that score - that made the audience cheer - we finally learned more about what happened the past few decades in the galaxy far, far away. Evil has returned and they call themselves The First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke and Kylo Ren - who wants to follow Darth Vader's footsteps. It's the job of The Resistance, led by General/Princess Leia, to destroy their secret weapon and find the one who could save them all. With the help of Rey, ex-Stormtrooper Finn and the most adorable droid ever: BB-8."
2058,8,The film has a very nostalgic vibe and looks amazing with the improvement of technology. The story was sometimes a bit rushed though,"Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens – Simply an outstanding piece of cinema. Lemme start with the story; Firstly straight from the beginning the iconic rolling credits mixed with John Williams amazing score puts a massive grin on my face, the actual credits explain the following story very clearly. The story itself is told beautifully through JJ Abrams vision who does justice and more to George Lucas' universe. JJ manages to perfectly pace the film with no scene being boring or useless. A huge amount of pressure paid off."
2059,8,Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens – Review,Kind of sad to see the number of 1 stars out of 10 reviews. 
2060,8,Not for cynics,"There is always a spice or two missing, a criticism because we are old and wise and worthy of opinion because we were ""there"" in 1977... but the *real* review is this: "
2061,9,A satisfying meal.,Fans have waited too long to see if the Franchise can survive without Lucas.. So is the film any good?
2062,7,The same as my first ever YouTube Review... Worth a watch!,"It's a shame to see so many people complaining about how similar this was to episode IV and how it feels simply like a reboot. Maybe there are points where the homage becomes extreme, but it still ticks almost all the boxes of a movie-goer. The film itself looks and feels amazing, with all the touches of old, including numerous new and old aliens lurking in the background to give it that classic star wars universe feel. Obviously as in any film there are ways you could pick at it, maybe the humour is excessive? Maybe it could be more original? But at the end of the day it will leave you laughing, crying and cheering, all in good measure. Star Wars is back with a bang, and episode VII makes it feel like it's never really been gone."
2063,9,Don't listen to the haters!,"First of all, I do not consider myself a hardcore Star Wars fan. Episodes IV, V and VI were part of my childhood, but compared with the Alien or Terminator movies, they played only a minor role. Nevertheless, I enjoyed them, and a few days ago I watched them again, together with The Revenge of the Sith."
2064,6,"Apart from the beautiful visuals, an average on-time watch",May Be Spoilers!
2065,10,All You Haters! How Could You Say The Movie Was Bad!,"For fans of the initial trilogy, from the 40-ish age group: I think you'd be better served by stopping after seeing the trailer, any way your imagination would take you would be better than the movie itself. This is not the Star Wars movie you are looking for..."
2066,6,A flawed ride through the Star Wars theme park,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens (TFA) is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. To be fair I have not yet seen Rogue One which may possibly be worse but I find it unlikely anything can be worse than episode VII. TFA fails to deliver in every category you can use to measure a film. It's story is nonsensical and trying too hard to be something it's not. It results in a rehash of episode IV. George Lucas and his team would spend months if not years planning and creating new worlds and characters to discover and explore with the audience. Disney has chosen to try and make as much money as possible, now I understand the nature of the industry and making movies with gigantic budgets like Star Wars demands a return, but if you go into the creative process with only money on your mind you have already set yourself up for failure. Because of the exaggerated and unjust criticism of the prequel trilogy, Disney has knee jerked and tried to recreate the original movie with new characters. Based on that sentence it's not an entirely bad idea. New planet, new aliens, new antagonists, sounds OK. But the success comes not from the idea but from the execution. This is where the movie was most disappointing, every aspect is executed poorly."
2067,1,You can buy the Star Wars logo but you can't buy the universe.,The Best Thing Thing That Could Have Happened to Star Wars Is Lucas handing it over. 
2068,9,The Best Thing Thing That Could Have Happened to Star Wars,"So, I just finished watching The Force Awakens after quite some time, and I really enjoyed it!"
2069,8,The Force Awakens,"I've never seen as many whiny Star Wars fanboys on one website in my life. It's like a bunch of 8-year-olds fell in love with Phantom Menace and Jar-Jar and grew up to be Hayden Christensen-like Anakin Skywalkers. Holy cow. Get off the soapbox, folks. You're full of nonsense. "
2070,9,"Ignore the trolls, people","I felt like a little kid in the movie theater seeing it opening night. I don't want to spoil anything so this review will be brief. The movie is very familiar to fans of the original trilogy. It captures the magic that was Star Wars in the late 70s early 80s. The new actors mix with the old is great, almost feels like passing the torch. You actually care for the characters and care for what happened to them. It's also the funniest Star Wars movie there's been. Even my wife liked the movie and she doesn't like Star Wars. She thought BB8 was really cute and I'm glad she went with me. I highly recommend everyone give it a shot because it's actually a great movie."
2071,10,A true squeal to the Star Wars trilogy,"To begin with The new Star Wars is a great film. It has some decent acting and storytelling, the visuals and special effects are overwhelming and most important finally part of the original Star Wars vibe is back again at the start of this new trilogy."
2072,6,Great entertainment for the young boy in me,Good....Goooooood.
2073,9,Feels like classic Star Wars with new faces.,"No matter how well constructed this movie is, the plot is just too similar to the previous franchises. The writers made no effort to be creative, zero imagination whatsoever. No new enemies, no new challenges, instead, they recycled the old enemies, they go the easy route of reviving the Empire, now know as The order, so maybe they can sell more storm troopers and tie fighter merchandise? X-wing and tie Fighter are just lazily reworked, rather than designing something more radical, three decades should have made more advances in the republic! Sure they brought back the old characters and surprisingly they are just icing in the toppings and have little contribution to the overall plot, except for Leia to suit their political agenda of third wave feminism. The only good thing about the movie is fairly well act, special effects are great and some minor nostalgia values. If you are looking for something new, just skip this movie and wish it never existed."
2074,6,Recycled Plot put a damper in this movie.,"I saw the Thursday evening premiere with the highest of anticipation!! I was 12 years old when I saw my first midnight screening at Revenge of the Sith. I will never forget that experience. And although I've grown up and found how flawed the entire prequel trilogy is, the Star Wars universe still means so much to me."
2075,9,It's hard to believe this movie is actually real!!,"The Force Awakens is an exciting return to the Star Wars universe after the disappointment of the Prequel Trilogy. While it doesn't take the franchise in many new directions, it delivers a fun and exciting Star Wars adventure."
2076,7,A Safe Yet Satisfying Return to Star Wars,"As a die hard star wars fan, I really waited for this movie However, I came home disappointed Basically its episode IV reboot, its a shame they don't make a new story Here is the comparison: 1. Princess Leia hidden the Death Star plan on R2-D2 vs Poe hidden Skywalker location on BB-8 2. Luke is scavenger so is Rey 3. Obiwan lower his shield and killed by Darth Vader vs Han Solo is killed by his own son 4. And then the final attack on the BIGGER (unbelievable they repeated it and just said its BIGGER now) Death Star or whatever they called it....when I saw it again I did not believe, and you know the end. 5. Luke find Yoda - Rey find Luke"
2077,1,"This is NOT a episode VII, its episode IV reboot","Sometimes, the most hyped movie ends up being the worst. There however, is that handful of Directors that you can just say ""this film is in good hands"""
2078,9,My favorite film of 2015,"I liked. But he should not have died Han Solo. It is a good and very worthy remake. Hollywoodense, do not expect much. But it was more than I expected, having seen those films without soul, I, II and III. I must admit that The Force Awakens recovered the magic. There was even applause at the end of the film, by the nostalgic like me. The truth is that I spent a good time.She turned her strength. That was my thought when leaving the theater. Good effects, good plot, decent performances, a little plaintive racist, but Hollywood, is forgiven. Luke Skywalker is fat. That's all I have to say. I do not remember anything else, because I saw a while ago. Salud."
2079,,Volvió la Fuerza,"I don't understand why people have to be so picky. You would have to be a jack ass to not enjoy this movie. Especially if you're a star wars fan! I went to a Loews theater and it was packed, everyone left with a smile on their face. The experience was incredible. The effects and soundtrack were great, the acting was great. It was a more modern depiction of the Star Wars we all know and love. If you didn't like it, you're an idiot. It's a movie, it isn't perfect, but it met my standards and a majority of everyone else's. Was it a bit repetitive? Yes, but it was so well done that I didn't even care. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. If you're a big Star Wars fan like I am, get your ass to the nearest theater and see it asap. Stop being picky people. Jesus Christ."
2080,10,"Do not, I repeat, do not listen to these bad reviews","""The Jedi, the Force, it is true. All of it."" said Han Solo. Millions of people have been waiting for the 7th Star Wars movie. And I'm saying. It was worth it to see!"
2081,8,2015: The Force Has Awoken!,"I loved the movie from the opening crawl until the very (not that surprising) end. Would I have done some things differently? Sure, but you can't please everybody."
2082,9,A galaxy in chaos like never before,Never seen such a long movie with so much action jumping around to what seemed like 5 other movies but yet none of them had time to develop in the Star Wars way.. Was like they had 6 directors each do 30 min but none of them were allowed to see any of the other directors 30 min first to be able to bring it together. There was no real begging 3 hours of Middle and no ending. Of course special effects and all that were great but Disney couldn't help but drop the Golden Egg once again. I honestly think just about any average to huge Star Wars fan could of done better job with this movie.. More is not ALWAYS more!
2083,6,Made me dizzy with feelings of ADhD,"In comparison to other movies, this won't win any awards for Best Picture of the Year, but it's awesome for what it is - Star Wars. It's just like the original trilogy, and as some people complain, it might be too much like the originals. There are obvious plot devices that are re-used for nostalgia, but I appreciate them as a fan. My only gripe is the Star Killer Base - C'mon, seriously. THREE TIMES?!? WHY?"
2084,10,It's great for what it is. A Star Wars movie.,"I have thumbed through quite a few of the reviews on here for this movie, most of them rated 1 star (or occasionally 2 or even 3), along with a lengthy diatribe around why the movie is so unconscionably awful. Whilst I'd agree that there is so much lacking in this movie, I can't in all good conscience mark it down there with the most awful films I've ever had the misfortune to encounter."
2085,6,Star Wars: The Franchise Awakens,"Ah yes, the difficult seventh installment."
2086,8,Galactic romp with a minor Rey of doubt,"As a fan, I really enjoyed getting a wrap up of the old movies, by bringing in old characters and seamlessly introducing new characters. Doing this I think they should have a nice foundation for developing the story further. They also managed to keep a distance to I-III, and rather build on the world of IV-VI, and not introduce conflicting information."
2087,6,"Thin plot, nice wrap up for fans, pace too fast.","My rating is mainly for the none canned lines and of course BB8 the Droid. Which is light years better than Jar Jar and the robotic acting that existed in the horrid prequels. Granted BB8 was created mainly to sell a kids toy to the masses. However, he made me laugh and that is Hollywood gold."
2088,4,Starwars: The Force awakens or A New Hopeless Propeganda,Boycott time!!!!!!!!
2089,,As Expected Disnye Just Announced Another Trilogy,I saw this movie at 2:30 Friday morning and let me just say that it was phenomenal. Of course there are some things that i felt didn't work and some things I would have changed but overall a amazing addition to Star Wars. There are gonna are gonna be spoilers so you have been warned. 
2090,8,A fantastic installment to the movie series we all love so dearly,"If you are here and avoiding Spoilers, really really you should not be anywhere !! Stop right now and go see the movie, then come back here, there, wherever and read others opinions and thoughts. That being said, there are no spoilers in this review. "
2091,9,"It is an EVENT Movie in every sense of the word, Star Wars Reborn !","I went into the movie almost fearful.Wasn't sure at all, if this baby could possibly be rocked. I was relieved to say the least. "
2092,8,Phew ...,"I really don't know where to start. I've been reading lots of reviews and some go as far as calling this movie a 'Chinese IPhone'. The sole fact that Star Wars is being compared to that Apple abomination is an insult. Star Wars, even though a consumerism product was not originally conceived as one. And this movie as commercial as it is, has to some degree the charm of the original trilogy. J. J. Abrams did a great job specially using lots of practical effects instead of CGI was one of the perfect choices Abrams made for this movie, it makes it feel genuine, it makes it feel like part of the Star Wars family. Another review in here says, the visual effects look like from 1977. Well... That was the intention, trying to make it look as genuine and accurate to the original trilogy as possible... And they achieved it! But make no mistake, this movie has similar looks to the original Star Wars, but that, by no means, mean that the visuals are the same, the CGI is near perfect as well as the practical effects and The Academy did well with the visual effects nomination."
2093,9,Every Generation has its Legends.,"I went into this film with an open mind and open heart wanting to love it. The last three Star Wars films had pretty much sullied me on anything new from that camp, but hearing that Disney was taking over and furthermore, not listening to George Lucas gave me hope."
2094,6,You've Already Seen This Movie if You're a Star Wars Fan,I personally loved this movie its kinda like the other star wars films. I loved the new people in this movie and bb8. I heard some people saying they thought that Finn was kind of boring but he was captured and born as a storm trooper so what do you expect. He's already not boring for rebelling against the other storm troopers. But I will say the villain was lame. There was no violence and very little killing. I would recommend this movie for families though because the only reason it is pg-13 is because of a little saber swingin. I was defiantly worth the wait and the money though. I would give this movie a big 8 out of 10.
2095,8,Great movie,Largely the same story as Episode IV - lonely teenager on desert planet finds a droid and they end up blowing up a large weapon. There were also quite a few really unbelievable moments Captain Phasma just takes down the shields? I mean why even have her as a character - she barely shows up?
2096,6,Disappointing - same story as Episode IV,"Driver-character as Lord Vader wannabe- should have kept his hood on- had a few temper tantrums with his light saber- not villain. When he took his hood off- there were laughs in theater. He should have kept his hood on. Audience laughed as driver character was identified as solo and general son. His character appeared as a spoiled kid. The scenes with him in them were less interesting, except when Rey gave him a Laser spanking. Enjoyed the movie and my group were into the movie when each character was introduced.we will see it again."
2097,9,Adam driver- bad choice in casting,"Firstly I have to confess that I have enjoyed the movie very much as a fan of the series, but not so much from a critique's point of view, and here is why: The movie tried way too hard to please its fans, so hard that it has forgotten to bring something new to the franchise. As always J.J. has teased his fans with the help of his so called ""Mystery box"", but all those mysteries that were set up haven't got the treatment they deserved, some of them still don't have answers or if they got they weren't answered fully, the end of the movie just desperately asks in agony for a sequel, it is just like with the trailers of The Amazing Spider Man in 2012, they set up the big question of who Peter's parents really were, but we haven't got an answer till its sequel (terrible movie, let's just hope Disney does better next time). As it is the case with The Amazing Spider Man, the movie it's just an extended trailer. Also the reveals aren't as shocking or surprising as Abrams would have expected, they are way too obvious. Now the villain Kylo Ren is resembling too much Darth Vader, probably that's what the studio has wanted from the beginning, not just the villain resembles perfectly the first film from the franchise( or forth), the plot is also almost identical with the first installment ( or forth, take it as you prefer). Also some characters that we would've liked to see more on the screen got sidelined, as mentioned before probably they already signed for a sequel. Now let's not just complain about the movie, so I'll let the fan from me to speak now: ""BEST MOVIE EVER!"" OK, just joking with the that, but overall the movie was great, it didn't live up to the hype, but there wasn't any chance on earth that it could, but overall it was great, now let's see some reasons: One of the the things that really made this movie stand out was its humor, probably it's the funniest movie in the series. Secondly all that nostalgia, it was really good to see old friends, and almost all of them got the treatment they deserved. Also the villain was pretty good, leaving aside his outfit, he felt really human and his interactions with the others were really well done, it was interesting seeing him during some nasty situations. An other thing that I really enjoyed were the action scenes, well directed, a clap for Abrams for this. Now let's sum up a little bit and reach a conclusion, overall the movie was an enjoyable ride and it was good to see some old friends back and despite being great it could've been even greater, but Mickey probably wanted to play safe with this, it probably didn't want to bring a crusade on itself like Lucas did with the prequels ( Am I the only one who liked them?) The movie has gone with the original formula and it succeeded, but it doesn't bring anything to the franchise yet ( damn it sequels). While watching it expect something entertaining, not something that will strike your mind for months, like 6th Sense did.( speaking of twists, or even the 5th movie The Empire Strikes Back)"
2098,7,"The force is strong with the fans, but not so much with the critiques",I've just been watching a YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU7SGn0MeP0
2099,3,"It is not a sequel, but a remake 2","This movie has properly brought back star wars for me. Many people has said that this movie is a direct copy of Episode 4. This film is very nostalgic and yes there are things where it is directly taken from the original but its done with a purpose. The thing is that history repeats itself all the time. We look at our own history and we see patterns. The star wars is the same way. This is the story for the next generation and this story more involves the offspring and relatives of the original cast. Kylo Ren, the son of Han and Leia, is the new bad guy in town. He is obsessed with being like his grandfather, Darth Vader, and finishing what he started. It only makes sense that the New Order would do exactly what Darth Vader did because they want to be just like him. Kylo Ren is struggling between good and light. He is still very young and so we are seeing him kind of beginning of his actualization. People have said that he is too whinny but I think thats the point. He was a dumb kid who was obsessed with power and decided to go to the dark side. Anakin Skywalker was whinny too and even Luke was in the beginning. There are many unanswered question about Rey. They vaguely hint that she many be related to Luke Skywalker but we don't officially know how yet. We will just have to wait for Episode 8 to really fins that out. Rey is a strong character and we catch her in the beginning of her journey and but the end we see the force awaken for her. If you have the Force you have it. Each character in star wars has a moment when force awakens for them even before they have been trained. We see this happen to Rey which is why she is able to have such a command for the force before she has been trained. There are many bad user reviews of this movie because are so passionate for the story which I totally understand but in the end if you pick apart every detail and exhaust it then you will looks the magic. So watch and enjoy. There are more movie to come and more questions will be answered."
2100,10,Something that has brought back the old star wars in a good way,"Let me preface by saying, Thank you JJ. "
2101,10,The Force Awakens : The Awakening we've all been waiting for.,"-Kylo Ren is not scary, he is so powerfull, but his enemies have no respect of him. He is more like a teenager in puberty. Poe Dameron talks to him, as if he were a joke. So he felt for me like a joke.<br /><br />-I dont liked it when Rey spilled the powder next to the bowl. Its so hard for her to get food, but she's not really carefully with it. Sympathy minus point for me.<br /><br />-Dramatic scenes didn't felt dramatic, probably because the weak figure of the antagonist<br /><br />-To destroy the Starkiller Base didnt seemed difficult"
2102,,weak antagonist,"This movie is not perfect....but it was amazing. I loved the story, and the new characters are memorable. Rey, Finn, and Poe are extraordinary additions to the the Star Wars Franchise. I only had problems with the pacing of this one. Character arcs were extremely rushed and I had no time to think about each one. Except for Rey of course... With the ending the way it was that's to be expected I suppose. JJ Abrams has a great eye but not a great hand the writing was...alright... The Drama didn't peak when it needed to, and the comedy was all too predictable. I'm sorry not to see him back again to get little redemption. Even with these minor problems I can't wait for the next one... It is Star Wars of course."
2103,9,Spectacular,What to say that has not already been said in previous reviews?
2104,10,A nostalgic ride with a fresh coat of paint,"I have to admit when I saw this for the first time I was absolutely spellbound, I thought 'finally another Star Wars movie with charismatic characters and practical filmmaking, this is a massive step up from the prequel trilogy'. However, I was skimming over an important factor into why this movie was loathed by hardcore Star Wars fans, the 'playing it safe' derivativeness used to sucker in fans."
2105,6,A promising yet inherently flawed start to a trilogy,"Full of great moments of action, comedy and emotional/sweet. This first installment in the new trilogy feels like it achieves a fantastic balance between the new and the old."
2106,8,A great balance,"I really have to say that I was disappointed to see that Han and Lea made such bad parents. I mean really, Ren was a rotten kid and instead of manning up and being a father, Han takes Chewie and runs off and Lea decides to send Ren to live with his Uncle Luke. Yeah nothing bad could have happened with that, send the kid to live with his ""Confirmed Bachelor"" Uncle that made out with his own sister not once, but twice, and if that weren't bad enough had the power to save his father but instead let him die on the ramp of the space ship that could have taken him to a damn hospital ship! Yeah that's right I said it, Vader was more machine than man and all Luke had to do was get him on that shuttle, they could have gone to the hospital ship and fixed Vader's oxygen tank and than they could have really worked on that Father/Son relationship. But NO....Luke took the mask off and let the poor bastard choke to death, and right after he saved Luke's life from the Emperor and his ""Force Lightning"". If that weren't bad enough, he doesn't even give his old man a proper funeral, no just put him on a pile of wood and let him burn, what an asshole!! This is the influence that Han and Lea wanted for their kid, it's no wonder he grew up to hate them and want to crush the resistance. That's another thing, after the empire was destroyed and Lea was an integral part of the new republic, why would there even be a resistance? Not only that was she such a power hungry bitch that when the new republic didn't do things her way that she decided to lead this band of ingrates that refuse to be governed by a legitimate democracy. Meanwhile what does the great and powerful Jedi Master do, he runs off to live on some island alone, probably because even he knows that he never actually finished his training and was ashamed to call himself a Jedi Master. Which is actually the only thing he and his father really had in common because Annakin never was an actual Jedi Master either, yes he sat on the Jedi counsel for a minute before Palpatine conned him into coming to the Dark side in what was probably the most anti-climatic transformation ever. But back to the story at hand. It is refreshing to see that if the Jedi are to ever make a return it won't be a Skywalker, because let's be honest, the Skywalkers are to the Jedi what the Bush's are to American Government, Each one worse than the last. One last thing, WHERE WAS LANDO?? I am really hoping that in the future we find out that the reason Han left Lea was really because he caught Lea and Lando in an Endor tree house, and that is where Finn actually did come from..."
2107,7,Han Solo Deadbeat Dad...,"I feel like this is brand new, with new actors and ideas being thrown in the mix. Yet it still feels like Star Wars. This burst of new life into Star Wars is defiantly worth a watch despite complaints of similarities to episode IV, whether a Star Wars fan or not."
2108,10,New ... But still Star Wars,"This movie is mostly fun, except it's a copy of A New Hope. The fans whined about the prequels, so Abrams gave them what they wanted, a movie just like the original. This feels like lazy writing and bothers me more as time goes on."
2109,7,Good but too familiar,"This movie is so poorly written it is probably the only star wars I will only see once. It is an insipid remake of the first trilogy with elements borrowed from other blockbuster movies. Some star wars fan are just over excited to see a millennium falcon and forget what made the trilogy they like so great. It is this entire universe so well designed and structured, filled with plot twists all along the road. This one does not contain any structure nor any plot twist. It comes up with one new idea which is the rebellion of stormtrooper (taken from books). Which is great but not enough. They should have spent more time digging in those books because there are a lot of fantastic ideas out there that I would have loved to see on screen."
2110,3,Poor plot,"It is somewhat humorous to read through IMDb reviews of Episode VII, realizing how much anger and frustration went into so many negative reviews. You certainly get the feeling, that the Die-Hard fans of the original trilogy generally walked away disappointed."
2111,9,"May the force be with you, always",By: Meli 
2112,9,star wars,"No spoiler here, just reading the other reviews of the movie (which I did see and, for the most part, enjoyed), and I've decided that all of you total geek-nerd Star Wars lovers should just stay home and not go to another episode. You will never be satisfied with anyone's imagining that is not a perfect continuance of the first three. You couldn't even be happy when the director who wrote the first three and created the whole franchise and world, endeavored to write his own prequels. You are like the those who usurped Apple from Steve Jobs, because they didn't think he was good enough to run his own company. Now you've been given new writers and you are still not happy. Just don't go! I guarantee you'll find flaws and hate it, and if you don't hate it now, you will once all of your freak friends convince you of all of the things you were supposed to hate. I take this all back, just go, or you won't have any complaining to entertain yourself with until the next one comes out."
2113,8,Just don't waste your time GEEKS!,"In a galaxy far, far away, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and crew are back to defend the universe from a new threat known as the First Order. Directed by action-adventure maestro J.J. Abrams, the fast-paced seventh installment of the ""Star Wars"" series takes place 30 years after the Empire's defeat in ""Return of the Jedi."" Fresh-faced newcomers include scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley), stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and a lovable new robo-kid on the block, BB-8. To the audience's delight, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher reprise their roles as Luke and Leia Skywalker. This latest chapter of the intergalactic space-age saga has already broken box office records.

2114,8,Familiar faces and newcomers take on a new evil power,"I put a 6/10 by respect for the two first saga but seriously... what a crap! Swimming leia, Han Solo the legend killed by a crying baby, is this a joke? Where is the scenario? I think this ""movie"" is a commercial for toys"
2115,6,Sigh,"SW7 had done a superb job at almost all aspects of the filmmaking, however had gone no where with the macro-level story telling including the further expansion of the star wars universe. Every new star wars film under Lucas expanded the star wars universe by either introducing a new race of aliens, a new planet, or showing us more of a planet that was previously introduced. What type of planet is Jakku? A bootleg of Tatooine. What planet did Maz lived in? Well they have a bar that is also a bootleg of the one in Tatooine from episode IV. Star Killer Base? COMON!"
2116,8,Can anyone name one new thing that you have learned about the star wars universe from episode 7?,"DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!Star Wars: Force Awakens was OK when went to see it, however there were some obvious elements from the original trilogy brought in for instance: the mentor type character being killed by a familiar face, a ""son"", this is a link between Obi-Wan and Anakin because as said in Attack Of The Clones Anakin considered Obi-Wan as his father, and Obi-Wan was struck down by his former apprentice, as Han Solo was by his son Kylo Ren. In addition the obvious copy from Star Wars 1977 brought into Force Awakens was that there was as said in the movie itself ""it's another Death Star"". Also the planet Tatooine has been renamed Jakku and the R2-D2 character has been replaced by BB-8. With all these facts there are some good points to the movie itself like the practical backgrounds instead of using CGI, which in fact was one of the main issues people had with the prequels. My final point is that I think that this movie tried to disregard the prequels because there were no references that I had seen within Force Awakens which I think was not the best of choices film makers could of made. Overall it was OK but needs to make a more original storyline."
2117,7,"It was OK, however it does not have an original storyline.","Where to begin?? A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...... to cheesy? Probably. However it does feel like a long time ago since the last time we were treated to an amazing Star Wars movie. Now let me be clear, star wars is more than just a movie saga for hardcore fans and casual film goers alike the gravity that these movies carry is not lost on anyone. I personally fall into the hardcore fan category and i was lucky enough to attend the London European premiere (had to slip that in there) as the place where i was finally after a decade of waiting thrust back into that galaxy far far away. My biggest problem with writing a review for this film is a recognition that as a fan objectivity will be difficult (10/10) however i will try."
2118,10,Its back!!!!,"...since I saw episode 4, where an unknown boy leave his home in a desert planet to travel with a smuggler on the fastest spaceship in the galaxy, just to end fighting the empire in a final battle that destroys a big space station able to annihilate planets. "
2119,7,I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...,I watched this movie last night with great anticipation and was thoroughly disappointed. There was no real purpose to the film.
2120,5,what happened,"A much awaited movie for all the ""Star Wars"" fans. Not since ""The Return of the Jedi"" has there been a Star Wars movie that has been worth watching. The movie marks the return of Harrison Ford as ""Han Solo."" Carrie Fisher as ""Princess Leia"" and Mark Hamil as ""Luke Skywalker."" The other well-known characters that also make a return are ""Chewbacca,"" ""R2D2"" and ""C3PO."" Added onto this are some new characters who bring the ""Star Wars"" story sequence up to date, who give a solid powerful performance in their roles - Daisy Ridley as ""Rey,"" John Boyega as ""Finn"" and Adam Driver as the evil ""Kylo Ren."" It has been thirty years since the evil Galactic Empire was destroyed and a new threat has arisen and attempts are made to rule the Galaxy. However, the forces that attempt to do this face a challenge from a group of people and it is they who get assistance from the Resistance. But they need to find Luke Skywalker."
2121,9,Well Worth the wait.,"We've been waiting for this moment for a lifetime and it has finally arrived. Did it live up to the hype? The answer is it truly depends. If you went into the show expecting to experience a film that revolutionizes the whole industry with its magical wonder, excitement and beautiful story you will be sorely disappointed. That is what the original trilogy did. You can't go back and to the same universe with the same characters and the same themes and expect to some how be blown away again like the originals don't exist. "
2122,10,J. J. Abrams skillfully balance the old with the new!,"I will make this a very concise review. The Force Awakens is an incredible movie that is a fitting addition to the Star Wars canon. The combination of the new characters mixed with the legends was very well done, and we truly have a new trilogy to which we can look forward. To be fair, no villain will ever live up to the legend of Darth Vader, but Kylo Ren is well cast, and a deeply flawed character. Finn and Rey were perfectly cast. I have read of of the negative reviews of this film, and while it is within people's rights to say what they want, I just cannot imagine what somebody would have done better. This movie was not only extremely exciting, it leaves me anxious to see the future movies."
2123,10,Incredible,The look and feel is true to Star Wars...the characters are interesting and mystery surrounds what has happened since the Return of the Jedi. Great feeling leaving the theater after this movie. Hopeful for the remaining 2 films of this trilogy.
2124,9,Star Wars returns with this movie!,"To add my voice to the thousands who have already written reviews, here is mine. It will contain spoilers."
2125,6,Sweet Jabba! Another Review,"I went to the movie theater at the last moment and with mixed feelings. I was prepared for a major disappointment. And perhaps that made me resist and fully accept this Star Wars edition. In short, the first time I saw the movie I thought I am done with Star Wars. But... Apparently it is not that easy to reject this powerful dope, the saga turned into for such a great number of people. "
2126,8,"Relatively disappointing, but yet not quite","If you are a Star Wars fan, you absolutely need to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I rated this movie a 7, but I understand why others rate it higher. Below I'll explain what I like about Star Wars, which will tell you why I rated The Force Awakens a 7, but anticipate rating its sequels higher."
2127,7,Great Step Toward Closing the Story,This film is the cinematic equivalent of a pickpocket: it violates you with lies and steals from you the money you carry your pocket and gives back nothing.
2128,,Terrible beyond belief,"I'm a veeery long-term Star Wars fan, since the release of A New Hope back in '77."
2129,9,Blew my mind!,so let's see ... there's this evil empire that's building a death star to kill planets ... a band of rebels need to take 'em down ...
2130,6,welcome to 1977 - without the surprise,"This movie had many nice scenes, moments, sometimes quite good character play, but they are poorly linked and have a bad structure. If I would tell a tale like this to kids, they would probably ask 1000 questions or just throw at me a bunch of pillows. "
2131,4,Slightly amusing but rather painful,I loved loved loved Star Wars. J.J. Abrams did an outstanding job and I'm very hypercritical of reboots or sequels. The bar I set for them is the Godfather part 2. While this film does not match Godfather part 2 it's still the movie I was expecting and more. What we got was an outstanding film with all the right elements adding In fan service and tying the story to the original movies. You can Listen to the other reviews but I know this film did it justice and People want empire strikes back. However this isn't Empire strikes back. This is the force awakens and the sooner people realize it the sooner they'll enjoy this movie. Don't take my word for it. You be the critic. Not let someone be your critic.
2132,9,No one can be satisfied.,I like this movie because the action in this movies was amazing and I like how the characters from the last movies return. In this movie it show what happening more than action and how to now what right and to escape from someone or something. And the new little guy is awesome it runs around helping it companions in difficult situations and try to survive. but what good is they found something that was lost and met something that disappear for a long time overall it a good to watch.
2133,8,I like this star wars movie,"As a die hard fan of ""Star Wars"" I watched all the previous films lot of time. With great hope I started watching ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens "". OK,it was not bad , it was really good. It was good to see both the new and old faces. The atmosphere was great. Somehow there was lack of intensity. I didn't get the dark,tensed moments like in the original trilogies. The actions were great.There was several time mentions of the dark side of the force,but it didn't feel that dark. Adam driver was great as Kylo Ren but he could do more. "
2134,8,Something from the past !!!,This is only supposed to be a short review containing no spoilers.
2135,10,Great movie,Captures the feeling of star wars well. Familiar but introduced interesting new cast.
2136,7,Strong reboot,"Even though this trilogy couldn't stick the landing by any means, I find The Force Awakens to still be memorable and enjoyable five years later. Yes, it generously borrows plot points from A New Hope, but adds just enough new stuff to make it a relevant sequel to such a beloved franchise. The same cannot be said for the films that follow."
2137,8,Great Intro to Star Wars for a New Generation,"JJ Abrams entered that Dark Side cave in Dagobah and came out alive and in one piece. Being a Star Wars fan himself, he knew it would be impossible to reboot the most popular franchise of them all and please everybody, no matter what he did. Too much nostalgia would throw off the uninitiated newcomers; too little would appear as treason to the crowd that has memorized every single line from the original trilogy. On top of that, JJ and his team faced the challenge of introducing new characters the audience would care for, catch up with what the ""legacy"" ones had been doing over the last 30 years, quickly explain what the Force and this galaxy are all about, and at the same time set up the narrative context for two more movies to follow. All in 135 minutes, where exposition, character development, drama, comedy and action would have to be balanced perfectly."
2138,7,"An archetypal epic story, retold (but not remade)","When I was nine years-old I remember watching some show on TV, and they did a segment about this new movie that everyone was going mad to see: Star Wars. And from the clips that were shown, I became infected with that same madness too."
2139,9,Now this is Star Wars,The force awakens is definitely not the best Star Wars movie you could watch but it's not the worst either (the clones attack is in my opinion).
2140,7,When disappointment awakens,"Here on IMDb.com I read ""sonofhades"" review. He pretty much summed up the entire movie."
2141,2,"This movie was awful, all hype, did NOT deliver the force.",Yes im an avid star wars fan and have been since I was 4 years old watching a new hope in the cinema but I've also tried to remain pretty unbias.
2142,9,The sequel we were craving,"The movie was a very good one. The special effects were in their prime. The new characters were very good. Rey and Finn were spectacular. BB-8 was an adorable droid. I was very happy at the return of 2 classic Star Wars characters - Han Solo and Chewbacca aka Chewie. Kylo Ren was a very formidable yet fragile villain. I liked how J.J. Abrams and George Lucas decided to have Finn originate as a Storm Trooper as it gave us some intel on how Storm Trooper life is. The scene showing Darth Vader's near;y disintegrated mask really sent a chill down my spine. Later on, the return of Princess Leia, C3PO, R2D2, and the other Rebels really made me happy. The attack on the First Order's Planet Destroyer/Home Base had a sad ending... Oh NO!!!!!! Kylo Ren killed Han Solo. I had to stop myself from bursting into tears. The light-saber fight between Kylo Ren and Finn and Rey was very good. It left us in suspense determining Kylo Ren's fate. In conclusion, the movie was really good but the killing of Han Solo brought its original 10 rating down to 8."
2143,8,Very Good Movie Yet Killed My Favorite Star Wars Character,I've been a Star Wars fan since 1977 and although I'm no Jar Jar advocate I've enjoyed every movie in the saga; even the weak and poorly written Phantom Menace.
2144,10,Tour de Force,"With films that contain and have to be true to so much history and character development, decades worth, I saw this with no expectations. It was a fun movie to watch, had a lot of great elements and left the audience wanting more. My five year old saw it with me and was entertained the entire time. I mention that only because as a film, it can stand on its own merits, regardless of the die-hard fans pumping the rating up. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made, but it seemed to be more in sync with the first three from way back in the day, it had the same atmosphere and pacing, the same dialogue and character development."
2145,8,Pretty Good,"This movie was very, very, FUN. It was not perfect; but then again, I don't think any of the Star Wars movies are perfect. "
2146,7,As expected,The most anticipated movie of the last decade definitely lives up to expectations. The perfect blend of old and new is enough to satisfy even the most sceptical of moviegoers.
2147,8,Lives up to the hype.,"Episode 7 had been in the rumor mill ever since the prequel trilogy came to a great end with Episode 3. With Disney purchasing Lucasfilm, it seemed fitting that Episode 7 be their first effort in the franchise."
2148,7,A Fitting First Chapter in the New Trilogy,"This is absolutely the Star Wars film people, not just fans, have been waiting for all these years. Right from the beginning the thrill of Star Wars is palpable and the wonder of discovery returns. J.J. Abrams brings his talent for making the audience care very much for his characters and sets up not just a new trilogy, but a whole new generation of Star Wars that the prequel films could not muster. The magic of this world, the excitement of conflict and even the comedic moments between the endearing characters are all there."
2149,10,An incredible adventure!,"it's what every Star Wars fan waited for. Great story, great action, great characters (and acting)(with Harrison Ford's Han Solo being the brightest of them all)... but..."
2150,7,"""razzle dazzle them""",This movie is made for kids under 12 years old. The writer/director does not watch Star Wars. Amateurs without training can easily wield light saber and duel with a Sith - dark lord? Pleaseee
2151,1,Waste of time,"This is Star Wars as it was meant to be and one feminists will be proud of for all the right reasons. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as Han Solo is on screen more than anyone would have expected. He is commanding, fully invested in his role and delightful as always to watch. But it's the new comers who well and truly stamp their mark on this film. "
2152,10,Feminists will be proud for all the right reasons,"To put it bluntly, episode VII is everything I could've asked for and more. "
2153,10,Modern film-making combined with the magic of the originals,"If you want a Star Wars film that cares more about the characters than it does about special effects and flashy light saber fights, this is the film for you. Although Finn, Rey and BB-8 were fantastic, it was Kylo Ren that stole the show in my opinion. How do you fill the void that Darth Vader left behind after Return of the Jedi? By introducing a villain that is as interesting and as deep as Kylo Ren is. Everything about Kylo Ren works for me and that is so refreshing after the prequels failed to have any decent villains. "
2154,9,Only Empire and Hope are better to me.,"This is a movie that can absolutely stand up to the originals, which is rare. It didn't work with the prequel trilogy and didn't quite work with the Ewok spin off movies either. This Star Wars feature has a great cast and the chemistry between every single one is amazing, no matter if an old, well known or a new, unknown characters. Also J.J. Abrams is a great director for the movie, at first I was going to be to much like the new Star Trek franchise, but even so it does have some elements of them, it still gives me the Star Wars feeling that captures every Star Wars fan. J.J. Abrams makes some very good decisions and even so he ""had"" to kill of Han Solo, he does it in a surprising way. All in all this movie is not perfect, but pretty close and am absolute must see, not only for hardcore Star Wars fans."
2155,9,A truly great Star Wars Continuation,"Straight out of the gate this movie had the look and feel of the original trilogy. I noticed a few early nods, but unfortunately it became abundantly clear that I was watching Episode 4 reincarnated. While I enjoyed it, this made the movie very predictable. I wish I was being super critical, but even Jurassic World had more surprises."
2156,7,"Satisfactory for an Old Fan, but I wouldn't say Great",****POTENTIAL SPOILERS*****
2157,10,"I cant believe nobody ""gets"" it .....#Spoliers",Han Solo's death was sad but this movie is just crazy too many stuff is going on it is an OK movie to watch with the family but still not a really good movie.
2158,6,Something,I was very scared about this film. My hands were actually shaking as I walked into the cinema. My heart was thumping rapidly as I wondered what Mickey Mouse might have done to the Star Wars franchise.
2159,9,"Maybe it's because I had low expectations, but VERY GOOD",The huge fighting scenes were great but if you dive in to the story it really was one big repetition of the first ever released Star Wars. The movie was slick and clean and it felt like one big animation. 
2160,7,A new hope on steroids,"I have seldom seen a film where the male and female leads had as little chemistry. They seemed totally bored with each other, and only managed a half-hearted hug to set up a Harrison Ford line ending with ""... hug later."" If they had been able to act, perhaps they might have convinced the audience that there was some attraction, but since they couldn't act, they didn't convince. And speaking of chemistry, what happened to having a little bit of science in a science fiction movie? They happily travel at the speed of light, bouncing off trees and rocks, as they head through space. Einstein's general relativity is celebrating its 100th anniversary, but the script writers seem to be ignorant of anything remotely related to the actual science of time, space or advanced weaponry."
2161,1,No Chemistry Between Leads,"I don't understand why this movie has gotten so many negative reviews. I think it is underrated, so I was compelled to give it a perfect 10 score. My original thinking was that it was somewhere around 9.5."
2162,10,Best Movie Ever?,The art of Film making has awakened in making this movie.
2163,10,"FINALLY THEY MADE A ACTUAL MOVIE, also : why didn't Jurassic world have this level of special effects ?","The best of the last three movies. Good start to the last trilogy, has definitely given me the Star Wars vibes"
2164,8,Not as bad as everybody says.,"The minute the Star Wars running storyline came on screen with the familiar music score, I had chills. Honestly with so much hype and expectation weighing on this movie I was half-expecting that it would buckle under the pressure. But much to my very pleasant surprise, this was an excellent movie, better than I expected actually."
2165,9,Wow  The Force is Strong with this one,"This movie, when it released, was a bit of a phenomenon. A return to Star Wars, return to formula, return to a little galaxy far far away. I suppose that's the problem. Return to formula. Say what you wish about the prequels, I know I have, but they introduced a new dynamic. Light side has the advantage over the Dark side. Contrasted to the Original trilogy, which had the classic villain stronger than hero dynamic, it was an interesting concept. This movie, despite not getting the criticism for it at the time, returned to how the originals were, despite it making no sense. Was it too risky to try something new? Maybe. I don't know. Perhaps Disney didn't wish to test the waters yet. We all know what happened when they eventually did. I do wish things in this movie were truly relevant. The whole mystery box concept JJ introduced was fun to speculate on, but did he really think it through when he realized he wouldn't even be making the next two movies? It's a shame, because many concept in this movie were quite cool, and the actors were all super enthusiastic about it. Each character had a chance to be something special, each actor was going full effort, the whole crew was on full effort, it all lied on directing duties that JJ didn't realize wouldn't be his forever. If all the ideas in this movie were truly expanded upon how they should have been, this movie would be an 8/10 for me, and would have left me beyond impressed. Sadly, though, JJ had no plan, and neither did Rian Johnson, who I think forgot he was making a Star Wars movie. But I'm getting ahead of myself. This is the Force Awakens I'm talking about. Anyways, problems with the movie? Ehh, I felt it was a bit phony how Rey inconspicuously beat Kylo Ren, a trained duelist, while she, a scrapper with no more experience with a saber than a child, beat him into submission and even left him a little scar to remember her by. Welcome to the Disney conglomerate, folks."
2166,6,Had Me From The Word - Go,JJ Abrams has talent. He has talent to boot. He is achosen director. And scores of negative reviews are so-called reviews. They are anti-semitic which is obvious. I work for a Zionist organziation and fight againste vil and hate every day. Shame on the privilged fascists who hate on Director JJ Abrams.
2167,10,Anti-semitic review,"This is not a bad film, this film feels and is so nostalgic to fans of the Star Wars universe but I also feel like the just recycled part 4-5-6 and mashed it into a film. You can really see the heart and passion that has gone into the making of this film and I can't knock it, it's actually a really great film to watch but I feel like they could've done more and expanded the whole universe even more. I love Star Wars and its whole universe (the films, the games, the community) and this film had great potential to show the greatness of this whole story, but it lacked in showing us new things. Character development in this film was O.K, it was good for the male lead but I feel like they held back on the female lead of this film, we can only hope that Star Wars: Episode VIII brings more depth storyline."
2168,6,Recycled Wars,The Force Awakens is a great film that really gets back to the fun spirited adventure of the original films. 
2169,9,JJ Abrams does for Star Wars what he did for Star Trek,"Although it was a real visual show, I'm a little disappointed on the movie's scenario."
2170,7,I'm a little disappointed,"I once read a Superman comic as a kid back in the 1970's, where Supes travels into the future by zipping around the earth at super-speed, thus crossing the international dateline over and over. And at the end of the story, to get back to his own time, he of course zips around the earth IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. Even as a ten-year old, I can remember thinking, ""But that's just stupid."" I regretfully gave up reading Superman."
2171,3,Wha. Tapee. Sashit.,"No movie has had more anticipation than Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Fans have been waiting over 30 years for a sequel to the beloved franchise. The mediocre prequels not only didn't live up to fans expectations, but had many lose hope of whether Episode 7 can return the franchise to its former glory. Fans don't need to worry. Star Wars is back."
2172,10,The Force Awakens will be nostalgic for fanatics and fun for casual fans.,Saw the movie last night. I would say that it's an above average film. It wasn't perfect but it was entertaining and left me satisfied. Here are some observations: 
2173,,Better than prequels; worse than original. Overall good but had its flaws.,"I gave it 10/10 just to help the rating because they deserve to be at least 9/10. Anyway, the movie was more similar to the originals than the prequels which is good. We now get to watch not only the good guy/girl (Rey) develop, we also get to see the bad guy (Kylo Ren) develop as well. The cast is pretty good but they could tone it down with the modern style humor and just keep it classy with the Han solo style sarcasm. It is a good way to bring in a new generation of fans into the series. It is also good for helping to add to one of the greatest stories of all time. Don't be so harsh, no movie is ever going to live up to the original 3 films due to sentimental reasons and also the time period. Let's remember that when I was a kid when the originals came out there was no other movies like that. Now there are hundreds so films like The Force Awakens lose some of their value for that reason. Thanks"
2174,10,Better than the prequels not as good as the originals but still very good,"First off, I haven't done a lot of reviews on IMDb, nor have I felt a compelling need to, especially since the internet - about 2005 - devolved into a pit of ""I'm smarter than you are, no I'M smarter than YOU are"" childishness."
2175,9,Better than all the Prequels and Return of the Jedi,Right so having seen this film several times both in cinema and now more recently 3 years on (can't believe it right) It stands up to the test of time especially after a sequel in the same time period has been made.
2176,8,"amazing star wars for a new era, but Disney's controlling string are noticeable.","When I saw this movie for the first time I was actually Happy with it, but then, when I repaired that people were angry at it I was also angry. What do I want to say with this? People expectations for this movie were too high and that gave this movie an unfair rate."
2177,7,Good...But Not That Much...,"So when it was announced that a new Star Wars trilogy was to be released there was natural scepticism. After the dreaded prequels had all but tainted the Star Wars name, it was up J.J Abrams to prove a good Star Wars movie can be made in modern age cinema. I can happily say he's only gone and done it. "
2178,8,He's only gone and done it!,"First to get this out of the way - just like Episodes I, II, & III - if anyone was expecting this to match the original trilogy (IV, V, VI), then you're fooling yourself. Self professed Star Wars fans attacked the prequels (and some foolishly act like they don't exist) because they thought they were going to match the previous trilogy, when anyone with half a brain could tell they wouldn't no matter what Lucas did. While Episode I was the weakest with some questionable content, it was in no way ""garbage"" or ""the worst movie ever"" like some self righteous ""fans"" or movie goers complain about. If you're one of those people who say, ""worst movie ever"" in regards to Phantom Menace, my only advice would be to either stop watching movies for the headaches they give you or watch more than 10 movies in your lifetime before you make ridiculous statements. Episode II had some weakness and Episode III was good. The point is, that the newer trilogy would never match the magic of the original - no matter what Lucas did. Different time and anyone seeing all the altering he did to those with the numerous ""special editions"" (some cosmetic add-ons were decent, while others were absolutely terrible) could see how Episodes I, II, & III would be. All good, but certainly different. But this is not about Episodes I, II, & III - just mainly to make a point."
2179,7,"Opinions Will Vary, But This Was Entertaining Whether You Call Yourself a Star Wars Fan Or Not","This movie is completely amazing. It's structured like the old ones, and acknowledges it. Han even says something like: we can always blow it up(referring to the big laser). The acting of the beautiful Daisy Ridley and cool John Boyega, surprised me in an enormously positive way, and the rest of the cast played their roles to perfection. The movie is dynamic and will not let you sit bored for a second. Still it manages to establish the premises of the movies, while leading up to a sequel we can't wait for. In general the attention to detail is amazing, so fans will experience the full magical star wars universe, while new-comers will fall in love with what all the hype is about. I myself really love this movie and believe it works better than any star wars movie before it. It has a bit more humour, but never to an amount that feels excessive or childish. The movie could easily take some more time, but it sets up a lot for number 8. "
2180,9,"Magical, beautiful, Star Wars.","The most noticeable effort in Star Wars VII is the accuracy in the balance among old and new elements. To avoid spoiling the original Star Wars experience with too different, too much and too easy modern CGI technology, the director J.J. Abrams had to make something new starting from technology made almost 40 years ago. It wasn't a easy task but Abrams did it quite well. Actors Harrison Ford and Daisy Ridley are greats (they are worthy the whole movie) but the rest of the cast left me perplexed, with some actors really out of their roles. Some parts of the script are really poor too, lacking fresh fantasy and ""wows"" scenes, even if two thirds of the movie are enjoyable yet a awful climax makes the end very disappointing, if not boring to me. Too bad. It really could be a good Star Wars movie but it feels like the director wasn't up to carry the job all the way till the end. After this one, will I watch the next Star Wars chapter? Probably yes. Hoping next time it wouldn't be just a nostalgic experience and takes us finally in the future of the saga with something completely new and remarkable."
2181,7,Not epic but a nice nostalgic experience,"Imagine yourself reviewing the end of year projects of first year film students. You have a strange foreign kid, who apparently really wants to communicate something (god knows what), but lacks the tools or language to do so, plus he's so cracked out of his mind it probably wouldn't matter anyway. Welcome to this film! Poor production quality, bad sound, amateurish cinematography, non-engrossing characters, HIDEOUS editing. The only real good thing about this film was that it was less than 90minutes, so you'd only lose that much of your life. Unless, like I and my lady, you debate killing yourself if it went on much longer. Avoid at all costs."
2182,1,Dark Emo Unmasked!,"Okay, wait a second. What's with all the negativity in the reviews?"
2183,8,Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens,"A new story is something that have high risk, Disney doesn't want that, if they buy the franchise, is for make money. And the success on that, depends on what the fans want, and if, we can be happy with the movie or hate the company forever. "
2184,9,"All that the fans, want.","The picture was action packed almost as soon as the marque that tells us, ""A Long time ago in a galaxy far away..."" finishes scrolling down explaining that there is a new dark force in the universe threatening the rebellion."
2185,8,A thrill ride from the first second,"This movie was a lot of fun-- sure, it was derivative of Ep. 4, 5, and 6-- but it was an outline that worked and a great way to reintroduce us to this world (for the older generation of viewers that were around when 4,5,and 6 was released-- now watching ep. 7 with their kids.) "
2186,,"Great Movie! And no, it's not a reboot.",Yes I am a fan of all star wars movies. Though I cannot really watch episode 2 again it was not a good movie. (leave jar jar alone..I know he sucks but everything else was awesome maybe not pod racing either but mostly everything else.)
2187,10,amazing!! i want to go far far away over and over again,"CGI and Special Effects aside, I thought the Force Awakens left something more to be desired. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Satisfying, but a little disappointing as well. "
2188,7,Star Wars(y),So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7. 
2189,10,Best A,"A mostly positive experience, this film is the good kind of flashy and feels like a true Star Wars sequel. It has high flying escapades, robots, interesting character development, and unique uses of the Force. It does seem to suffer in context to the following films, but as a standalone it is a fun action film."
2190,7,A decent film,"I haven't been prompted to write a review for a movie for a long time, however, some reviews I have come across on this site have frankly appalled me. To give this movie only one or two stars is not realistic. This is a carefully crafted, fast-paced movie with some truly beautiful moments. It is fun. You will not look at your watch once(except, perhaps, in hope that there's still some minutes of the movie left). It is not perfect, of course, but there was not one moment which was cringe worthy. "
2191,10,Don't listen to the naysayers,"Buzz on movie too high that everyone feel it's must watch movie of the year!! so me ... I have seen old series and truly a fan of both the trilogy, but this one disappoints me seriously. The retrospective cinema with same story is shown. The film starts well and feel like yeah this is the movie you really wanted to watch and soon it will be a drab narration of old story, old characters. I felt ecstatic watch Han Solo on screen once again, but is that enough for 2015 which is called as sequel of Return of Jedi. The old movies had great persona of Darth Vader, Master Yoda and it truly lacks here. In overall you can still give a try, if you are truly star war fans. I rate it around 6 for favorite droids :)"
2192,6,Retrospective cinema & meager of story,"Frankly, most people (such as I) go to these movies because they were promised 9 movies in the 80s and so were left gaping for more. This movie could break records even if they literally showed the famous credits, and afterwards the whole movie centered around the producers taking a dump on a fan (rather than the figurative dump that this movie actually was). That being said, go see it for the nostalgia!"
2193,5,Missing a toilet scene,*SPOILERS AHEAD* 
2194,8,Familiar but Still Different,Lots of people spending hours of their life writing thousands of words of critiques. Star Wars isn't a religion. It's a series of movies made for young audiences. And they're all incredibly intriguing and have certainly captured the imaginations (and allowances) of tens of thousands of little boys and girls who grew up into the adult men and women currently critiquing it here on IMDb and elsewhere.
2195,10,It was fun. That was all it needed to be.,"I am a little surprised by the amount of hate this movie has received. Personally, I loved this movie. I won't go into detail, but to put it simply, this film was such a breath of fresh air for me. I remember buying the entire Star Wars collection a couple of months before The Force Awakens was released. I decided to watch each episode in chronological order. After going through the prequel trilogy, I literally felt exhausted. I remember my brother saying to me, ""I can't wait to watch the original trilogy."" That was the first time I had the feeling that maybe the prequels weren't as great as I remembered them when I was younger. The next day, I popped A New Hope into our Blu- Ray player. And let me tell you, I completely forgot how good that movie is. Unlike the prequels, I actually enjoyed myself while watching the original trilogy. And that is why I like The Force Awakens. I felt like I was transported back to my favorite galaxy after a long time away. I was making new friends and catching up with old ones. Is this movie perfect? No. But, I dare you to give me a movie that has no flaws. But I also understand some of the complaints claiming that The Force Awakens was to similar to A New Hope. I agree, it's very similar in some places. But you know what? I'm okay with that. This film gave us new characters that I really enjoy and I'm looking forward to getting to know them more. There are also some mysteries that I can't wait to have unraveled. To me the key to telling a good story is having a good plot and having great characters. And while the plot of The Force Awakens may not be the most original one in the world, I still enjoyed the great new characters, not to mention the old ones. Plus, I have faith that the next episode will have something new and fresh to offer. I can't wait to see what awaits Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo, Luke, and everyone else in this galaxy filled with possibilities."
2196,8,Why all the hate????,"MY AGE RATING: 12+ violence, blood, infrequent mild language."
2197,9,"Great movie, even if you are not familiar with the story","This is a shortened review. For my full length review, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/ "
2198,7,Don't listen to the internet 'haters',"Star Wars has been quite possibly the largest movie sensation of the past 38 years. Many regard it as a truly visionary masterpiece, the pinnacle of great storytelling combined with editing techniques and special effects way ahead of its time. But the truth is that Star Wars' story in itself is hardly original. Director/writer/producer George Lucas stole from just about every single action serial from the 50's such as Flash Gordon and Republic Pictures' The Fighting Devil Dogs, as well as themes and sequences very similar to Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. But none of this takes away from how much cultural impact Star Wars has had on the world. In fact, because the original Star Wars trilogy incorporates so much those films, the effect that it has on viewers becomes all the more resonant. "
2199,8,Fun out of 10,The hype surounding this film was huge and it was very difficult not to get my hopes high. Hearing the star wars intro was incredible and when I finished watching this film I felt amazing: 
2200,6,"An amazing film, an average Star Wars film","This is the best movie i seen in a long time, while the story is kind of predictable i account this to my many years of watching movies, there is rarely ANY movie that has an unexpected twist for me."
2201,10,"A great movie , nothing more to say","First of all, I don't get all the overwhelmingly good reviews. But I think people will look at this movie with more reason after the initial hype declined. I don't say it's a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one either."
2202,7,Mediocre Movie,"Very difficult to live up to the original trilogy but this was just a bad movie. Big explosions lots of CGI and not much else. The plot and script seemed to be just thrown to together with little thought. Very silly and makes little sense with many comical parts which are so silly it's funny for all the wrong reasons. JJ Abrams pulls out many tired old action movie clichés. Bad corny cheesy dialogue, bad jokes, mediocre acting, superficial characters, well I guess this is Hollywood today. Hate to say it but when the dust and hype settle another Phantom Menace. Michael Bay could not have thrown together a more idiotic silly incoherent plot and script, which has gaping holes and making any sense is not much of a consideration at all. This was like the PG rated Disney TV version."
2203,3,Very silly movie almost a comedy.,Such an amazing film. Never really watched star wars but heard it was coming out and watched the films so I could watch and understand the new one and I loved it. It is clearly made for the this generation and will be popular for another 50 years. It's fun got new and old characters for both this generation and old star wars lovers. It is a similar film to the first one but they are trying to recapture the magic. So all the kids can experience it like everyone else did when the first one came out. some people are being too critical and probably would have complained no matter what because the old ones are special to them.
2204,10,Amazing,"Being born in the 90's, Star Wars had been a staple of my childhood ranging from original trilogy's continuous VCR viewings during the holidays, Darth Vader action figures, bedsheets, schoolbags and underwear to the prequels' much anticipated theater trips and late night computer games excursions, so when The Force Awakens was first announced as the part of a new trilogy, you can probably imagine how excited I must have felt and on my second viewing, one in 3D and the other on 2D, its safe to say JJ Abrams had done justice to the name and the universe of Star Wars, by blending the timeless story line of the sequels with technological bravado of the prequels."
2205,9,"There is always a light and dark side to the force, I choose to see the light in this one.","Ok yes , it follows the first film in plot , but you've got to admit it's a good solid film .<br /><br />I loved Star Wars as a kid , and didn't care for the prequels , you had good actors with wooden lines and far too much cgi that takes away too much from the films .<br /><br />My little boy loved it ,surely that's the point that everyone's missing.<br /><br />It hasn't ruined my childhood to be honest it's the closest thing to the original films I've seen in a long time .<br /><br />Time to grow up people let the next generation have their say , and for me I loved it ,shame about last jedi .<br /><br />Fingers crossed for the next one, jj I hope the force is with you .<br /><br />Ps please make my boy happy again"
2206,8,"My little boy said it was the best film he'd ever seen , and was so excited isn't that the point ?","I left the cinema at 12:30am this morning with very mixed feelings toward this movie. Whilst my wife and children were bouncing off the walls with excitement at what they'd just witnessed, I remained a little more composed. I will try to limit my spoilers to useful, critical observations, so if you're looking for a blow-by-blow synopsis - move swiftly on."
2207,8,Making a good job of filling impossibly large shoes...,"Just a reboot of the original story. Oh the death star is replaced with something bigger but nothing that great. I like the character Rey but that is about it. No real imagination to this. Physics also take a back seat, and just dont matter. The death stars replacement shoots an energy beam that not only travels faster than light, but suddenly splits into several beams each one targeting and destroying it's own star system. Each system light years from one another. Oh and if you can somehow justify this idiotic weapon. You can not explain how the light transmitted by the destruction that results from its use, instantaneously travels it's way across hundreds of light years to those who whiteness it. Just laziness!"
2208,6,Reboot of the original,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens revitalizes everything brilliant about the Star Wars saga. It was beautiful, emotional, dark, action-packed, and above all else, it was fun. All the wonder and fantasy that was instilled in us way back with the original trilogy is all brought back here. The Force Awakens paves the way for bold things to come in this new trilogy and I can not be more excited about it all. Every character is bold and slightly old-school. But it is exactly what we need. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is an impossibly brilliant scavenger, Finn (John Boyega) is an ex- conscripted Storm Trooper, and Poe (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance's top pilot, and together they usher in the new generation of Star Wars. With the help of some old faces, of course."
2209,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"""The Force Awakens"" is a winner after the first viewing, but not in the second, third and so forth. ""Star Wars"" has its roots from the first six instalments. The extraordinary connection and understanding between the fans and the series' universe are strongly active. So, it does not matter whether ""The Force Awakens"" is good or not, as to be successful in profit-making is guaranteed. And what if it is good? Two-billion dollars in the box office is the result. ""The Force Awakens"" is the new generation of people or characters which is (new generation) being linked from the previous two trilogies."
2210,7,"""...a winner after the first viewing, but not in the second, third and so forth.""","I have seen a new hope at cinema when I was 7 Years old, since then I love movies and I love Star Wars, Episode I-III was a great disappointment but now J.J Abrams gets the old Star Wars feeling back to me. Even when this movie have some flaws it was one of the greatest movie experiences for me ever. Most of the actors did a great Job, but Daisy Ridley was really amazing in this movie, because of her Rey is my new favorite character of the whole Franchise. I will watch Episode VII a second time in cinema and then I think it will get the 10/10, that I only give after a second viewing. Don't miss this movie at cinema, you will regret for all time!"
2211,9,Waiting for that so long!,"The whole force topic is not elaborated enough. The true masters were Obi Wan and Yoda – they clearly showed signs of some advanced gurus or partly enlightened persons: fearlessness, more focused on the inside then on the outside world, little attracted by sentimentality, etc. According to this those masters should have had a less blurred view of whats was and is going on. As Obi Wan stressed the importance of Luke and as he was trained by Yoda - we can hope that there is some new inputs from Lukes side in this new trilogy. Now in contrast, to earlier statements it is not impossible that a highly advanced soul as ""Rey"" might is, can quickly proceed on the path of the force as she can bring enlightened spots from earlier incarnations. Nevertheless, some work is needed to truly ascend to a real master. Generally speaking I think the force is too much used in a wasted manner to fight each other than to withdraw the ground of existence of the dark side which are the great illusions of greediness, fear, cruelty and so on."
2212,6,Force topic is still not elaborated enough,"I could not have not more disappointed, the story line is a 100% copy of Episode 4... No character development, no fun.. It hurts watching."
2213,2,more like a parody...,"So many years ago, in this very galaxy, a young generation of people witnessed the birth of one of the greatest fantasy stories in existence. Each and every viewer succumbed to the magnificent world that had been created for their delight and the fantastic characters that conveyed all this information. A fictional universe so strong and magnetic, that despite its downs and inevitable flaws felt so real."
2214,8,A Masterful Return of an Epic and Fantastic Saga.,"I love Star Wars, I always did! So I really enjoyed this movie...but the story line is very predictable and there's nothing new on it! Funny BB8, lousy Kylo Ren, adorable Poe and Finn...I don't know if I like Rey yet...I simply hope that the rest of the new saga will bring something exciting!! Then...spoiler part: I think the dead of Ian Solo hasn't enough pathos! Even Chewbacca seems to forgot immediately that happened...I don't know...probably he should survive for at least another chapter! A thing I didn't understand (maybe I'll do the during the next movie) is close to the end, when Finn and Rey come back safe and she hug Leila...but they never see each other before or am I wrong? How could Rey know she was Ian Solo's wife? Can wait to see an answer to that!!"
2215,8,Unsure,"I haven't posted an IMDb review in a decade but I had to write this one. I've been reading all these negative reviews, and I can only conclude...the hate is strong in them. This wonderful film appeared in the #25 spot in the IMDb top 250 and has been pushed steadily down ever since. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? Here are some frequent complaints about TFA from the IMDb trolls and why they should be disregarded by sane people. *FN doesn't look like Temeula Morrison and they just cast a black actor and a female lead just to be politically correct. REBUTTAL: It's 2015, get over it. PS: Stormtroopers are not, and never were clones. They discontinued the clone program by the events of ANH. *It's stupid that FN can pick up and use a lightsaber. REBUTTAL: A lightsaber, on it's own is just a weapon. A mechanical device. You hit the switch and it goes BROOOOOMP! You don't have to be Force Sensitive to use one. General Grievious uses lightsabers and so does Han Solo. If you can use it to cut open a tauntaun, you can run somebody through with it. *Rey couldn't defeat Kylo Ren with no formal training in the Force REBUTTAL: She defeated a wounded Ren, who was still in training himself, which makes sense in every possible way. *The plot is identical to ANH and borrows elements from ROTJ just to be completely unoriginal! REBUTTAL: TFA is more of a reboot than a sequel so I expected all the fan service. And they did it damn well too! I felt like it was more of a tribute to the OT than outright plagiarism. *Han Solo went out like a bitch. REBUTTAL: No, he didn't. That whole scene was exceptionally well done and touching. People that sat behind me in the theater audibly gasped when they saw it."
2216,10,The Best Star Wars Ever!,"First off, I watched this film after watching all 6 of the previous films (guess I'm not the first) and avoided reviews of this one (again, not the first). I absolutely, wholeheartedly loved this film, it's fantastic, I want to see it again, NOW! Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Visually, wonderful, harks back to the first film (in 1977) and integrates todays CGI without making you feel as if you're watching a cartoon. The live action sequences are totally edge of the seat stuff, the change of scale stuff (seeing Rey mucking about inside a Star Destroyer, then panning out to see the thing crashed in the sand are truly awesome, no doubt. The characters are as well drawn out as they can be, it's a sci-fi-opera genre, don't forget. The new characters, Rey & Finn, well, you just root for them, don't you? Chewie & Han, you love them already. Princess Leia adds a new depth, although you feel you want to know more about what's gone on there. Our new baddies are 1: anguish, but acted much, much better than Haydn Christianson, 2:Wow, evil beyond contempt The story, music, acting, visuals kept me very much entertained & wanting for more. Guys and Gals, it's about time we faced up to it, this is a great film, one of the most successful in all time, it's especially good for the 40+s like me who saw the first films for the first time out. J.J.Adams has done a fantastic job, hands down, Kudos. I think what's going on here is, the older people (like myself, of the generation that saw the first films the first time in the 70's / 80's) saw what we always wanted, loved it, consumed it, oh! But the younger generation, bless, can't relate to it quite so much. My opinion is, it's a wonderful film, well worth watching & well worth watching again & again to see the nuances I missed. I enjoy, now, being able to talk to friends about it & revel in it. Summary, wonderful, enjoyed every minute. Bad points: Rubbish reviews. Grow up, people, if you can do better, go do it! This is a really good movie, well worth seeing, entertaining, you know what you're going to get & you actually get much, much more... For me, 7 euros is the best money I have spent in years. Not so bad, eh?"
2217,10,"A really great film, watch it !!!!!",++++SPOILERS AHEAD++++
2218,7,"Felt like a remake, but still liked it overall","The problem with TFA, imo, is that there's no deeply invested emotional connection to the new characters, at least not on the level of most of the duels in the other movies. Overall, i'd put TFA near the bottom of the list as far as lightsaber fights go. I felt no emotional connection to Kylo, Rey, or Finn. In ESB, RotS, and RotJ, you feel the emotion during the fight, you're connected to the characters, you're invested. Even in ANH you can almost feel the emotion when Vader confronts Obi-Wan on the DS1, even though the fight itself was not very action-packed and exciting. Knowing what happened in RotS really makes you appreciate that confrontation more. I felt that the emotion was missing in TFA. Sure, Han's death is shocking and tragic, and Kylo Ren is a frikkin weasel about it; but the same level of emotion and connection just isn't there that exists in ESB, RotS, RotJ, and post RotS ANH, or for that matter even TPM. I felt more connection to Qui-Gon than i did the new characters in TFA. Even if you're talking just pure action and excitement alone as far as the lightsaber fighting itself, it's still in the bottom half imo and not as good as ESB, RotS, or TPM; in this regard i'd say the only worse fight is ANH."
2219,10,The duel in TFA,"One can argue that a new Star Wars title is bound to disappoint, be it from the bitter taste the prequels left or from the inevitable hype train that raises expectations to unrealistic levels. Unfortunately, The Force Awakens also falls into the same trappings that have plagued this series ever since The Empire Strikes back."
2220,7,A New Hope for Star Wars,"The Star Wars: The Force Awakens is possibly my favorite movie-going experience since I went and saw Return of the King back in '03. For better perspective, Return of the King and Fellowship of the Ring are my two favorite movies, ever. I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, when even as the opening text crawl was up on the screen, I was feeling apprehensive about it because of how the prequels turned out. "
2221,9,"Kick-ass movie, deserving of all praise and your money.","I wasn't really interested in seeing this after the prequels turned me off of the Star Wars universe as a whole but I went with a friend who wanted to see it, so that was my attitude going in."
2222,7,"Too much of a loving homage to the originals, too afraid to be its own film","I was expecting something with more OOMPHH than Darth Vader times, the Original trilogy. But what i get after a long 2+hours is totally frustration. It's just a reboot of A New Hope, and the best(worst) part is, this 2 totally new force user can almost instantly use their new found power like someone who has been practicing for years. Wow! 1st timer can mind control, 1st timer can swing the sword and defeat a Darth Vader wannabe? wow! COOL (yeah right, so NOT cool that is)"
2223,1,The Fart Awakens and it sucks,"''Real sets, practical effect, you've been here, but you don't know this story. Nothing's changed really, I mean everything's changed but nothing's changed. That's the way you want it to be really. To see the way the technology has evolved, and yet keeping one foot in the pre-digital world.'' "
2224,9,"Is this a perfect movie? No, but what film is? This is however perfect endless entertainment and it surely lives up to its expectations.","The fans have waited for over three years to see this movie. They were praying for the creators not to destroy their childhood passion, again. Fortunately that did not happen and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is the perfect return to the original trilogy with plenty of action, humour and very interesting and eye-absorbing new characters. There is no spirit of Jar-Jar Binks in any of them and we are thankful."
2225,8,Powerful Force of nostalgia,I must start off by declaring that whilst i have watched all the movies I do not claim to be a Star Wars fan.
2226,8,"Great movie, but lacks the depth that would make it fantastic","I went to see Star Wars VII with my friends and from the beginning to the end I loved every single frame that passed along the screen, I mean, seriously, it's great to see a franchise that you love so much been well threaded with great new characters (no Jar Jar \o/) and a competent director, which had already made Star Trek. The plot is very simple, there's nothing new, everything is recycled from the original trilogy: SPOILERS FROM HERE 1- The empire (now the first order) 2- Tatooine, where the new Jedi is found 3- Lost sons (Leia and Luke, Kaylo Ren and possibly Rey) 4- A Disturbed villain, that once was a good man (Anakin/ Darth Vader, Ben/ Kylo Ren) 5- A great new death star (now it is a whole planet!!) 6- The sacrifice: Obi-Wan's sacrifice against Vader, and now when Kylo kills he's father Solo 7- The discover of the force (Luke and Rey) 8- All characters we love are back :)"
2227,9,I loved it but I understand those who hated it,"This film will be slandered, scrutinized, picked apart, and downright crucified. It will also be praised, respected, honored, and remembered. That's the nature of something so ominous as a series like Star Wars."
2228,7,Predictable? Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Star Wars? Yes.,"The movie is basically the same storyline and plot as a new hope, which I think is a good thing, I like to think that this movie has brought the sense of wonder and magic to the kids of today as I got with it from my own childhood watching Starwars."
2229,9,Can't wait for the Errrm Sequel ?,"Remember the old days when people compare Star Wars original trilogy and prequels and lament on the fact that they cannot make a decent modern day adaptation for the franchise? Well, we cannot say that anymore. The Force Awakens is the ultimate fanboy dream and it fulfills their needs in every possible way. It has it's old, well-adored characters, plus a bunch of new cool ones. The Villainous Kylo Ren is a suitable successor for Darth Vader, considering he will remain behind his iron mask, and lots of action sequences with a brilliantly choreographed lightsaber dual. Daisy Ridley and John Bogoya proved their worth with an enjoyable show, while the veterans graced the screens with their iconic characters."
2230,7,"Goosebumps... Lots of, Lots of Goosebumps...","The Force awakens is by far the best Star wars movie to come out. While many fans may have a preference and I got mine as well. We could all argue to ourselves that there could is no denial that the force awakens gives us more depth of every character in one movie than in a whole trilogy for some. Each character carries a rare maturity that has not been seen in a star wars movie yet. If one looks past in imperfections...(or better said) or comparisons of similarities or differences in the other films we could see that: if this movie was to stand alone and be the only star wars movie to come out and we didn't hang on to nostalgia or comparison, we could easily see the force awakens is absolutely brilliant and most people will say their second viewing is much superior to their first viewing due to the facts expectations are gone."
2231,10,The torch is passed,"I'll begin by stating the obvious: It is far, far better than the prequels. For one, it has the trademark quick pace of the originals, organic dialogue, humour, surprises, intensity, drama, spirituality plus beautiful direction and solid, authentic acting."
2232,7,"A fantastic sequel, even if not bringing many new additions to the saga.",My previous experience with Star Wars has not been very positive. I watched The Phantom Menace when it first came out and thought very little of it. Recently I decided to watch the original movie and did not find it remotely enjoyable. I tried to watch the follow-up but gave up after 20 minutes: I was not enjoying it in the slightest and it just seemed a waste of time persisting with it. 
2233,2,Star Wars: TFA Review,"Let me just say that ""Fans"" who are nitpicking this film for being unoriginal are missing the idea of this film's intention. It was made to please the Star Wars fans, it has everything in it that makes a good Star Wars movie, you have the Space Battles, Lightsaber Fights, Action-Packed Adventure, and Mysterious Mythology that the Original Trilogy had. That being said, I thought the film was really good and very well directed by J.J Abrams. The new trio in this film are very well casted and well acted by John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, and Oscar Issac. The reprisal of the Original Trilogy cast was very thoughtful and they definitely looked like they were having a ball. Kylo Ren is an interesting new villain, Adam Driver does a good job of playing a villain who is trying his very best to be like Darth Vader and I really am wondering where it is going to go for this character in the next two films of this trilogy. The Visual Effects were good, the Sound Effects were good, The Comedy was hilarious, the Score by the Legendary John Williams was Phenomenal and the effort made by the Crew to have as many practical effects as possible was well done. The plot is pretty good, but like the other fans, I do have some questions about where they are going with this, I don't know, maybe we'll see in Episode VIII. I honestly think they are paying a lot of homage to the original trilogy so they can set the foundation and focus on the future films. Overall, I am give this a perfect 10 out of 10 because it gives us almost everything we have been asking for that the Prequels failed to give us, it also gives us something that I can say in one word, Fun. So what are you waiting for, go see it now."
2234,10,A Huge Return to the Star Wars Film Franchise,"I am a huge fan of ST ep 4-6, and my favorite character is Han Solo, which was played by Harrison Ford. When I saw Harrison Ford in the trailer, I knew this is the movie I certainly must see. I was lack of sleep the night before. But while I saw this film, I was awake the whole time. The action, the story line, the characters, ⋯all of them, make me laugh, and cry. A+ for this film! They did a great job! I am so glad that the CGI wasn't the priority of the entire film. They have character development and lots humor. BB8 certainly steal my eyeballs, such a cute figure. This is a film for all the Star Wars fans, and for those who never see any ST films, they will enjoy the viewing experience, too."
2235,10,Han is back!,"Thank you all for this amazing movie! If you're a Star Wars fan you won't be disappointed, seriously. This movie gets you going. It has it all."
2236,10,"JJ ABRAMS, I LOVE YOU! (And the rest of the crew)","I very much enjoyed this movie and I have been a long time fan of star wars from books and the OT. I could live without the Prequels but Revenge of the Sith was alright. Is this movie like A New Hope. Ya in many ways it is. The fact that this movie brings me and many others back to there child hood already makes it one of the best Star Wars movies they have made. A lot of the older crowd hates this movie, this movie is for everyone who is just starting out to like Star Wars and of course original Star Wars fans. Not just Original Fans. If you are all about the OT Star Wars then be all about them and Let the new Generation have there Star Wars. If you like Star Wars go watch this movie. Simple as that. If you think nothing can beat the old ones then don't watch it and stay with the old."
2237,8,A new Movie for a new generation,"OK, so let me just start by saying I didn't grow up on Star Wars like my parents did, actually the first one I saw was revenge of the sith, and I really enjoyed that one. The force awakens was an OK movie, and it was just that, average. I have seen a ton of reviews on here rating it one star and ""worse then the prequels"" and yes, while this can be up for debate, I disagree and want to set the record straight. "
2238,7,"C'mon people, it really wasn't that bad.","People who found this disappointing just because it wasn't flawless and completely original are very narrow minded. It had its flaws, a lot of which it did seem like too much was taken from A New Hope and put it into the movie... but that really is the only flaw. Saw it two days in a row and would watch it again. Easily surpassed the prequels. Fantastic movie. Would rate it a little better than Return of The Jedi but a bit less than A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back (both pretty much flawless)."
2239,9,"People can't be pleased anymore. It wasn't flawless, but it was damn good.","My title sums up this movie. You want to see the Falcon? A cool red light-saber? Han and Chewie? And see a bunch of X-wings destroy the Deat... I mean Starkiller base? Well, you'll get it. <br /><br />Casting is pretty decent, Poe, Finny and even BB8 are kinda okay. Rey, I still don't know what to think of her. A bit too naïve and innocent in my opinion but she's not annoying at least. And Kylo... Kylo is pretty much the risk this movie has taken, by making him look really awesome with his outfit, saber and mask aaaaand surprising you when you see his face. I think it was a good choice in the end.<br /><br />It's a solid and simple star wars movie. A bit of plot and ""star wars science"" holes, like how in such a huge galaxy can they see the shot of starkiller and the explosion of the planets? Unless they're in the same system, not possible. During the fight after Maz Cantina gets blown up... where did everyone go? The cantina was full. Somehow only Han and friends get out of the debris. Rey's awakening is a bit weird but why not. Personally I would have made her force sensitive when she's running after Finn who's going to get eaten by the weird worm creatures on Han's ship. Not even going to ask why did those creatures insta kill all the bad guys but they capture Finn... with all those tentacles, don't ask. <br /><br />Anyways, a good and entertaining star wars movie. Good action, decent actors, good CGI. Just a bit too predictable."
2240,7,"Few risks, fan service and opening some questions",Great movie. Great story. Great action. Superb cast. Loved it.
2241,10,Fabulous,"Simply put story wise it is a reboot and unimaginative. Plot wise, it could make sense for a trilogy. Creativity was not there but new characters are likable and well done. Plot holes ruin it. Remember when you watch this this is a reboot/sequel that lacks creative story."
2242,7,An Honest Review. It is worthy... but lacks and entertains,"I was waiting in veins with big eyes to see this movie. But I must say I didn't even got the feeling, watching this movie immediate at the cinema. Well I did it and my feelings (the force) didn't disappoint me."
2243,4,A Star Wars alike Movie,"There really isn't anything that unpredictable about the film. Story-wise, it goes from A to B in a very simple way. "
2244,,"Great movie, but I'm still not a fan.","This is not going to be a long review, in fact, I will keep it simple:"
2245,9,Awesome to watch,"Like millions, my wife and I dressed up for this film like the ones before. There are spoilers.. but then again you should see it by now.. but if you're reading this review you may want to see it. I'm going to drop some bombs so you're warned."
2246,10,Great Addition to the Saga!,"This is a great movie and well worth your time! My only quibbles (which are quite minor) would be ""another super-weapon"" and some derivative plot points. Perhaps the pacing is a bit fast in a few places."
2247,10,Great movie,"A great movie with a lot of great surprises! Great acting! Great story! Are you people blind??? It is in no way a remake of A New Hope. The whole plot is about the mystery of Luke Skywalker!!! I've seen Star Wars The Force Awakens twice and plan on seeing it three more times!!! The people who are complaining are just looking for something to complain about, look cool and be an attention hoar. Star Wars The Force Awakens was wonderful. If you don't like it. Your not a real Star Wars fan. When Batman The Dark Night Rises came out, people complained that it wasn't like Batman The Dark Night. I didn't see Rey blow up the Starkiller at the end like Luke did the Death Star. Kylo Ren took off his helmet early on in the film and every knew who he was. We didn't know who Darth Vader was until Empire Strikes Back and didn't see Vader's mask off until Return Of The Jedi. Not only that the beginning of Force Awakens is totally different from A New Hope. The ending of Star Wars The Force Awakens is different than A New Hope. The Force Awakens ending was finding Luke Skywalker and the mystery behind him. A New Hope ending was blowing up the Death Star. Should I go on???"
2248,10,Are You People Blind??? It's Not A Reboot. It's A SEQUEL!!!,"I did not have high expectations for this movie going to the theater, but i was pleasantly surprised when the movie came on, it looked amazing, the acting was good and the flashbacks to the original trilogy did not feel forced (no point intended). Even though it missed something to make me feel ""oh my god i'm back in Star Wars"" it still held up as a good standalone movie."
2249,6,Promising start but fails half-way through,First ever review on IMDB after so many years.
2250,9,A review from someone who missed the original six Movies,"Although it's better than The Empire Strikes Back (1980) & The Return of Jedi (1983), it's hard to say I love it. The first 30 minutes of this movie is great and I hoped it didn't make me feel disappointed as the prequels (excluding the original). But no. Everything changed when old characters (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia...) appear. May be you don't believe me but the film would be better if they didn't use old ""friend"". J.J.Abrams did it because he thought that made us love his work. He's wrong. That just helped him got the high grossing. I don't like the story arc much. Han Solo was killed? The romance of Rey & Poe (may be)?... It made me remember the stupid era of Anakin Skywalker! But at least, I could see Luke Skywalker in the last scene and I hope that Episode 8 do it better!!"
2251,6,Nothing special!!,"It astonishes me how so many people cannot connect the dot between this movie and what is happening in the real world. For god sakes, our white house had a P.R. stunt where 2 storm troopers were standing next to the speaker at the podium. But like all Star Wars movies, this movie shows domestic terrorists (Patriots, Constitutionalist, Libertarians, Militias, etc.) fighting against political tyranny that demands control. What bothers me is why all these movies are now incorporating female heroic super soldier characters into these wildly popular scifi/action movies, at the same time our government (military) allows females to enlist into infantry... are we all the sudden short on man- power? Are getting ready to start WWIII? This has nothing to do with feminism... it could just be a coincidence I guess... more power to you girls."
2252,9,Reminds me of government,"The direction the writers took the plot of this film is... well, safe. It will draw upon the nostalgia of the countless people who have seen the old star wars trilogy and considered them good films, but do not necessarily count themselves as big fans. This movie will continue to sell tickets, and we will continue to hear many moviegoers sing its praises."
2253,7,"A New Hope, but Not A New Movie",You should only watch this if you don't care or want to see the 'old gang' back together and as you would imagine them to be 30 years on.
2254,1,depressing,"This movie is getting so much crap (1/10 ratings?), why? For those that say that this is lacking in creativity, I'm baffled. This movie sets up so much that IS new ...but I guess I can see how a person might get hung up on the similarities with the OT. All I can say is that this movie left me thinking ""THIS is Star Wars!"" There are corners of the movie that I know I'll be going back to. Like the OT, there are characters that are briefly touched on that I can speculate endlessly until episode VIII comes out. This movie had way too much at stake not to have SOME fans disappointed ...we all loosely envisioned our own ideas about the future of these characters and so much time has passed to think about what this movie could have been. I loved the characters and I actually loved the history repeats itself nature of the film. If you accept this part, you will be THRILLED with what you experience. I gotta give this movie love, it woke up the real feel of Star Wars in me. THis Star Wars feeling has been missing since Jedi and I'm sooo on board with where we're all going. :)"
2255,10,Do not be ashamed to enjoy experiencing this as history repeats itself,"The new heroes are easy to fall in love with and the villains easy to hate, fear, and even pity."
2256,10,A New Legend is Born,"Being a big Star Wars fan, and even as someone who actually doesn't hate the prequels, I really enjoyed The Force Awakens."
2257,9,"Perfectly enjoyable, like the others you're not supposed to over think these films!",****This Review is SPOILER FREE****
2258,9,Star Wars: Attack of the Clone Reviewers,"This is probably my new favorite Star Wars movie, it used to be Return of the Jedi. Why? Well, I'm not sure. Probably because after the prequels anything is better than those. I couldn't even stay awake for the Phantom Menace and didn't bother to go to the theater for the other two. "
2259,7,"It's good, just not amazing like everyone hoped","This movie is of a different breed. It plays with the duality of characters, and keeps you guessing what kind of direction characters will develop in. I like that the movie has plenty of nostalgic reference to the first Star Wars movies, while bringing a ton of new content to the table. I find the parallels between the Nazi Regime and the First Order to add a lot of complexity and realism to the storyline."
2260,9,Precedent-Setting Masterpeice,"As I just returned from the premiere in my country, I'm filled with mixed emotions. Being a long-time Star Wars nerd, this movie has both entertained me well and also left we stunned."
2261,7,The Farce Awakens?,"This movie was excellent, If i were to choose one word that described this entire film for me, is that is was a delight. "
2262,10,The Force has Awakened! Delightful Film!,"Not that a tick in every box is a bad thing. But sometimes the fastidiousness of the ticking reduces our enjoyment. George Lucas opened the minds of the 70's to adventure laden science fiction - bundled romance, villainy, hope and an all-encompassing 'force' that just stuck with audiences. So much so that when he made his average prequels, a movie commentator observed that the movie does not even need to be watched for it to turn a profit; such was its success as a franchise. But we digress - post his landfall profit from his sale of this lucrative franchise to Disney, George moved away from the creative cockpit. The world has waited with bated breath over the past three years to see what J.J.Abrams can bring to the cantina table and the verdict is - he does not disappoint..too much."
2263,7,Star Wars : The Force Awakens - a tick in every box,"It's like someone made a computer program, then inputted all the data from the original 3 movies (which btw were very good) and it spat out this ""movie"" !"
2264,1,Written by a computer algorithm ?,"It's a great movie. J.J Abrams gets the essence of the first three Star Wars movies and recreates the universe that fans missed so much in Episodes I,II and III. The film combines the action, the drama and the storyline without falling in childish plots or boring topics. The locations are splendid, the characters are solid and for two hours and fifteen minutes you can do nothing but being stuck to the screen feeling things you felt thirty eight years ago when you saw Episode IV for the very first time. J.J. Abrams picked the story where George Lucas left it thirty years ago and has made a brilliant film. In my opinion, it's the best movie and the best shot of this brilliant director."
2265,10,Great movie,"When the credits rolled, my immediate reaction was hell yes! That was a fun mesmerizing, immersion into the most beloved franchise in history. After 12 hours of letting this sink into my nerd IT brain I am ready to throw in my $.02. I have some thoughts on the negative fan reviews that are currently sweeping the galaxy..."
2266,10,TFA is Marvelous in both Fan Service and Plot,"For me, I believe anyone who enjoyed the original trilogy can't really fault the storyline, yes it is roughly the same as ""a new hope"" with the best parts from V and VI loosely thrown in, but that's what I found so comforting about the whole movie. I'm not sure what others was really expecting or how to better the entire movie. "
2267,10,Starwars reborn :),"I was 11 when Star Wars came out in 1977, and I fell in love with that movie. To me, it was one of the most entertaining pieces of movie making ever made, and it still is. But this was better. Hard to admit, but this really was better. Why? It's hard to write a truly complete review without spoilers, but there are none below. Here are the reasons this is a truly great movie."
2268,,Objectively the best movie in the franchise,"An exceptional film, that has similarities to Star Wars(77) this has real heart and unexpected humour to it, that I found surprising and utterly welcome. The droid BB8 although a real thing, has CGI added to it that is amazing, Daisy Ridley is utterly outstanding in her role and Harrison Ford is..... Well Han Solo, Chewbacca is actually a character I really liked in this, they've given him a bit more expression... Anyway, go and see this NOW you wont be disappointed."
2269,9,Really impressive film,"You may have heard about the unoriginal plot, the plot-holes, the tepid script... its true, all of it. The force is not that strong in this one. But hey, i'm among those who were blown away at the age of 12 by episode IV, so I may be jaded and biased. I was super excited ever since TFA was announced in 2013, and then anxiously waited for weeks after its release, devouring the worst IMDb reviews just to keep my expectations in check."
2270,6,A solid OK,There should be no spoilers. nothing here should ruin anything 
2271,9,"The Force Awakens, the movie Star Wars needed","I have been a life time Star Wars fan, I love Star Wars not because of the special effects or story, but the depth of philosophy involved."
2272,7,Good but not quite Star Wars,"-------------------------USELESS RANTING TO ""STAR WARS FANS""--------------------------- Before I start my opinion I would like to address the rest of the users that have decided to rate the movie less than 5 stars; If you're rating this under 5 stars you're either a Star Trek groupie or a very cynical bitter person. There were some issues in the movie I will admit however nothing can be perfect."
2273,9,Engaging plot with extreme nostalgia,"Hard not to spoil, but actually no need. You will see all by yourselves. I have seen a good picture in perfect Imax 3d cinema, with Great decorations, low acting and even lower plot. It could be OK for any third-rate movie with high budget as Antman or Batman vs Superman, because I don't really care about that films At All! But I care about franchise I was growing on! Dreaming of the force and lightsaber to guide me through life to fulfill my destiny. How can I take This movie as a part of Star Wars Universe??? Why so Serious??? Because!!! It's Star Wars!!! They should be amazing, incredible, recognizable!!! And Wtf was that??? Not an Awakening - that is for Sure! They're on the Highway to Hell... and They're going dooown((( No motivation of the personages are available. The main idea of the Quest doesn't make any sense - it's just ridiculous! The main Twist is soooo baaaad and had no need in it. The new sides of the Force are simply Wtf? Just add Teenege Mutant Niinja Turtles and OK with That... And the last one, how many times do we need to see the Death Star build again??? I know, it's hard to come up with something much more powerful, than Vacuum Cleaner of the planet's atmosphere from Space Balls, but Jar Jar, Please do!!! I have more reasons not to watch the next episode, but will surely attend the cinema, when released. But, I must say ""You (J J) have ruined, What He (Lucas)'ve started""."
2274,7,"It feels like an ordinary movie with good decorations, but low sense in it","This movie is another example of modern cinema: no real story telling, no character development, mediocre acting at best, senseless lines, stealing ideas all the time and of course targeted at the widest possible audience. Instead a lot of action and XF, as we have been getting used to. Guys like Abrams are simply unable of making real good movies, period! I don't demand Hitchcock level of story telling and development of tension, but these modern director don't even meet the basics of movie making, they are just effect driven copycats."
2275,1,"Abrams did it again, killed Star Wars after Star Trek","J.J. Abrams has crafted a fantastic new episode of Star Wars in the classic style of the original trilogy, restoring competence, humor, convincing dialogue and acting, thrills, spills and chills. He has created new, likable characters that the audience can actually get behind, instead of be annoyed, disconnected and detached from, as in the widely-derided prequel trilogy. "
2276,10,A Masterful Return To Form,"There are bound to be haters, but IMHO they are mostly misguided. Star Wars is not a sci-fi series, like Trek. It's not a fantasy series, like LOTR. It's a soap opera, the story of the family of Anakin Skywalker (as was almost spelled out in episode IV). And in this respect episode VII succeeds. The family drama unfolds magnificently; Daughter has stayed the course despite losing everything to the Force. Son has killed the Father, failed in his path like him and became a recluse. A grandson rebels against his father and finds inspiration in his lost grandfather. A forgotten, yet faithful, granddaughter steps reluctantly in. And the Universe revolves around them all. Yes there are flaws, but there's also very tight story-telling, decent cinematography, good acting. It's a film that had me suspended and wondering how it all fit in those two+ hours. Brilliant film making and editing, it would have taken 30 hours of film to depict all these events unfold in a typical LOTR and a mini-series for Trek. Finally, after 30 years....Star Wars."
2277,10,The soap opera continues,"I'll be honest, part of the reason I'm writing this review is out of spite, purely because I'm so sick of the disproportionate amount of hate that the sequels have been getting. As a start to the trilogy, this is a well-shot, fun, and entertaining movie with charismatic and entertaining characters, as well as plenty of suspense. Sure, it's an homage to A New Hope, but it's tonally different. I'm just confused with why die-hard fans continue to tear this film apart, while calling the absolute train wreck that is The Phantom Menace a masterpiece. Sure, I love all Star Wars, but I can't, with good conscience, call Episode I a fun and exciting kick off to the prequel trilogy. That's what The Force Awakens does well-it keeps Star Wars fun and fresh, something that fans of all ages can enjoy, while successfully introducing a new era with new characters and a new story. Because Star Wars is supposed to be fun-and this movie brought it back."
2278,9,Fun,"... would be if we at least see some skin. If you are going to insert women instead of men then fine. Make the women attractive and desirable. Make them thin. No Tattoos of course. Long hair down their backs. Short skirt and heels. Now I am interested and can forgive you. Otherwise, why bother? The original is better and it is always better otherwise.<br /><br />This Episode 7 is just a remake with no redeeming quality."
2279,,The Only Time I Would Support A Gender Switch Film..,"I think the premise of the film was excellent and the building of the new characters gave an exciting thrill. However I think it was a terrible ending to a really good film; introducing Mark Hamill for the last minute or so was annoying because we didn't see anything else. Furthermore the fact that his name was second in the credits is nonsense. Also it was a shame that they killed off Han Solo, but instead of Chewbacca saving Rey and Finn they should have made Luke save the day. However, J.J.Abrams did a really good try at bringing back the loved franchise and I solemnly hope the sequel will focus on Mark as Luke Skywalker, Rey and more so Finn because I really want to see him become a jedi and help rebuild it."
2280,8,Good start to a new beginning,"The movie in istself is fantastic but when you follow up on the original characters like Luke, Leia and Han you have to do it honourable. This is where JJ totally blew it. Leia's character gave a week impression and killing of Han without Luke and Leia's pressence was thin, very thin! And when it comes to Luke Skywalker WTF! His entrence in the movie should have been when the lightsaber was shaking in the snow. The lightsaber should have gone into luke's hand, what an entrence it would have been. Instead we only got to see him for a few seconds in the end, WTF! Besides that I loved the new characters even though Kathleen Kennedy's political correctness had a very uncomfartable pressence in the movie. This movie would have made it to 10 in MY rating if it weren't for the listed failures and for the fact that this movie is a remake of A new hope. Disney plays it safe where they should been taking risks. And they take risks where they should play it safe."
2281,6,"Exellent movie, stunning effects,but dishonours star wars!","I went into this film with a bit of worry. I had heard that it was too similar to A New Hope and when people put the story together in the way that they did, it did seem similar. After seeing it, however, I wondered why I was ever worried in the first place. The Force Awakens is an incredible film with a spectacular cast of characters, incredible writing, amazing performances, great humor, and a compelling story."
2282,9,Star Wars is Back to its Former Glory!,"Although this movie is enjoyable, I found the story to be a lesser copy of one previous film in this franchise."
2283,6,"Good, but far from great (one little detail in this review is potentially a spoiler)",WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS Positives - Amazing use of practical effects - Hits home seeing original characters - John Williams - Impressive visuals especially fight scenes e.g. Ren vs Rey/Finn - Stormtroopers can actually shoot things this time - R.I.P. Han Solo - BB8 was amazing visually and as a character
2284,8,"SPOILERS Worth the wait, very nostalgic and great fun","At last a Star Wars movie with characters to care about again. All of them: Ren, Finn, Poe and most of all Rey is real fleshed out chars with a heart and soul that reacts and acts like someone you can relate to. Sure some of the plot points are straight from ANH and the story is so so."
2285,6,"Flawed, Derivative but pretty Good!","This movie wasn't just a huge disappointment, it was boring. Why? Because I've seen it before. It was a duplicate of Star Wars Episode IV (1977). Force-blessed child is found on a desert planet where he (she) meets a droid recently runaway from Darth Vader, they are helped off that planet by Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon, they get entangled in yet another Death Star where the shields must be lowered and a target must be destroyed to destroy the construct ... even the canyon scene with X-wing fighters was rehashed. Was there an Obi-Wan? Yup, the incomparable Max Von Sydow plays the role of the old geezer who provides the path to learning about the force but is killed in the process. Scenes from Episodes V and VI were also rehashed, like setting bombs to blow up a facility and a father/son team meeting on a bridge with a single light saber. The death of Han Solo was SO PREDICTABLE that the entire scene dragged on and on into utter boredom. I almost started laughing when Luke (Yoda) is finally found on a water (swamp) planet where Rey (Luke) will learn to be a Jedi ... that's Episode VIII, which promises to be a complete rehash of Episode V. I won't waste my money on it. Regrettably, I was fooled into forgetting my first rule of movie marketing: if the movie is bad, it will often be over-marketed before its release to try and make the investment back before anyone realizes how bad it is. Disney marketed the snot out of this movie. I should have seen this lemon coming, but I hoped. Oh, how I hoped. So, just to be clear, why do I want my money back for Episode VII? Because I already paid to see this movie ... in 1977. It even had the same cast!"
2286,2,I Want My Money Back,"Star Wars fans are a strange bunch as they never seem to be satisfied: Give them something original and new like in the prequel trilogy and they will certainly proclaim that this is not ""their"" original Star Wars. Give them something that is a lovely homage to the original trilogy -like this film- and they will certainly argue that it is not ""new"" enough. "
2287,8,8/10,What did people expect? I can't believe all the bad reviews. This film has everything it needs to be entertaining and that's what movies are all about.
2288,9,What's with all the bad reviews. Great Movie!!!,"The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film I watched in the cinema. I'm too young for the original trilogy and the Trilogy-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named happened at a time when Hollywood movies were freely available on the internet long before they arrived in German cinemas. I watched the original trilogy on VHS at a friend's house and it made a lasting impression on me. I watched The Force Awakens in 3D and dubbed into German so I won't judge some the wonky dialogue too harshly before having seen the English original. I'm not a big fan of 3D and I thought it made some of scenes on the 21,4m x 8,8m screen, the biggest in my soulless multiplex, look rather toy-like. I managed to avoid all the trailers and all spoilers and going into the film knowing nothing about it was a great experience. Overall I enjoyed the film, it had decent action scenes, interesting new characters, great returning characters and moments of chuckling, tension and sadness. Unfortunately I couldn't shake the feeling of déjà vu. I think J. J. Abrams played it too save. Did he really have to blow up the Death Star a third time? I have to admit that I didn't manage to sustain my suspension of disbelief. I don't want to nitpick, but when you start wondering that a vehicle which utilizes anti gravity relies on a combustion engine you know that you are not fully immersed. I felt that there was some back story missing, how could the First Order rise so quickly and build another Death Star? The Stormtroopers are still very bad shots, the overwhelming odds were too overwhelming, a lot of solutions too convenient and travel from one place to another was often miraculously fast. I liked the new characters, especially Rey, but Han Solo was far and away my favourite character in this film. (Harrison Ford made good for the Indiana-Jones-Movie-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named.) I'm not sure about Adam Driver, without his mask he didn't feel like a very threatening villain. He is still Adam from Girls for me. My favourite scene was the Apocalypse Now reference with TIE fighters and the laugh out loud funny moment was when Chewie complained about being cold. Overall I think it's a good film, but it's also a save film. As with Star Trek Into Darkness J. J. Abrams rehashed old ideas but this time without making up a totally nonsensical and bonkers storyline. I'm wondering if this film will bring forth iconic moments that will be remembered in years to come, like the original trilogy did."
2289,8,"History Repeating, nevertheless enjoyable","For all the people giving this film 1 out of 10, I say shame. Saw the film tonight and it was very, very good. Maybe not above IV, V, or VI, but very close. Seems that most of these individuals point to similarity in scripts of IV and VII, and there are some that I would have liked changed. (Similar dialogue at critical points, and the super weapon) Beyond that though, this script was original, and it had more twists and turns than any previous episode in the series. I loved the film and can't wait to see what is to come. I feel attached to the new characters and how their journey will continue to unfold. I gave the movie 10/10 rather than the 9/10 I would have simply due to the unfounded reviews by other fans who wished that the story had perhaps mirrored all the hundreds of Star Wars books they have read over the years. Many individuals have been anticipating and dreaming of the day when they could continue the story of Luke, Leia, and Han, and to many of these individuals nothing this movie did would have done justice to the series. Look yourselves in the mirror, minority of Star Wars fans. This movie may not have gone the way you would have wished, but purposely grading it below any reasonable standard simply because of your differences is just plain immature and petty. Get over it or stop watching. Get over your own preconceived ideas of what the movie should have been and grade the film fairly. I cannot personally see any true Star Wars fan giving this film less than a 7/10 regardless of their unhappiness with certain plot details. To anyone having second thoughts about the movie due to the handful of horrible reviews in contrast to the vast majority of highly positive ones, don't second guess yourself. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. This is a truly great film in the Star Wars franchise."
2290,9,Forget the reviews giving 1 out of 10 stars!,"No specifics on spoilers here, just the bad and the good that I see. Bad: For two new bad guys, they could have picked someone without a beak-nose for the son of... and doesn't look anything like what their kid should, and how about a deeper voice for the base commander if he is to shout and not sound like an angry kid. A new bad guy gets beat up by a girl with no training? what the...!? (maybe if they had -him- showing some form on influence on the fight) A bit part with no explanation for big time actor Von's role. A barter townish place, ultra limited exposure for it. Why is there always a fat man-thing behind the counter of these places? The new tall speaking thing reminds me of a cross between Prometheus and Kingdom of the crystal skulls... no imagination. Not enough bar scene. Not a single word spoken by ... Uniforms lacking newness, same old with a few new bits. With no new remarkable star ships in the flick, they only went bigger with what we all expected. What could they think of next that's past a planetary scale ship? How about bringing in some old Dune stuff and have folding space travel?"
2291,7,The Evil Empire Strikes Out,"I watched this movie last week and I come on to IMDb and see the film has a rating of 8.5 out of 10 despite the fact every single page is just full of hatred and 1 out of 10's. I don't understand why everyone is giving the film such a low score, I thought it was great. Not as good as the original 3 films but better than the 3 prequel films (even though the prequel films were not that bad in my opinion)."
2292,9,A good Star Wars Film,"Wow. My 6 is actually looking really generous. That's really only because I'm too nice a person to give movies 4's or below. I save those for movies that I think are truly unwatchable. Unlike the majority of these reviews which rarely breach 5 stars (which raises the incredibly suspicious question of how in the world this movie currently has an 8.8. I smell something fishy.) Anyway, my overall impression of this movie is that it's really...really, fanfic-y. My brother (who was one of the seemingly rare souls who actually liked this movie) yelled at me all the car ride home from the theater (about half and hour), for this opinion, but this movie was just really fanfic-y."
2293,6,Ugh...Hard to Believe that my 6 is being Generous,The Force didn't so much as Awaken as not really get out of bed. Maybe it's having a slow start. 
2294,8,Did I expect too much ? Is retro OK for a modern new Star Wars.,"I liked the movie, and I'll probably see it again. However, I left wanting to see more. "
2295,7,Like eating a meal at a fancy restaurant: good but I wanted more,"So I've been doing my damnedest to avoid The Force Awakens but was sufficiently bored today to get sucked into its gravitational field along with just about the entirety of the rest of the western hemisphere, it seems."
2296,1,a safe re-run of past well-performing brand names given a fresh lick of paint by talentless hacks in the service of corporate greed,OK I re-created my profile to address the haters. I loved this movie and was disheartened to come home to so many bad reviews.
2297,10,Addressing the Haters: UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED,It seems that people who state they disliked it believe that their opinion is more valid than the opinion of those who loved this movie.
2298,10,I Really Enjoyed It,"I'm a young adult- so not someone who was around to see the original trilogy in theaters, but still an avid fan who grew up on Star Wars. Not just the original trilogy- I grew up on the whole story, and as a result love the prequels just as much as IV-VI, and really have never been let down by Star Wars. Episode VII was no exception. The Force Awakens exceeded my expectations in that I thought Abrams would ramp up the action and effects so much to 2015 standards that it would lose the nostalgic feel of the other movies, as far as music, action, cinematography, and portrayal of outer space. Instead, TFA stayed true to the feel, while still effectively introducing fresh actors and new technology. The new perspective on stormtroopers threw me off at first, seeing them as people with feelings and not just organic robots, but it worked well. Things I didn't like: the death planet. I really liked the frequent references to the original trilogy and most of the plot parallels, but Death Planet was too much homage and was a bit silly. Also, the movie didn't have any particularly memorable scenes- it was constantly moving, perpetual little fight scenes, and felt more like an action movie than an epic saga. That was one thing that I loved about the prequels: each one had at least two or three epic scenes that immortalized the movies (at least for me), and TFA just didn't have that. However, that was all I didn't like. Keeping the old actors in their original characters was AWESOME- that just isn't something you see in movies. And I can't describe the feeling I got at the end, which I think a lot of other people also experienced, judging by the audience's applause after the film. A solid 9/10, and I look forward to the next installment."
2299,9,Honest Review.,NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.
2300,8,"JJ Abrams wakes Star Wars back up, like it should be","I'm keeping this short, but here goes...."
2301,6,Original Diehard Fan with Mixed Feelings,"The most recent installment of Star Wars is nothing less than a visually stunning, well-cast, well-written masterpiece. This is the kind of movie to get you excited about the remaining two films, a great way to start a new trilogy. Star Wars fans will love and enjoy the mix of practical effects with CGI. there weren't any moments where I felt that the CGI that was present was unnecessary. It will make you laugh hysterically, cry like a baby, and after it all, sit back in your seat in wonder if you really witnessed such a masterpiece. I always appreciated the quick-witted lines in the original trilogy and was presently surprised that The Force Awakens also follows a similar style of humor. I think this movie also has the potential to create a new generation of Star Wars fans. I look forward to showing this to my kids, years from now, along with the other films. (Yes, even the prequels for continuity's sake.) I think viewers will also love the diverse cast. I disregard any notion that the parallels to Ep. IV-VI discredit this film in any way. It rather strengthens the attachment and emotions one experiences while watching this movie. And I know many people have been saying this, but it really does have an excellent final shot. It's something to get fans excited about what's to come. Despite having the same first initials as one of the most annoying aliens in the galaxy, Abrams nailed this film right up top next to the original trilogy."
2302,9,Best Star Wars Film Yet,"There is no going back. You will not experience the same awe, fright and excitement you did when you were a kid watching A New Hope. Neither will your kids. Our world is too high-tech now and full of CGI to appreciate the rush of watching an X-Wing fighter flying through space or on an attack run. Now, with that said, the effects are cool and not overdone. The re-imagined storm-trooper headgear is pretty cool as is the new color schemes on the X- Wing fighters. JJ Abrams did arrive an appropriate balance, pulling way back from the video-game atmosphere of Episodes 1-3. But unfortunately, as many others have rightly recognized, this is not a reboot so much as a remake of Episode 4. It is the EXACT same plot. Yes, there is the twist of a renegade storm-trooper helping out our heroine, but so what. Nothing too material or interesting, frankly. It is the EXACT same plot (worth saying twice). The actors, to be sure, are good, at least the new ones. And this despite corny lines that really sound like Lucas wrote them. But our old buddies just don't belong--even Han. Well, Chewbacca was fine (how could you screw him up anyway). Ford is way past his acting prime and his performance seemed forced, unnatural. Carrie Fisher's life was a train wreck and it shows in her face and odd diction trying to hide ill fitting dentures. Yes, that could be mean, but you will hear it and it is distracting; probably why she was not given more lines. Hamill looks like a homeless guy and said not one word. So I guess we'll really see on him. But without a doubt the characters of Solo and Leia were ill served by the original actors. The hand-off wasn't necessary. I will say killing of Solo also was unnecessary, at least on screen."
2303,7,Over-hyped but not bad,"The graphics was amazing. Everything looked like real. If I would rate this film by only the graphics I would give it a 10/10. And I must admit that even if I hate 3d, the 3d in this film was very well."
2304,8,Graphics were awesome but the story was not.,"I'm a big Star Wars fan, The Force Awakens is good but not great, and I'm amazed at the really high rating here. There are positives; special effects great, and acting pretty good. But alas the story was very predictable, and it would be better to have not seen any of the previous Star Wars movies before seeing this one."
2305,7,Good but flawed,"It was an unfortunate movie on many accounts; starting with excessive nostalgia-pandering. The only necessary elements from Lucas' framework that needed transferring were The Force (in it's ambiguous, mystical form), light sabers, Light vs Dark. I didn't need a droid beeping or X-Wings or ""I have a bad feeling about this""-lines or a Milennium Falcon or Stormtroopers or....you know? I wanted a fresh story, new characters that ended up being involved in grand galactic struggle alongside our old heroes, instead they bluntly introduce terribly unsympathetic characters Rey/Finn/Poe and go ""Here, your new heroes."". It doesn't work like that. I read the writers were struggling to incorporate Luke because the movie would be about him & people wouldn't notice new characters enough so they kept him out...CAPITAL MISTAKE. Yes, this movie should be Luke from the start as full Grandmaster on his academy, then you can bring in an impoverished girl that got attention by doing some Force-related stuff. Maybe over the course of a good 3 hr movie I start caring for her. Now our ""heroin"" has no start, no development, no depth...she just is. The actress is rather bad, over-the-top facial expressions, & a non-eloquent British ghetto accent. The movie is inundated in British accents by the way, it seems to be a Galaxy Far Far Away in Brompton. For reasons, she meets FN-2187 (Leias cell block...sigh Disney), who's best described as Ron Weasly black sitcom edition. He's the sidekick to the Princess in an animated feature. His arc makes no sense: Stormtrooper who gets anxiety attack (isn't this what military training uncovers?), then defects, sees Rey, and for rest of movie runs along like sexually excited moron spewing lies and jeopardizing lives. Poe is pointless as well, just a random ace pilot because the OT had 3 people as well I guess. The villains usually have it easier as they only need to be foreboding, ruthless & cool. Kylo Ren pulls it off and I found myself rooting for him rather quick. Later on Kylo becomes weak for plot reasons but I can't escape the feeling he's the hero and Rey the villain. That's how much Disney messed it up."
2306,3,Depends heavily on ep.8 & 9/ Does not stand on its own,"If there is anything the Force Awakens did right for me was that it truly gave me the Nostalgia factor. I was a kid again if only for a brief 2 hours left wanting more! Let's start with the story.'Contains Spoilers'... Many have said this is just a copy of a New Hope.. In a way it is. But i Understand why it was done.. This movie is mainly for a new generation of fans, It's a sort of reboot if you will. Disney and J.J mainly made this film to target a new audience to the Star Wars Universe and what better way to do that than to give them the same ride we older fans received from Lucas. The story follows a very similar path. Focuses on 3 new leads and brings their stories together to fight against the First Order and destroy Star Killer Base. The film ends on an excellent Cliff Hanger and leaves you wanting more. Some complain about too many plot holes. This was done on purpose and there is already a few books out that explain a lot of back story of the characters. I love to read so this is no issue to me but i can understand how some have a problem with it and i am sure plenty will be answered in Episode 8. The Dialogue and character relationships in the film are spot on Star Wars. The Humor is excellent and they did a great job with throwing in a lot of nostalgia factors to give a nod to the original trilogy. It really did feel like watching an original Trilogy film and that's what i loved most about it."
2307,8,The Feeling is back. For 2 hours I was a kid again =),"All of the people saying this is a rehash of a new hope clearly aren't paying attention to the movie. Though there were similar aspects, out didn't detract from the movie experience at all. First of all let's talk about kylo ren. Such a great villain. When you compare kylo ren from episode 7 to Darth Vader from episode 4, kylo ren is a much better character. More fleshed out and a much more conflicted character. This makes you care about the villain in a way that you didn't care about Darth Vader. I loved the sparity between general hux's cold calculating personality to kylo ren. All of the new actors did a fantastic job in the movie, with Oscar Isaac giving a standout performance. Han solo is also excellent in this movie, and his conversations with chewie are some of the best parts of this movie."
2308,9,Had flaws? Yes! Fun? Hell yea!,"It really felt like star wars, not just a random sequel. The special effects, the characters, overall it was nostalgic. Sure it has its flaws, (similar plot to last movies, slightly rushed, etc) but the pros out way the cons. I got a good idea of what was going on, understood the characters, and enjoyed the movie as a whole. And honestly, you could poke fun at the original trilogy just as much as this one. JJ Abrams clearly know what he is doing, and I hope he makes this a trilogy. My main problem is how kylo ren was revealed, and I wish there was more of a buildup, but, if you like to enjoy a movie for its cinematography, special effects, and writing, then I would recommend this movie to you."
2309,8,A nice addition to the series,"Saw it, won't spoil it."
2310,9,Spoiler free,Let me break it down for you really simple with a pros and cons list:
2311,6,"A Fair Review: Tired of Hearing Idiots Say it's a ""Bad Movie""",*********************** SPOILER ALERT ***********************
2312,9,J.J. Abrams is the modern day Midas.,I watched this in the cinema on release thought it was decent but just a bit slow
2313,7,it wasn't the best but still decent,"As we all know, pressure makes diamonds. J.J. Abrams had more pressure on him than I can imagine. I can only say that while watching it, I had a smile on my face. The movie is practically perfect. Despite any doubts I had about J.J. Abrams ability to create a story to live up to the legacy of the previous George Lucas ones, he did it superbly."
2314,10,Loved it!,"There seems to be a lot of negative, low rated reviews which are unfair and unjustified in my opinion. People focus only on the plot similarities of this films predecessors. They expect too much from a franchise which is desperately wanted. If you don't enjoy or appreciate the efforts to bring it back, it's very simple; don't go to see the next one! I know i will be going! We know history can repeat itself and the same logic applies to this story. Yes there's a lot of episode IV in here, but its ironic to love that plot, yet hate this one. The inspiration of The Empire is exactly what determined this. They could have brought some new ideas, but i think they're saving them for the next one. This was a good film. The quality of filming, special effects, music, editing and character development: all excellent. The casting was pretty good although Driver(Kylo Ren) just doesn't have that villainous feel to him and looks young for the role despite being 32. May sound harsh but he's too pale and skinny for me, he also needs a haircut. Too late to change now i suppose, maybe some Sith eyes would up his scare-factor. Abrams did disappoint me with the predictable death of Solo, and his inclusion of Leia was weak. Some parts did feel rushed and i thought they could've maybe dragged it out. Its more about the story for me and not all the action. They'll find it hard to make a good Star Wars film without Solo as his character just brings so much to the film, but i have faith in this team. People seem to have trouble with Ren being beaten by Rey so easily. Maybe you didn't notice his abdominal injury sustained by Chewies' crossbow blaster... however i do agree he was pretty weak and unconvincing. Struggling against a Stormtrooper in a lightsaber battle, It was not mentioned whether he's a Sith lord or not, but surely has training to that of at least a Jedi knight from Luke. Cannot vouch for Snoke as i have no idea of his understanding or teaching of the dark side. I have a suspicion about who he is though, won't say just in case i am correct. I am a big fan of Star Wars, even Episodes I, II and III. I read character bios and invest time and interest into understand the thoughts of Lucas and what he was trying to achieve, i'd like to think i know what i'm talking about when it comes to Star Wars. Hopefully they can make Ren more of a threat and beef up the plot to make the next one satisfying for all. They don't have to cram it all into one film, they should take their time and deliver what i suspect will be Reys training by Luke, Rens training by Snoke and the revival of the battle for balance of the force which the whole story has ultimately been about. By all means, demand more from Disney and Abrams, they can only get better with criticism, but remember credit where credit is due. Have faith, fear is a path to the dark side."
2315,7,Room For Improvement,*** This review may contain spoilers ***
2316,2,The force awakens ( but is still sleeping),NO SPOILERS
2317,10,There were stars and a war.,"I consider myself a Star Wars fan. I already saw The Force Awakens twice and it was only out for just two days. I did not want anyone to spoil this movie for me, so I watched it early on opening day. I wanted to be in the moment the way the director intended it. I will probably watch it a couple of more times in theatres before waiting for the Blu-Ray release. Word of advice, just go for the 2-D version. I've seen it both in 3-D and 2-D. My favourite theatre had it only in 3-D and I wanted to see it in it's massive auditorium with a huge screen. It is the Ziegfeld Theatre in Manhattan. One of the last single screen theatres in New York. I don't like 3-D because the picture is darker and not as sharp. My preference would be an actual film projector and not digital, but that's next to impossible in this age of convenience. The Hateful Eight is something I will watch in glorious 70MM film."
2318,9,An exquisite new episode in the Star Wars Saga,"Respect for J J Abrams. All the people who criticize this film were expecting something that they couldn't get. Nobody can remake the feels you felt during the original trilogy just because you watched it as little kids and this whole world was new to you. J J Abrams has done his best to bring the old feeling back, and was successful with it. you can't expect it to be perfect of course, because no movie is perfect and even the original trilogy has its' flaws. you can't expect to have the feeling you felt while you watched the first trilogy, just because it's impossible. I LOVED this movie. The force awakens makes you laugh, cry, and excited throughout the whole film. The new characters have depth to them and you get to connect to them and learn to love them. I just don't get it why people compare between movies. I don't compare it to the original trilogy and not to the prequels either. You should just say thank you and enjoy the movie. this movie is amazing on its own."
2319,9,enjoyed every moment.,(My original review for this film was written December 18th 2015)
2320,9,Now THIS is Star Wars!,WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS
2321,6,Review: Star Wars – The Force Awakens (2015),"So where does the film succeed? It's characters are phenomenal. All excellently written, very funny but with heart. Both Fin and Rey will not be forgotten. All of the action sequences are very well done and the cinematography is exceptional. The lightsaber fights at the end are the best since like and Vader in Jedi as it does not look choreographed but also is presentable. the ending shot was as perfect as an ending could be, with Luke standing there, not saying a word, just looking at Rey. There was minimal exposition and the movie dove into its own mystery making it an excellent first movie. Where does it fail? The movie is a little self indulgent in making Rey out to be this savior. The reason like was so great was because he wasn't made out to be this amazing guy, he became it slowly throughout the second movie, unfortunately in this movie Rey beats the main villain with ease after she says the word ""force"" whereas even after all his training in empire, Luke gets torn apart by Vader. She is constantly built up as this great savior when she should not be presented this way. The other problem is the dialogue at times is bad. This is a problem with all of them and it's no exception here. Overall it was good however and Hans death was executed very well. The third best of the series."
2322,9,Excellent Star Wars Movie and a very solid film- SPOILERS AHEAD,"Star Wars is one of the most established movie series of all time. Despite these films being a tad overrated, I find myself enjoying these films myself. Star Wars: The Force Awakens, was no different. One thing that is overlooked in Star Wars I feel is just how cheesy they can be. That something that I think tons of people glance over when they're watching a Star Wars movie, and the same goes for this one. There was a good handful of cheesy scenes and dialogue that was hard to sit through. While it didn't ruin the movie, it was still quite hard to watch. The action scenes in this film, however, were nice and fluid and well orchestrated, much like the original films. The new characters were fun and interesting and probably the most exciting part of the whole film. Overall, I don't have much to say about The Force Awakens. Yes, it was good, and yes, it was infinitely better than any prequel film. It did have it's pitfalls with some of the dialogue and even some boring scenes, and it for sure felt like a revitalization of the series by bringing back certain key plot elements from the some of the first films. Overall, though, I had fun. That's all that really matters when it comes to Star Wars anyway."
2323,7,Fun film despite some flaws,"I read a lot of reviews here and now I've seen this movie, too. I wonder what people, who complain about this movie, did expect. Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? Schindler's List? "
2324,9,A great movie for the whole family!,"J.J. Abrams reignites and revitalizes a galaxy far, far away with raw, practical wonder like never before, with a story that feels like more of an unfulfilling reunion show, but an exhilarating reunion nonetheless.<br /><br />Ever since the prequels, in fact ever since the originals, we (Star Wars enthusiasts) have been anxiously anticipating a return to the Star Wars universe, and ever since it was announced back in 2013, it rose the potential for a brand new trilogy, hopefully out-grown and learned from the prequels, and true to the originals, to create something truly new and extraordinary. <br /><br />With a whole new set of characters, in a whole new set of stories, extraordinary, it is not. <br /><br />I don't want to bum out the incredibly protective fanbase, but if you're hoping for new planets, a different kind of Star Wars story we'd never seen before, or even an exploration of things you'd only dream of, dream again because Force Awakens takes such a safe route that it almost replicates, frame-by-frame, arch-by-arch ""A New Hope"" in a very respectable, but unnecessary way. <br /><br />First and foremost, the problem I have with ""safe movies,"" is there's nothing to hate because no risks were taken. Example given// The Force Awakens.<br /><br />Now, that's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie by any stretch of the imagination because there's so much to love here.<br /><br />There's a certain mold that defines Star Wars and J.J. understands that beautifully. What I mean is the franchise's so-called style sort of rides this fine line of being overly-cheesy and overly-romantic in its cinematic experience. And its a style that really only works with Star Wars, but it's also a style that has become beloved and cherished by millions of people on the planet. And that said, ""The Force Awakens"" fully embraces this style and projects it on a stage of film-making, entertainment and execution that is at an incredibly high-level of craft, higher than almost any previous installment. <br /><br />It's all there. <br /><br />The performances are sensational, and are even better than expected. <br /><br />The returnees such as Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are all terrific. But it's the new cast that's significant in this one, and do they ever steal the show. <br /><br />Daisy Ridley plays a wondrous scavenger in Rey, who really is the heart and hope of The Force Awakens, giving us a true female hero for this generation. John Boyega plays a runaway stormtrooper named FN217, or aka Finn, and comes across annoying at times, but plays it in a real ""Star Warsy"" way that's effective. But the one to talk about is Adam Driver who plays the emotionally corrupt villain Kylo Ren, who comes across so stellar that in his character's desires to become the next Darth Vader, you actually wish he was as he nails the Star Wars villain with humor and class as good as any before him.<br /><br />So in terms of craft and breaking down the filmmaking elements of ""The Force Awakens,"" this movie has it all. But if those elements are in just a simple, safe story that you wish would go to the next level, then it's just promise. But you put those elements in a daring story, it's extraordinary. <br /><br />Unfortunately, it strays in the prior and stays safe. Without judging the performances, the new characters of Rey, Kylo and Finn are intriguing, but are nothing new. Furthermore where they take these characters, which could've been interesting to any inventive writer, they instead put in them in the default Star Wars character setting in the same-old story-verse we've seen and heard many times before. Now, the default setting isn't a bad thing, it's just that's what's keeping Episode 7 from being extraordinary.<br /><br />Now about the title. This installment delves into a concept that is referred to in the title as ""The Force Awakens."" Intriguing and relevant to the new trilogy. But as much as it is true in some ways, it isn't as relevant as it needs to be. In fact, to think about it, when was the Force ever Awakening, and when you really think about, there are only really 1 or 2 moments in the grand scale of the journey that makes this relevant in any way.<br /><br />The story actually focuses more on the search for Luke Skywalker, which in retrospect gives more sense to Episode 7 being titled ""The Last Jedi,"" or even ""Search for the Last Jedi."" But, shouldn't it be exploring its own new fresh awakening, which is why its called Force Awakens in the first place? <br /><br />Yes, and that is where this movie is flawed. <br /><br />Not saying this movie doesn't go anywhere, it certainly does especially in the last act of the film. Its just for a good portion of this episode, we're left waiting in anxiety and we start to force our own awakening and wonder upon this movie in hopes it'll create some of it's own. It eventually does, but the line from the Yoda-like character referred to as Maz says, ""a different question for a different time,"" completely defines this movie.<br /><br />Then until its final breathes, do we realize this may just be where the story really gets going. But it ends right there. Sure, it was a fun ride, but there were so much unfulfilled desires and hopes in the story and characters, other than the craftsmanship, there's really no reason to revisit Force Awakens other than getting giddy about a few promises that are soon to come, in sequels ahead.<br /><br />Yes, I am going overboard with the criticism here. But there was potential to take this installment in a direction that could've been extraordinary and new. The filmmaking was there, the performances were all there, but I feel as though the production was too in awe that they were making a Star Wars movie, and gave us something fun that pays too much omage. But that doesn't mean it isn't an exhilarating voyage into a galaxy far, far away.<br /><br />Its exuberant, fresh and has moments with awe that slice you right through the heart. Yes, it has its flaws, but every Star Wars movie does<br /><br />In the end of the day, this is a fine addition to an already celebrated and unprecedented saga that only brushes the surface, but brushes it in the most exciting way imaginable and leaves us a lot to look forward to. May the Force Be With You!"
2325,7,The Force(d) Awakens,Sometimes you wonder if critics are not paid by Disney. I am not an anti-corporate guy and I did not have crazy expectations for this movie. But...
2326,3,I simply cannot let this film have 8 stars,"Starting Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens had me thinking that maybe the blockbuster had been overrated. Never have I been so wrong. The movie threw you into the universe that was so masterfully created by Lucas, and makes it even better with new planets, characters and baddies. From the epic space battles to the daunting legions of The First Order, led by Kylo Ren, everything was bigger and better. There was so much that was good about the movie, that I could barely explain all a that I though was awesome. And even though the movie was amazing, I felt that there were some overused clichés and some foreseen plot twists. So, down to the specifics--with no spoilers at all, for the record."
2327,9,"An epic return to a galaxy far, far away","Words cannot describe this AMAZING and EPIC continuation of the Star Wars saga, and a great recovery from the injury that was the prequel trilogy. Harrison Ford was good in it, so were Carrie Fisher, Kylo Ren is a very good villain and pretty much ""snatches the evil role"" from Vader, but DAISY RIDLEY as REY made it for me. She was just the best character in this masterpiece."
2328,10,Best movie ever,"No matter of what, I love this film and anything Star Wars."
2329,10,What a great movie,"I am a Star Wars fan, especially of episodes 4, 5 & 6, but I am not an aficionado by any stretch of the imagination. That being said, I rate The Force Awakens 9 of 10 stars. The first 1/2 of the movie, when new characters were introduced and developed, was 10/10, the second half, which was a bit slower and a lot more like the older Star Wars movies (similar story line, etc.) I give 8/10. The special effects I thought were exceptional throughout the movie. The new young talent, particularly Finn and Rey were outstanding. Han Solo's and Chewbacca's roles were almost perfect. Definitely a movie I will watch again soon, and will buy on blu-ray when it comes out."
2330,9,Superb,"Spoiler alert! Generally, it was a classic star wars movie. Very enjoyable with some contradictory and ridiculous things (like a lot of movies of course). The main Kylo Ren appears to be an extremely powerful Sith, whο can stop a blaster cast (similar to those which executed almost the whole Jedi order) and read the minds of ""non-weak mind"" people, but he is unable to defeat in a light-saber duel an untrained girl, who uses the force like she was trained from Yoda for years. I remember myself satirizing how Luke Skywalker became so fast a ""Jedi"" with so poor training and here we see even better result with no training at all. What made this movie different from the previous episodes is, unfortunately the extreme lack of creativity. It was similar to episode IV in many ways, in a point to make it look very much like a remake. Also, the evolution of the plot was fast and the end abrupt. To conclude, i would say it is an one-time watch movie. I hope that in the next we will see something new."
2331,7,Very enjoyable movie but the creators really have lack of creativity,"The Force Awakens, and it is back! J.J. Abrams has erased the mistakes of episodes I-III and has brought us a gem."
2332,10,The Force is Back! Quick No Spoiler Review,I was expecting so much more from this film. Instead what we seem to have is a remake of the first film but with updates. At the end I was left flat. While the new actors showed some enthusiasm the others seemed to sleep walk through their roles. 
2333,7,Disappointing,"This movie had grit, with comedy, but none of the jar-jar, Ewok, over the top cutesiness that lessened the earlier six movies for me. Is this one the best? Hard to say, really liked the first (original) trilogy but this one was closer to how I would personally envision the SW universe... so for me, this *IS* Star Wars (the last three, Anakin-based, SW movies that were out were just fan-films in comparison). SW-TFA had overall good character development, eye candy, humour, etc. However, as some have noted with anger/disappointment (no spoilers here but a general alert), there is a certain ""reminiscent"" flow to the plot which some will either hate or they will thoroughly enjoy. For me the latter was the case; though I can understand the arguments of the former, I would simply add -- don't be a whiny ""purist,"" this movie was top notch from a sheer fun/entertainment POV no matter what similarities one may pick up on."
2334,9,Excellent,"First time in a loooong while I've seen a movie in the cinemas without getting bored and looking at the clock. I truly enjoyed myself throughout the movie and could easily ignore the flaws. But once out of my seat discussing the movie with my girlfriend I found myself complaining about how similar it was to the earlier movies, and after a while I realized I almost hated it. A weird change of feelings in a matter of hours to say the least."
2335,7,90% recycled material - but still lots of fun and nostalgia,"The progression was natural, really. The thrust of the first Star Wars trilogy (now known as episodes IV-VI) was mythological. The thrust of the second trilogy, the prequels, was political. It only makes sense that the driving force behind the third trilogy is commercial. We're moving further and further away from the resonant, the sacred, the meaningful."
2336,1,"As the Franchise Grows, the Stories Weaken ...","...I'm going to stay the distance...<br /><br />I love them all...ALL!!!<br /><br />People just don't like change...<br /><br />Every time I watch this, it's different and I enjoy it more!<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one...<br /><br />Lovely bit of escapism..."
2337,8,I was there for the first...,I read some of the reviews and kind of laughed because they were kind of right in their sarcasm and cynicism.
2338,,Conflicting thoughts,"The Force Awakens was a blast to watch and an emotionally thrilling ride filled with adventure, story, characters and a lot of heart. The film has exceeded my expectations for the Star Wars film franchise. I expected a good movie but what i did not expect was a great one. I am casual Star Wars fan. I love the original trilogy, but i can also appreciate the prequels as well, though to a lower degree because when there are so few Star Wars films, you kinda have to. What this film does is it eliminates the overly complicated story-lines of that set up the prequel trilogy in favor of a much simpler old fashioned way of story telling reminiscent of the original. Which is a refreshing breath of air for Star Wars fans."
2339,9,''The force is strong with this one'',"When this movie's release was announced, I was very excited at once. I am a huge Star Wars fan, filled with - what I call - ""the Star Wars feeling"". You either have it or you don't. That does not mean I love everything Star Wars related, but I truly loved this new film!"
2340,9,That good old feeling,"This movie will make you realize what it means to be nostalgic. A packed house of Thrills, Comic relief and adventure will leave you mesmerized. Just go for the experience of reliving the old characters and enjoying the new ones. A very slick edited- roller coaster ride, which will leave you gasping for air, when it ends. Awesome effects with strong characters and their strong motivations make this film one of the best entertainer of the year. Really this movie is for the FANS. Don't get bogged down by the haters, God knows what they were expecting, it's not Lucas dude, so stop comparing this one with the earlier films and admit it that JJ is a far better director that Lucas. JJ Abrams is really the new Spielberg, a perfect mix of Big films with a Soul. Go watch as soon as you can and I promise, when this film ends, you will be literally stuck in your seats for few seconds and trying to soak up all the excitement this film would have created inside you. ""The Force is with this Film"""
2341,10,"""The Force is with this Film""",The Force Awakens is a perfectly manufactured product for mass success. 
2342,7,Spectacular but Tiring,I'm writing this review to address the vast amount of horrible reviews ''Star Wars Fans'' have been giving this movie on IMDb.
2343,8,Don't let others diminish your enjoyment.,"I like this movie, on its own without the original movie, I'd say it was excellent, but unfortunately they didn't do too much with the story, you could have easily called this Star Wars episode IV mark 2. It became pretty clear about half way through, that the story is almost exactly the same as New Hope, interchange the characters, interchange the Death Star with Starkiller and you have almost the same movie. At times the unoriginality of this made me appreciate the story arc in prequels, although I'll never be able to get over the poor execution of those movies. Unfortunately, though, too many critics are getting carried away with the euphoria of having a movie that wasn't as poor as the prequels, most of them seem to just completely loose all their objectivity and professionalism and are making this out to be the greatest Star Wars movie, which this really isn't."
2344,6,Good Star Wars Movie but...,"Beautiful Star Wars, great characters, story, cinematography, comedy."
2345,10,SEQUEL TRILOGY IS THE BEST TRILOGY IN THE SAGA,"The movie was just okay to me. It was better than episodes 1-3. Let's see. You have 3 main young characters, 2 men and a woman. The force is strong in one of them who lives in somewhat isolation on a desert planet. There is a bar scene with every possible alien there could be having a drink. You have a good elderly character die at the hands of the lead bad guy. The lead bad guy dresses in black and was once good but now struggles on the dark side of the force. A cute chirping little robot that has something hidden in it. Jedi mind tricks. The Millennium Falcon as the main ride for the good guys. A big nasty death star that while it can blow planets up into tiny little pieces cannot defend it self from a handful of poorly armed good guys. The young good character strong with the force has to find the last Jedi. Did I just pay $14 to watch Episode 4 or 7?"
2346,6,OK but...,"The plot really is a complete mirror of ""A New Hope"" but the film holds none of the emotional weight or character dynamics of that film. The two protagonists, Rey and Finn were boring and had no personality. Rey was the most wooden character and I could not care less about her character. Finn was better and has some humorous moments but even they felt forced- like his encounters with Captain Phasma- who was a pointless character. Princess leia and Han Solo were kind of just there, not adding much really but forced nostalgia. Kylo Ren was under-powered and the First Order were not intimidating villains at all. The Rebels felt more powerful. Starkiller base was stupid, the plot was predictable. "
2347,3,"No character chemistry, rehashed plot, made for kids.",Who ever tells you this movie anything but perfect is either an over pretentious know it all or is dead inside.I know this are harsh words and that everyone is entitled to there opinion but not when it comes to this. For this SW movie the only opinion anyone is entitled to have is its mindbogglingly awesome.
2348,10,Just Incredible,"I celebrate the freedom of speech, but I am truly amazed about how much hate has been poured into the user reviews for this movie, looks like everyone is tearing it apart and still it has a strong above 8 score, what tells me that the great majority thinks is awesome but only haters speak aloud, and again, they have the right to do it, but those who support the movie should do the same, and that is why I'm writing this."
2349,10,Hate is the path to the Darkside,"Honestly, I like this movie. For me it's a good return to the Star Wars franchise, what spoils is what they did after The Force Awakens. The plot is good, the characters are cool, the CGI of the movie is spectacular, worthy of a saga like Star Wars. There are mistakes obviously, like the fact that they killed Han Solo so soon, how much they wasted Finn in the next movies. But overall it's good to see."
2350,9,The Force Awakens,"A typical Star Wars recreating the spirit of the originals. The new cast look as though they are going to take the franchise forward, with the help of the more established faces."
2351,8,In JJ we trust,I was very excited to see this film and purposely stayed off social media for the past couple days to avoid any spoilers or reviews. While it is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination and is entertaining to watch. I was overall very underwhelmed. 
2352,6,Very Underwhelming.. *Spoiler Free*,I've been a Star Wars fan my whole life. Loved the original trilogy and didn't hate the prequels as much as everyone else seems to. But I was really hoping we wouldn't get anything like them again. And we won't. Star Wars: The Force Awakens was great.
2353,9,Flawed But Still Great.,Im not going to review the good parts of the movie. I loved it as a star wars fan and for that matter anything with the word star in it usually makes me happy! But in this review i want to point out the few things where they fell short
2354,7,Could have been better with 1 cast change,"After two dismal prequels and one barely acceptable one filled with lackluster story telling, a complete overuse of CG and green screen, villains that instill no fear, and Jar Jar Binks the Star Wars legacy rested solely on the original three films. These films brought us excitement, they introduced us to instantly iconic characters and locations that blew our minds, special effects that made us feel like we were flying with an X-wing squadron or clashing lightsabers with Darth Vader himself and they introduced us to the classic good versus evil tale that know and love so much. The Force Awakens now too caries this impressive legacy. As soon as I heard the music and saw the bold title I got goosebumps, this film is a triumph on its own but as a part of the Star Wars story it really feels like the return that fans have awaited for so long. The new story is interesting and right from the start you feel invested in this new saga, I felt like this is a story that's really going to be special. The mix of new characters and old classics truly made me emotional, old characters fit in seamlessly and the dynamic between Rey, Finn and BB-8 works so incredibly well. As for the dark side and the villains I felt the true power and conflict behind Kylo Ren and I believe he was an intimidating bad guy and intriguing character for this new saga and one of my personal favorites from the Star Wars universe. Contrary to what some people are saying I personally feel like this was not a remake of the original films, it took the essence of those films and yet made it feel entirely new and fresh. Of course this is not a perfect film but this is certainly a perfect Star Wars film with all of the heart and soul of the original films but with a new feel to it."
2355,10,A return worthy of the Jedi,"This movie is okay, not amazing, but just simply okay. I think people who rated this film things like a 5/10 and 3/10 or lower didn't look at the film in the right way. Sure the plot was simplistic and boring but that's not what you're supposed to focus on this film. You're supposed to be looking at the explosions, the fights, and the way characters interact with each other etc etc. Sure J.J. might have done this movie slightly wrong but that doesn't mean it wasn't terrible beyond a reasonable doubt. "
2356,7,It depends on how you look at it,"The only explanation for this movie having such a high start rating, considering both how bad it was and how many negative reviews have been posted, is that the makers must have people who go on IMDb and flood the site with 10 star scores. Seriously, what other possibility is there? I blame IMDb for this as much as the people who made the movie."
2357,1,The film makers must have paid for good ratings.,"This review may contain spoilers or hints, so beware! Whether you liked or disliked the prequel trilogy, you had some expectations going into this movie. If you hated the newest three movies, you anticipated another letdown. If you did like them, then you were hoping this movie lived up to the Star Wars name. Either way, you will find yourself surprised at how good this movie was."
2358,9,Terrific return to the original trilogy ways.,"To start with what's important, it's a good movie ! "
2359,8,"Go for it, maybe even try out 4DX","For a long time fan, this was pretty good. I was always worried about putting to much references to the old movies, and though there were a lot of them, it didn't bother me nearly as much as i thought it would. Apart from Snoke looking like something from Harry Potter or the Hobbit movies (Godawful that is), my main issue with the movie was the whole part about the new Starkiller Base. It felt like pure laziness from the screenwriters, and they didn't even try to bother to feel like both its power, and the whole battle on it mattered to anyone, or felt exciting or threatening in any way. "
2360,8,Good,"Art style, music, storytelling, acting, continuity. Everything feels straight from the Episode IV,V and VI. This is the true Star Wars sequel people were expecting from the prequels. Long gone are the obvious CGI, bland acting, bad dialog, crazy sword fights. This is classy Star Wars, it's a interesting movie in a style that is hard to find on this age, it brings that ultimate feeling of adventure and happiness when you see it. Everything is well done, aliens races are again a delight to see with so much detail about everything and of course, fan service for fans of the Episodes IV,V and VI."
2361,10,Star wars done right.,"First of all I admit I am not a die-hard fan nor a fan of the series, but I did enjoy the first and second Star Wars movies from the first trilogy (the one from 1977). I have seen the prequels as well and the Family Guy parodies (hilarious, you should rather see the parodies rather than the prequels!)."
2362,7,"A fair sequel: Great for fans, but average for everybody else","As a non spotty basement dweller who doesn't suffer from severe aspergers like the people here giving the this film 1 star, I actually thought this was a great film. "
2363,9,Great :),"Star Wars: The Force Awakens has great music, good acting, fleshed out characters, and stunning effects. The movie has a great new cast that actually does better then the original actors, and actress. And with characters with fleshed out motivations that are easy to not only get behind but also feel emotionally invested in. The fight choreography was also much better then any of the other movies in the saga. And with effects that are realistic enough to believe I can just sit back and watch the character deal with there conflicts."
2364,7,I guss its cool to hate this movie now right?,"This is a great movie. It's also an extremely popular and main stream movie, and therefore is going to bring out people that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2/10 shouldn't even be taken seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right, and putting a magnifying glass over the minor flaws in the movie. "
2365,9,"Ignore negative, neckbeardy, contrarian reviews. The Force is strong with this awesome movie.","I'm shocked by all the negative reviews on here. After watching the movie, I can assure you that this hate is unwarranted and blown out of proportion. 2015 has been a bit of a sore thumb for me with movies, there were a few that Iliked, but really not that many. This was such a breath of fresh air. Let me address the hate that the negative reviews are complaining about:"
2366,7,Ignore the negative reviews. Star Wars is back,"After seen this film a second time you realize it just doesn't measure up, yes it made a ton of money and people are been too generous with the rating of this film, but the story felt like remake rather than continuation of the series. So many missed opportunities in terms of story development and character development. I thought the casting was OK, but the actors were not put in the right roles. I didn't connect with any of the characters at all or care for them, the story was very dumb down as to insult the fans. I' am still hope full that they can turn it around and make better on this tragedy with Rogue one and the next one after that."
2367,1,No Star Wars Magic,This film is not a disappointment in the slightest fashion. 
2368,9,"IGNORE THE """"Original trilogy"" with superior special effects"" REVIEW","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a sci-fi action flick that any die-hard geek could never miss! Though the story and several scenes in the movie were a little too similar to those from the first three films, but it was overall definitely fantastic! The new characters, the direction, the visuals, and even the return of some of the major characters from the original Star Wars trilogy are all what make The Force Awakens a stunning masterpiece! It should be noted that there is a both surprising and depressing scene in the movie that involves Han Solo being killed by his own son (the antagonist Kylo Ren) by getting stabbed through the chest by a lightsaber, which would easily make this movie perfect for spoiling."
2369,9,A little too derivative but much better than the prequels,Sure a lot of people won't be satisfied with this movie but I certainly was. The only 2 star wars movies I enjoyed before this were the first 2 (in order of appearance) The third was lame and it got even worse from there. If there was another good one it had to be one of the ones I missed since I lost interest completely. My wife wanted to go so we just saw it tonight. My expectations were low. It starts out OK and keeps going all the way through. It is fun and action packed like the originals were. There is no time wasted on stupid characters or boring dialogue. I am actually looking forward to the next one. Who cares if it was reminiscent of the first one. I loved the first one. I hated the last couple I saw. I am SO glad Lucas is done screwing up these movies. Star wars is cool again. BTW the wife loved it.
2370,9,Star wars is entertaining again,"The new installment of the Star Wars saga is here and I must say, it is amazing! J.J Abrams chose to go back to the roots of Star Wars with real sets, real costumes and practical effects. It looks beautiful!"
2371,8,Back to the roots of Star Wars,"First off I will say the film was entertaining overall, the effects were excellent and the appearance of Han and Chewie added a lot to the film as a whole. It does feel like Star Wars. So in terms of being worth the price of admission, it is."
2372,7,"Entertaining, but not great","This review is more for me to vent my personal outrage of the blinded by nostalgia of the original films and ""What they stood for"" FANBOYS who want to hate on everything that is not a re-release of the original virgin films by George Lucas. You guys have SO many mental problems and I highly doubt any of you have been outside of your parents houses since 2005. George Lucas didn't make you happy, god damn Star wars GURU himself disappointed you. Many of you hated this new movie before it was released and you already wanted to bash it before you even saw it! Heres the situation, Disney purchased the rights to this, they own Lucasfilm and it's properties which means the Star Wars franchise will be shoved down our throat and pimped out like never before.. Oh really. Because I clearly remember the Phantom Menace being everywhere. The toys, the special buys from fast food places, EVERYONE talked about it. Nothing has changed since then except fan service. This new movie had everything the ""Real fan"" should want. Returning characters, returning themes a complete awakening of what the original films were. The sets were beautiful and I seriously thought I was tearing up in the theater seeing how the shots looked. They gave us quite a bit of time to learn the characters and feel for them with the limited time we really got. I don't know how much more a fan could REALLY want without being disappointed. I mean it's like some of you request for something more like the originals, they give it to you and you're unhappy. You were given something unlike the originals (Prequels) and you hated it. George Lucas is old and had no idea how to make a Star Wars film anymore and it wouldn't matter. You guys saw the original trilogy when you were children and these films will not make you happy because you are immature little derps. IDC who made the movies, IDC who owns the movies all I cared about was seeing things that reminded me of the originals while bringing some new things to the movie!! the villain reminds me of Darth Vader but is CLEARLY different considering how he reacted to failure which was to cut down anything near him. Enjoyable movie was enjoyable but you DIE hard fans can't enjoy anything that is NEW."
2373,10,Star Wars fans are STUPID.,"This is a spoiler free review, I would like to say that I grew up with the prequels, so I carry no intimate nostalgia for the originals. I will treat this movie with no bias just because it's star wars."
2374,7,"Unoriginal, but still enjoyable","One day I woke and there it was: The Force Awakens. I had gone to sleep with my r2d2 1984 action figure only to find out that somebody stole it. I soon found out that the movie took my collectible item without asking. Looks like Kylo Ren is making a ham sandwich for this. BB-8 steals the show with all of the magnificent lines the droid has. Finn, a stormtrooper who realizes that being a stormtrooper is not what it seems joins forces with Po in order to make Kung Fu Panda 3. Rey is an orphan who finds out she has the force ( But who can her parents bee ??????). Overall, while people call this a remake of episode IV: A New Hope, I believe that it is a REMASTERED version which is way different. Personally, I like A Force Awakenes and hope one day I will get my figure back."
2375,10,An awoken Audience,"As someone who grew up with copies of the original trilogy on VHS, almost worn out from so many plays and rewinds - it was difficult to go into the screening without exceptionally high expectations and a child-like level of excitement. The marketing pushed the idea of redemption, for a franchise that had lost its way. Not that I didn't love the sight of Jar Jar Binks in the senate. But swamp-dwelling comic relief characters out of sight and out of mind, I took my seat, light-up-light-saber in hand."
2376,6,"Do, or do not. There is no try when making a Star Wars film.",.. after Mel Brooks in Spaceballs. J.J.Abrams should have stuck to something he does not kill. The Force in this case.
2377,2,"Use the Schwarz, J.J.!","I really like this movie, many people say it's the same as a new hope but no, it's just paying homage to the originals"
2378,8,Really good,"I'm still crying, and I haven't cried in 10 years in a movie theater. I hate this movie, I hate the feelings it gave me, I hate them. If you are an average fan of 'Star Wars', like myself, do not go and see it. You'll have a psychological breakdown. For the emotional impact that this movie extorts on you is overwhelming. Are there any flaws in this movie? Not that I saw. My only minor complaint is that this movie borrowed so many ideas and plot points from 'A New Hope'. But you know what? I don't really care. What's important for me is not how original a movie is, but how it's executed. I felt suspense, excitement, joy, fear and sadness. Lots and lots of sadness. F**k man, he died, and I'm afraid Skywalker will be next. I don't care about Leia. If we ever witness Luke Skywalker die in the next sequel, I might commit suicide."
2379,9,Has 'Star Wars' redeemed me?,"I watched this film earlier today, and I came out of the theater with a quite good feeling. It was perfectly fine. More or less what one could expect from a SW movie."
2380,8,Stop wining about this movie!,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. "
2381,9,I cannot understand why there are so many negative reviews,"After the failings of the prequels I, as an avid fan, was worried. Saw JJ's attempt at Star Trek and thought it was passable, but thought he couldn't make this worse than 1-2-3."
2382,7,Good but no great,"I am seeing a lot of people nitpick this movie pretty bad, and I know that is gonna happen with any movie this big, and any Star Wars movie for that matter, but people really need to calm down a little bit. First of all, I recognize that this movie has some flaws, but every movie does and anyone who expected a perfect movie is completely unrealistic, and really only has themselves to blame for being let down. The OT are, in my opinion, some of the greatest films ever made but they have some issues too people all movies do!!! That being said this is such a great movie. Its amazing to be back in this world, especially since it feels like Star Wars again. Some people are complaining that the movie didn't flesh things out enough, and I think that for certain things that is correct, but Lucasfilm is leaving reveals for other films and they are smartly thinking ahead instead of blowing everything in the first film. Others are claiming that the movie is a rehash of A New Hope, when really it is mainly just homage with a couple points that I agree were too similar, and I think this movie is based on the idea that history repeats itself. Every single person that I know that has seen this movie, which is pretty much everybody that I know, absolutely loved it even if they had a couple minor issues, and there is no doubt to me that this is an amazing start to this new trilogy! The original cast was all brought back in a perfect way, the new characters are great and I already love them, and I cannot wait to see what comes next. The force awakens is no doubt the most difficult task ever handed to a filmmaker, and JJ Abrams did an amazing job bringing Star Wars back. It is a complete triumph, and it deserves all the money that it is going to make. I cannot wait for episode 8!!"
2383,10,Star Wars is back!,"First of all, I consider myself to be a hugh Star Wars fan. I loved the music and concept since childhood. I did like Episode 1-3 but I agree with most fans that i know of, That the actor to Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Jar Jar Clumpsy Binks reduced its potential. "
2384,6,Episode 4 with better Visual effects and more cheesy!,"Having seen it for the third time (on opening weekend), I can now safely say it is easily on par with the first three films. Every viewing reveals new details, subtle nuance and more charm."
2385,10,This film rewards repeated viewings just like the original trilogy did,"JJ has been labelled a hack in the past but you know what? He pulled off the impossible! 2 successful reboots in Star Trek and Star Wars?! Come on! Give the man some credit! And don't say that he copied A New Hope! That's the point of STAR WARS! History repeats itself( RHYMING)! Plus, it fits PERFECT with the theme of letting go of the past! If you DO have problems with the writing, you cannot deny that the film is executed almost flawlessly! That last shot is garbage though! Overall, greatest movie ever and JJ is a god....gunga ginga"
2386,7,Execution is GREAT!,"This is a very early review of the most hyped film since The Phantom Menace, so there will be no spoilers and my review will be as vague as possible."
2387,5,"Looks great, but bored me silly","Some people think it was a ""remake"" of the earlier episodes and I completely understand that. However, to me it was important that this FEEL like a Star Wars movie, unlike episodes 1-3, this 100% does. There were many details that a Star Wars fan would pick up on that I appreciated. I think it was a perfect introduction to a new storyline. Are there similarities in the storyline to the originals? Yes, but I think that's completely OK for the first movie in what will most certainly be the first of a series. So let's be kinder, those who gave it a 1 would have probably given it a 1 in any circumstance. It's completely unfair to give it anything below an 8. Also, I love love loved that there wasn't excessive CG throughout every scene."
2388,10,It felt like a true Star Wars movie,"OK, just saw it last night and i have to say .... the force IS awakened ! I was happy with the characters, their chemistry, how the story was told and how JJ kept the magic that was long gone in this universe. Also i think its the most funny star wars movie :) i mean ... there was couple of times when all theater was laughing loud. The moto of this movie really steps up and i just cant wait to see what will happened next in this trilogy. I see people ranking the star wars movies and of course they put new hope and empire up first but ... i think this movie is a combination of those two and if Im not such SW fan i would rank this one #1. Ray - she stole the movie with her soul, every time she appears on screen i fall more and more in love with this character, when Finn appears i start to smile and Po is so charismatic thats beyond belief and finally BB-8 ... omg, Darth Vader himself will love this droid :) buying bb-8 toy for sure :). Speaking of Darth ... new villain here as you know is Kylo Ren and i have one word for Adam Driver performance - BRAVO! I just hope next SW movies will keep the magic Im going this Sunday to watch it again hehe :) May the force be with you !"
2389,9,The force is strong with this one,Abrams' achievement in rebooting SW with such faithfulness to the original trilogy will guarantee his place in the history books as perhaps the greatest movie director.
2390,,Faithful to original films whilst bringing something new.,"The Force Awakens, the long-awaited almost mythical episode seven of the Star Wars saga is finally upon us. I held off from writing this review for quite some time as I digested the film and tried to distill my feelings about it. I've got such strong feelings for the original trilogy from being a kid, that would it live up to the expectations I had in my own head? This was the holy grail being realised at last - real, and new Star Wars at last. "
2391,8,Return of the Empire,"I was re-beamed into the Star Wars universe I knew the last 38 years from 78, when I watched episode IV as a 16 years old guy, to today and it was a fantastic and thrilling journey."
2392,9,A perfect substrate of all prior Star Wars episodes,"Like many of the folks I have seen on this website, I too was a bit disappointed in how predictable the plot was. From a business standpoint it does make sense to stick to the tried and true Star Wars formula, this decision brings younger fans into their market but also alienates some older ones. But aside from that it was an enjoyable movie, not great but enjoyable none the less. I don't understand how a film that has excellent cinematography, good action, and decent enough dialogue can earn so many 1 star ratings. Especially since I think this movie was far better than the prequels were. When it comes to the dialogue, not having George Lucas involved actually helps this film. Mr. Lucas himself has admitted that writing dialogue is his weak spot, and in this film when people talk it actually sounds like real conversation. The pacing in this movie is excellent and it needed to be due to the predictability. As far as the characters, they have their pros and cons obviously. Rey and Finn had good chemistry together but occasionally you'll find yourself thinking ""how come this girl is amazing at everything she tries, right off the bat"". When it comes to the villain, Kylo Ren is very complex. At times it feels like they're revealing too much of his personal emotions for him to be menacing, but it also could be used to build his character if they plan on keeping him as the antagonist. Like I said before, the main problem in this movie is that it's more or less a rehash of A New Hope. I'm sure that let people down initially but if you understand that before watching it, you'll probably enjoy the movie anyways. It's well executed, well choreographed and all things considered it is a good movie. It's not a 10 star movie, it certainly isn't a 1. If you're on the fence just give it a shot, you might be pleasantly surprised."
2393,6,"Yes it's a remake of sorts, but still enjoyable","Before I talk about the movie, and I'll try and keep spoilers to a minimum, I'm going to grumble, about some of the user reviews and statements I've read."
2394,9,Haters missing the point of a great addition to the Star Wars Mythology,"Its hard to critic this movie without mentioning the others.. It really is I will say that the last though were alright felt like they had a different spirit or feel to them the the original ones did. I am happy to say I felt this one heralded back to the spirit of the Original Star wars series. I don't mean that in a bad way I just felt that the Original Star wars 4,5,6 just had a different flow to them I think 1,2,3 were good but they pandered a little to much to kids. Ie Jar jar. I think 2 and 3 might have been better if they had done like a part part 2 in there some where as I felt that they were trying to fit to much in such a short time. Anyways Back to this one.. As I said I felt that in the end it went back to the feel of The Original and I am quite happy with it."
2395,7,My Two Cents,My real rating is 8.5. Giving it a 10 due to all the naysayers giving it a 1. There is no movie with these effects that deserve a 1. The story is so-so and it is probably because there are a few major questions left unanswered and I will probably be answered in the following sequels. The acting and the air around the whole film is a huge leap forward compared to episodes 1-3. I like the way they created it. The production also kept the tech relatively consistent in relation to episodes 4-6. The only thing I disliked was the antagonist (you will know what I mean when you watch the movie). I look forward to the continuation of this promising set.
2396,10,on the right track,Just got home from watching Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens​. 
2397,6,Better than the prequels...,** This review contains spoilers **
2398,4,A very average movie and a bad Star Wars movie.,"How to keep calm ?? We waited .... For 3 years already. Let us remember that day when we learned that Lucasfilm was bought by Disney and the biggest saga of all time would return to the cinema. Between excitement and fear (especially fear from the usual cliché that is the modern public on the box with big ears), not knowing what to expect from this Star Wars: Episode VII. Since my childhood, I was rocked by Star Wars stories, and even today, nothing has changed. I am even more addicted to this universe than ever. Whether it's the Original Trilogy, the prequels, animated series, the Extended Universe or all other products around that galaxy far, far away, I have always remained a great fan of the extraordinary world that created George Lucas. And now I decided to write this review after 3 months that I watched the movie."
2399,10,For all children of Star Wars,"As a huge star wars fan, I believe this was a great movie that brought our favorite galaxy back to the screen. It showed old characters in there old glory, and introduced a new cast of intriguing characters. The acting was terrific and the dialogue was snappy and hilarious. None of the painful dialogue from the prequel trilogy. This movie still did leave a lot of unanswered questions, and it left me wanting more star wars! What more can you ask for from a movie? It had great action, great thrills, and even moments when I was legitimately scared. Kylo Ren and the First Order are the scariest and most complex villains the saga has to offer. This is one of the best star wars movies ever made, which is saying something considering two star wars movies are in the IMDb top rated movies top 20. This movie deserves to be in the top 20 as well. I was entertained from the second the opening crawl began, to the credits at the end. Truly a masterpiece."
2400,10,Awesome,No real spoilers: references to character dynamics for those wanting to remain completely pure before viewing.
2401,10,A True Modern Blockbuster,"I went to the movie theater to see The Force Awakens so I could see for myself what the huge hype was about. My friends loved it so much that they saw it a second time, so I had very high expectations. "
2402,8,Amazing,"The Force Awakens is a much better movie than any of the prequels, but lacks the imagination, pacing, and sense of wonder of any of the other six Star Wars films, and suffers for it. I had high hopes, and they mostly weren't quashed, but I think it could have been so much more."
2403,7,Good but not great,10 out of 10 only to irk all the whining fan boys on here.
2404,10,Relax people. Its just a space fantasy movie.,"The movie is good enough to enjoy it without even knowing the prequels, and if you are around your 40's it is likely that you will feel a tender nostalgia from the first minute."
2405,6,Go and have a nice time with your children/friends/others...nothing more,"The movie is not bad, which is a good start."
2406,8,Perhaps the best protagonist yet,"J.J. Abrams is considered one of the most skilled directors of our time in Hollywood. Some of his previous works, including Super 8 or Mission Impossible 3 were decent sci-fi/action movies (the latter being, in my opinion, the best of all five). Unfortunately, his attempt to revive the Star Trek franchise can hardly be treated as successful. Action-packed, but with no reasonable plot, both movies are a good example of contradicting the Gene Roddenberry's original idea and principles."
2407,7,"Better than the new Star Treks, but...",tl:dr - Watch once but doubt you'll bother watching it again.
2408,1,Underwhelming,"This movie had a lot of scenes that were similar of the other movies in the franchise. (Spoiler)Such as the scene when Kylo Ren kills his father Han. this scene was a resemblance of the Darth Vader/Ben Kenobi, Death Star scene in which Luke witnessed Vader slaying Kenobi. This in turn steeled Luke's commitment to the Jedi ways. Rey seeing this had resolved to seeking out Luke Skywalker. The cast of characters in the movie were varied in strength. The bad guys weren't referred to as Sith. didn't have the ominous fear instilling presence of the Sith of previous movies. (Spoiler)If an untrained force adept can beat a trained so called fallen Jedi, and he(Fallen Jedi) has a hard time dealing with a soldier with a light sabre. Kylo Ren was a bitch. This movies saving grace was the introduction of Rey, Finn, BB8, and the return of Han Solo & Chewbacca."
2409,8,star wars The Force Awakens,"Zero spoiler review. I can describe how I feel about this movie in 8 words: I can't wait to see what happens next. I sure as hell never said that after any of the prequel movies. This is a proper Star Wars sequel, full of adventure, excitement, and most importantly, fun. The characters are roundly endearing, the story is roller-coaster paced, and the setup for the next movie is perfectly executed by plot points that leave behind a lot of mystery. This is how mythos is built, just like in the original movies. This movie contains a lot of nostalgia and callbacks to the originals, but they all feel natural and organic, and it has a heck of a lot of new stuff too. The visual effects are inventive and look incredible (and very importantly for those of us who hated the artificial look and style of the prequels, everything looks authentic), and the musical score is appropriately rousing. The bottom line for Star Wars fans: not as good as The Empire Strikes Back, and nothing can ever capture the magic of the original Star Wars that started it all, but this is a solid third best in the series, much better than the awkward Return Of The Jedi and light years ahead of the soulless prequels. Coming in third to heavyweights like the first two movies is no knock, and it's one of the best movies of 2015. Big thumbs up."
2410,8,A welcome return to classic form,"I have been a Star Wars fan since opening day in 1977. However, I had a few Star Wars toys, but have never owned Star Wars apparel or memorabilia so I'm not what many of you would categorize as a die- hard."
2411,9,"Well done to tie story, yet reboot a bit","*Possible Spoiler Alert* I was honestly nervous going into this movie...as a die-hard Star Wars fan, I was super anxious about a new director/Disney taking over...but I was NOT disappointed."
2412,10,LOVED it,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that I have always always been much more of a Star Trek fan than Star Wars and as such, any Star Wars movie I watch always ends up shrouded in this bias of ""this would have been better if it was more like Star Trek"". I don't hate Star Wars, it's just not my preference story-wise."
2413,7,A solid film for Star Wars fans,"""The Force Awakens"" was a thrilling, emotional journey all the way through. JJ Abrams did a remarkable job by staying true to the original trilogy's DNA and managed to combine iconic characters with new ones very smoothly. The new story-line fits very well, mixing up classic elements with the new setting/atmosphere. Rey is the highest point of this new Star Wars world and i don't think anyone of us saw that coming (BB-8 was awesome too). "
2414,9,"An emotional, thrilling journey true to its origins","Well, for everyone who has ever had their expectations smashed upon the jagged rocks of reality, I'm happy to report that it's safe to get excited. J.J. Abrams has expertly crafted an experience that delivers on everything that made original trilogy the beloved franchise that it is today. Of course, the action, grand spectacles, pretty faces, and sprinkling of humor that is typical of triple-A crowd pleasers is present, but so are the elements that make a good movie into a great one. Just like the original trilogy, this installment sets itself apart from the pack thanks to its likable and memorable characters, an interesting storyline which exists as more than just a vehicle to drive the action, and a fictional world so compelling that even adults want to live in it. So, get ready to care about new characters. Get ready to fear a multi-dimensional villain. Get ready to go on a new adventure. A worthy successor to the original trilogy has finally arrived."
2415,6,A Worthy Successor to the Original Trilogy,"The opening of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, with the setting of nighttime on Jakku and the almost immediate introduction of the new villain, Kylo Ren, was such a great way to start the new trilogy. You get a sense that this new villain means business and, after stopping a laser blast midair, you know he's got quite remarkable powers. "
2416,8,"Rehashes on old ideas, but executes them flawlessly","Just over a year ago, on November 28, the first official teaser trailer for possibility the most hyped film to ever be released, hit the internet. Just as any human, Jedi or not, knew that this was just the first shovel of excitement to be thrown on the increasingly fast hype train. "
2417,7,Star Wars: A New Hope 2,"There is nothing new in this movie in comparison to previous six parts. Exactly same story line. Only difference is that new Jedi is a female character who looks like Jennifer Connelly. And other than Harrison Ford, acting is pretty dull. There is not a single good punchline in the whole movie. Sci-fi movies have a huge scope of good punchlines but they failed to capitalize. But who needs to capitalize when you have huge capital which can be rather used in the advertisements. Right?"
2418,4,Cut Copy Paste of previous versions. It is like Over-hyped Twilight movie..,"It's clear that J. J. Abrams shows his utmost respect to the franchise and keeps everything familiar intact. As a fan, I'm totally happy watching this movie, with well-timed re-introduction of characters we know and admire, and a structure that faithfully follows a classic Star Wars movie."
2419,9,A fan well-served here,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was one of the most anticipated movies of 2015 and lives up to its high expectations."
2420,9,Perfect Base for what is left to come,WARNING!! SPOILERS AHEAD!
2421,9,Fantastic movie! I loved it!,"This film isn't full of surprises but it's good. It's a real Star Wars film- it's a good Star Wars film. It's really Star Wars like a Star Wars film hasn't been since Return of The Jedi. You won't care about the new characters like you care about the classic characters but the film doesn't expect you to and when the characters and story run its course the movie ends while you're still having fun. And it is fun. It's really Star Wars- X-Wings, Tie fighters, bad guys and smart ass dialog. The special effects are great and not a heap of over cooked computer generated visuals but instead are practical sets and beautifully done classical miniature shots like in the classic films. I love that."
2422,9,A real Star Wars Film!,"I Liked it so much when it first came out but seeing how the trilogy ended changes my point of view about this movie , it's still an enjoyable movie tho."
2423,7,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,"Any sequel to something so iconic was always going to attract those who love it, and those who hate it. I guess we can each imagine the elements that would make up our own perfect Star Wars VII movie. But I think this is part of the real magic. Star Wars on the one hand joyful and trivial, on the other deep and meaningful, seems to reach not only our shared consciousness but also have a personal meaning too. "
2424,10,Pure Star Wars joy!,"One can say that this new episode is a reboot, a remake. Yes, this is true! But it deserved my attention. I was not disappointed watching this. Not a bit! The thing is that this is quite similar in term of story, with the first movie. But, in my opinion, was made like this with a purpose. I am sure that the next one will be more profound. In fact, this is what we expect from Star Wars creators: a saga with love, death and many adventures! We all say now that being a orange ball, is more expressive that being a silver blue tube. Nobody can say that Ray's part is played better than Amidala's one. True, there are several stupid moments when I asked myself why the villain sounds better with the mask on and childish, adolescentine without the mask. For me, a 44 year old guy, this come back was more than welcomed. I was able see another story that promised much more in the future. It moved me, so I encourage you to go to theaters to see it. And, if you have the possibility to go t a 4DX cinema, go there to fly Millennium Falcon! I was sad a little bit seeing how time passed over Leia and Han, but both of them contribute to the story. Let's hope for the good and remember what Lucas said: when you do a Star Wars movie, everybody in the world will tell you that you should do it in a different way."
2425,7,"Yes, it is true!","The fact that people are rating this on the same level or even lower than the prequels is terrible. Part of the problem may be that it's either the best thing or the worst thing there is no in the middle with some people. To those of you who are rating it 1 go back and watch Phantom Menance and you'll be reminded of what a bad Star Wars movie is. This movie isn't perfect and the plot isn't the most original but the characters are great. It's funny when it needs to be serious when it needs to be and dramatic when needs to be and Harrison Ford as Han Solo is great.This movie isn't the best Star Wars movie but it is definitely better than a 1 which the majority of reviews I saw gave it. Even if you aren't a fan of Star Wars I highly recommend you watch this movie. ""From my point of view the fans are evil!"" -George Lucas on selling Star Wars to Disney"
2426,10,Why so many Ones,Utilising a predominantly repurposed story from the original movies what we get is a visually pleasing film that really doesn't do much new narratively. It also throws a lot of ideas at the audience trying to discover which ones will stick in order to carry a trilogy but does not succeed as a self contained story in its own right.
2427,6,Very Very Safe,Don't bother with this garbage: it's just a bad ripoff of the very first star wars movie.
2428,1,A Chinese ripoff would have done a better job,"The start had me shocked, and hooked. I knew instantly this was a different breed of the Star Wars franchise. Yet the further I got through the film, the more it seemed like a simple clone of the originals. Throwback, upon throwback, reference after reference. At first I loved it, but then it seemed it was the premise of the movie. Don't get me wrong, the acting was amazing, the visuals were fantastic, and I loved all the new characters. But it really lacked that Star Wars feel, despite it being basically the same plot as episode IV. "
2429,10,"Fantastic start, Disappointing end","I read all the shitty reviews on IMDb of the new Star War movies from 'so called' critics and I laughed out loud at their reasons why they hated the movie. But these reviewers are just amateurs who try to bash a great movie. The professional reviewers wrote - USA Today 4 out of 4 stars, the Guardian 5 out of 5 Stars, The SF Chronicle 5 out of 5 stars and called it a great movie that was both thrilling and humorous, The Wall Street Journal headline 5 out of 5 stars - ""The Star Wars you have been waiting for"". If the movie is as bad as the amateur critics on IMDb states, why does it have an 8.5 IMDb rating? Why is this movie going to gross over $3 billion dollars if word of mouth regarding the flick mirrored the crappy reviews found on IMDb? These reviewers who tell you that Star Wars VII it is a bad flick are just bitter people who live in the basement of their Moms' home and probably think Scy-Fi's Expanse show is awesome (it's not). I have seen the movie Star Wars twice including IMAX and love it. The movie is 150 minutes long but feels 90 minutes. It's a great flick – the two best movies this year are Mad Max and Star Wars VII."
2430,10,SWIIV an awesome flick,"I appreciated how TFA played with scale, showing off the Star Destroyer at Jakku, making everything feel larger. Exceeding long takes, fluid camera movement, seems to be up to the viewer whether that's an improvement, I like it since it's a step up from the TV- show cinematography, at least the lazy compositions of 6, 2, and 3. But it still bothered me - fluid movement of camera, it'd fit more better if it was more static. It's too action oriented and lacks the feeling and breath of Star Wars. The blocking of actors - cantina bothered me, as I prefer the actors to be moved around, so the camera follow movement rather than living on its own, it kinda took m.e out The ending felt forced, the execution wasn't good either - awkward blocking and the choice of the helicopter shot only comes off as awkward, too - blocking of the actors, placement of camera, no sense of direction, all affecting the feel of the movie, unfortunately. It also borrows the style of the others, as the portrayal of Kylo Ren reminds me of the portrayal of Vader - Kylo Ren with helmet was filmed from a low- angle, same as Darth Vader with the helmet, implying intimidation - Kylo Ren without helmet, was filmed from eye-level, same as Darth Vader, implying they're human and 'normal.'' 'There's a scene, where lighting plays a significant role and is symbolic in terms of the character's internalization, where the light illuminates half the face, meaning the character's split in terms of decision -- Kylo Ren is partly told through the cinematography, it tries to say he's not supposed to be as badass, since he's still learning, though some prefers one dimensional characters. The lighting and camera-work in the TIE- Fighters -- clear improvement, instead of the unnatural blue lighting from nowhere in ANH, it's the lighting of the outside, also when it fires laser bolts, the cockpit illuminates from the green laser bolts, really convincing in comparison. Though it has innovative cinematography for a Star Wars film, it has a lot of ''homage'' shots, trying to connect the saga, whether it's too many similarities, it's up to you - Jakku mirroring ANH's Mos Eisley reveal - Maz Kanata's castle mirrors Mos Eisley cantina, though they try and make the shots their own, by taking their own variation of it, it may have gone too far. I absolutely loved the opening, my second favourite, only behind ANH's - my interpretation of the Star Destroyer covering the light, I'm thinking it foreshadows the darkness to come. Its technical aspect was still impressive, though the ending wasn't anything special and made the feeling of reward suffer."
2431,,Lack of reward or an actual disappointment?,I was lucky enough to see the Force Awakens on its release day and I'm glad to say that it was spectacular! The movie was well directed and the whole star wars effect was evident throughout the movie whether it was the soundtrack or references to the original trilogy which i thought was a great gesture towards massive star wars fans like me.
2432,10,The force is very strong with JJ Abrahams,"I didn't get the Star Wars vibe. Don't get me wrong, it was a very well done movie and JJ did a great work. It is not easy to take command of such beloved saga and not get backlash. But something lacked, something beyond the great visuals or the script. For me, the Star Wars movies have a thread that connects them: the exact amount of action, drama and absurdity that made them lovable. The director took the job really seriously and that is what derailed TFA from the others. I know many people despise the prequels because they consider them silly, but that is the charm of the saga. For those who complaint about lack of originality, what would you expect? The premise is always the same: the dark side versus the light, good versus evil and the search for the force. Different characters and situations, but at the end is always the same. And that is not a bad thing; if you have a winning formula, just keep using it. I do have to say that TFA was a little too similar to Episode 4 for my taste, let's hope that the storyline might change a bit in the next movies. As a fan, I really enjoyed it and wasn't disappointed at all. It might get predictable, but this is a saga that can't overuse plot twists (we have many already). The acting was acceptable, the characters fresh and the visuals incredible. So, enjoy it, relax and may the Force be with you..."
2433,8,Great movie but...,"First and the most important thing.. Ignore all the negative reviews from 40 years old geeks, nerds and fat-sos living a their parents basement."
2434,7,A New Hope Remak...ish.. A New Hope for Movie Lovers,"I am a long time fan of the franchise, and remembering the excitement I felt for Ep 1. i remember the disappointment even more. The entire film was just really bland, with no wit or fun characters. Without going into the Ep. 1 too much, I was very happy to know this was potentially better than any previous Star Wars material. The story was well established, and well executed. J.J is excellent at showing, rather than telling and exceeds at this in the beautiful world he created. The only exception would be the Snoke character who stuck out a bit. I will be looking forward to his character development in future films though. John Boyega has a lot of charisma as Finn, Oscar Isaac is great as Po Dameron, and Daisey Ridley is exceptional as Rey. The show stealer for me was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. His performance is amazing, and he encapsulates everything necessary for illustrating the struggle that Jedi's have with the light and dark side. I am super excited for my 2nd viewing, and for the upcoming Rogue One film next December!"
2435,10,The Force has Awakened!,"So, was it good? Short answer Yes with an If, long answer No with a But. SW:TFA is what seems to be a trend with JJ Abrams films; outstanding visuals, but a week story that misses the big picture."
2436,7,Star Wars: The Next Generation,"First of all, it is best to watch the movie for yourself, because any Star Wars movie are good, some of them are better than other, but watching this one without listening to personal opinions of other is the best way. "
2437,10,"This movie feels like Star Wars, a NEW Star Wars movie.","This movie was good. It avoided a lot of the problems of the prequels. The script was good, story was good, acting and directing was mostly good (more on that to come) and it was intense. It's gripping film that gets back to the adventure type feel of the originals."
2438,7,"A good movie, but still not quite as good as the originals","In 1999 Star Wars creator George Lucas finally began to give us his view on the events that led to Star Wars IV, V and VI. The first Star Wars trilogy was, as we all know, a milestone in cinema history and it's not easy to top something like that. He didn't succeed to top the original trilogy and although successful commercially, fans weren't all to impressed with the prequels. The story was flat, the characters annoying and the special effects too clean. It could be that this even led to his decision to sell off his Lucasfilm and all the rights to the Star Wars imperium. Disney picked up those rights. Maybe because they thought they could do better. Well, commercially they were right. But better films? Their first installment isn't that impressive. It's worse than The Phantom Menace."
2439,1,Another failed attempt to recapture the magic,"I absolutely can not understand why people give it so much negativity. So what if it was a reboot to episode IV, isn't that a compliment to JJ for making such an amazing film? "
2440,10,The movie is absolutely amazing,"It's sad to see that a lot of old-school fans are hating on this wonderful piece of cinematic art, because it almost had me (who's also an old-school Star Wars fan) in tears."
2441,10,a cinematic piece of art that gets underrated by a fan-base that's never satisfied,"It IS excellent. the movie has a lot of the previous films, it has a lot from episode IV. the picture is amazing, it has a fast pace, the special effects will knock you out of your seat, the story keeps you going all the way through, and it makes you care about the characters. You feel like as star wars has returned to the same vitality it had when it first came to be in the 70's. The only complaint would be that it has to explain more about the characters and the story at some points, but fans will recognize the classic elements. Seeing the old crew of actors of the previous films brings joy to the heart, this movie has heart and it will absorb you. Even if the plot is not as deep sometimes, it has what you expect from a star wars film. better than the prequels."
2442,10,Excellent!! At least will watch it 3 more times,"I Loved this movie, not because of the old trilogy making a comeback but because of it's new tone and characters! Finn and Ray are amazing choices for not only good characters but of their personalities and roles in this film. Ray was stole the film as she learned to master the force and help take down the main antagonist. In may eyes she is becoming a very cool female protagonist up there with Ellen Ripley and Kill Bill. I adored the fact with out with the old and in with the new. And killing off Hon Solo might be heartbreaking for some long time fans but for me it was welcome party for Finn and Ray's new adventures to come! I also loved seeing Luke again, it brought back lot's of nostalgia!"
2443,9,Amazing!,"I haven't written a review on IMDb before, but I figured for Episode VII this would be worth doing."
2444,6,The Force Awakens - but is it the same force?,"For some strange reason the recent Force Awakens movie seemed to draw a lot of haters. Many have claimed the plot to be to similar to that of the first one (original) which I can certainly agree with. But personally that hasn't change my view on it one single bit. Quite frankly I loved the film and felt it offered everything you would expect from the franchise: jam packed action, a wide array of new characters, a major plot twist and of course a lot of blowing things up."
2445,9,Don't listen to the haters !!!,HERE THERE BE SPOILERS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
2446,7,This isn't the film you're looking for..,"I think this was definitively a good attempt at nostalgia, however I believe they most certainly recycled way too much of the original 1977 Star Wars IV- A New Hope, only with a new filter."
2447,8,Good attempt at nostalgia,Great film but the plot was almost identical to the original star wars. OnLy disappointment for me was the villain.as soon as he took of his mask he just reminded me of One Direction.Hopefully his actions in this movie will make him a lot nastier in the next one.
2448,7,Rehash of Original with Great Additions to saga.,"There is always an explanation...and many reviewers have given them. Indulge me and let me get this disappointment off my chest and into the universe. The extraordinarily high rating given this episode, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is surely linked in part to nostalgia and massive advertising. It is as if we couldn't dislike such a fixture of our childhood even if it is being served up again covered with crème chantilly and so many other frills designed to cover up the truth that the dish is tasteless. There is plenty of humanity in earlier episodes, the Nytimes.com review is a mystery here. And please tell me if I missed it but there is less than nothing new or original in this episode. The new young stars are compelling but the out of the vacuum storyline is not. The only humanity I saw in the film is that Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill were allowed to age, graciously or not depending on your personal projections. We do have the generalized massacre of anything enemy, as well as defenseless planets. In sheer numbers these virtual deaths put practically every other high body count movie to shame. The carnage is rarely graphic however. The first 'moment of blood' is when John Boyega realizes that his fellow Stormtrooper is indeed flesh and blood, however, there are no indications that all these billions? of people being blown away, even though it looks so clean and spectacular, you know using the power of the sun to annihilate planets, are indeed people... This said, annihilating billions is a SF trope (see Dune, etc.) and the real problems with this film lie mostly elsewhere. Disney can make great films, using its name or one of its subsidiary studios but this film, which I am sure has already spawned many video games, was made to make money big time, and little else. Which is disappointing."
2449,3,The power of advertising and nostalgia,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (known in Spanish as Star Wars: Episode VlI - Awakening of force or Star Wars: Episode VII - Awakening Force) is an American film space opera genre. Released in the US on December 18, 2015.4 5 is directed, co-written and co- produced by JJ Abrams6 1 and is the seventh installment of the Star Wars saga, serving both the date astringent 1 and the internal chronology of the series then takes about 30 years after the sixth episode, Return of the Jedi (1983) .7 Thus began a third trilogy, which is added to the two already existentes.4 Produced by Lucasfilm and Bad Robot Productions (owned by Abrams) and distributed worldwide for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Awakening Force follows the struggle of King, Finn and Poe Dameron with the Resistance, led by veterans of the Rebel Alliance against Kylo Ren and the First Order, arising from Empire Galactic."
2450,10,Star Wars,"I've been reading a lot of criticism from what are clearly ""fans boys and girls"" who in my mind are desperately trying to relive the original trilogy's glory -- that ain't happening. This is a new story for a new generation, period. I stood in line as a 10 year old kid in 1977 for the original Star Wars, and walked out of the theater mesmerized and totally blown away. This will never happen again with Star Wars. Again, once people come to grip with this, they should enjoy this film."
2451,9,"Criticism of Film Wrong Headed, Here's Why","What is it with hollywood and all these remakes?<br /><br />I cannot understand how a whole industry has to be so out of ideas and ignore continuity. It's like if someone goes to Aldi for grocery shopping tomorrow and finds out that they are selling lawn mowers now only. It has no connection to their past however. I mean in the last Star wars the rebel alliance won and was restored to power. It is now again that the rebels are just that and at the mercy of an empire+ with the same old stupid death star idea. What is up with that?<br /><br />Also, enough with this substituting of men with women. really bored (Mad Max, Terminator, Star Trek...) 'idea.'<br /><br />I am a man. I will pay $$$ for flaunting beautiful leggy girls and that is it. But please don't shove your modernity on me."
2452,,I was on IMDB so decided to add my review,In my opinion the best parts of this were the character Rey and the great participation of Harrison Ford as Han Solo. I liked very much the part where Solo says the Force is real with the Jedi and the Sith!
2453,8,A great comeback of Star Wars!,"What can I say? That from my point of view,the movie is very good. However,I am a Star Wars fan. If someone who does not remembers things from other episodes,will watch the movie,she/he will not understand some things. From my point of view,it is a 9 movie. However,because of the things that are not explained for the newcomers,I only gave it a 8. I will not tell what is happening in the movie. You should go see the movie. And if you do not understand things in the movie,than watch The Phantom Menace,The attack of the clones,The revenge of the Sith,a New Hope,Empire strikes back and Return of the Jedi. I am waiting for the DVD to be released to watch it 2-3 more times,in detail ."
2454,8,"a very good movie,from a star wars fan point of view","Star Wars the Force Awakens a good movie, but all to familiar. Star Wars was definitely a well done movie, but it would have been much more impressive if it was the first of a series or a new world. Yet watching this movie felt all to similar too the previous six installments but with better cgi and green screen. I couldn't help but feel that this movie was only made to break box office records and bring in a significant amount of cash on the way. It makes me wonder why Hollywood can't just let something that is good rest in peace. What is the need for constant remakes and revivals of movie classics that survive on their own? In terms of the movie it was utterly predictable and I got a somewhat cheesy feel from the movies new heroes especially Finn. To me it felt like the same story as IV, V, VI but with different characters. It was also somewhat disappointing to see such grand heroes as Han Solo and Luke Skywalker old and grey, for me it took away from my remembrance of them as such great heroes in the previous movies. Now the reason I don't rate this movie lower then a 7 is because it still managed to provide a better thrill then the other blockbusters of this years such as the Hunger Games, Divergent series, and Specter. What I can say about this movie though is that it is top of the game sound and visual effects, expect Oscars nominations in both categories. Overall still a fun movie to relax and watch on a Sunday afternoon. 7/10"
2455,7,"Star Wars the Force Awakens a good movie, but all to familiar and predictable.",****Spoilers********
2456,8,The Start of something special,"I've tried to rewatch this for like the fifth time. It's a solid flick I would expect so much more effort from Disney. I think a lot of the problems are Disney's fault and not JJ Abrams from what I've read. I would have loved it to be longer like JJ planned because it already moves fast as it is . What bothered me the most when we watching was the dialogue it just seems so childish and so plain and so simple as if someone made it just for children and there was so much announcing the first scene with kylo could have been so much better if there was so much less said. Saying, ""kill them"" all the time and announcing it out loud something they do in Kenobi as well. Just feels fake and artificial. No crazy mass murderer even thousands of years into the future would announce things so boringly, so plainly, it's like the opposite of Reva lol. We just need a middle ground to keep things just ok people!. Kylo has very little character or personality but his dialogue is the worst. If you watch lots of serial killer shows or just any shows about a murderer they're either really silent, or really loud or really weird and it's like all he says is.... ""kill them"". Should have said nothing. It would have been much more realistic and felt much more scary I mean this is the first time meeting Kylo right? Kylo was awesome but the dialogue made him cheap and boring instantly despite how cool he was. It's as if you take a badass villain, the roughest villain you can think of , looks awesome, does awesome things, then when he talks he's like the LEVEL OF A THIRD GRADER? CAN WE AT LEAST MAKE KYLO TALK LIKE A 14YR OLD? HIS DIALOGUE doesn't work. The old man, lor van Tikka, also ruined it for me there's nothing worse than somebody with a heavy foreign accent trying to act and just saying all the wrong things and just PUSHING you out of the film mentally and reminding you that this is just a film I mean in the first scene? It's almost as bad as the 4 characters in ROGUE ONE. It just sucks you right out. I like the actor but his voice and the things he says are just bad again the interest should have had so much less dialogue. The next scenes with Rey are like that...and they are wonderful. You watch her slowly unfold. It's amazing. That's how this first scene should have been- less talking and more destruction so we can interpret it how we want. I've seen many amazing films that have very little talking that are just kind of laying the groundwork for everything. And though I love dialogue I'm a talker myself it just does not work in this first scene and really pulls me out of the movie and really makes me kind of laugh at Kylo when I definitely feel that this could have been the opposite I could have looked at him as a total badass."
2457,6,Tried to REWATCH for the 5th time.,** Spoiler Free** 
2458,9,Great film with some minor Flaws,"A good continuation to the Star Wars franchise. The scenes felt right, the space combat and effects were great, CGI was not abused and JJ Abrams managed to control his propensity for non stop Action to add a few subtle moments to great effect."
2459,7,"A worthy sequel, with some weak spots.",Spoilers follow: I've watched Star Wars 4-6 and I've enjoyed it tremendously.
2460,1,"Incredibly over-hyped, low iQ movie.","Following the CGI-heavy, storyline-light prequels (which I enjoyed but didn't 'feel') The Force Awakens is a return to what Star Wars is all about. "
2461,10,Back to proper Star Wars,"Yes, I think so. Nice to watch the film with an appreciative audience, there were cheers at times which added to the atmosphere. Lots of references/tributes to scenes in the originals, humour, beautiful jaw-dropping sets & backdrops, action a plenty. Its a new hope for a new generation. Wonder if the kids of today will still be watching in 38 years time like the kids of the 70's are today?"
2462,9,worth the wait?,*** This review may contain spoilers ***
2463,9,What a Fabulous ReBoot!,"WHAT I LIKED: A film with so much hype rarely lives up to expectations - but the 'The Force Awakens' exceeds them all. It's just truly amazing. Watch brilliant characters in a film that credits the originals whilst moving forward in the most exciting way possible. We've never seen a film that encompasses so much in terms of tone and emotion, that still pulls it off with such continuity and sensitivity. You can really tell everything was beautifully crafted by every hand in it's making; 'Episode 7' is beautifully acted, directed, scored and shot to the most incredible standard. But there's more to this than all those achievements, Abrams pulls off a movie that genuinely makes you feel every emotion. It makes you laugh, cry and despair, gives you chills and makes you grin from ear to ear. This is everything you wanted it to be and so much more more. Whether you're a Star Wars fan, or not - this is the must see movie of 2015. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The odd clunky scenes are there, and as with 'Episode 4' (which this film appears to be very similar to) the plot could be slightly more layered, and less bitty in terms of the way it is portrayed. Plus one small thing, Kylo Renn doesn't look remotely intimidating or torn without his mask. VERDICT: History is made. 'The Force Awakens' is a spine-tinglingly beautiful piece of film that does so much so sensitively. Star Wars is back, crowning Abrams as the new king of film."
2464,9,It's well and truly back,"Is a good movie, may be one es of best ones of 2015. But not a decent starwars"
2465,7,This an episode IV remake disguised as a new episode,"I personally loved this movie. I just saw the 6 previous movies this month of course... and compared to the other ones this one is a lot slicker. THE REAL REASON this movie stands out though is the chemistry between the main characters; I could FEEL the emotion of the movie, totally made me feel like a kid again."
2466,10,Really fun movie!!!,"I will not say the movie was bad, it wasn't, it fulfilled its purpose, it kept me interested in what I was watching"
2467,6,The old hope reawakens,"Nice plot, though perhaps a bit overly explosive. It showed disappointingly little of the Knights of Ren- even the trailers had more footage of them than the movie. It left few loose ends, though I find it a bit incredulous that the good guys are always successful in destroying superweapons in all the movies. Works well as a standalone film. I found the Rey-Ren duel at the end very satisfying. Solo's death was a bit weird, because I would not like for such a major character to die in the first film in the series. I also found Starkiller Base fascinating. Overly a suspenseful, exciting and captivating film, The Force Awakens will mostly not disappoint most film-goers."
2468,10,Very good,I'm not a big fan of the old E4-6 movies and i don't hate E1-3 as much as most do. Except of E1 all SW movies including E7 are on the same level for me.
2469,6,Entertaining,A Disgrace to Humanity! Only for the Immature Mind. Garbage! Insult to Intelligence! This is Not a movie. It is childish nonsense. Pure Crap.
2470,1,A Disgrace to Humanity!,If you are a sophisticated movie goer well wtf would you bother? Personally I tend to despise critically acclaimed movies because well they suck and are boring as hell.
2471,10,Great Movie,"""Not everybody is familiar with ""Star Wars"". But what happens if we try appease to both sides equally?"" Episode 7 is the answer to this question. The result is a highly plot driven movie, contextualizing original trilogy sentiment everywhere it can while using dialog as a vehicle, adding additional context for kids and people who don't watch movies that often. The biggest mishap though is that homage falls into parody at times. Almost any of director J.J Abrahams scenes have a undeniable nod to other movies while not really committing to their affect therefore lacking self-awareness and depth."
2472,,For the casual movie audience,Interesting movie I saw it in the cinema loved it ...................
2473,9,I loved it,The Good: 
2474,9,Was Great...but not flawless,"I was blown away, I came in expecting it to be an alright movie, but it was fantastic. I'll keep it simple; the first 2/3 of the movie were great. Excellent story, visuals, characters, script, everything really just felt natural. Abrams avoids references to the prequels like the plague."
2475,10,Return to the feeling of the OT,"Not quite what it was hyped to be (it was virtually impossible), but a decent movie nonetheless. It's basically a remix of elements from the classic saga, and with 3 movies worth of original material it feels a bit rushed, with each plot point resolving a bit too quickly and simplistically in order to make room for the next. It's basically the Jurassic World of Star Wars: identical plot and faster, larger everything. The best feature of the movie is that it does what everyone else should and pretends the prequels don't exist (it's also better for the plot to pretend that humanoid life span is longer and memory shorter). You think JJ's Star Trek relied too heavily on coincidence? Man you're in for a roller coaster of ""what are the odds"". Items and characters improbably converge from every corner of the galaxy with convenient timing. -DO NOT FEAR SPOILERS- Any plot twist spoils itself with blaring use of red flags anyway. NOTHING in this movie will surprise you. The only real spoiler of the movie: Kylo Ren is a wimp. Possibly the weakest Force User ever seen in the Star Wars Saga (the prequels feature younglings, but we're pretending they didn't happen) despite the movie spending the firs part hyping him up. Mark Hamill, for a voice actor, can surely say A LOT with his eyes."
2476,7,Finally a decent Star Wars movie,*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*
2477,10,"With the hardest job in the world, JJ Abrams.. I salute thee","After waiting so many years, the last thing you would want to see, it's that they made a mess of the movie, and unlike many people I don't think that happen with this one. Hear me out. "
2478,7,Not so bad,WHAT A TREMENDOUS REBOOT OF THE MOVIE SERIES!
2479,10,Go. See. It.,I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life.
2480,7,A Good Start... With the Comfortable Feeling of a Worn-In Pair of Shoes,"If you never saw a Star Wars movie, then you could find this movie fun to watch, despite its shallowness and flaws. If you see this movie while really, really high then you might think its great. If neither of these conditions apply, then prepare to be disappointed."
2481,3,A lower quality remake disguised as a sequel,"What a way to resurrect the franchise! TFA is a perfect mixture of nostalgia and modern Sci-fi. Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams, Michael Arndt have done an amazing work as screenwriters. During the first quarter of the film, we're reminded of the original trilogy back in good old days. As the film progresses alongside some great bunch of dialogues and humor, TFA also has twists and turns and unexpected surprises in store. After watching the whole movie one can not help but marvel at the epic writing(and maybe cry a bit too)."
2482,8,Perfect balance between the old and the new,"I probably would've rated this 10/10 back in 2015. I absolutely loved TFA and saw it multiple times in the cinema and bought it day one on Blu-Ray and watched it multiple times again. In 2020, my rating slips to an 8/10, mostly because the hype has subsided. The Force Awakens is still a fantastic Star Wars film, which is made even more fun and satisfying now knowing what we know now about where certain characters stories end up going across the trilogy. The set piece involving the Falcon and some TIE Fighters on Jakku is truly one of the biggest highlights of the trilogy, it captures everything that made Star Wars so magical to begin with whilst being shot in a modern, engaging, visually stunning way. It's not without its flaws, which you can go discover for yourselves, but SW:TFA is such a fun sci-fi rollercoaster ride that you have to experience."
2483,8,The best of the Disney Star Wars films!,"I love the first Trilogy. Star Wars was great, Empire even better, and Jedi is really good too if you don't take this a your whole life. The prequel trilogy had too much CGI filler and were a mess except for Revenge of the Sith. The Force Awakens however, is a very good movie and an important movie. The characters are good and they have a lot of interesting cliff hangers on purpose. The mythology is solid and interesting and is nice to see the old crew with some great new characters. The main character here,Ray, is one of the most interesting and likable characters in the saga. It's important because it got away from CGI and digital filming and instead used practical effects and was shot on actual film which gives it a more realistic look. For those who see similarities to A New Hope, the story is different still with some things being similar but the characters and the setting and where the force is and the cliff hangers that they set up are all new and exciting. This is the 7th movie after all, it is impossible not to be similar after a while. This better than a few Star Wars movies and a very important film that went back to grounded film making"
2484,9,"Shot on Film, Practical Effects. Great Beginning to Trilogy",So going in I had a ton of reservations I thought the movie might suck but I knew of JJ's record the man hasn't failed us yet. All things considered. The movie hits a lot of nostalgia centers in the brain as far as coincidence and providence between the new trio of characters.
2485,9,Beautiful movie... this is what the prequels should have been. JJ the GAWD...,"Movie is OK.., not bad... very good 3d nice quality of filming and nice visual effects, but i am little disappointed... Story is problem... I think the actors John Boyega and Diasy Ridley not perfect for this role.., special John Boyega... Finn (John Boyega) can t fight with Kylo Ren two or three minutes with light saber he is son of Han Solo and princess Liah... who is Finn??? he does not know anything abut force... Rey must learn how to run... she is beautiful but she don t know run normally.... Film is call ""The Force Awakes"" but I I did not notice to much FORCE..."
2486,7,We IS force....!!!???,"One to four stars? I don't think so. I think fans of the books may be upset that this doesn't follow that cannon. Since I'm oblivious to the books, none of that mattered to me. The first spoken line sums up how I feel about this movie: ""This begins to make things right"" And TFA does just that. Heart. Humor. and Fun!!! Fun characters, lots of visual candy. Not too much CGI. "
2487,9,What's up with the bad reviews - This movie is FUN!! Like the originals.,Basically a remake of a New Hope. Some great acting from some quality actors. New light saber seems a bit daft and impractical. Great locations chosen for filming and I liked the original characters and actors being a big part of it.
2488,7,Good but not great.,This movie was not all that I expected it to be.
2489,9,Star Wars for a younger generation,"I won't spoil you, of course, However, this film will spoil you, and in many ways, specially if you are a long standing fan of the franchise. It breaks from tradition, from Canonical standards and from the inner logic long associated with the generally accepted core of its narrative. J.J. Abrams as well as Lucas, relentlessly teamed up with Disney to create a botched, pseudo reboot, that has so many flaws -I think- that it'll take at least a far, far away voyage, to a farthest galaxy to amend. However, this is not intended to deter you from watching it and enjoy its undisputed technical prowess and magnificent graphics. Go, watch and know! However, for the new or emerging fan this film may well will be a good introduction to the incredibly detailed and intricate Star Wars Universe, albeit from a new start and fresh interpretation of its Canon."
2490,6,"Not so bad, not so good, above average but below expectations","I had high hopes for this movie given all the advertising and hype about it's release. Yet when I watched the movie at first glance it seemed all action packed and well balanced, but I soon realized this movie had the same plot as the original Star Wars, only different characters. It was nothing more than a ripoff! Many people for some reason ignore this which is clear to me given its high rating of 8.4 at the time of this review. "
2491,3,A complete ripoff of the original Star Wars.,"The Force Awakens is just... wow. It was a fantastic re-entry into the Star Wars franchise. The opening scene with the assault on the village is just amazing, straight away you know you're back in the Star Wars universe. All of the cast, (old and new) are brilliant. This film provides a great way to bow out one of the most iconic SW characters of all time. Han goes down trying to do good, compared to when he was a runaway, scruffy looking nerf herder in episode V. All of the original cast look great for their age, and remained true to their original roles. The new cast are great too, this film provides a brilliant gateway for the new cast to start taking over. Overall, I give this film a 10/10, and will definitely be watching it again."
2492,10,The nostalgia is strong with this one.,"There are a lot of reviews on IMDb that do not hold The Force Awakens in good stead. Many have to do with it being a remake of Episode IV. But how is using (many) tropes and old themes a remake? After all is not Star Wars based on Joseph Campbell's ""A Hero With A Thousand Faces"" who's very core concept is the idea of a shared type of story? The myth? Now, some will go into specifics of how The Force Awakens goes beyond that (""a droid on a mission..."" ""Desert planet..."") but I see these as the tropes and the echoes of the past - not as a copy. To me my biggest worry with The Force Awakens was a remake of Episode IV. But I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't feel like that. Because while the skeletal framework of the narrative was similar, it didn't feel like the same story. "
2493,9,Echoes and Enjoyable,"The long awaited Star Wars 7 was a massive blockbuster hit. People flocked to the theaters to see this movie. I was one of them! The hoots and hollers throughout the crowd showed that this was an astounding movie. JJ Abrams delivered with a great plot, revival, and cast. Some critics state that this movie was a remake of IV. I believe they are similar, but the differences are what set them apart. This movie was a great revival by introducing the First Order and the Resistance as well as some new characters. The diversity of the cast as well as old members being brought back combine for an incredible set of characters."
2494,9,JJ Abrams steps up big in revival of Star Wars,"Certainly this as any movie can be picked apart for some details, but this was very entertaining. The acting was great from most, especially the new cast members. Harrison Ford was excellent as he usually is. This was very pleasant considering Hayden Christensen performance was in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith."
2495,9,Excellent addition to the franchise,"Edit-- Went with my original title. Originally put ""A New Hope"" because felt my title was harsh, but not anymore. Also saved my newbies rant for the end. --"
2496,6,The Forced Awakening,"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is, many ways, very similar to the 1977 Original that captivated a generation and became a global phenomenon - a raucous, joyous ride through the galaxy. While the return of old faces (Han Solo, Leia, C3PO,R2D2) stirred the nostalgia bubbling in the hearts of many, The Force Awakens truly succeeds in it's new faces, particularly the characters Rey, Fin, Poe and Kylo Ren. Not to mention the bumbling, lovable BB8. The story beats echo the films that spawned it, but The Force Awakens restores the fun and energy that was sorely lacking in the prequel trilogy, and sets a new generation of Star Wars fans up for what hopefully will be a return to glory for this beloved franchise."
2497,9,The Force has truly Awakened,"there are not much things that I would want to say but review requires to say... where to begin? obviously as most of you I grow up on original trilogy, and of course they are the best. Yes, it was more closer to original trilogy than prequels, maybe too much.. but does it mean better? I found it weird that J.J Abrams said it will not have connection to comics, but it had but with minor changes, I do not see a point in it, okay, major thing I did not like in movie, main antagonist is wimp,I had feel that I could beat him up, all movie was about developing characters for the next movie, not in this movie itself, so I feel little disappointed, with minor changes it could be the best (after original trilogy), Star Wars is all about light side vs dark side battle, but if the movie has lack of it, I start to think that prequels were better in this way, I would say 6.5/10, directors please listen to real fans and do not make same mistakes."
2498,6,one but BIG flaw,"I have seen all the Star Wars movies, and I have never really gotten into them. Then, I saw the trailer to The Force Awakens, and I got really hyped up top see this. I saw this Thursday night with a friend, and it was packed, which was great, being how many people who were die- hard fans were in there as well. This movie made me LOVE STAR WARS. The characters were great, the story was well written and beautifully directed, and the overall movie was AMAZING! The entire audience, including myself, clapped at the end of the film. I honestly feel as if this film 'awakened' a part of me that made me love the series and look forward to the others. I honestly might go see it again once it cools down at the theater."
2499,10,"Awesome Movie, Coming from Not a Big Star Wars Fan","It was very hard for me as an adult to take this movie seriously, being that it's mostly a rehash of the original 1977 Star Wars but with a severe Mary Sue case."
2500,6,A Loving Tribute? Or Maybe Just a Rehashed Version of the Classic Fairy Tale,"A sequel carries story line from its series, but maintain events of its own. This one has fragments of everything that are scattered all over. No single events can really grab the heart."
2501,2,The force of irresponsible scripting and directing awakens,"THAT film is damn good... hey! I know I can see some remake, who cares... how-f-- king-ever, there is a within a reason for that. there will have explanations in next two films...(account of remaking FEW)"
2502,10,For those losers who rated those low numbers of stars,"We can all admit to the disappointment that was the prequel trilogy, the opener to the brand new trilogy is a big hit, and a great film even though it follows closely to the plot line of the original film, a new hope."
2503,8,"A solid film, bringing new life to the franchise","I really enjoyed watching SW ep. 7 at launch, the air of excitement of watching a new Star Wars for the first time in 10 years was brilliant."
2504,9,A great addition but quite an obvious episode IV plot copy,"At long last we have been given a Star Wars movie that takes full advantage of what the universe has to offer. JJ Abrams has shown that he can handle a movie of this kind and balance all the elements that makes up the movie. I was, more or less, at the edge of my seat from start to finish, since I didn't want to miss the story when it really kicked off. And the movie kept me in suspense in a brilliant way, so that I never had a moments rest, and thus was fully entertained from start to finish. What really made me happy to see was that lots of the problems found in previous movies wasn't a problem here. In episode 1 - 3, it bothered me that the special effects had taken over to such a degree, that any story and acting was strangled. This is not the case in TFA. Here the effects are balanced so that, there are enough to blow you away, but tempered so that the story shines through and the actors get to show what they can do. In episode 1-6 we mostly see either under- or overacting. Of course some did a great job. It was a joy to see a movie where the acting was as it should be. In short, JJ Abrams has made the movie Star Wars fans has deserved and waited for."
2505,10,The best Star Wars movie ever!!!!,THE GOOD:
2506,7,There is some good and some bad,"I personally unlike most of these horribly negative reviews, enjoyed this movie; it has it's flaws, but it's a solid movie. My only complaints are that this is the third death star like object been destroyed by rebels, it's following the old movies very closely, too close to be honest, I sometimes found that Kylo Ren sounded a little cheesy sometimes, and that some scenes with Kylo Ren seemed unintentionally comedic, on the positive end, it has pretty good acting, no major plot holes, and it's doesn't have Jar Jar in it."
2507,8,"Not perfect, but a fun film.","I have given this film a tentative 7/10. It is watchable and does have the feel and look of a true Star Wars movie. Having just re-watched the first 6 episodes before seeing this film. (Like all good fans would have done) I went through again, the despair of wishing Jar-Jar Binks was digitally removed and replaced with a real character, to just feeling a little disappointed, but glad of the improvement in episode III. Watching Episode IV it is always time to relive your childhood moments and the wonder that was embedded on a young mind. But actually, if that movie was released today, it would have nowhere near the love and following it holds in our rose tinted minds, it is clear that Lucas' direction is lacking, but the idea and special effects of the time, meant that was never a problem. Episode V stands alone in the whole collection and is as good today as it was then. Kershner is the reason why. Episode VI just brought a conclusion to the story that was needed. "
2508,7,Force Forsaken or are we about to be enlightened?,"Let me start by saying that if you haven't seen The Force Awakens yet, and are a Star Wars fan; why the hell are you reading a fan-boys' review of it? Go see it – now – it is GOOD! Everyone knows about Star Wars, and everyone knows that there were massive expectations for this to be THE Star Wars sequel the whole world was waiting for. Sois it? Short answer: Yes! There is almost nothing here we haven't seen before, but it still manages to feel fresh and up-to-date."
2509,9,A New Hope - MKII,"I felt a lot of anticipation for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as the trailers showed and promised plenty of action and drama."
2510,6,almost worth the wait!,JJ you had me worried you would not come close to the originals story telling or its mythology and would ruin much of the magic behind star wars even thought you might make wookies talk in English.... and I was .... not surprised the film was a total flopp it sucked it lacked all the creative genius from the other two sagas... and just threw nostaliga all over us and made us choke it down and call it star wars.... the force did not awaken the force sunk deeper into a coma with this lastest installment with a complete remake of a new hope with a gender swap and a few terrible other moments shot on film and put into a show.. I feel as if the star wars we all knew and loved is dead and died with george when he sold the rights... kind of un willingly... and then Disney the biggest global Nazi company in the world... bought it I already had nightmares on what was to come... and my fears came true.. it did not lead me to the dark side but to a whole another side... a losing side... the movie falls flat with no real suspense or action everything kinda makes no sense and what does make sense makes even less sense later... Much of the rules george wrote for the star wars universe were broken in this movie too so its hard to find any redeemable qualities when it was made soo poorly with almost zero respect for the source material and its fans... I feel like only reason it was a box office successes is because all the kids and families going to see it.. not because it was actually good in any form of way.. I hope JJ quits and lets someone more creative take over... and Disney loses the rights then I would know things are right again... At least we have the originals and the clone wars anime to make up for this!!!!!! JJ you are the sole representation and Incarnation of Hitler and the nazi army! parterning with Disney and making this atrocious film!
2511,1,A new Hope turned into a New Nightmare!,"the Force Awakens looks and feels more or less like a remake of the first original Star Wars. In a cinematic sense it was amazing, airborne fights were never this exciting in a star wars movie, light saber fights were never this cruel and threatening. It was an amazing experience overall. But the plot lacked so much, the story is more or less the same old star wars story; with a big weapon, pending doom and a last minute getaway. They could have incorporated the extended universe but has chosen to stay with the old gimmicks. I understand this if the movie was targeted to the new Star Wars fans, but with all the references to the old movies it feels like a fan service for the dedicated audience. Kylo Ren was a major plus. His youth, power and anger are all on the screen at all times. His conflict in mind with Han and Rey was brilliantly displayed (if not too obviously). I'm waiting to see how Rey's character is going to grow in the next movies, I have hopes that this series will be amazing."
2512,8,Loved it. But most of it was nostalgia boner.,This is a very good film.
2513,9,Very good film,__________________________SPOILERS FOLLOW___________________________
2514,10,Not an angry review,"This is a very good movie, a fantastic work by JJ Abrams and his crew. This film is mainly focused to ""reboot"" the series and to create a new generation of fans as well as bringing back the many fans the franchise has."
2515,10,Great Movie (For Star Wars and Sci-Fi Lovers),"It was a great movie, four of my predictions came true and they did take many elements from the expanded universe but over all it was just amazing and I had tears at many moments. This movie builds up the hype for the next episode so much. If things go well episode 8 will be really better than this one, for anyone who knows points from the expanded universe can easily predict this movie, like the story of Kylo Ren could be predicted years before the movie was announced but for someone who has no idea of the EU then of course it must be a thrill for them, good movie over all but please no more super weapons, tired of that. My complaints about the movie are. 1. How come the remnant of the empire become so strong? 2. How come there were no star destroyers protecting the star killer weapon. 3. The new republic didn't start any military to counter remnant threats all these years?"
2516,6,"Good, played safe but not perfect.","The long awaited saga continues, led by familiar faces and new allies. The Force Awakens sets the tone for the next chapter of a new regime of both the Jedi and Sith. J.J. Abrams takes the torch as we once again journey to galaxy far far away. Of course there will be mixed reviews from both the critics and the Star Wars faithful like myself, most of which have been favorable. However, as expected there are several perspectives and outlooks. For this review, I'll share my initial thoughts. Overall J.J. Abrams does a great job as he begins to carry the weight of almost a 40 year franchise that Lucas fans would show no mercy if failed. I believe it was smart of Abrams to give the storyline ""New Hope"" parameters. There were clear Episode IV parallels, like the mission centered on information carried by a droid, a rescue driven by purpose and love (initially) (Finn & Rey, Leia and Luke/Han), and the sacrifice of a leader (Han and Obi Wan). For some this was Abrams playing safe, but I think it was good for us to make connection to the past; it strengthens the purpose of the Star War principle. The screenplay is packed with great balanced of the characters we've come to love, along with new personalities to grow into like Finn's spontaneous comedic courage, and who can forget the adorable BB-8. My biggest issue would be Kylo Ren's screenplay. The childish tantrums he throws are absolutely unacceptable for a potential Sith Lord, it completely disrespects someone like Darth Maul, which we all know was gone too soon, but that's another story. I would also add, the premature revealing of himself with Rey was not smart, I almost would say it kind of devalued his character, especially seeing he's going with the whole Vader inspiration thing. I was somewhat OK with Han requesting for it to be off, but I'm really not a fan. I mean even Adam Driver's face looks teenage, so that doesn't help. Furthermore, there seems to be an accelerated plan for Rey's use of the force. For some Rey's engagement with the force might a little advance for only a brief talk with Maz, Luke wasn't nearly as advance in New Hope and he had Obi Wan's help. Nevertheless, it's not the ideal based on what we've seen in past experiences. Despite some of my slight issues with the film, I feel very confident in Abrams' direction for the remainder of this saga. The Force Awakens was a great film, worthy to be endorsed by the Star Wars faithful and those unfortunately new to the galaxy's greatest story. No one's perfect, so no one should expect Abram to be. I had my doubts, but Abrams pulled through, and he earned every bit of my 9 out of 10 rating, which I rarely give out as a respected critic. Besides we all know Lucas's eye isn't completely turned away from the project. He's a ""Blackbriar"" consultant for JJ. Thoughts?"
2517,9,The Force has Finally Awaken,"Spoiler Alert! No names named, but an inference to an event. "
2518,6,"I wanted more, and not in a good way","First, I'm going to mention that I will not add any spoilers here - although if you didn't see the movie yet it's very likely you've heard them somewhere else."
2519,9,Not in the same league as Revenge of the Sith but definitely good,"What can I say, I am a Star Wars fan as most of you ... but I am a bit disappointed. Star Wars had a story after the ""Return of the Jedi"", out from the films, comics, video games, and sadly this movie erased ALL of that. Call me a nerd, call me a classic fan, and call me a follower but all was wiped out in a story that maybe never happened. JJ did an acceptable job with Star Trek and I gave him a vote of confidence for Star Wars, big mistake."
2520,6,Yes is a new Star Wars world,"Remember the joke that did the rounds when we all found out Disney bought the rights? And a million nerds cried out at once! Well it turns out they were right to express their horror. This is no classic at all. In fact I left the cinema thinking ""Is that it?"". This is a far cry from when I left the cinema after Empire thinking ""Wow"". Now I appreciate I'm much older if not wiser but isn't a film supposed to wow you? "
2521,5,"A million voices cried out at once - ""Not Disney"". They were right.","The plot was identical to a New Hope. Painfully identical. The new characters were awesome; Finn, Rey, BB-8, Kylo Ren and Poe were awesome. We didn't need Han and Leia ruining the movie, they sucked. Luke was awesome. My biggest complaint is that the cgi was brutal. Snoke was just embarrassing, a poor man's Sidious. He could have looked super cool, instead he looked like a cgi nightmare. And that at-at at the beginning looked worse than any cgi in the original trilogy. Also, that talking orange who knew so much about the force somehow, was painful to look at. That Yoda puppet in the original trilogy looked a hundred times better. No more fan service, R2-D2 bullcrap, and more of the new characters, and this would have been a good movie. And another death star!? Come on! Throw me a bone here!"
2522,8,A really good remake of a New Hope,"Let me tell you something about the barely-thought out critics who ""ranted"" about this. They were just complaining the movie was a low-budget version of the classic Episode IV. Yeah, no. This is a brilliant movie! Sure, it has flaws and all, like Kylo Ren kinda acting like a wimp, and it's overused comedic humor because it's owned by Disney, but the rest of the movie was beautiful! "
2523,10,Brilliant start to a sequel trilogy!,"I gave this movie a 10. Loved it to be honest. Seen it 2 times already. The 2nd time you kind of pick up on things you may have missed the first time around. It is worth the watch if you ask me. If you have not seen the First 6 movies I would suggest you do to get a better understanding of the whole universe. I plan on seeing it again next year in January, then buying it when it is released!!! I thought there were also some pretty funny parts as well. Now I can't wait for the next episode to come out, I am sure it will be just as good!!!! So for the New Year take your whole family out for a treat and watch Star Wars together!!! Happy New Year!!!"
2524,10,Just Plain Fun!!!,First of all I will list the positives of this film and then the negatives.
2525,8,Good Movie Overall With a Few Flaws!!!,"I went to see the film that was a must see in December and in all honesty was shaking with anticipation as soon as the opening credits rolled. However this soon gave way to confusion as the film borrows heavily from A New Hope. A hero gives a droid a piece of critical information and the droid stumbles upon a person who can help them. Wow, the same plot to Episode IV. Towards the middle of the film, when Rey is given the light saber that once belonged to Luke, how was it recovered since it would be falling through the atmosphere of Cloud City. The new sith bitch, Kylo Ren was the whiniest little prick in the film. He has daddy issues, like Luke. And don't get me started on the new Death Star. I did like the part when Han and Chewie were back on the Falcon. Overall, it is the same as the original trilogy, just made for a new age."
2526,7,"Decent to start a new Trilogy, but it copies too much from the Original","I don't understand why people are putting 1's and 2's on this. They say it's a remake but it's barley alike with a new hope. The acting was great. I especially liked Harrison Ford in this movie. I also understand why they killed him. He had no character development left, and I think it was a smart choice. Adam Driver played a great Kylo Ren. Daisy Ridley just got better throughout the movie. The only dislike I have of the movie is that R2D2 was barley in the movie. Chewbacca was like normal Chewbacca, a total bad ass. Some people are angry that Luke wasn't in the movie, but I think is really helped out the story line. But overall, this one is going down as one of the greats."
2527,8,Equal to the originals,"At last an authentic Star Wars film where storm troopers die if you point a laser vaguely in their direction but they themselves can barely hit a barn door despite years of military training, Chewbacca still can't say his own name, and the droids are actually cuter."
2528,7,Why are the rebels so ineffective and rubbish at ruling the galaxy?,"So despite my high rating and recommendation to go watch the movie, i want to take this time to express some slight concern for the future of the franchise and i believe the problem if any could be JJ Abrams."
2529,10,"Great movie, heavily recommend going and watching this movie!",This was a decent movie but it was nothing spectacular in terms of story. There is nothing much fascinating about the plot. Visually it is great to look at. A lot of hardwork went into making this movie and you really see it in the sets and costumes and cgi. The movie itself did not surprise me or captivate me.
2530,7,Solid movie,"This is an entertaining film. Sadly it's forgettable, I don't pay to see another New Hope, nor do I pay to see a rehash of the same old themes. I pay to enter into the star wars universe and wonder, be brought into the history, the mythology and see something a little more profound. On this is based my rating of the film. Not whether the effects were good (they were) or whether the soundtrack was good (weirdly I don't remember any music or any noticeable theme)."
2531,2,"Predictable, unoriginal and kind of annoying despite not being bored","Remember how the original trilogy was all about the lovable and believable characters? In the Force Awakens the personae dramatis return as central to the main story and they are extremely likable in both their character and performance. The new leads, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac and Driver offer stellar performances, quite unequalled by the cast in the original Star Wars. Ford's performance is as great as you would hope for. His hawkish eyes show youth and gravitas. And the best, remember how in the prequels no one was amazed by the world they found themselves in, or the events or troubles they were confronted with? How the CGI had turned them into wooden puppets on a green screen? In this movie everyone is amazed by the world they find themselves in. A real world of real locations, real sets, real aliens and real effects. Rey, Fin, Poe, Han, and even Kylo Ren can express surprise at the marvellous world in which they find themselves, indeed like the movie audience itself should. Indeed, the intended response of the audience is very well reflected in the characters' response. It's absolute genius, and also the hidden success of the movie. And perhaps more importantly, the quality of all the characters is itself a reflection of the social and emotional makeup of the general audience. Each fan will encounter his or her own alter egos in the characters on screen. With the curious, inquisitive and mysterious Rey looking up at the sky dreaming of worlds she expects never to visit. The gentle and knightly, yet playful and amazed Finn trying to do good but also fearful of the responsibilities and consequences it involves. The adventurous Poe, flying his x-wing like any fan would, screaming and cheering of joy. And of course, the ultimate fanboy Kylo Ren, wishing to be 'that bad guy', obsessed with the imagery of the Galactic Empire and Vader: a type of fan many are all too familiar with. The banter between Rey and Finn, Han and Chewie is heart- warming and extremely enjoyable, and as some moments sublime. The atmosphere of the planets, from warm to cold, from light to dark, all reflected in the characters' emotions and the tripartite structure of the movie. Screenplay is great and cinematography excellent. Williams' soundtrack is also markedly different from the prequels, and more akin to the original trilogy, yet also excitingly different, with themes and motifs now more attuned to the movies characters than events and topography as in the other episodes. They are recognizable and very much attuned to the emotional stages of the characters in the different acts. I was also hardly upset by the similarities to a new hope. These were superficial at best. It was enjoyable how the movie twisted, turned and played with themes and motifs from the originals in a surprisingly creative manner. The character stories, around which the movie entirely revolves, are entirely new and fresh. Rey's story has never been seen before in a star wars movie, or as a female heroine, in any other movie for that matter. A female 'Arthur' indeed. Powerful, but perhaps also tainted by past, present and future, and at some points frightened and unsure of herself. Traits which Ridley performs stunningly with her rendition of Rey. Finn's story is also completely new to the star wars universe, and plays into the classical and late classical theme of the 'good soldier' with chivalric qualities., which naturally contrast to but also play into Rey's independence. Poe is THE pilot. Of course, every fan boy's biggest dream is of course to fly an x-wing. He brings wit to the story, and his character was perhaps a bit underused. However his story and role in the saga is are as yet still unclear, and are perhaps intentionally left obscure for later episodes to fill in. Kylo Ren is of course the new saga's 'gate keeper', frustrating the quests of the main protagonists, barring their way and chasing them when they cross the 'boundary' represented by the light. He character as a villain is new and fresh. A hero of the dark, tainted by the light, the natural antithesis of Rey, the hero of the light. As for the obscure backgrounds to the story itself: the movie aptly manages to reintroduce 'lacunae' to the story which are meaningful and mysterious like they were in the originals. In the originals, the political backgrounds of the story- empire, senate and republic-, the character backgrounds to Vader, Luke, Leia, Han and Obi Wan were intentionally mysterious and little effort was taken to explain these to the audience. The prequels took some of that myth away by filling in the blanks, often badly. The Force Awakens reintroduces the original trilogy's 'myth-making' by intentionally leaving much of what happened in the 30 years between ROTJ and TFA in the middle. Such conscious use of omission and lacunae allows much room for audience engagement, who are invited to fill in those blind spots themselves, and imagine for themselves how the story, characters and galaxy might have developed to state in which they are depicted in The Force Awakens. The force also returns to its more mysterious properties as in the originals. No more midichlorians and pseudo-science here. The Force returns in its magical form so beautifully depicted in A New Hope and Empire. It is my hope that the anthology movies, books and other media produced by Lucasfilm leave something of that mystery intact, because it was the mystery and lack of backstory which made the world of the originals so engaging in the first place.The last minutes of the movie were marvellously mysterious and deliver a scene never before seen in any star wars film to date. It definitely left me wanting for more and I am already beginning to feel that the waiting for episode VIII will be unbearable. Star Wars is definitely back and it is beautiful!"
2532,10,Star Wars is back and it is sublime!,"The special effects were great. New r2d2 android is very nice. The one thing I will say is there was too much ""look at me .. look at me"" the token black storm trooper. I'm important. Can we have a black character without bending over backwards to make him/her seem important? I know you can't please everyone and it's just a movie. it just seemed like Too much awkwardly and unnaturally focusing on a fairly irrelevant character. Black storm troopers matter sure but what the bleep?? Affirmative action in the movies? Anyone else Notice that? Seemed so much on a irrelevant character to please black storm trooper fans. It takes away from the quality of the movie. But what else is new? When the token storm trooper doesn't get an academy award for best actor I expect to see Samuel Jackson throw a temper tantrum and storm the stage at the academy awards. Haha. Or better yet give him the academy award. He 'earned' it and surely 'deserves' it."
2533,8,Black storm troopers matter?,"So, naturally, this new instalment has generated a mixed bag of reviews... I can see why, but I'm a sucker for Star Wars, so slightly biased. "
2534,8,"Nostalgia, Amazing Sequences and a fantastic soundtrack.. It's Star Wars","I really enjoyed this film and was so happy to see a Star Wars film not just cgi like the prequels.the film had basically the same story as a new hope ,with the droid containing information that the villains wanted (that being a map leading to Luke Skywalker,who has vanished) but I don't care about that what I liked was the introduction to a whole new bunch of characters and having some old ones back for nostalgia. I like the way Kylo Ren will be back and can't wait the see more of Snoke.that is exactly what I wanted characters I was genuinely interested in. The last scene got me so excited for episode 8 and was kind of glad that Luke was in no trailers on promotional material ,as it was so much more exiting seeing him for the first time In the actual film. Episode 7 did what I wanted it to do get me back into Star Wars after those terrible prequels ,it is a good start to a trilogy which I have faith in.only a year and a half till the next one."
2535,9,***this review might contain spoilers***,"Warning!! This review contains spoilers. This movie was a failed attempt to bring back memories and create something new. The new characters were a failure. A clone trooper with a personality? Storm troopers with gender? Rebel storm troopers? Just not right. Not Star Wars. The female copy&paste version of Luke was uninspiring. The acting was inexperienced and not fit for a Star Wars saga. Plus, she learnt alone in a matter of seconds how to wield the force, something that Luke, Obi, Anakin took a long time to do under the supervision of Jedi masters. How did she defeat a sith who had killed a whole team of training jedis with no lightsaber training and no knowledge of the force? Lets not get started on the horrible sith character. Epic failure in my opinion."
2536,6,"Good film, disappointing Star Wars","I saw it a few days after it came out, when all the craziness had passed. And I have to say that I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Even though it has some points of improvement."
2537,8,"It did the franchise right, but as a single story it wouldn't be enough.","This movie was not what I expected. Of course this is a reboot, but it offers nothing new. Huge plot holes and a sith that is not worthy of the title.. I do not need mentioning the plot holes as so many before me have already done so. I came out of the theater disappointed. 2 days later I'm thinking that is was just fine. The film looks beautiful and it has the old school Star Wars vibe."
2538,7,"disappointed at first, OK with it now","I liked this movie. I liked it as much as the original trilogy. It was WAY better than the prequels. I thought that George Lucas would never understand the mistake he made in the first place. But I was wrong, This movie was fantastic."
2539,8,"This is a good movie, stop being so over dramatic.","the PC-ness of the current Jedi films, is a bit overwhelming. if you don't have "" Diversity"" in the cast, it gets blasted by idiot critics. how about just casting competent people, and not worry if its a ""Rainbow coalition"" of actors..?? I was seriously underwhelmed by most of the top billed actors, they don't ""grab"" your attention, the action does. Ewan MacGregor was a wonderful Kinobi.. Daisy Ridley.. John Boyega,, sorry, neither of them really shine like a Nova in the films.. passable, yes, palatable.. maybe.. but, worthy of carrying the likes of these films ?? not remotely. shoot me for wanting SOLID people in a Sci Fi flick of this import... Adam Driver as Kylo Ren... even his character is still a bit ' out to lunch"".. for someone who is to be a major Menace to the entire galaxy, he seems like less of a threat than your local security guard in the alien bar in Mos Eisley space port.. just way to much money available to have gone after better fits.. I would rather see Denzel Washington as Kylo Ren, or some other major character, because he is GOOD.. maybe Timothy Oliphant, or Anson Mount, or a whole HOST of others from other Sci Fi films.. even Channing Tatum could fill Boyegas role better, and be more believable.. sorry, just a good film now, not the Epic one for the next 30 yrs it should have been.."
2540,7,it should have been epic....,"This review ""contains spoilers."" Let me start off by stating that I am a gargantuan Star Wars fan. The first flick my parents took me to see was ROTJ. I rather enjoyed the prequels minus one Jar Jar. Goerge Lucas, to me, is a genius and an innovator. I, like many people who are fans of this epic space opera franchise could not wait to see The Force Awakens. But then I went to see The Force Awakens and COULD NOT BELIEVE what the hell I was watching! Here are the problems with this so called Star Wars movie:"
2541,1,Star Wars? You Are Mistaken,"I frankly do not understand why or how other viewers may have noted so poorly this chef-d'oeuvre. I have watched all episodes of the Star Wars franchise and as per my view point this one is ranked at the 4th position after A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi respectively. Why?"
2542,8,"A good one overall, awakening of the Force","First of all, I'm not getting these 1 star, terrible reviews. I believe you need to judge the movie primarily by how it develops from the original tone of this film, not by how you feel it's supposed to be. I mean really, some of you people are total cranks and snobs. "
2543,9,"Very good SW film, better than all of the prequels and ROTJ.","The Star Wars logo flashes onto the screen, complimented by John Williams' powerful, instantly recognisable soundtrack. The introductory fanfare."
2544,8,The Force Awakens - a complete review.,"Yes, there are similarities with other SW movies...but what else would the Empire do but build a new superweapon?"
2545,9,Good Re-Start,"7.5 out of 10 for me. It's a good not great movie. The story is better than the screenplay. The casting is superb. Everyone shines, especially the two young leads John & Daisy. It is thrilling, emotional, and feels important without taking itself too seriously. All in all, a good start to the new trilogy. My only two gripes are how Kylo Ren was written which I find a bit weak. The character did not seem scary and mysterious like Darth was. And no detailed back story was provided. My second gripe is about how predictable the biggest plot point in the movie was to me! I could see it coming from miles away."
2546,7,The Force is mildly strong with this one!,"It was a great movie. It was very similar to The Original Trilogy. One negative I have is that some plot points were very similar to A New Hope. Leia and Han are great in the movie as are the newcomers. There are many unanswered questions that hopefully the next movies will touch on. I hope for the rest of the trilogy they try and make it their own, and not completely like the OT. I can't wait to see where they take this story and I do hope that the future directors will take the reins more and make their own vision as well, instead of playing it safe. Overall, There is never a dull moment and there is so much action and drama. You will remain processing what happened for quite a while."
2547,10,Fast Paced,"It was just incredible to watch again the Star Wars fan fare at the big screen (I must admit that I cried a little bit). My expectations for this film were HUGE and at the end, I just felt that this movie is more a remake of ""A New Hope"" than a continuation. Is like a Star Wars knockoff with the epic return of our favorite characters from a galaxy far far away..."
2548,7,"Good Movie (although it feels like a remake of ""A New Hope"")",I really enjoyed this movie.the only thing that I hated was that Han Solo died that moment literally brought tears to my eyes.the effects in this movie were fantastic.i thought how they brought back the old characters was just perfect.and how they had introduced the new characters to the old characters was awesome.i loved a lot of the references in this movie.the relationships between certain characters was too good.but don't see this movie in 3D because there are no 3D scenes.But IMAX with this movie makes you feel like you're in the movie.therefore I give this movie 10/10 so I really recommend that you see this movie because trust me it's not like the prequels.
2549,10,Best Movie Of Last Year,"The main point I want to highlight was the unconvincing dialogues, and a forced feeling of some characters. He forced the bar too hard. I was a bit disappointed. I'm still a big fan, but I hope the next few films are a bit more careful about it. There's no use of so many special effects if the characters' dialogues and emotions are not up to par. And please, stop the cliché of everything in the last second, by an inch, by a triz. This is already extremely predictable. My modest opinion, from a big fan. I hope I have helped."
2550,6,unconvincing dialogues,"'A special effect is a tool, a means of telling a story. A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.' - George Lucas "
2551,5,I wish I hadn't seen it,"First movie of the new trilogy, you'll have unanswered questions, that's obvious. Despite what some people are saying this movie does not contain ""plot holes"", you can't say that when this is just 1 of 3 movies, it simply doesn't make sense when people say this movie has plot holes. Now, a full original history, nope, it does resemble a lot of the original movie but that's a good thing in my book. The movies has a perfect balance between the use of CGI and props, that means a lot to me. Its atmosphere is darker and felt a bit more serious than the kid's show Lucas call ""prequels"". A screenplay that doesn't make you cringe and beautiful scenes with excellent music."
2552,10,Watch the Movie with an Open Mind,"As somebody who grow up on watching movies with my family, I am always looking for great movies to add to my collection. In order for me to purchase a movie it has to have a great plot, interesting characters, believable actors, stand up to the hype, and with some crazy back story, for bonus points. I enjoyed Star Wars 7 so much I am going to buy it on Blu Ray."
2553,9,a great movie,"I admit,when I went to see this I was a bit scared.Everybody was waiting for the new Star Wars movie and the expectations were unspeakably high,so I was afraid that it wouldn't stand up to them. I am glad to say that I was proved wrong.This movie brilliantly manages to give you the same sensation the original trilogy gives.It looks like Star Wars,it feels like Star Wars.It's definitely not a perfect movie,that is certain,and I see many criticizing it,more like nitpicking it,for its similarities to episode IV,but despite these similarities it feels like a brand new chapter.Regarding the usual complaints about this movie:"
2554,9,"Star Wars is back,simple as that.",It's strange........
2555,8,"Entertaining! Not really a review, more of a comment",I am huge Star Wars fan and was expecting a lot from this film. I have to say that I was afraid a little bit because George Lucas wasn't doing this movie and my fears came real.
2556,6,Different Star Wars?,I remember going to watch A New Hope In '77 with my Dad.
2557,9,Feel like I'm 7 again. Pure magic for me,"Don't let my 8/10 rating mistake you into thinking this is objectively a very good film. I am fairly new to the Star Wars saga, I know the basics as in the major characters and their simple relations to each other with further sparse knowledge on what the Force is/does. Other than that, I am a complete noob having only seen The Phantom Menace when I was 10."
2558,6,"Good film for newbies, mediocre for die hards","The movie is very fast paced and the story line/characters are a bit (tiny bit) hollow. Let's face it, it is a sci-fi family friendly movie as it should be. Some of the negative reviews are just a matter of people being fans of the franchise too long and expect too much out of it (especially this being the first movie)... It is a very entertaining movie."
2559,8,Why not?,"The Star Wars franchise has, at this point, been so deeply rooted into my social conscience that it is hard for me to give this movie a fair, objective review. I'm sure many fans feel the same way: we want to be excited at the prospect of a new beginning (a new hope if you will) for the series, but are unsure if there is a way to revive it to its former glory. The Force Awakens hits a lot of those benchmarks, but falls just short of being among the best films in the series. "
2560,7,Out of the slumber,So.... um. Firstly i want my money back. OK let me break down my EXACT feeling through the movie...
2561,2,What the Actual F.CK,"Characters feels REAL, ALIVE, COMPLEX and fun to watch, opposite to episodes 1-3. I did not know what to expect when Disney bought franchise, but they and Abrams succeeded. Very strong start to new series of Star Wars films. This movie was also very good in 3D, opposite what I experienced when watching for example Hobbit. "
2562,10,Star Wars is back,"I I love the new star wars because J.J. Abrahams has deep and honest relationship with the characters form the original trilogy and with the force as a concept. You can bitch about the ""rip off plot""(Episode 4) but I did't mind when Georgie did that in episode 6. You can cry about the lack of Creativity but i would have to call you naive. You can call it nostalgic (and therefor bad ) but why would you watch a Star Wars movie if you are not into nostalgia. I fell in love with the new Star Wars for the little things the same way i fall in love with my wive for the little things again and again even thought she she is mostly the same every day."
2563,10,Amazing *Spoilers*,The film entertained me from beginning to end. Although not perfect I feel I can forgive the misgivings that I have. The new characters all fit in well. The moments of humour were well placed. There were a couple of lightsaber moments that I thought were too graphic. My concern before seeing the film was that the story would be too unoriginal. And it is. I was surprised by how much it repeats what has been done before. Personally I forgive it because I feel it sets it up for the movies to follow. I was hoping the film would not finish where it did. It is an annoying ending. But one that makes me want to know what is going to happen next. Hopefully the story will now move on from what has gone before.
2564,9,A great return to the Star Wars universe,Lets be honest. 
2565,9,Please ignore the bad reviews. This is a very good movie !,"Star Wars Episode VII : The Force Awakens, directed by JJ Abrams, has its flaws which can quite obvious at times, but the film makes up for it in every other way. "
2566,7,Flawed but highly enjoyable,"The Star Wars Prequels are probably one of the most divisive items of popular culture. Much derided by fans and a good many critics, the prequels haven't aged as well as their predecessors. Some of this is because of bad storytelling, or then-innovative but now shoddy looking CGI and an overuse of green screens. Needless to say, the prequels haven't aged well for me as a fan of Star Wars. I still harken back to the original trilogy for its hokeyness, its fun and its good storytelling. Yoda's reveal is still one of my favorite moments in American film. It's something that is such a classic thing to do in myth and legend, but still manages to send chills down your spine when it happens. The prequels had so few moments like these that were enthralling and rewarding that I eventually stopped watching them altogether."
2567,8,A Great Film That Promises More,"I enjoyed this movie a bunch!! I feel that this film captured everything we loved about the previous star wars films and added some new stuff!! Though, as you may have seen in other reviews, it's not a perfect film. "
2568,7,"It's not groundbreaking new cinema, it's not a steaming pile of poop...It's Star Wars!!","The Force Awakens was an amazing star wars movie . Its the beginning of a new chapter . Its how all beginnings are . After the movie ended i wanted more and there are more episodes coming soon ! I agree that the movie had a few unanswered questions but it is absolutely worth to wait for them to be answered . Its like when A New Hope released in 1977 , many answers were not told like who Darth Vader was or why does he always wear a mask etc . People were left on a cliffhanger after watching it and had to wait 3 years for the Empire Strikes Back to release which answered many questions . "
2569,10,I have felt the Force !,"Between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace, Star Wars fans had to wait what seemed like an eternal 16 years for a new entry in the iconic saga that has seduced millions worldwide. Although it had George Lucas again directing his creation, it is universally agreed that not only did the film not live up to the hype of almost two decades, it is also quite a lackluster one that messes with some very dearly regarded traditions that came from the original trilogy."
2570,7,A great even if familiar restart,"I had high hopes for ""Star Wars : The Force Awakens"" (SW7). Unfortunately, JarJarAbrams did was he often does, namely ""adopt, disrespect and destroy the work of others""."
2571,1,JarJarAbrams is the Sith who destroyed the Star Wars franchise,"I see that the last few reviews rip this movie apart, but I feel that they are just being hateful for hateful's sake. The negative about this film is that this film is a reboot of the original (A New Hope). Another negative part about his film is there are too many pieces of the original film in parts to be little reminders from the first three films. On the other hand, I think this film is more entertaining than the last three prequels. When it comes to the pro's of the film, it has a great cast. All of the characters are rich and entertaining. The movie was shot with real sets, which made it look real in comparison to the prequels, which were shot on green screen. Finally, this movie will give the new generation of children something fun to watch they my generation received, Star Wars fun. I watched the films at the theatres, I played with the toys, and I can't think of anything better to watch for a small child with a imagination."
2572,9,It's a very entertaining film,The movie has just one (big) problem: Han Solo died (?) - Did he? If so then part VIII and IX are dead before they even show up on the silver screen.
2573,10,"Excellent now, unsure about what is yet to come...","On the one hand I understand the frustration with plot. It would be wrong to overlook the obvious similarities with the original trilogy. However it is completely unfair to overlook the many brilliant aspects of this film. The special effects and the return to the practical effects takes you straight back to all that was good about the original films to mark the film as 1 out of 10 on these grounds alone is unfair. The new characters are all very good. They're not perfect but they were never going to please everyone from 5 years old to 70 years old. The look of the film and specifically kylo ren is brilliant. Remember this is a movie primarily for children. Its about aliens and space ships and sword fights! BB8 is a triumph and the updated storm troopers , and general detail is amazing. The older characters are solid remember Harrison Ford is 73!? I really enjoyed this film and whilst obviously there are many similarities as I said before it is so harsh to judge this on that alone."
2574,8,It couldn't be perfect,"Now first of all, this movie was a blast. I really enjoyed it, a must watch in theaters, and a worthy sequel. You heard that right a worthy sequel. Was it perfect? By no means! Did it fail expectations? Depends on your perspective. I, for one, can sum up this film in one word, ""satisfied"". As for the people who feel this resembled TOO MUCH of Episode IV, did you really expect it not to? A bit naive to not see Star Wars as a repeat in literally everything you see in it. It follows the same formulas, just as any other franchise you see around here. Now as for those who hated this movie but now ""like"" the prequels because they're ""original"" and adore Lucas' ""original story telling"" over J.J.'s recycling of plot points. Please, try to find the parallels between Episode I, II, and III to the Episodes IV, V, and VI respectively. I'll get you just started here with this link http://alexplorer.net/starwars/movies/sw-parallels.html and then you can find even more yourself, and you'll see what I see. Enjoy the movie!!!"
2575,8,For Those Who See Too Much Resemblance,"NO SPOILERS. I couldn't help but smile when the Lucasfilm logo filled the screen, and the main titles started rolling. This was the moment that millions of people around the globe have been waiting years for. A fresh start, a new director, no George Lucas (thank god), old cast, etc etc. This movie has to be amazing, right?"
2576,7,"Good movie, but nothing more.","A long time ago in a galaxy far away It really has been a long time ago if you are a Star Wars fan. The big question is ""Has the Force Really Awaken? Since the prequels?"", no puns intended. This movie starts with this big question and yet it left you with a sense of awes and discoveries. The biggest fears going into this movie for us are managing expectations, too much fan services, and the handling of the new characters. In delight, this film has diminished all of those doubts and fears and instill a new light into this new saga where JJ Abrams (the director) and Lawrence Kasdan (the writer of the empire strikes back) who brought back the nostalgia and magic of the original saga without compromising the plot of the film. There were so many positive points about the film from the castings to the practical effects which bring this movie to life. The movie team has done many things right, from marketing the trailer without spoiling the film to the last scene of the movie. Thus, leaving the audience wanting MORE after the movie is over. This is the beginning to new saga with characters whom you care about as the plots propel along. A point to be noted is that this is a fast pace moving film with enough exposition that keeps you entertained and informed throughout. Going back to the portrayals of the new characters Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver as Ray, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren respectively were very well executed and were given more than just role to play but role to be supported and sympathized with. The Force has awaken as the saga continues as it picks up where it was left off. In conclusion, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awaken is an excellent film and is highly recommended for not just Star Wars fan but for movie lover in general. May the force be with you."
2577,10,The Force Has Awaken,"The first thing I was struck by going in was how beautifully shot this movie was. I could tell that everything was crafted with great care and skill, and it felt really immersive. "
2578,7,"Gorgeous immersive visuals, uncharismatic characters, predictable tedious plot",This is my very first review and what compelled me to write it was the amount of unjustified negativism towards this movie (because you can't use as an argument facts that are purposely left open or things that you missed because you were on your cellphone tweeting about how awful the movie is).
2579,8,Star Wars shines once again,"In my opinion, this film is impossible to review objectively... Star Wars is so beloved and entrenched in our collective consciousness that there is simply no way this film could live up to our hopes/expectations. That being said... it is not bad."
2580,7,Impossible to review,SPOILERS Important information essential to the success of the rebellion is hidden in a droid. Once the information has been extracted from the droid it helps the rebellion in their mission.
2581,1,More holes than a sieve,"Despite the criticism, this film is a huge success. People will always be annoyed about how similar movies are but what they forget is that too much change is a bad thing.I admit, after watching for the third time just 2 days ago, I certainly feel there are a lot of elements of the original film and saga. However, none of the similarities are bad things. For Instance the plot of the movie is the same: 1. Droid has important plans to help the Rebels (The Resistance) 2. Bad guy is related to one of the heroes 3. Han Solo and the new hero save a girl from the Empire (First Order) 4. Rebels (resistance) blow up the planet destroying station and escape 5. Everyone lives happily ever after."
2582,8,Exactly What We Needed.,Star Wars fans are a very hard bunch to please. In fact I don't think you can please them...no wait...what pleases them is critisising Star Wars films. I thoroughly enjoyed the latest film and highly recommend it. Saw it on the big screen and can't wait to watch it again. Great visuals. Wonderful performances. My favorite part of the film is when Kylo Ren takes his helmet off. Not expecting that and I really hope the next films will explore this characters downfall. Having a sort of man boy as the villain who doesn't seem to be completely dark kept me guessing if there was going to be a u turn during the film. Can't wait for the next instalments and equally all the ensuing anger that will spew out of fans mouths.
2583,9,excited for what's in store next,"Don't believe the Haters. People have the right to not like the movie, but this is receiving some unfair hate. Let me start by saying that I a huge Star Wars fan. I grew up watching the original trilogy on VHS, I have read lots of Expanded universe books, watched the cartoons, played Star Wars video games, and saw all of the prequel's in the theater, but I don't think all Star Wars is great, I remember very clearly the disappointment I felt after seeing each of the prequels in the theater, and I have been disappointed by many other ""Star Wars"" stories, so I went into this movie with skepticism. But I was pleasantly surprised. Are there plot holes? Yes. Mistakes? Yes. Similarities to the original? Yes. But this is a great Star Wars story. Haters say ""It's a remake!!"" In its defense I would say go back an watch the original trilogy with an open mind. Are there plot holes? Yes. Mistakes? Yes. Bad acting? Yes. Poor dialogue? Yes. And let's be honest, George Lucas himself copied and ""stole"" from all kinds of things, including numerous old Sci-fi shows and westerns. The turret gun scene in ""A New Hope"" is a scene for scene copy of an old World War II movie with TIE fighters replacing the old planes. Some call it ""inspiration"" others label it "" plagiarism"" But it doesn't matter, we all loved it because it was our childhood, and we had never seen anything like that on the big screen. These days Hollywood lives on remaking, rebooting, and renewing with every blockbuster trying to out explode the next. The fact that is a ""STAR WARS"" sequel should clue people in. So to lambaste this movie for being ""unoriginal"", ""a lazy remake"", or ""a copy of the original"" is unfair. "
2584,9,People are unbalanced in their hate,"The Movie was Great, Amazing action, Stunning visuals, Ideal Locations But not many people have liked it, reason being the movie was much predictable, and probably not as exciting as the older versions like the original trilogy. For a star Wars fan it's hard to get over the fact that there's gonna be an episode made without the main protagonist Luke Skywalker. He was the main centre of attraction in the star wars Saga, he didn't have anything to do with the movie, Maybe he would with the next one. Secondly, (Spoiler) Han Solo died in the movie which means that the next episodes will be totally based on Rey, Finn, They would be the main characters as Luke would be in a role like Obi-Wan was during his older times"
2585,10,"May not be as great as the Old star wars, but it's promising and a lot to expect in the future","The force awakens: more family drama than an episode of Jeremy Kyle. When Disney took over the Star Wars franchise in 2012 many feared that Disney would regurgitate an un-original, cheesy, money-maker trilogy, much like the prequels of the early noughties. Although there have been some serious improvements in the last decade or so, ultimately the force awakens lacks the charm and grit of the original trilogy. "
2586,6,more family drama than an episode of jerry springer,"To Star Wars fans, not only is this movie an incredible homage but also regenerates the beauty of the universe to attract new fans world wide. All in all one of the best examples of a successful relaunch of a franchise movie.The Film begins in the same traditional Star Wars setting. The story itself progresses quite fast in a pleasing manor. The acting is superb, especially that of Daisy Ridley. There are many surprises inshore for Star Wars fans as well as exciting cameos surprise appearances for everybody to enjoy. After watching this movie the first time i was absolutely in love. I then had to watch it over and over again. With every time i re-watched the movie i found it managed to still peak my interest as well as shed light on specific details i had not notice the first time around."
2587,10,A must Watch!,"I enjoyed this movie, but I approached it with the same expectations one has when walking into a McDonalds joint. You're there for the junkfood, not for some fancy high- cuisine. Considering it's the 7th movie in the series, I wasn't really expecting some ground- breaking movie-making."
2588,6,"It's good, for a cheeseburger bought at MacGuffins","I have been watching Star Wars since I could walk, knowing the inside and out of every nook and cranny in the series. I, like many of you, adore the original 1977 release far more than the 1997, and despise of Jar Jar Binks. Honestly, the Phantom Menace should never have existed."
2589,10,"A perfect Star Wars, A cinematic Masterpiece","After the catastrophe known as the prequels, it seems that they have learned their lesson. I already here has to give a small spoiler alert. It is as if they went back, compared the original Star Wars to the prequels. My guess is it went something like this. We lacked characters and a plain plot. There was excessively use of CGI instead of practical effects. The light saber battles were too polished and well-choreographed and lacked raw emotion. The prequels took themselves too seriously and the there was a lack of the humor from the original films. Moreover, there was Jar Jar Binks Now, they have managed to create five new great characters (yes, I am counting the droid). In addition, they brought back the greatest due of all: Han Solo and Chewbacca. I especially liked the introduction of the characters in the film. So, characters check. Plot, good versus evil. Right from the start there is no doubt about who is evil and who is good. The film introduces this with the introduction of the characters. The struggle good versus evil, plot check. The practical effects of this are great, and I cannot say I saw any flaws with the use of CGI, maybe with the exception of the Emperor replacement. Cannot say I was impressed with him. But check again. The jokes were back, both with Han Solo and with the new characters. It made it enjoyable to watch the film. Check. I really enjoyed the light saber battles(s). Big check there. Finally, Jar Jar Binks or any other annoying thing did not show. Final check. However, it all seemed very, very familiar. The new characters were in fact not entirely new. The got much of the old characters in them. Han Solo was kind of Obi-Wan from the original films, the girl (Rey) was Luke, BB-something was R2D2, Pilot-dude was Hans Solo and so on. Furthermore, the plot was not just similar but the same as the first original Star Wars. In fact, multiple scenes, like the opening, were close to identical. I can mention more like the bar scene, introduction of Luke/girl (Rey) on a lost planet, storing important plans on a droid, death star as a planet, final battle with a flight scene down a tunnel, sneaking around and avoid storm troopers, death of old main character at the end. And that is just the top of my head, I could go on. This is a good Star Wars film and it is not a disappointment like the Phantom Menace. I enjoyed it. However, it lacks originality. It is practically a remake of the original Star Wars. There are a few deviations, which I hope will expand. For example, the bad guy got much potential for development. But it is without a doubt in my mind a safeing (probably not a real word, but you get the idea), something to satisfy the fans and give them exactly what they want. But, I have seen the original Star Wars, and I enjoyed them very much. I can see the original again if I want to. I want something new. I hope the following sequels will take more chances. Make new original stories. Try to develop independent characters, instead of copying the old. Unfortunately, the setup for the next sequel feels like a setup for the The Empire Strike Back again. With the girl going in for training and the 501-legion striking back. Hopefully I am wrong."
2590,7,Safeing,"when they announced that they gonna make a new star wars movie, a original story which dose not build on any expended universe material. Foolishly I assumed i gonna see a new star wars story. What they actually meant: We gonna do a low grade remake of the original, with some new elements, and mostly worst actors. "
2591,1,The last Star Wars film i bothered to see in a cinema,"I saw this movie today and I am definitely planning on seeing it again. I had hoped that this movie would be able to pull the franchise out of the hole that the prequels had caused. I think it's safe to say that it did. The characters, the action, the story, all of it was stunning. Not to mention the visual effects, but I'll get to those last."
2592,9,May the Force be with this Film,"This episode was basically saying goodbye to the loved old Star Wars characters and story and an introduction of the new guys. I think the reason why the plot is so similar to past episodes is because they're wrapping everything up to be able to start a new story. I loved it. (The new lightsaber was pretty cool, btw). I think the new two episodes coming along will be really good. I think once the original characters and story are retired we'll like it even more because we won't be trying to compare it to the originals. It's hard not to compare it but soon it'll be it's own thing. It still felt like Star Wars to me. Say goodbye and hello. It's a new story with new faces. It's the new Star Wars."
2593,10,"Possible spoiler? Out with the old, in with the new. Hello's and goodbyes.","I first went into the theater with a flicker of dismay in the back of my mind. I was reminded of the last three failed attempts at reviving the Star Wars brand and to my surprise I was wrong the movie was very different than any of the other films, yes many of the plot devices had gross similarities between some of the older films, but the emotions that Star Wars: The Force Awakens made the audience feel made it all worth it. It almost felt like the rehashed plot devices were justified, after watching the movie it feels as though Episode 4,5, and 6 albeit were great films they just never quite made you feel much for the entire galactic struggle quite like The Force Awakens does. Yes we all felt something for our favorite main characters but we never quite cared what happened with the resistance."
2594,8,Epic Tale Reimagined,"I bet most of you, giving this 1 star, walked into the theater with your minds already made up. I thought it had an interesting storyline, and I loved how they paid homage to the originals. I see people complaining ""it's like a cr*ppy remake"". Doesn't make sense to me. I think it's awesome they're bringing the old cast back, and it's been set up for, hopefully, a very good trilogy. Idk, I may enjoy stuff more and go easy on the criticizing/ speculate. They are usually the majority who bothers to leave a review. They like to vent and whine about all the little stuff. I think this movie has the potential for better written sequels. How anyone can compare this movie to Episode 1,2, or 3 blows my mind. Much much better, regardless."
2595,9,Look at all the butt hurt fanboys whining.,"Personally for me, Rey and Finn just don't seem like the kind of people who belong in the Star Wars universe. Whenever I saw them I couldn't think of Star Wars 100% and couldn't immerse myself in that universe, but whenever I saw Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2D2, and Luke, I thought and was immersed in the world and universe of Star Wars. Kylo Ren was OK, but an issue I have is how is he supposed to be Han and Leia's son when he doesn't even have the same hair color as either one of them? He has black hair and Han and Leia both have like light brown hair? The space battles were amazing though, I loved seeing Tie Fighters and X-Wings and whatnot again, THAT is most certainly Star Wars. Personally I would have loved to see George Lucas direct as well but what's happened has already happened. To sum it up, basically it was Rey and Finn who mainly gave me the negatives of this movie. I don't know if they just aren't the best actors or what, but they just have this look on their face that takes me out of the movie and makes me just see their actual selves, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, and not who they are supposed to be in the universe of Star Wars in this movie. They way they acted and spoke, and what they said (not all the time) just didn't seem believable and felt so un-star wars like for me, and yeah obviously what they said wasn't necessarily the actors fault, but rather the writers' faults. The movie just felt like it tried so hard to be a fan-service to general star wars fans and didn't try to feel like it was Star Wars and an actual movie. It should have tried to just be a natural Star Wars movie and then people like me would enjoy it, but one of the problems for me was casting Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. I wish episode 7 could have just been all about Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, Luke, C3PO, and R2D2. I guess maybe I'm just not a huge fan of young characters/people. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are too young and I think I prefer movies where everyone is at least like late 20s or at least 30 years of age. But again, this is just an entirely personal personal opinion."
2596,7,Can't compare to the original 6 and Rogue One,"As a child I grew up on the prequel movies, which were not perfect to any stretch of the imagination, and by the time I got to the age where I began to truly appreciate movies I wasn't the biggest fan of Star Wars. So before entering the cinema to watch The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. "
2597,9,"All Star Wars fans will love it, and so will the average viewer.","As a Star Wars fan and as a realist, I expected this new trilogy to not meet expectations. Like any Star Wars movie if you can look past the occasional plot hole and logical fallacy this is a great movie. It gave me all the elements to satisfy my nostalgia while bringing in new characters and storylines to keep me interested."
2598,7,Great start to the new trilogy,Im suprised didnt think that it was that good <br /><br />Story wise a Little Bit like Empire strikes back
2599,9,A pretty good Star Wars Movie,"There were three aspects of this film that were completely average; it's score, it's cinematography, and it's editing. Because these things aren't giving or taking points from its grade I'm not going to talk about them to much. One thing I really hate about a lot of modern films is that they're treated like radio shows. 60% of human communication is nonverbal this means only 40% of what humans comprehend is actually said. Radio shows had to explain everything with dialog because the audience couldn't see what was happening which means the 60% of nonverbal communication was non existent. When it comes to film however when a director is portraying emotion 60% of what is being felt should be showed and not sad. Think about it, when a person is sad they don't just say ""Oh, man I'm so sad,"" they portray with body language and other action. This movie like many others completely disregards that 60% that should be nonverbal and only uses dialog to tell the story, show how the characters feel, and tell the audience what they think. This is lazy writing and is therefore costing this movie one point. "
2600,6,"Star Wars: Episode VII ""The Force Awakens"" (Movie Review)","I watched this movie today and the more I think about it, the worse it seems. As a lot of people said it before me, it's the shameless recycle of episode IV. JJ ruined Star Trek and now Star Wars, but in a different way. Let's face it, this whole show was a huge marketing stunt and not much more. The story lacks depth and very uninteresting, given that we've seen it all before. It's simply unbelievable, that they couldn't come up with anything original. Or is this what the masses wanted? The rating shows, that apparently they wanted this, indeed. So everyone who worries about spoilers, just chill, because it's a remake, with technically more advanced visuals and without the charm. Horrible pacing, not very good acting, lame Darth Vader wannabe evil guy and no memorable moment to mention. Not even the death of Han Solo... sad. To say something positive: the design is great, I liked very much the practical effects and the movie looks very good overall. It definitely doesn't belong to the list of the best movies of all time. I won't hurry so much, to see the next one. Hugely disappointed..."
2601,1,The lack of originality is strong with this one,"Okay I absolutely loved this film, I didn't get a chance to see it while it was in the cinema and due to all the hype surrounding it when I eventually got to see it I didn't have high hopes but oh my god I freaking loved it and every time I see it I love it even more. Yes its a fan service and yes the plot is similar to A New Hope but similarities between films is just the norm now, every Rom-com, sci-fi, action, horror and comedy are going to have similarities because there are only so many times something can be made for the first time. "
2602,10,Some people need to get over themselves,"Imagine that if instead of the seventh episode it was a remake of the episode IV (the first one, to who don't know)? Disney would be destroyed, tons of people would cry: HERESY. And thats what I said to my kids when they asked me why it was never done a remake of the three ones. I said that it would be a heresy and would be a failure in all cases. Even if it would made it with excellence, the first ones would ever been better, because they were the first ones. Sou Disney choose to don't make a so called remake, but the episode VII has, obviously, the same history of the IV. The main line is the same, only the characters are changed e some parts are added but the history is the same. With more action and much more technical quality. And that's what made it a great Star Wars movie. it is a remake without being a remake and gives the tribute to the heroes of the first one movies. I enjoyed, my kids enjoyed so I think it is a great great movie and, I dare, the best Star Wars Movie I've seen."
2603,10,What if it was a remake,i just wanna say this was a great movie. I've seen every Star Wars movie there is just like everyone else has. and I'm sure there are those who agree and disagree with whats said about diff parts of different series of films. it was great to see the original cast in the movie. i just dislke the fact that Han Solo was killed in the last part of the movie. i wonder if he and George Lucas made a deal on that? there are some other reviews that said that Harrison ford didn't want to be in the movie. I'm guessing George Lucas made him an offer along with the rest of the crew to be in it. i just wonder what the next series is gonna be like. i can only hope the best. i know time has changed and so have the actors and how they used to be. I'm always gonna be a star wars fan!!!!
2604,,The FORCE awakens!,LOVED IT!
2605,10,Feel the Force once again...,"I really, really liked this movie. I was especially impressed by John Boyega and his character Finn, who added a bit of humor and a sense of doing what is right."
2606,10,"Sure, the story is very similar to the old Star Wars. But it works. 10/10","OK, this is my opinion of the new Star Wars."
2607,6,I must the the only one to like it?,"I don't understand all of the negative reviews. Yeah it was really similar to a new hope, but so what. We've went 10 years without a Star Wars movie, and over 30 years since the last good one. The Force Awakens was really well done, it had its flaws, but there have only been a handful of movies that could be described as perfect. Episode 7 had the mesh of action, scifi, humor, and characters that made for a great movie. I am personally satisfied with this movie and I cannot even begin to understand why people are hating. I think 8.5 is the perfect rating for this movie. The problem is all the Star Wars fans are trying to compare it to the original magic of the trilogy, but at the end of the day nothing can ever beat the original magic. But this is definitely the next best thing and the closest we can get. The new cast blended perfectly with the old cast, and the special effects were on point and the story was heart felt. The chemistry between the characters is amazing too. All in all the force awakens was a great movie and a great return to the Star Wars franchise."
2608,8,"Not perfect, but definitely nostalgic","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the better movies of 2015... as a standalone film. I can imagine people seeing Star Wars for the first time, really liking this one and developing an itch to see more of the Star Wars universe."
2609,7,Saved by good new actors and good technical execution,"I came out of seeing this movie extremely satisfied, abrams delivered on what he said he would he rejuvenated Star Wars ready for new adventures."
2610,8,Great addition to the Star Wars Universe but not perfect,"Spoilers ahead: To me, the star wars universe is like pizza. Even if it's done bad, it's still pretty enjoyable. This movie certainly didn't rank among the original three, but it was still enjoyable none-the-less."
2611,7,"Your average Hollywood movie, not epic though",I agree with all those who have already chimed in to point out that this is a lazy reboot of Start Wars IV A New Hope. It really was the last thing that I expected however in hindsight I am not surprised. Disney goes back to the same tired well (Destroy the Death Star AGAIN!!!) that we have been to so many times before. I guess that all I have to add to all the legitimate criticism of this film is the following. 
2612,2,Star Wars 7: Why even bother except for the MONEY of course,"Listen, when the prequels came out, all of you harsh critics HATED them because of the story lines and the horrible and overused CGI (which I hated as well). It was missing the nostalgia and gritty production that made the originals so great. JJ was HAND PICKED by Lucas, after Lucas himself gave Disney rough outlines of how the 3 movies should go based on the Star Wars universe. After that, he was hands off. Now, you people hating JJ and wanting Lucas back, are the same people who complained about the prequels and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was Lucas. Obviously there is no pleasing you. ""BOOOOO the prequels aren't like the originals"" and now ""BOOOO VII is too much like the originals"". Absolutely ridiculous. I will admit, there is no beating the originals. They were ORIGINAL. Nothing like them had come out yet. They were adventurous and feel good and exciting. I want to go out and fight the Republic after watching them. But it's 40 years later. They had to please the people who were upset with the prequels, and had to find a way to bridge the gap between that generation and this. Yes, the story line is similar, but this movie was an introduction for a lot of people, both as characters and fans. You cannot be upset at that. It couldn't just jump right into the new storyline with no context. Be patient people. This was a wonderful movie. The CGI was limited. The acting was great. The scenery was beautiful, as was the filmography. JJ even left out his famous lens flare for us. The only things I disliked were: 1) Han's death and how unceremonious it was. 2) Carrie Fisher's acting. She was great in the originals but seems to have forgotten how to in this one. 3) Luke's absence from pretty much the whole movie, and the 3 minute staring scene he has at the end. 4) Finn was EXTREMELY overacted. His character makes no sense. He's trying too hard to be funny and to fit in, and from someone that has always been a storm trooper, this makes no sense. Han, Rey, and Poe are wonderful, and have great chemistry. Kylo Ren's character is intimidating at first, until he throws a complete temper tantrum, which I think should not have been in the movie or should have been written differently to make him fearsome, not weak and childish. All in all, this was worth the hype. I went in excited, and left happy and excited. Don't let all of these negative reviews get to you, they can't be pleased unless they wrote their own film, which I assume wouldn't be that great considering they spend all of their time bashing great movies and not getting paid millions of dollars to write and direct."
2613,9,Can't please anyone,"I really don't understand a lot of the hate I have seen this film get. I believe that The Force Awakens is one of, if not the, best films of the franchise. "
2614,9,Star Wars is Back!,Any review of Star Wars always comes with baggage. I saw the first one when I was eight and have watched it far too many times since. I enjoyed the next two but would certainly have joined the Dark Side to avoid ever seeing Ewoks again. I have felt less impressed with the offerings since. 
2615,10,Back to the Future - No Spoilers,"While I enjoyed it, The Force Awakens mirrors Star Trek Into Darkness in its predictability and similarity to preceding films in its series. The dialogue was very unstable/cliché and made old characters as well as new ones fall flat. The plot, characters, and dialogue together felt more like a normal action movie than a Star Wars film, and many of the Star Wars aspects of the film were too repetitive of the originals films to feel genuine. These faults took a lot away from the quality of the film. "
2616,8,A New New Hope,"When I decided to walk into the cinema, I expected a movie this franchise deserves. When I walked out, I was just sad. What should I say ? The big difference between the original and ""The 7th episode"" is the passion that creators put into making the movies: this film was just a plain time-killer made in order to gain some money on a popular movie series, when other parts were clearly made with hart, passion and, above all, well written scenario. 7th episode's plot is developing too quickly, characters are not fit, and there's just no meaning behind it. But there's something good to be mentioned. At very least this movie kept original's atmosphere. You feel like you are watching yet another part of the story, written by George himself. That's the part I liked about this film."
2617,6,"It's good because it's Star Wars, why else would it be ?","I'm not a Star Wars fanatic, which is why I went into the theater with a pretty open mind. I must say the movie didn't disappoint me at all. If anything, it restored the feelings the original trilogy stirred in me as a child. I really liked the new characters and their dynamic, it offers a multi-dimensional villain that is nothing like we've seen before (so, I don't quite get the 'remake' references, although there are clear similarities with the original that are perfectly justifiable) and the soundtrack alone is worth the price of the ticket. I hadn't really enjoyed the Star Wars saga this much since I was a kid, and it has been such a pleasant surprise."
2618,10,Loved it!,"1. The plot. Copy-paste episodes IV to VI in one script, compress it in 135 minutes and believe that old recipe will work is at least underestimating (especially for fans) if not foolish. Makers had all the expanded universe material on their disposal but instead they decide to do that?! Very disappointing and sad. I just wonder whose idea was this unbelievably cheap trick, because it ruined the whole thing. Storyline of TFA is not worth the name Episode VII and is simply an epic fail which will be hard to erase in the upcoming episodes VIII and IX."
2619,7,Who stole the magic?,"Very good movie. The prequels were so awful, this movie is such fun and a wonderful addition to the Star Wars family. The acting was excellent... such a change from the poorly acted prequels. The special effects were incredible and I loved the new robot. Just wish the movie didn't follow the original Star Wars movie so closely. But I'm sure the next movie will surprise us with wonderful new planets and lots of intriguing characters. It was so awesome seeing Han and Leia and Luke... and of course Chewbacca and the robots. i just hope the Death Star doesn't get used in any future movies... or if it is mentioned it's not the entire focus of the movie. But overall a fun movie to watch and I can't wait for the next movie."
2620,10,Star Wars is back!,"I was very excited to see this movie, and very hopeful of JJ Abrams and what he could bring to the franchise. "
2621,6,This is not the sequel you are looking for,"Same old faces, Harrison Ford et al (more wrinkles), same old space fighters & space ships, same old death star (oh! but its bigger), same old plot and story lines i.e. light sword fight on a bridge in the final reel and many, many more too numerous to mention. As others have pointed out on IMDb this wasn't so much a new story as it was a copy of the old story and pasting the same actors, machines, bad guys in white armor, fat guy flying in a rebellion fighter down a narrow corridor of the death star to destroy, etc. etc. Millennial's would have accepted a subtle reference to the former story but to be beat over the head repeatedly in every scene was overbearing and outright boring trash. Disney better re-think the other committed pictures in this series. The next one will be a disaster if this continues. I saw this mess from a DVD Redbox so I wasn't hit as hard as those paying premium prices. I didn't give this a 1 because the new R2D2 was innovative and different. It was the only thing new about this movie. However they had, you guessed it, the same old R2D2 and C3PO taking up space in this movie. See this Star Wars - NO! Forget it!"
2622,3,I'm a victim of the hyped up media machine Disney unleashed,"After many years of enjoying the merits of IMDb as a mere visitor, I finally decided to register and write my first review after being shocked by some of the negative reviews for The Force Awakens."
2623,9,"Maybe not the most original story, but a lot of fun!","Come on people, what DID you expect? I've been scanning these scathing reviews for a while now and can't believe how nobody can take anything positive from this movie."
2624,8,Very good for what it was.,*WARNING* *SPOILERS*
2625,9,"Great Nostalgic movie,but not perfect * WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD*","Star Wars, The Force Awakens is by far the best of the series. Not to take anything away from the original trilogy and the prequel, but I eager to see what they do with the last two in this true sequel. The story, special effects and acting was simply amazing! Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher did a wonderful job reprising your original roles. The new actors and actresses also did a fine job with their respective roles, helping to add depth and originality to this movie. I also enjoyed the insertion of Easter Eggs throughout the movie, such as the remains of damaged and destroyed ships and weapons from the former movies. If you are able, check this out in IMAX 3D! Star Trek, move over, Star Wars is back!"
2626,10,Best of the series so far!,The good news is: it is like Star Wars IV. The bad news is: it is almost exactly like Star Wars IV.
2627,7,Clone Wars,"I have seen Star Wars in 1977 and since then I have seen all the episodes muliple times. The force awakens is one of the best entries in the series if not the best one yet. I do not understand any negative reviews especially by the so called original fans. This movie is awesome and outstanding. Kylo Ren is the best Star Wars villain yet. Yes, he is whiny, jeaulous, insecure and weak but that is what makes him so dangerous and unexplainable. The young actors are by far better than Hamill, Ford and Fisher were in 1977. Especially Daisy Ridley does a very good and very convincing job. By the way the movie is set to entertain and that is what it does perfectly so. 10/10 for sure!"
2628,10,Awesome Movie,"First off, was this movie good? Yes it was, and I can say that after I had left the cinema I wasn't disappointed. But was it a great movie?"
2629,7,A nostalgic and fresh (yet not flawless) start for a new trilogy,"I am a huge fan of the Star Wars saga, and I think this is a wonderful addition to the franchise. I am not sure why it is getting so many bad reviews. It is family friendly with very mild violence or language (like the original trilogy) and an excellent storyline. "
2630,10,"Well done, Entertaining, Nostalgic, and Family Friendly","So lets just get to the point here, honestly, i was disappointed by this movie, i'm not afraid to say so. First of all, this movie is really fast paced (for me) there were no characters back story or development that made me lack of emotion through the viewing, okay maybe people are covering this flaws because of the hype or because the old cast are here. so here's the list"
2631,7,"it was ""okay""","It is claimed to have cost 200 millions, but that obviously did not go in the originality of the script (it's blatantly ripping off a lot from the original trilogy), the quality of the camera work or the actors. "
2632,4,Far far away from George Lucas' masterpiece,"This movie is a gift to the younger generation, who gets to relive in a revitalized way the first Star Wars movies. Most of the harsh critics of this movie blame it for its great similarities to the original Star Wars, calling it either a remake or a ripoff; but rest assured that these similarities are exactly what makes this movie incredible, and that the movie doesn't feel like an usurper, but rather like the worthy legatee of the first Star Wars movies."
2633,9,The worthy legatee of a legendary franchise,"First I'll start off with the negatives, the plot was fine, but it was pretty much the same as Star Wars IV: A New Hope, and small bits and pieces of the characters and overall story felt a little rushed. They sort of all met up and came up with a pretty basic gameplay as to how they would blow up the new Death Star which is now about 10x larger. They pulled it off, but overall looking back on it, it felt like it all happened pretty quick. There really weren't too many holes in the story and to suggest this is even a problem is hard too do considering it's there are two more movies to come."
2634,8,"Fantastic return to Star Wars, however a little recycled.","I went without too much expectations to see The Force Awakens. Because i thought that all the hype i had for this film will make me hate it, too much hype can change completely your appreciation of movie (Seryously just watch some examples in other franchises or see how all end for The Phantom Menace which in its time it was supposed to be a revolutionary film over the original trilogy and we all know it didn't even came close to that) you could even say hype can kill movies. Sincerely, even when I have all that hype for this to be a good film and deep inside me I was thinking that i will hate it. It doesn't. It even exceeded my expectations it was one of the best installations on the franchise. And most important than that it make forget about the prequels. This movie pays homage to the Star Wars mythology and earns its place in this beloved saga. Brings Star Wars back to our lives and doesn't disappoint us!"
2635,9,You have to see it!!,"Amazing movie that exceeded all my expectations. Been a fan since 1977 and it made me feel like a kid again! Love the new cast, especially Rey and Kylo Ren. BB-8 made me forget about R2-D2 altogether. No way this movie deserves less than 7. Clearly the 1/10 reviews are people being paid or who worked on the PT and are bitter. Perhaps they are in the James Cameron camp as well. Seen it three times and I liked it more and more each time. After the prequel abominations (Revenge of the Sith was good), I welcome the similarities between ANH and TFA. Critically speaking, it's right up there with ESB. I'd probably rank them ESB, TFA, ANH, ROTS and ROTJ."
2636,10,"Fantastic return to that galaxy far, far away...",I do not usually write reviews I usually just leave a rating and then leave the page but as I am a fan of the Star Wars series I suppose I should give my opinion and battle against all the idiots saying they would prefer to watch The Phantom Menace all over again.
2637,7,Brilliantly directed and well done though very safe.....,"Are you guys for real ? Why am I seeing so many 1, 2 and 3 starts and an absolute trashing and bashing of this movie ? I mean really, would you rate it lower than Pixels ?"
2638,9,"What is going on, IMDb ?","Sure the Star Wars prequels were some of the most disappointing things to ever be created, but you can't deny how brilliant George Lucas' creativity in world building kept the franchise alive with new races, locales, weaponry and characters. But creating atmosphere only goes so far, you need good writing, relatable characters and immaculate direction. So when Disney took Lucas' baby right off him, I was wishing, hoping and dreaming of a film made by directors who were fans of the originals, with a clear focus on giving the audience nuanced protagonists and antagonists. Fast forward a couple years and The Force Awakens was released under the helm of J.J Abrams. In short, The Force Awakens is unquestionably the best Star Wars movie we've seen in 30 years, and is an undeniably entertaining jumpstart to the franchise – but one certainly not without a collection of narrative flaws, missed opportunities, and predictable plotting."
2639,7,"Close, but not quite great.","Star Wars is back and the Force has never been stronger! Since age 4, I have loved Star Wars. I was a child during the prequel trilogy and never got to experience the excitement of a premiere, but now at age 20, I have, and it was absolutely amazing. For generations, Star Wars has inspired millions to do good, to be creative, to think across the stars, and this film has done an incredible legacy set forth by George Lucas, true justice plus some."
2640,9,The Force has Awoken!,"In a year in which throw backs from the yesteryear were the norm, oh how I hoped that this would be the one where I would not want to get up from my seat, the one that would give me the joy and chills of excitement that make cinema the greatest of art forms. How I wished to be moved by emotion and feel that special something, that on screen magic that touches the soul and makes you grateful that in spite of everything that is wrong in the world, you were born in a time when you can witness stories like the ones happening a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."
2641,6,The Jurassic World syndrome,Again fooled by Hollywood.
2642,1,They took my money,"I honestly dont understand at all why Retro-Nerds rate Episode 4-6 better than 1-3 or 7-9, but I totally disagree."
2643,10,the perfect movie for a continuation,"I grew up watching all the star wars saga, i've seen it dozens of times and still can't get bored of it. 10 years ago i heard rumors and even saw a picture o a possible episode VII but as I said, rumors.Finally these year I got the privilege of this great sequel. It is undeniable that episodes IV-VI are the best and are masterpieces, even though The Force Awakens is an exceptional job of J.J. Adams, the references to a lot of stuff in previous movies are amazing, even the argument is really well studied, couldn't find any bloopers and of course this one movie is greatly influenced by Episode IV. In the beginning of the movie, the intro gave me the chills, and that is a wonderful sine. Episode VII is really well establish sequel, and even though it will never be star wars greatest movie, I can only say, ""well done, loved it and thank you for bringing them back"""
2644,8,Thank you for bringing them back!,"Unlike many moviegoers, I couldn't care less about the STAR WARS franchise these days. Sure, I grew up with the original trilogy, which I still know and love, but George Lucas single-handedly destroyed the goodwill surrounding those movies with his mishandling of the prequels. The good news is that THE FORCE AWAKENS - a genuine sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI - is better than the prequels, but only just. Because this is a deeply flawed movie that gets ten things wrong for everything it gets right. While it's a delight to see Harrison Ford effortlessly breezing back into one of his most iconic roles, the rest of the production is a mixed bag of good and bad, of the woeful and the wonderful."
2645,9,Nice movie!,"Only people that ""think"" they are fan's are giving this movie negative reviews. This movie is absolutely ""Amazing"" and I don't think anyone could have done any better with it. If your nit picking little things you should really re-think your entire view. This was probably one of the hardest movies ever to remake and JJ Abrams did an awesome job. He had a lot to live up to, and a lot to follow up to.. and he did it!!"
2646,10,"Ignore the negative's , This movie is AMAZING",I want to do two things with this review. 1) Provide my overall impressions of the film and 2) Address some of the comments that I've been reading here from reviewers who have given this film only a few stars and many complaints.
2647,7,Episode IV for Grown-Up Fans and Newbees,I just re-watched the movie last night after finally getting my 4K Blu- Ray player and television and 7.1 surround set up and was quite happy with the film (even though not 4K) overall with the visual and sound.
2648,8,Back to Basics,"Not a bad movie like most of the originals, but i just don't get why people go nuts over it. Quite frankly recent movies Creed, Ant man and The hateful eight were far better movies IMO and never get any where close to the media attention or money."
2649,6,what's the big deal?,"I first saw The Force Awakens about a week and a half ago in my local cinema. Upon arriving at the theatre, I realised that the screening was in fact in 3D. I never go out of my way to see a 3D movie however I was excited when I remembered how good the visuals appeared in the trailers. Besides, I had finally got the hang of my flimsy daily contact lenses so the 3D glasses wouldn't be a problem. "
2650,9,2nd Time's A Charm,"Star wars the force awaken was an OK film, but it has a very similar plot line the Original star wars film, There is a new evil empire, there is a new death star like thing, there is a girl from poverty who becomes a Jedi. if you look over the graphics and sounds you see the force awakens as a combination of J.J Abrams the force awakens and the original star wars. Also I don't get an evil presence from Darth Ren(I think) but a more Anakin sky walker a Winne asshole. Over all I did get a star wars experience I like, however this might be because of the kids in the theater that annoyed me. Some good points were that they were needing to find Luke, but that's all from story really. so that's why I give it 6 out of 10."
2651,6,"OK if, new for star wars you are","This movie is the best I've ever seen No I'm joking this movie was useless, Star Wars 6 didn't need a sequel but Disney decided to do it. The story was pathetic and not credible. When I saw the six firsts star wars I immediately got into the story but I couldn't do it with this one. I watched it on my phone and it took me THREE DAYS to watch the entire movie because I fell asleep the first two times!!! I think there are only two good points in this movie: The actor's performance that was very good and the special effects that were just beautiful. It's definitely the worst star wars ever. I knew that the movie wasn't good before seeing it but after seeing it I'm just in shock. Even George Lucas said that he sold the star wars saga to white slavers. Definitely this move can't be compared with Star Wars 3 that is actually THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!"
2652,3,What I think about Star Wars VII,This movie was totally visually stunning with an epic soundtrack and an all-star cast in the production value is truly on point. All in all after seen the preview to directors at it and San Clara Florida I was truly amazed at the edits made because the first was a little choppy. Although I'm still waiting to see the 3-D IMAX version in a few days this will be highly game changing movie in the industry. The ability for 3-D or XY axis spinning a camera on the ball camera and the use of focus on these cameras with them within balls is somewhat mind-boggling at first it was a little hard to handle understanding how the cameras moving. But with more explanation from the casting crew as I've already previewed some I will be a little more tempted to understand the actual physics of how it was edited with and what suffer and how they were able to shoot so it's stunning visuals all from within the box. In a few days the casting for a come forward with much-anticipated goody bags off and It'll be quite a show. I will meanwhile be picking up my sports car to shut off so I hope you enjoy this is Bruce checking out the Motel 6.
2653,10,In a nutshell totally stunning!,"I saw this movie twice in theaters and would probably see it again. It met my expectations almost perfectly. The characters were pretty well developed in their own respects. Rey developed in the sense of initially rejecting the idea of being a Jedi until she sees the ally get murdered and one severely hurt. Finn develops in the sense of going from being a stormtrooper, a character type whose never been given and real human emotions in the whole cinematic series, to being a rebel and almost dies to protect his allies. The plot in this movie was OK. If you've already seen the original Star Wars you'll notice that its basically the same plot with some differences besides setting and characters. The settings in this movie were amazing. They were beautiful and even helped develop Rey's character at one point. Great Characters(with development) OK plot Amazing Settings Pretty Good Movie"
2654,8,It was pretty good,This 8 comes from the legacy. I have few points to share with;
2655,8,Light version of Empire Strikes back,"The movie was relentless. It threw me back and forth, it tore me apart, and it had damn fun with it. JJ Abrams is the perfect choice for Star Wars. The Sci-Fi feel, the heart, the very soul, the essence of Star Wars oozes all over the screen. The directing is magnificent, with beautiful views, exquisite camera placement, and never a single frame that feels out of place. The story is very engaging (despite having similarities with A New Hope), the dialogue is ACTUALLY believable and humane (take notes, George. I saw you at the premiere.), and the pacing. Good lord, the pacing. The movie runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes, but when JJ Abrams' name showed up in the blue font, it felt like I had been sitting there for merely 40 minutes. I feared the movie would be a little slow, and god forbid, boring for some brief moments, but no. The movie was a damn roller-coaster. And even though it felt short (in a positive way, of course) it tells its own standalone story. I have only one complaint regarding the lenght - I want more!!! Do I have to wait two years?! I smiled, I laughed, I cried, I couldn't handle it, I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. "
2656,9,Star Wars is back on track!,SPOILER ALARM - DON'T KEEP READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT* 
2657,7,"Hope for the sequels, this one fell flat.","I see a lot of people very angry with the film. With film and J. J. Abrams. Understandably, they expected more. They felt cheated many things that ""promised"" and ended up being smoke. The villain do not seem to be up to par. There are many errors in the script. Etc."
2658,9,"It is not the new film we deserve, but is the Star Wars's movie we need right now. So we will hunt it, because it must take it","First of all i like all the star wars movies, the 1st three and the second three... that said."
2659,7,Star Wars movie but that's it,"Since announced, this film has been the centre on my attention. When the first teaser was released I was incredibly excited. The two following trailers just heightened my expectations and intrigued me, three trailers and I still had little to no knowledge of the plot. Many trailers these days fail to do this and unintentionally show the whole movie. The marketing behind this film was 10/10."
2660,9,"impressive, most impressive","The movie is entertaining and occasionally funny, the action sequences and special effects are great, but the plot is convoluted, shallow and forgettable. Is it just me or does it appear that movies have evolved into just one long mishmash of action and explosions punctuated only by brief periods of meaningless dialog?"
2661,6,"Good, not great","Since the critic reviews had left me hopeful that something new and exciting was brewing with the Star Wars series, I felt disappointment as the final credits rolled in the theater. I'll drop it in easy point form."
2662,4,It's the iPhone 6 of sequels,"The Force Awakens is proof that if you go into the theatre with moderate expectations, you will be blown away when it turns out great."
2663,8,A fantastic experience that reinvigorates the franchise.,"J.J. Abrams has done it. He has returned Star Wars to where it belongs, and it feels so refreshing. This film had everything I was hoping for; great dialogue, quick-witted humor, fast paced action, and a memorable story with memorable moments. The character of Rey was pulled off spectacularly by Daisy Ridley. She had great lines and had a great back story. I feel that she is the character that fans will appreciate the most, even more than the original cast."
2664,9,The true definition of Star Wars,"Don't listen to the negative reviews! This movie is the best of the year! It starts and ends with not stop action. A movie for teens to seniors. It will bring back memories and will also start new ones. Seeing this movie on opening night in 3D was so much fun. And I look forward to the sequels. JJ Abrams the director brought more to the screen then I could ever imagine. And with the upcoming sequels being released much quicker then the past six trilogy, the wait won't seem to long. If you are a Huge Star Wars fan like I am this is a must see, and if your one of the very few that has never watched a Star Wars film, well you won't be disappointed."
2665,10,This Movie will not Disappoint!,"This movie is getting a lot of hate on here and to be honest I couldn't tell you why, it's Star Wars for the first time in over 30 years we have a Star Wars movie that isn't crap!!! The characters were developed the playful banter was back that we so dearly missed in the prequels, some of our favorite characters like Han and chewie both made appearances. The death of Han Solo was a disappointment but we could all see it coming I mean we almost didn't get a Han in Return of the Jedi, but the scene in which he does is done absolutely perfect, no music building suspense perfectly, I remember thinking what is Han going to say to get Kylo Ren's attention out on the catwalk and once you saw Han struggle to take Ren's lightsaber you knew it Han was dead it was brilliantly filmed. All and all The Force Awakens isn't a perfect movie what is though? While not perfect Star Wars is defiantly back from the dead and it feels great."
2666,8,Star Wars is back!!!!,"And TLJ killed the trilogy, rendering TFA useless.<br /><br />Pretty visuals, decent story hooks. But does not stand well on its own."
2667,6,"Enjoyed it, but relies on the trilogy.",This is for all the critics. What exactly did you expect? The books written after the films are also similar in many ways. This movie has taken a little from the books and made their own. If you don't like it fair enough but to enjoy it you need to look deeper after all this is star wars. It's all about the Jedi now. The first film has made a good start. If rey clearly is likes daughter then it can explain how she can use the force so naturally. It's in her blood and people do amazing things in difficult times. On this version the characters did not join the Republic but allied with them. The first order in the books was still known as the empire and they occupied some systems still but we're still the empire. Different sith came and went and even clones of palpatine and vader were made. Han had twins in the book named jacen and jaina. Jacen turned sith and jaina had to fight him so they have followed a certain way but made it their own. Don't like it oh well go watch the snoopy movie..........
2668,10,classic star wars.......,Let me start out by saying that I think this is a fantastic movie and that my opinions are only MY personal opinions and shouldn't discourage someone from seeing this movie.
2669,6,Great characters;great story with some minor flaws,"Really, I would give it 8.5/10. The Force Awakens is than 10x better maybe 100 times than the prequel trilogy (The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith). I went to a Midnight Screening on the day this came out and this is the first time I have seen a Star Wars film in the cinema in my life and I've been into Star Wars since I was 8 years old (when Revenge of the Sith was released in 2005)."
2670,8,"No one listen to these bad reviews, they are fake reviews from fake Star Wars fans!!!!!!!",Lets first start of in saying that a lot has been right in this film. They've created relatable characters and managed to make them feel much more human than most characters of the old films. There is no over- use of CGI and everything has the good old Star Wars feel that we all loved from the original trilogy. The 3D is also well done and does not feel strenuous on the eyes during the entire film. The fighting scenes are also well made and the space battles are very pleasing to the eyes. For all this I applaud you JJ Abrahams. 
2671,7,Great characters but story too safe,Remake? Reboot? Retread?
2672,1,Pavlov's Demographic,"NOTE: This is my first-ever movie review. I'm sure it will not turn out at the best review you've ever seen. But, when I soon become experienced in reviewing, I promise you, my reviews will become better and more specific and detailed."
2673,9,The Force Awakens,"I see a lot of negative reviews from disgruntled fans who idolize the originals and expect this film to be as good as them. The originals will NEVER be matched. But this is an amazing film that sticks to the basics of the saga and it is enjoyable for the entire family. This is a must watch. I never saw the pre-quells and from what I'm told they are an atrocity and I'm not missing anything. By sticking to the basics of the Star Wars premise, it appeals to a much broader range of generations. My hat goes off to Disney for doing right by this Saga. If you have seen the originals of the saga then you will understand this film without seeing the pre-quells that everyone hated. Lastly, if Mr. Lucas himself endorsed this film, then why can't you?"
2674,9,Great Film!,JJ did a spectacular job of bringing back Star Wars. I still need to go see it again so I can analyze the entire thing and not be completely engrossed (going to be hard to do) in the movie throughout the time I was watching it. 
2675,10,Star Wars fans everywhere crying out for joy,"When I was a kid I must've seen Star Wwrs about 10 times at the movies. Same for Empire and Jedi. When Phantom came out now in my twenties I was just as excited until I went to the theater. It was such a let down. Then came the little better two sequels. It still did not fulfill that same need to be excited ..to get lost..to feel like I could be a Jedi. Ridiculous I know, but I wanted to feel like a kid again. I thought...well that's it...it's over. Then when I heard Disney had purchased The rights to the series like most fans I was a little skeptical, but after the last three let downs I figured let's see what they've got. I mean hell look what they did to Marvel. It couldn't be all that bad. "
2676,10,The Movie I Was Waiting For,"It was kinda what I expected it to be, AMAZING. It actually leaves more questions than it answers, plus that girl Ray is way to overpowered. how can she, with no training, defeat Kylo with years of training. also whats here background, how can the force be so strong with her. How did Poe get back from the dead? It was kinda obvious that Kylo is ether Hans or Lukes son. minus points on Han dieing and R2D2 and Luke only appearing in the last minute. The trailer makes you ask questions and you expect to have them answered in the movie but they are just left in the open.It definitely asks for a Star Wars episode IIV in short, I liked it a lot but it leaves so many questions."
2677,7,Leaves more questions than answers,"I've seen this movie three times now and can honestly say I think it's great. Like most fans of the original trilogy I was dissatisfied with the prequels. The prequels didn't even feel like They were even set in the same universe as the originals and the writing was poor. The first line in this film is ""this will begin to make things right"" I kinda feel like this is a knock on the prequels but maybe I'm looking to much into it. The movie looks gorgeous. I can't say I'm a fan of jj Abrams' previous works but this movie is a treat just to look at. Things are gritty in all the right places IT LOOKS LIKE STARWARS! The plot revolves around a race between Kylo Ren and the Resistance to find Luke Skywalker, who has gone into exile after Kylo, Han and Leias son, turned to the dark side and killed the new Jedi he was training. I think this is a great reason for his disappearance, as if he couldn't face his friends after failing there son, the movie didn't come out and say that but that's what I love about this movie, it doesn't hold your hand and let's you see and feel what's going on and it does this very well. Some people disregard the plot as a ""remake"" of a new hope And I can see what they're talking about but this movie feels fresh to me, it definitely relys on nostalgia but that's kinda what starwars needed, a return to it's roots. The only issue I have with this movie is the middle section is a little clunky with the whole Han solo showing up out of nowhere and the raptars, I don't know I just didn't appreciate the goofy cg monster chase. I also didn't like maz katana and her bar. I believe the positives far outweigh the negatives, the scene where Rey calls the lightsaber and it goes to her instead of Ren teared me up every time because there's so much going on, Ren betrayed his father and the light side of the force while Rey embraces the force clears her mind and kicks his but! Because she believed! Not because of some stupid medichlorion nonsense. I'm not very good at writing reviews but I had to try for this movie. I have been a hardcore starwars fan my entire life and this has given me a new hope for the series, it's fun, it has great characters, and it doesn't tarnish the original trilogy. Ignore the naysayers starwars is back."
2678,9,I love this movie,"This is Star Wars parts IV - Vi content mashed into a single movie, with some fancy CGI added. Watching this movie literally feels like they re shoot previous movies and stitched up the scenes. Nevertheless its not a bad movie, it has action that keeps you engaged, visuals are great, and scenes add up to more less coherent plot."
2679,6,Noting new,"First of all Hi to all who are reading . Ignore the Haters just go and watch the film already they are all just sad because they did watched it and wish they could be a Superstar/Actor, its a great film good acting, no Great acting awesome story line a must watch in 3D if you can i watched it in 3D and the few extra bucks are worth it. so stop reading reviews and go take your family/friends and drag them to the cinema and enjoy! its my first review for any movie out there. going to spend the weekend watching the first movies (which i had not seen before by the way)the people who gives the bad reviews are most likely the exact one who already watched it like 10 times at the cinemas and are mad because no money left for more ...well that's just my opinion enjoy and may the force be with you."
2680,10,Ignore the Haters who have nothing better to do with their lives,"Those who enjoyed episode vii are the nostalgic ones, given the film is a giant collection of easter eggs and throw backs from previous films. It's a fan pleaser. With no new content. The criticisms for this movie mostly rely on the lack of effort to stir new emotions into spectators and just completely recycle previous concepts and bring the thematics up to todays standards for broader viewing by fans of original star wars and new comers alike. But many will leave with not much to appreciate when it comes to novelty. very much like the current fashion of rebooting older properties, here we've gotten a familiar story with a fresh coat of paint, with the pretty neat bonus of introducing us to new characters that can hopefully be developed further in new episodes, hopefully with more original content and a more expanded universe. it's not all bad, but it's not great either"
2681,7,"""Nothing to see here, move along""","If a film maker is inspired by another film, there are 3 options:"
2682,3,"Jar Jar Abrams, you dun goofed!","OK first up I admit I was disappointed after seeing the film at the cinema. It was a carbon copy of A New Hope, had cartoonish action in parts, and the main bad guy looks like Gollum."
2683,8,Growing on me all the time,I'm going to try and keep this short and sweet without spoiling anything important.
2684,9,Star Wars is back!,"Yes, this movie brought back all the little things you remember from the Original Star Wars New Hope, Including Humor, Villains, Adorable Droids, weird creatures just popping up, all the actors are ""Likable"" unlike the last 3 Star Movies. The Acting was better, the story was good. I actually didn't think I would like it going in. But I came out a Fan again of the Star Wars Franchise. Disney did a great job Reviving & literally saving the Star War Franchise. I would recommend this movie and I am looking forward to the next series of Star War Movies from Disney. I think some of the characters are predictable, but there are other characters your still not sure how their role will play out in this current movie and the next series of movies to come out."
2685,10,Star Wars is Awakened,"Star Wars TFA is a great starting point for the future of the Star Wars franchise. The film contains new hero's who are going to be much loved characters in the upcoming films. The villains are set up nicely, and are very different from any other bad guys in the franchise. Then there are the original big three, Han, Luke, and Leia, who are all really important to the story. The movies pace in perfect. JJ Abrams, the director, had a lot on his plate, having to explain the last 30 years and explain the new story. JJ Abrams came through and made a movie that the fans were excepting, and made it feel like the originals, while also adding a new regime. The movie is a must see, and leaves you wanting more."
2686,9,"Star Wars is back, and it is not going anywhere!",Spoilers! Though it has been two months
2687,7,review,"Star Wars holds a special place in my heart. I wasn't born for the initial hype of the original trilogy, however when George Lucas re-released them in the late 90's I lost my freaking mind. Space!! The force!! Good vs evil! Memorable heroes and villains! An awesome story! Han freaking Solo!!"
2688,9,Revived my excitement for the Hollywood Blockbuster,"Despite all the trolls talking the film down, I thought it was enjoyable and in keeping with the original theme. Ren was the weakest character both in the film and as an actor but on the whole a good solid film. There was an element of recycling of the original story but it has laid the ground for the next installment and I for one am looking forward to that release. I am sure the story will expand answering the questions opened by this episode. Much better than episodes 1,2 and 3 which in hindsight were pretty dire, Abrams has brought the humor and frolics of the original bang up to date and set the fans imagination with his next creation."
2689,7,A good solid sequel - don't listen to the trolls,"In my opinion, this is a solid 7,5/10 movie,but Mr.IMDb doesn't let us give half-ratings, so i'm giving Force Awakens an 8/10. Here's why:"
2690,8,"A tiny bit disappointed, but a great Star Wars experience!","Strong beginning! The film starts really well even with JJ cheese, then same old same old...Nothing really original."
2691,6,"It's better than the prequels but then so is a CGI-ed Turd, But The Force Awakens is miles off the originals.","I had heard so much good about this movie, and seen enthusiastic people interviewed while coming out of theaters and saying ""it's great, they did it, there's everything from the previous episodes.. they did it"". "
2692,1,When homer Simpson meets the force..,"This movie is Star Wars. Many people dislike it for all of the parallels it draws with the original trilogy; but this is what makes it Star Wars. It is not something radically distant from its source material, but the best parts of the original movies wrapped up with new elements that make it something different. Yes, there are many scenes that mirror those in the originals. Perhaps a few too many. But this is the overarching theme. It is a passing of the torch. It is so similar to give those kids who are seeing Star Wars for the first time the same joy and happiness ""A New Hope"" gave their parents. This movie recognizes its source material, but also acknowledges that it is something new. While many fans are angry at the apparent lack of originality, I found this movie to be strikingly well made in not only its impressive acting, plots, and effects, but its creative interpretation of the original scenes that influenced so many."
2693,9,"The Force Awakens is not just an epic sequel, but a passing of the torch to a new audience.","This movie was by far the best movie of 2015. Go in with modest expectations and a box full of popcorn and nachos and you will come out deeply content. Loved every bit of it. No movie is perfect and this one doesn't come without them, but if you do look past the flaws you are sure to have a memorable movie experience. "
2694,10,"Exciting, Entertaining, and Engaging!","Simply put, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is likely my favorite movie in the whole franchise and definitely ranks in the Top 5 of my favorite movies of all-time. If you are a fan of the original trilogy, you likely had high expectations going into this film, especially after the debauchery that was the prequel trilogy. Despite the high amount of pressure put on this movie, J.J. Abrams delivered and he delivered in a big way. Without going into specifics or spoiling anything for the readers, the cast was phenomenal, the effects were spot-on, the up and down roller-coaster of excitement and trepidation that accompanied watching the original trilogy was felt throughout this film. Was it a perfect film? No. But this entire movie did something many films I've seen before haven't yet accomplished, which was build up so much hype, so much expectation and emotion, and just blow my mind from beginning to end in the theater. In all, if you love Star Wars or are new to the franchise, start from the beginning. Trudge through Episodes 1-3, savor Episodes 4-6, and reap all the benefits in Episode 7. You won't regret it. It is simply fantastic and you deserve all that back story and build up to truly appreciate this film. 9 out of 10."
2695,9,A Fantastic Transition to the New Era of Star Wars,"It is unfathomable how much hate and criticism this film has received. When the prequels had been completed back in 2005, people were complaining that it was nothing like the original trilogy and therefore it was complete garbage. Yes, I agree I was not a big fan of the prequels, but Revenge of the Sith is my third favorite Star Wars film. My number 2? The Force Awakens, and here is why."
2696,10,An almost perfect Star Wars film,"After seeing the (for me) most anticipated movie of this decade, I had mixed feelings. It was definitely a good movie, outscoring 1 & 2 by far (3 is somewhat on the same level if you ask me). But the major disappointment is the depth in the story, which for me a is big aspect of the Star Wars Saga."
2697,7,"Good movie, but missing storyline depth","This is how the prequels should have been down. With enough love and care, it could have turned out this good. The new characters have interesting stories to tell, which aren't fully explained in the movie. They're possibly set up for later films. Nevertheless, the new kids on the block fit in well. It doesn't feel like they're intruding into a beloved series. They're a bit more realistic this time around too. Sure, we all love Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, but they're heroes who keep going for the sake of being a hero. They have tons of charisma but that doesn't make them feel real. These new characters have fears of their own, agendas. Some of the are cowardly and actually scared. "
2698,9,This is how the prequels should have been done.,"Rather than a review per se, thought I'd post a conversation I had by email this morning with a good mate....."
2699,6,Not as bad as people are saying,"Seen the new Star Wars film twice now, both times in 3D in DBox seats. BTW I'd recommend you see it in one of these seats as I think it adds to the experience (with this film anyway). The film itself is exciting from the off and the plot is very involving with several new stars making their Star Wars debuts. Daisey Ridley is especially good, as is Adam Driver in the baddie role. I love the return to using less CGI in this movie and the chase scenes are well thought out and shot. The old stars are nicely dove-tailed in with the new and the locations used are spectacular and varied. There are some touching scenes and surprising twists. Nice mixture of the serious and the jocular, which is typical SW. I think this film is a must see and at the end of the day it's great entertainment."
2700,10,Triumphant Return,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a good movie, there's no doubt about it. The first hour and a half I was smiling ear to ear. I loved it. It was fun, quirky, and the characters interacted with each other in a realistic way. I didn't even mind that the plot was somewhat based on the original. But then something changed: the plot became the original, and without any attempts to disguise it. Verbatim, with maybe a few instances altered on the minute mark, the plot became A New Hope, and then it became Return of the Jedi. I was being spoon-fed exactly what I had spent my time watching at home before I went to the theatre. Many people will not have any issue with this, if the reviews are anything to listen to, which reflects a lack of want for new creativity. And with the director at the helm, who can expect much more than a carbon copy (Wrath of Khan 1982). The characters were interesting, but the most interesting one was barely on screen, reduced to a Wedge Antilles-sized role. My biggest worry for the film actual turned into one of its saving graces: Adam Driver. He should have been allowed to be let loose even more, to dominate the film even. So no, the latest installment of Star Wars is not a bad movie. But for any long-time fan (even casual fans), this movie heralds an end to creativity in major blockbusters. Even in the franchise that created the blockbuster. It is simply a rehash of what's been done before (plagiarized is a better word) for the sake of being too scared of taking the story in a new direction."
2701,6,"Good Movie, Not a Good Star Wars Movie",*spoilers ahead*
2702,1,A Shameless Boring Rip-off With Idiotic Plot,REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
2703,8,Ignore the naysayers - this movie is excellent,I saw Episode 4 in the theatre when I was just 6 years old and like many from my generation I became a lifelong fan of the franchise sticking with it through thick and thin. 
2704,8,"Thank you, JJ.","I had very high expectations going into this movie, and was also very worried as I walked into the theater. I was concerned about whether or not this movie would do the franchise a justice, or be another flop. Every expectation I had for this movie was shattered. Star Wars: The Force Awakens had a fantastic blend of action, comedy, drama, and was all brought together by great performances. For starters, this movie is visually stunning. Every scene was eye catching, and kept my eyes virtually glued to the screen. I never found myself wondering when the next scene was coming, because I was totally enthralled on the action on screen. The new characters were incredibly likable, and each had depth to them. My favorite of the new characters are hands down Poe Dameron, Rey, and Fin. Anytime any of these three were on screen, it was just an amazing time. Fin and Rey had great chemistry, and the comedy between them is organic and hilarious. Fin is witty, high energy, and was 100% entertainment through the entire film. Rey was all around bad ass, and played a fantastic lead woman. It was a good twist making Rey the Force sensitive one instead of Fin, which we were all lead to believe. Her character is interesting, and has me wondering about her past, and her future as a Padawan of Luke Skywalker. Poe Dameron and Fin were hilarious with each other, and Poe was a fantastic character to watch interact. Oscar Isaac is fantastic, entertaining me every time he is on screen. Kylo Ren is an incredible villain that has depth, and is a villain that I genuinely want to learn more about, and that I care about. He's interesting, being the son of Han Solo and Leia. Kylo Ren is set up for success. Over the course of the film, Kylo Ren has his mask off a good amount, making it easier to connect to who he is. Speaking of Han Solo and Leia, they were great. They gave a good amount of nostalgia, but not too much, and it works. Watching Harrison Ford play Han Solo was just like watching the Han Solo from A New Hope, just a little older. The nostalgia in this movie was fantastic. The scene where Fin and Rey are running from the TIE Fighter air strike and the camera pans to the Millennium Falcon, got a ton of gasps from the audience. One thing was the amount of little details and nods to the original trilogies really made this movie feel like Star Wars. Admiral Akbar returns, and the Death Star is mentioned, just reminding us all of A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. The biggest problem I had was the look of Andy Serkis' character of the Supreme Leader Snoke. Snoke looked very CGI, but his character was still intriguing, and did not take away from the film in any way. This movie is not flawless, but nowadays, how many movies are? All in all, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a well deserved sequel to the classic pieces of film history that is the original three Star Wars movies. After a substantial amount of time, the Force has Awoken."
2705,9,The Star Wars We've Been Waiting For,***Minor Spoilers Ahead***
2706,8,The Force Has Returned,I am more of a prequel fan but it showed a promising start to a new trilogy. Although this and the rest of the trilogy get a bad rep I think it will be the favoured trilogy of the next generation. I think the trilogy it as good if not better than the prequels. I understand why people don't like it but they used good actors and a good director and the made a good film.
2707,7,It was decent,"Disappointed in how fast she picked up the force. Just seemed very wrong. Even Anakin couldn't learn it that fast. Luke had to be trained by not only 1 but 2 Jedi's. She didn't even know she had the force till picking up Luke's light saber. The other problem I had is with the dark-side. Where did they come from? And why was solo's kid so evil. He was obviously brought up knowing the light side. I just didn't get that. the last thing I want to mention is that there were too many similarities to Star Wars: The Last Hope. The Catina scene, Luke isolating himself, the tatoine like planet. Anywho, that is all I have to say, hope the next film is better."
2708,8,disappointed,NOTE: I watched this film with an abject disdain. As a result I wasn't nearly as bitter by the time the film concluded. I've since rewatched it twice to get a better handle on how to rate it. I was born in the Time Gap between the Trilogy and the Prequels so I was very hyper-analytical when I watched this because I felt (And still feel) that the Prequels were an abomination where George Lucas attempted to cash in on the Trilogies iconic status. This is as unbiased a review as I can possibly produce. Here's the breakdown.
2709,7,"The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly",I left the cinema last night with a big smile on my face.
2710,9,Fantastic Comeback to the Star Wars universe,"Bored...antagonist is not clear why all the hate to become a Jedi to learn already, 1 week into it, the clones have changed the skin color and they have learned to think, and they are not worse than Luke Skywalker turning with a sword) has slid into the abyss film, not interested in it now)"
2711,7,while Han solo you're lucky not to be in this movie),Films and stories attract people based on one of four things. The first is extraordinary story as in the Sixth Sense. The second is extraordinary characters and personalities as in say Godfather. The third is the extraordinary elements in the story as found in all folk stories like Alauddin and even in the Intouchables (the paraplegic is a new story element). 
2712,4,The Martian is better than this,***This review may contain Spoilers ***
2713,10,An Elegant Movie for more Civilized Times,Star Wars the Force Awakens is a great new installments to the Star Wars universe as it adds a great jumping on point for new people to the franchise. However it provides a great continuation of what die hards love about Star Wars as people who love all previous installments in the franchise will feel right at home. 
2714,8,Fresh but Familiar,"I see the trolls are out in force, no pun intended... The movie was entertaining, fun, the acting was good too. Let's all be honest, for these of you that are whining about this and that. Some criticism is just fine, but to say that it was terrible, was a ripoff of episode 4 (partly true), or just plain sucked are not credible. It didn't make 1 billion because it sucks. Sorry haters..."
2715,8,I enjoyed it,"I was 8 years old all over again . Goonies, Temple of Doom , Empire Strikes Back... Remember when you wanted to be Indiana Jones, that feeling of endless Possibilities ? "
2716,10,"Born again , again .","Star Wars: The Force Awakens was one of the most anticipated movies in the history of cinema, and most audiences have said that it was worth the wait. The energy and humor in the movie is similar to the original Star Wars trilogy (movies IV, V, and VI). While many people like Star Wars: The Force Awakens because of the nostalgia, I believe that the movie is too much like Star Wars: A New Hope. It is as if J. J. Abrams couldn't come up with any new ideas for the film. Viewers are treated to the same plot, the same scenery, and same characters as A New Hope. Even elements of the film that should have been new are way too familiar— the new characters, for example, are eerily like the old ones. And believe it or not, another Death Star gets destroyed. In short, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a rehash of Star Wars: A New Hope, except that some of the characters are older and now have complex emotional problems. "
2717,7,Star Wars: The Force Awakens is Recycled Material,"I attended the Midnight opening of the Force Awakens. I absolutely loved it, although I did realize the similarities the film poses to a New Hope. What annoys me is that these Star Wars fans who slated the prequels for not being like the originals, and using too much CGI, and now we get a movie which uses minimal CGI, and it actually feels like Star Wars again, and they don't like it. In my Opinion the aim of this movie is to reiterate the importance of Star Wars, and to get the REAL fans back on side. The film is full of shock moments and just sequences of awe. This has most definitely made me love the franchise again, although don't get me wrong I thought Revenge of the Sith was quite underrated."
2718,8,Played Safe - In the Best Way Possible,"Star Wars is iconic and always will be, Lucas bored everyone to death with the last 3 which revenge of the sith was ok, Episode 7 was entertaining at least and gave han, chewy, leia and the falcon. All characters did a good job, maybe not brilliant. You want Laurence Olivier or Meryl Streep watch another movie, this delivered as far as i'm concerned, didn't think much of the The Last Jedi, too long and the disney influence in certain parts i didn't like at all. But to give 1 or 2, 3 is ridiculous, i mean really...all the work that goes into these things...i'm looking forward to Rise Of SkyWalker."
2719,7,Enjoyed it,"Okay, first off, is it a perfect movie? No. "
2720,8,Are these bad reviews written by George Lucas?,Basically a remake of 'New Hope'. Just not a very good one.
2721,7,It could of been better!!,"I did not have any specific expectations when I walked into this movie. I had not read any reviews or talked to anyone who had watched it. Having merely seen a couple of images from the marketing campaign and the (current at that moment) 8.5 rating on IMDb, I simply hoped for something halfway palatable. "
2722,1,Star Wars: A Rip-Off of Episode 4,"I will keep this review short and sweet. After watching the film I decided that the pacing of it was too fast. I understand that there was a lot of ground to cover, but the characters had little development (Aside from Rey). I felt that the relationships formed too fast. I would have appreciated a bit more time spent on details of back story and side story."
2723,8,A film that chases the original trilogy,"I think this movie actually grasped the ideas of the force without a teacher rather well. The fact that Ray was able to have such quick skills flying the Millennium Falcon and learning to shoot the gun so well were examples. She also had a vision, which is clearly not something she was trying to have. It was just that the Lightsaber launched this vision by its connection to her and the force. I didn't quite understand how she was able to make the Storm Trooper do what she wanted. At the start of the movie, they think the force and Jedi are myths. And she's lived alone in a desert on Jakku almost her entire life. So how did she even know she could do that with the force? It wasn't like Kylo Ren did it and she learned from it. And they didn't show anything like that in her vision for her to have remembered. It just seemed odd. That was such a fun scene, but for her character, it actually was badly written. "
2724,8,Star wars planets/bases and uses of the force,"The first time I saw this the movie, was on a visit in the US. I had extremely high expectation. The movie lived up to all my expectations, and even a bit more! J.J. Abrams did a tremendous job as a director, and made a close to perfect Star Wars Movie. A great way to continue the saga! When it comes to the cast of the movie, I really like that the original stars where brought back to do their old characters, but there is a sad part regarding that. Spoiler Alert: The fact that the beloved Han Solo is killed by Kylo Ren, also known as Ben Solo, Han and Leias son, made me and and at least the people sitting next to me in the movie theater cry like babies. This underlines one of the things i like the most about this movie; it plays a bit with your feelings. All in all this is a movie i would recommend to everyone, but I believe you should have watched the original trilogy, before taking on this movie! May the force be with us all!"
2725,10,One of my all time favorite movies!,"I'm a Star Wars fan since I can remember. I was 7 when I watched the original trilogy on VHS (not the special editions if curious) and began to love this series growing up. While I do agree with the prequels being bad, I don't hate Episodes I and III like everyone else. Except Episode II because that was just a shallow, cynical fan service film that was crap. So my thoughts going into the new one is with anticipation and put aside my fanboyism by judging this film on its own. Does it succeed? Yes."
2726,10,A fantastic reintroduction to this great franchise!,*SPOILER ALERT (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!)*
2727,7,A Decent Homage With Many Flaws,"This new edition to the Star Wars franchise is arguably the best by far. It combines the time-tested formula with the new and raw ideas Disney brings to the table. From the moment the traditional text crawl appears, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat serving you with action-packed scenes and unpredictable reveals that will surely make you wanting for more."
2728,9,Arguably the best Star Wars film by far,"Promising start to sequel trilogy, but ultimately ruined by the entirely inept Last Jedi."
2729,7,Promising Start to Sequels...,"This is the first SW movie i got to see in theaters as an adult or that i can remember. I've seen all the movies 10 times over. As for TFA. I love it!!! I've seen it 4 times now and want to continue to see it again. Now to critic. As a fan-boy i want to say that this movie is a 10, but it's not lol. Although i'd rate it no higher then a 9 but no lower then an 8.5. This review is based off my first viewing. "
2730,9,TFA Great flick,"Last straw was Rose saving Finn, ruining a potential hero moment that would have helped redeemed this utter mess."
2731,7,Horrible,"This movie has in it everything we superficially recognize as Star Wars: chases, banter, light sabers, great characters (well mostly.... Phasma and Tonfa-guy are totally silly and pointless IMHO) plus good acting and direction. The sad thing is that it totally lacked an idea or any courage and had way too-much lip service to fans. It's a nice but empty retread of things already known, I rate this as fan-fiction at best. I'm flabbergasted that someone got paid to write this story that is just a mix and match of plot-lines, characters, and events from the previous episodes. This movie is kinda like BB-8: you may like it but you know he's just a R2-D2 clone and not the real thing. I'm surprised people seem to like this any better than the prequels.﻿"
2732,3,"Nice but empty, fan-fiction at best","It's better than you'd expect. Lots of twists, and LOTS OF NOSTALGIA. You get to see everything, and i mean EVERYTHING you want in a star wars movie. The graphics are certainly a lot better, everything is much more advanced. The whole movie in the end would want you to wait for the next one, however, it's great. New characters are great, actors are okay. Ray was spectacular, Finn was good as well. Harrison Ford had a big role in the movie, unlike what the trailers suggest. Disney has certainly added it's good touches, unlike what I expected. The sith had a good role, actor was okay, It was the general sith stories, what you'd expect to be honest. However, lots of unpredictable questions came up."
2733,10,Awesome,I was so looking forward to this film and while it was very very good it was also a bit disappointing. It was a remake of Ep IV.
2734,9,Very good with some bad parts,"I was born the year the first Star Wars movie came out on billboards in 1977, and was always a fan of the first trilogy that went to the movies. Not convinced of the outcome of the second trilogy comes to light in 1999 decided to use my sceptically mode to the biggest challenge of JJ Abrams, satisfy Warsies who know history and have lived all the franchise."
2735,9,Star Wars Chapter 7,"First of all, how everyone seems to forget that Kylo Ren was shot with a weapon that kills armed stormtroopers with one shot? That's why Finn and Rey managed to fight with him. It was seen earlier in the movie that Rey can fight, so is it a big surprise that she could keep up with a wounded Sith apprentice. Rey was connected to the force which gave her an advantage. I have to admit the one scene where Kylo acted like a teenager, was a disappointment for me. I'm talking about the one in which he destroyed the room with his light saber (again). It ate away Kylo Ren's credibility. But in this case, the Sith in this movie is really a person you wish would die. J.J Abrams made you hate the villain, because of Han. The former villains, especially Vader, were admired. Hating the villain might turn out to be a good thing in the upcoming films."
2736,8,Not flawless but very satisfying.,"I understand all those bad reviews, because people who were most obsesses with the Star Wars universe feel the urge to speak out. But in my opinion the 1/10 voters are simply ****OVER*****exaggerrating. The film is great, if you consider what it has to live up to. I went to the cinema not expecting much, and to be honest I went quite prejudiced because I refused to believe that Disney could do a decent job with this. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. I believe that the started up with secure grounds, repeating the original story a bit (ok, maybe a lot) but it was also giving a familiarity to the whole thing. Considering this is 30 years post-war, it is understandable that things are not that different from where we left them and -I hope this does not sound as a spoiler as the cast is already known, the fact that the old protagonists have a lot to do with the plot line and how the characters behave, it is understandable that they act similarly, the old ones do what they know and the new ones try to live up to the legends.Up to that point, all repetition is acceptable. There is one point of course where you understand that Disney simply went too far with copy-pasting in the sake of securing the whole ""sticking with the original trilogy recipe"" plan. But overall I have a hope that this was a testing for 8 and 9 to see what was too much and what not. I have hope that the following film will be better, but I still have to give a fairly good rating to this one. To me rating it independently from the others, objectively, this film does not deserve lower than a 6- 7.It's a good film guys. It simply isn't awesome."
2737,7,"Objectively, better than the prequels, not matching the originals.","All these reviews and Youtube videos filled with hate, like your lives depend on Star Wars. It's just a movie, get over it. Does it have a lot in common with the original titles? Yes. But wasn't that what everyone asked for?. I liked it. It's a link between the old and the new, the jokes had the feel of the original movies, which was really, really nice. I really dig it. Very good actors (OK, maybe the weakest is Adam Driver's performance, but it wasn't that bad either). Did you really dislike Episode VII? OK, then don't go watch Episode VIII. But wait, you will probably go anyway because you love being so controversial on the internet. It doesn't matter if it is a new director, you will probably hate it too. Because hey, controversy. I mean, it's not like you have to love the movies, but do you really need to have such strong hate feelings? Chill a little, please. I think it's a really good movie. I liked it. I look forward to see how these new characters will develop. Kudos on bringing the old Star Wars back, adding fresh air."
2738,9,What's not to like?,Basically a reboot and utilising bargain basement versions of characters from the classic trilogy. 
2739,6,"Not terrible, not great either.","After a year of skepticism, cynicism, and the like, Episode VII is finally here...and I couldn't be happier! Everything that was hated in the prequels is mostly absent from this installment and, it is a jolt of lightning for the series. We once again have a Star Wars with relatable, deep, and charming characters, meaningful, well-written dialogue, and beautiful, practical special effects. My one true criticism is unfortunately a spoiler, so I won't go into details. One thing people are having a problem with is the abundance of parallels between 1977's original. These parallels are obvious and whether or not they are an issue is up to opinion. Overall, it didn't bother me in the slightest. If you're a fan ready to see Star Wars returned to its former glory, it's time to buy your ticket (or DVD/Blu-Ray depending on when you're seeing this review)!"
2740,8,"The Force is awoken, alive, and well",I am old enough to have seen every Star Wars film in their original runs and have been a fan of the franchise from the beginning. Seems like everyone wants to be a professional movie critic these days. I read reviews where people just want to complain at a level that tells more about how unhappy they are rather than taking a movie for what it it. Then you have the movie studio shills writing ridiculously positive reviews that makes this film comparable to Citizen Cane. Finally you have the hard-core fans that will not complain about this film under any condition. My message is simple...Lighten Up.
2741,7,"People Need To Lighten Up. It Wasn't Great, but it was Fun.",I guess I'll focus in this review on something I've always held as one of the best things about the Star Wars franchise: The soundtracks.
2742,1,What new can I say?,"The story is supposedly 30 years after the defeat of the empire, yet there is no changes from the period of Episode VI. If we see the advancement in our own life and what was achieved in 30 years it is nonsensical that there was not improvement in the 30 years of the plot. One of the reasons that the original trilogy gain so much popularity was because it mixed since fiction and fantasy. I was expecting that a new episode will have more interesting things to show us, development, advancement, instead it looks like the only gimmick in the new episode is casting back the original stars from the trilogy. nice idea but you cannot expect that this only fact will be enough for these days viewers. but there is one thing good I can say about episode VII. 'It could have been worse'. If Hayden Christensen would have been cast in the film it would have become a disaster, without Christensen its just another failure. I hate it when a film is without a story (a poor plot or just a ripoff from other films) but I hate it even more when a bad actor makes the film just a nightmare. Hayden Christensen makes a film intolerable (in all of his films). I could not decide which was worse and which destroyed the film more, Austin Butler in 'The Shannara Chronicles' or Hayden Christensen in Star wars (or pretty much in all of his films)."
2743,,One thing good,"First of all, before you discount this review, let's not forget the route the prequels took. They completely abandoned the tone that the original trilogy had set and went for something completely different that ended up being a combination of poorly written and acted films. At least the force awakens went back to the roots of star wars- the films we all love the most. Look, I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't as original as it could've been, but honestly, it was just good to see star wars back. And also, there were many things this movie did well- acting was phenomenal(Rey and Finn are great additions to the series), the cinematography exceeds any other star wars film has done, john Williams is back (though his score isn't as out there as some of the other films were), and the writing is good... for the most part. You could get all salty about it and just look at the similarities, but I think that's a good thing. They stuck to the roots of star wars and while it may not have been as unique as everyone wanted it, it's a good film nonetheless."
2744,8,It returned to the roots of star wars... something the prequels failed to do,"MONEY: Remember folks, movie makers it's all about making money and entertain you. ITS A MOVIE!!"
2745,10,Not a review but a comment for the public,"I have seen the movie last night in the Midnight Premier in Germany(17th Dec.2015). I was so excited to watch it, it almost killed me for the past year. Yes I love Star Wars!!! I have read all the books that are out there as well as I have watch all the movies and TV Shows. And that maybe the Problem with TFA for me. My expectation was just too high! I wanted to see the perfect movie. but that normally never happens when I go to the Cinema. And that what happened with TFA as well. It is definitely an good movie with awesome Special effects, but a good Story is missing. Manny other Users here have written that it is a Remake of the first Movie that came out(Episode IV A new hope )and I have to agree with them. Desert Planet; Death Star; one Main Character dies... BUT never the less I think that this movie will lead into a bright future for the Star Wars franchise. And the upcoming Spin Offs and Episodes because the new characters definitely have potential to develop into something great. At the End I would like to say that I somehow expected it to be a Little bit disappointing but that is what you get when you are so super excited before a movie is released. ( Sorry for my bad English I am not a native speaker) THX JJ and George for another two hours not wasted in an cinema."
2746,8,Movie OK but unfortunately not Awesome,"I saw the last chain in the Star Wars series with my wife yesterday. It has been a while since the last Star Wars movie hit the theaters and ""a long"" while since we saw a ""good"" Star Wars movie. "
2747,8,Force is Strong with This One,"Although I loved the way the movie was filmed and how it looked (much more like the three first SW movies and therefore much more real than part I-III) I was disappointed. It's very clear that Disney and not Lucasfilms was behind the movie. The movie was, as many people said, entirely predictable with no surprises anywhere, and looked like a remake of part IV. Some of the emotional scenes were 'thickened' to the extreme using music and long shots. There were a few instances where the acting was really bad. But there were good things too: there is a bar in this movie again which looked very good and seems cozy, we see a bit more of the interior of the Millennium Falcon, and it was great to see the original actors from the first films again. So all in all I give the movie a 7 out of 10."
2748,7,Star Wars Disneyfied,"I was not even born when the first star wars movie was released, so unfortunately i will never know that feeling to see the very first Science Fiction movie ever, but i am thankful for the effort that was put in all the movies. The Force Awakens is one of my favorites from the entire SAGA. I enjoyed every second of the movie and i'm looking up for the next Star Wars films. I really hope that the next movies will be even better than this one, even though this was almost perfect. The actors are doing an amazing job with their roles. Rey is an amazing character, and i'm so curios about her origins, also Rey and Finn are so funny when they are together, i really like that the movie has humor. I saw that many people didn't like Kylo Ren because of some reasons, but i gotta say that Adam Driver did an amazing job as Kylo Ren, and also the character is interesting, reckless, but interesting! So, if you want to watch a really great SF movie, just go and watch Star Wars the Force Awakens, you can easily understand the story, even if you haven't watched the first star wars movies! May The Force Be With You!!!"
2749,10,A Movie Worth Watching,"The first installment in the new Star Wars trilogy is certainly a lot of fun. It brings to the table some very impressive visuals, some excellent moments, and, in my opinion, some of the most well written and well-acted characters in the history of the franchise. Overall, there is really one glaring issue I have with the film, and that's its usage of backtracking and fan-service. It's obvious that J.J. Abrams wanted to bring back the glory and the feel of the original trilogy. Unfortunately, without giving anything away plot-wise, the story re- packages similar locations, plot-points, and moments from past films, especially Episode IV. If there was something I appreciated about the second trilogy (Episodes I-III), it's that it tried to expand the universe into new locations and situations. Much of this new episode simply feels too similar to the old films to the point where it gets to feeling unoriginal. Still, Episode VII is a good starting point, and I am very interested to see where the next installments go."
2750,7,A New Hope for a New Trilogy,In my opinion the best Star Wars I've seen since The Empire Strikes back. I rank it as the best. My heart was pounding at parts of the movie. It was absolutely amazing. I will be watching it again and again. It was so worth the wait. I love it. So many great elements in it. It was visually beautiful. It was the Star Wars we know and love. Way better than the overstuffed cgi prequels. It was action packed and was linking things together. I didn't want it to end and it sets so much up for the future episodes. ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY WITHOUT A DOUBT AMAZING. New characters are so wonderful in this movie and I really ended up loving them alongside the original cast. The first order looks so powerful. I'm a very happy Star Wars fan. I can't wait for Rogue One. Most importantly Episode 8 because The Force Awakens leaves you with so many questions. It makes you want more which is so great. The best Star Wars. WATCH IT.
2751,10,Absolutely loved it from beginning to end.,"It was ok, because of some scenes (sword of Skywalker), but overall it was not satisfying enough. Too different from the original storyline and not enough credibility."
2752,7,"Too many questions, not enough story","Episode VII is a movie that was massively hyped up before release. As a result, it was extremely disappointing to many. I was skeptical but hopeful before watching this movie once I learned JJ Abrams and Disney would be taking the helm (Disney certainly has the funding and I thought Abrams did a decent job with the Star Trek movies). Sadly, I feel this movie really did fail to live up to its potential overall."
2753,4,"Mediocre at best, absurd at worst","***WARNING-CONTAINS SPOILERS-YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*** SW:TFA is everything that the franchise needed. It has fresh new heroes and a beautifully crafted storyline that delves deeper into the lives of fond characters like Han Solo and Leia Organa, as well as adding mystery to the fate of Luke Skywalker. The film was a nice change to the somewhat rushed prequels (despite what some people say; it's just my personal opinion)and showed the devoted Fannies of the franchise how these characters have progressed since VI and how the galaxy has changed with them over time, shown by the emergence of the First Order from the ashes of the Sith."
2754,,A beautiful return to a fantastic franchise,"First of all, I created this account entirely to review this movie and give an explanation that most die-hard Star Wars fans should understand, as well as those who enjoy Star Wars in general and were looking forward to an excellent movie."
2755,10,Review from a Fan and Realistic Point of View,When I went to see this movie I was expecting a fun time and a great movie. I think that J.J. Abrams gave all of us what we wanted and needed. It was an awesome movie and I can't wait to see it again.
2756,9,The best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi,"Hi Reader, I'm quite confused about some of the critics about this movie. Yes there are a couple of ""catch""-phrases that could easily left out to make it even more exciting."
2757,10,Delivers a spectacle far beyond imagined,"The look in Luke's eyes, at the end of the film tells it all. How much pain and suffering has the Force created? Eternally recurring in a flesh and blood balancing act? Abusing Force ""Sensitives"" to go dark or light to achieve balance? Why give the Hand of God to man? "" The fault dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings."" JAWS has the Shark, Star Wars has the FORCE. Kylo Ren Eaten, Snoke Eaten, Luke Eaten, Leia Eaten, Rey being Eaten, Finn Being Eaten, Han EATEN, Chewie being Eaten, This story is far darker than what any of us expected. The Mass genocide and violence is major for a Star Wars { Disney } movie. I know your out there, force sensitives. Feel the FORCE and become the ONE."
2758,9,The Force is the Star of the Show,"Force Awakens is a solid foundation, and a non-stop action packed nostalgically entertaining opening episode for this new trilogy. However it does have its flaws, which is why I can't say I loved it as much as I wanted to, and which is why I have given it 7/10. Being a massive fan of the OT and a satisfied junkie with the Prequels, I may have made the mistake of over hyping The Force Awakens to a point where nothing could actually meet expectations. I went to see it first in standard 3D and it just didn't feel right. I left the cinema with very mixed feelings; something didn't capture me as it should have done, or perhaps as much as I desperately wanted it to. I knew I had to see it again to decide. So last night I went to see it this time in 2D, in terms of cinematography it translates far better than the 3D version, and more importantly it feels like a Star Wars movie."
2759,7,While not perfect it delivers a fun filled Episode VII that lays a solid foundation for the future!,"There is a common theme in the negative reviews. 1 - Kylo Ren being matched by a girl with no training and 2 - Story based on a New Hope. Answer 1 - Kylo Ren is not trained yet. He has only had basic jedi training so his powers are weak. He is about to be trained by the most powerful of the sith - Darth Plagueis who was the master of Sidious, so....power is coming. We don't know Rey's origins yet so the fact she can use the force is a good thing because the stage is set for an epic battle of Jedi against Sith which is what Star Wars is all about. Answer 2 - Did you not want to see a battle of Jedi and Sith/good against evil/ an empire type fleet against a rebellion/ a Star Wars!!! People who complain this movie is like A New Hope are people who complain about anything and everything and for the sake of complaining and most importantly, do not know what Star Wars is about. The fact remains episodes 1-6 was all about anakin/vader and his path to the dark side and back. It was about Jedi against Sith so for Star Wars to be good, the Sith and Jedi must be good characters and they have created fantastic characters in Kylo Ren and Rey. So perfect start to the new series. One last note, the original setting was a must. It's only 30 years later."
2760,10,To the haters and complainers,"OK, so it's not Empire, but Empire is not Empire to the folks that love A New Hope. People like what they like. But to call this a bad movie or to say it's a copy of the original is sorely misrepresenting this film. "
2761,7,Don't listen to the Trolls! Good flick!,"The thrill of Star Wars is back to its best. The movie is a masterpiece with all the best elements of A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi combined with some spectacular visuals. Its a feast to watch while also constantly engaging the viewer with well timed action sequences and fluid acting. A lot of talk about the movie being too PC, but personally I thought John Boyega and Daisy Ridley were perfect in their roles. The chemistry between all actors felt extremely natural and dynamic. A common complaint would be the ""predictability"" of the movie but this really depends on what you think about the characters."
2762,10,"Raise your expectations, I promise you won't be disappointed.","I have to be honest with myself. For some reason when I watched this movie it felt like there was something missing. The prequels to the original get so much constant hate and criticism and no one points out the positive things about those movies.. .. I actually enjoyed watching those movies more than this one despite some cheesy lines, over use of CGI and annoying characters like JaJa.. <br /><br /> I feel this way because episodes 1-3 still had that magic touch.. I don't know what it is but it still maintained a certain type of feel and flow of the original movies. It had things about those movies that were very memorable, original, yet still felt familiar.. That is what I feel was lacking in this one. There was nothing about it that really stood out.. It tried to be Star Wars so hard, but it failed. It just felt like ""someone else"" was trying to copy and remake the Star Wars theme.. None of the characters were memorable.. None of the fight scenes were really memorable.. Each one of the Star Wars movies before it had something that really stood out . I could watch all six of the Star Wars movies over again .... But this one I feel like after watching it once.. I don't really care if I see it again. Even Harrison Ford didn't look into it. It was like someone dragged him out of bed and forced him to do this movie.. His acting was very lack luster. "
2763,6,7 but still my least favorite,People are giving this film high marks because it 'feels' right. It 'feels' like the Star Wars we know. But this feels like Star Wars the same way a $5 IKEA wood effect table feels like real hand-crafted wood.
2764,2,Cynical Nostalgic Trash,"I don't think this review will contain plot spoilers, but just in case..."
2765,10,Loved it. Will be seeing multiple times while in theatres.,"Anyone who says the film's story is bad or is a remake is living in the past. It is a good film with elements from the original trilogy that made them good, but it didn't remake them. It avoided possible easy story telling and did spring some surprises which were not expected or theorised. John Williams nailed the score (we all expected him too anyway). Harrison Ford didn't come across as old or worn out, he was Han Solo, not Harrison ford playing Han solo. Daisy Ridley nailed the character of Rey and Adam Driver did exceptional with Kylo Ren. Adam avoided completely changing character when Kylo removed his mask and never showed signs of cheesy villain acting. Two of my worries were: The Humour and How original characters were used. The Humour was great as it didn't come across like the characters were trying to be funny or didn't make us think that the director was telling us to laugh (if that makes sense). The use of original characters was outstanding because it wasn't a nostalgia fest where old characters took it turns to show up and not have any relevance. They contributed to the story as R2D2 wasn't in their as much as BB-8 but they both have a major importance to the story."
2766,9,"Recommend, brilliant balance of nostalgia and modern techniques and characters","Star Wars: The Force Awakens was the first ever movie to get me 'hyped', so you kind of get the picture what it really meant to me. I walked into the theater with huge excitement, awaiting for the that legendary intro to pop up on the big screen. It was my second time ever to have a chance to watch a Star Wars movie in a theater. The first one was the infamous Episode III. 'STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS' starts rolling along with the well-known Star Wars soundtrack. The goosebumps on my skin were real. I couldn't believe I was watching something that should be considered a phenomenon! After a bit more than 10 years, I could gorge upon a sequel to one of the most recognizable motion pictures in human history."
2767,9,"The best, at the right time",The main issue with Force Awakens is the storyline. It's a reboot of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. It doesn't continue the storyline but instead reverts it back to bring Harrison Ford's dream of Han's death to fruition. Ford so desperate for Han Solo to die lacks the vision to see how it destroys the franchise and characters established in the originals.
2768,8,Good but not great,"I am a Star Wars fan and my expectations for Episode 7 were VERY high, but this film lives up to my expectations! Wonderful actors, fantastic set design, an impressive music score and perfect visual effects! And listen- this isn't the full list of things which are great in this movie! There's much humor with many funny jokes and the lonely disadvantage is that the plot is nearly the same as Episode 4. Before I've watched this movie, I feared that the new actors (John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac) wouldn't perform well- but they did a very good job! The whole time I sat in the cinema I've been impressed and it was the same at my second an third time! It isn't the best film ever, but one of the best Star Wars films! So finally it must be said that ""Star Wars: The force awakens"" is a fantastic sequel and good beginning of a new trilogy!"
2769,7,One of the best Star Wars films!,"I usually don't write reviews, but this time I felt compelled to do so, since so many are talking bad about this movie. "
2770,9,"Beautiful film, with minor flaws","When I first saw this movie in the theaters back in December of 2015, I loved it. Sure, it had it issues, but seeing it in the theater brought a wave of nostalgia over me and made me wonder if this was how people felt seeing the original Star Wars in theaters. However, 9 months later, the nostalgia has worn off. Does the movie hold up without that lens? Well... kinda. The movie is nowhere near as good as I remembered it being. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Not at all. In fact, it's better than most big budget movies. Let's start with what worked. For starters, most of the new cast was really good. John Boyega's Finn was portrayed very well. I liked the new movie's approach of making stormtroopers more than just faceless baddies to wipe out. It added a weight to seeing them get blown away by the heroes. BB-8, while obviously only existing as a marketing device, was an effective marketing device nonetheless. Kylo Ren is easily the most compelling villain Star Wars has had since Return of the Jedi. His story and conflict made him an extremely interesting character that I look forward to seeing more of. Poe Dameron was tacked on to the plot later in the movie, but in the scenes he was in I found him to be a very fun character. The only new character I really don't enjoy so far is Rey. As Max Landis controversially but accurately stated, Rey is just too good at everything. Maybe some of it makes sense, and maybe it will be better explained in later movies, but I really don't see where her character can really go outside of the mystery surrounding her. Next up, the story. It was a simple plot, using elements from the past 6 movies and mixing it together with new ideas to create a new plot. It was okay enough, serviceable, but not particularly great. The only storyline in the movie I found myself particularly invested in was Kylo Ren's internal conflict, which was great. Let's talk about the directing. J.J. Abrams excelled at visual storytelling in this movie. A particular scene that stood out to me was the final confrontation between Kylo Ren and Han Solo. The use of lighting and music in that scene made it so much more powerful and heartbreaking. That being said, some unfortunate J.J. Abrams tropes made it into the movie, like the lens flares in the Starkiller base fire destroying multiple planets, a scene that would have been much more powerful if it weren't so distracting. To put it simple, the movie had a lot of issues, but where it was good, it was great. This movie restored Star Wars and made me hopeful for the future. Here's hoping it learns from its mistakes and gives us a spectacular episode VIII."
2771,7,Nostalgia Glasses Off,I've seen a lot of 1/10 ratings on here. So many that I felt I needed to actually create an account and defend this film.
2772,9,In Defense of Episode VII,"J.J. Abrams has made a spectacular film. The force Awakens is fun, entertaining, nostalgic, and, in the end, Star Wars. But just a kind of remake for the new generation."
2773,6,"Next Attempt, try with Shakespeare","I find it difficult in where to begin with this abomination, as there is so much to comment on and IMDb only allow 1,000 words. I could write a better trilogy of books as to what is wrong with this film and why you should avoid it. "
2774,1,"Yet another blockbuster money maker, with little story telling and substance","Yes, yes, yes it is in fact a distinct parallel to A New Hope in many ways. I have heard this as a reason for why some people have given this film a low rating. However, I think the parallels are far from lazy but rather beautiful and have more meaning than one might initially recognize. "
2775,8,A journey for Star Wars fans both old and new,"You are all entitled to your own opinions.... sadly fanatic star wars fan cant just sit down and enjoy a movie for what it is. They have to put every single frame under a microscope and start comparing and analyzing. The force awakens isn't perfect and yes it has flaws, yes it ""borrowed"" some ideas from the original films yet its entertaining and that is why people go to the movies (unless they are just bored out of their mind)."
2776,8,Star Wars fans....,"How I've waited for this movie. Ever since I was a kid I've loved Star Wars and its universe and characters. Me and my brothers acted out scenes from the film in our backyard and my childhood memories are full Star Wars, and that's why I became so excited for this film."
2777,8,Great and grasping film with some amazing moments but some dependency problems,"I don't understand the people who are giving this film a bad review.. I believed they are comparing this movie to original classic well don't because there will be no another classic but like every generation this movie is best in it's own ways.. And so do speak I have been waiting for this for my whole life because I never ever has a chance to see any of star wars series on big screen only in DVD so I'm glad that I've seen one on big screen and everyone should have, too. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the best movie I've ever seen in the big screen. It was remarkable, best and marvelous. It's like Lord Vader said ""Impressive. Most impressive"""
2778,10,Remarkable and Impressive,"Where to begin, of course there are many thing to say, most good but so much not so good.. I liked the movie, and it felt like Star Wars, but it also screams Disney, with all it's little drama's and humor."
2779,7,spoiler alert on a long awaited return,Star Wars:The Force Awakens is a fresh but familiar return to one of the most beloved cinema epics in history. The baton has been officially passed on to the new generation of characters because they steal the show.
2780,10,The Force Awakens is an expertly made film. Im going to have to watch it multiple times at the cinema.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens came out in 2015. Directed by J.J Abrams(the director who previously revived Star Trek franchise), it's set three decades after Empire's defeat, and follows two major characters who are caught up in search for franchise's main character, Luke Skywalker."
2781,6,Made for longtime fans,"The most successful movie franchises are the ones that capture our imagination, the movies that makes us believe that an abandoned orphan living under the stairs can have magical abilities. A boy that grew up on a desolate planet can rid the galaxy of an evil empire. A mosquito containing a drop of blood can create a park where we can interact with species that went extinct 65 million years ago. Movies containing childlike wonder, those are the most likely to attract millions to the box office. "
2782,9,JJ Abrams' Star Wars,This film was visually stunning. However I feel it was simply a remake of episode IV: A New Hope with a subplot attached. I was and still am disappointed with the way this movie turned
2783,7,A remake,"Firstly, I have to admit that I'm a Star Wars virgin! I have never seen any of the previous movies. I didn't go to see this for myself, I took a young man with learning difficulties for a fun activity. For the most part, it held his attention. As for me – well, I just don't see the appeal of the movie for adults. Sure it's great for under 15's and wouldn't dream of knocking them for their enjoyment! "
2784,3,I just don't get it,After watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens I feel like it had a lot to prove because the previous episode (Return of the Jedi) and its amazingly high reputation in the film industry. So I think J.J. Abrams did a great job in rebooting a franchise that is close to fans hearts.
2785,8,Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review,"I know this, among many other reviews, will just find themselves lost in translation with thousands of others. But that wont deter me from conveying how simply awesome this movie was. It was truly a Star Wars movie. To have just enough fresh material meshed so fluidly with the old stuff everyone loves is really a masterful feat."
2786,9,A Real Star Wars Movie,"Spoilers may be involved Everyone is so concerned about elements of this movie being very similar to ""the original trilogy"" and I have to say those are the same people complaining how different the prequel movies were. A lot of people I talk to or read reviews are comparing this one movie to the 3 original trilogy movies, please remember it is the beginning of a new trilogy, a new generation of fans. This movie isn't fan service the way people want it to be. I for one loved this movie. The action is some of the best we will ever see on screen. The script is fantastic. The actors are perfect. The death of Han Solo is what needs to happen at that moment. Kylo Ren is played to perfection by Adam Driver and I'll tell you why. Kylo is a man emotionally torn. He is being pulled from both sides of the force/life. He's fighting it internally and that would create angsty behavior prone to tantrums. Finn is not a Jedi. He doesn't wield the lightsaber decent at all he gets beat by a storm trooper and Kylo is damaged from Chewbaca shooting him and the trauma of just killing his father. Rey on the other hand and this is my guess for the future is/or was trained for a while before being hidden, she has also been on a very hostile world and has learned how to survive which explains why she is able to pick up the saber and handle her own. Anyways this movie is the beginning its not all the movies in one. Go see it enjoy it"
2787,10,The beginning of something bigger!!,"I'm no fan of Star Wars since that franchise isn't very popular in my hometown. However, the huge buzz around this installment is what seduced me to watch this one. And guess what, I believe this work deserves an Oscar."
2788,9,"Terrific, fantastic, absorbing, surprisingly satisfying even for a non-fan",I'll try to make this review quick.
2789,6,"Not the worst film, but......","First of all, like many of you, I was a 5 year old when my dad took me to the largest cinema in town to see Star Wars A new Hope. But my fondest memory comes from watching over 10 times the second installment The Empire Strikes Back, so the expectation for Return of the Jedi was equal or above The Forcé Awakens. "
2790,9,Watch the film first Spoilers ahead. Best crawl ever,"The new star wars movie wasn't bad but it could have been waaaaay better.That movie is cool but I think the ending of one of the most popular saga in the galaxy deserve a better ending.Once again disney,you deceived me."
2791,6,Could have been better,**SPOILER FREE**
2792,9,Great Film - remember its aimed at KIDS!!,"So for everyone that thinks this movie compares to the original 3 movies, you are sadly mistaken. Episodes 4-6 were amazing. This one compares to more of 2 or 3 at best. For one, the girl just pretty much starts using the force in a day and pretty much whoops Kylo who was trained at an early age...WTH? The acting was better than Ep 1-3 but still was lacking. Carrie and Harrison weren't there once great selves and really didn't show the spirit they once had. They didn't seem into the parts so much. The girl that plays Ray was great. Kylo was more of a gripy little child than a Sith. Any of the other Sith would have killed him just for being the way he acted. Overall a good movie, but not Star Wars quality, or at least not what it was hyped up to be by any means. Should have given the whole thing another title and just started from scratch."
2793,6,"Good movie, but not comparable to Ep 4-6, more of 2 or 3.","Completely recycled story, this movie is really a remake of episode 4. Rey she's technology wizard, learns to fly the millennium falcon in 5 minutes with no prior flight experience unlike Luke who was already trained as a pilot, she also learns to use the force with no prior force experience after just being told about it uses mind tricks which took Luke several years to learn to do. Not only that she also kicks the ever- living crap out of Ren with no prior jedi training at all compared to Ren that has experience of both the light and the dark side of the force."
2794,1,This movies makes episode 1 - 3 look good,"J.J Abrams has no without doubt constructed and delivered the best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. Better yet, the best Star Wars film after Empire and A New Hope. Jedi isn't as definitely having good things in it, but without doubt planted the seed for what was to come in the Prequels. Ewoks anyone? Like I said though still a great film, but not Star Wars good.."
2795,10,Better than the older fans want you to believe. (No Spoilers),This was an absolutely wonderful movie. Ever since I was 4 years old I've attended star wars openings. And the force awakens was no different. Was it like the old movies no of course not but it was a new take on an ever expanding universe. Everyone on here throwing up 1 or 2 stars are just but hurt. They complain about Disney or JJ Abrams directing it. But the truth is they did a fantastic job revitalizing an old series. With the thrills of space battles and a story that is set up for many many more movies the star wars franchise will grow larger. It's our jobs as fans to make it the best series possible. So please for the love of God ignore all of these idiots and see the movie. You will not be disappointed
2796,9,The movie was great... Stop the whining,First of all I am only writing this review in response to seeing some hugely unfair critiques on this website. Every film has flaws but to label The Force Awakens a 4 star film (0.6 above the average rating for Jack and Jill) is beyond harsh. In general criticism appears to revolve around
2797,9,Tremendously entertaining regardless of the slightly derivative plot,"This film, compared to the rest of the titles, was bound to get mercilessly torn to shreds by Star Wars fan boys. Most of the negative reviews I've seen are more about people comparing the movie to the original trilogy (which is nearly impossible to measure up to), or about people being upset that the film wasn't what they expected or wanted. Sure, it would've been cool to see a couple different things happen and maybe I would've liked it more if character X did this instead of that... But I'm not J.J Abrahms. "
2798,9,Great movie,"""The Dark Side. The Jedi. It's all real."" - Han solo"
2799,7,"God, Rta, Dao, the Force.","I do not work for Disney Bad Reboot as a contractor so I can be honest  and, as such, I hope this helps you.  This movie stunk. None of it made sense. the plot, such as it is, was  copied (nay cloned) from the first trilogy, but the acting was bad and  none of it made sense.  Why would there be a map in a robot (rip off alert!) when someone  doesn't want to be found? Why would there be a death star that can be  destroyed by a flaw by flying in trenches (rip off alert!) when the  flaw is known? Why would there be an orphan on a desert planet (rip off  alert!) who is scavenging for food, but can fly space ships and teaches  Han how to do it too? I can go on and on, but safe to say this 'movie'  sucks as does the next sequel/reboot.  Sorry, Disney contractors. I know you put food on the table by spamming  and giving this 10/10, but let's be real."
2800,,I Am Not Personally In Love With JJ Abrams So I Can be Objective,"I simply can not comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review! It was, without a doubt, brilliant. The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes, it feels like you're actually IN the ship. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters vs returning characters and story lines was brilliant. "
2801,10,Freaking amazing,I'm gonna get straight to the Point (sorry I'm late been lazy) 
2802,7,"A very good movie, not the worst in the series but definitely not the best","Good, what I expected, I guess. My mom and dad took me to see A New Hope when I was 14? Ground breaking, fresh,new, a little camp, but so what right? There was so much to see for the first time! We freaked out when they went to LightSpeed the first time!"
2803,8,The Disney feeling of the Force is strong with this one.,"One of the most popular film franchises in history is back. Star Wars: The Force Awakens begins 30 years after the conclusion of Return of the Jedi. A new threat has arisen in the galaxy in the form of the First Order. Led by Supreme Leader Snoke and his right-hand men, General Hux and Kylo Ren, the First Order has constructed a new weapon with the capability of destroying planets. The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa, seeks to stop the First Order and destroy their weapon. It is up to a scavenger abandoned on a desert planet, a former stormtrooper, and a couple of familiar faces to aid the Resistance in their mission. Against this backdrop, the mystery of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker's whereabouts looms."
2804,7,It's Back,"Have been shattered. The other user reviews are right, this movie is nothing like a Star Wars film."
2805,1,All my hopes and dreams,"Compared to the originals, I was disappointed, especially considering the hype. my biggest complaint is in some of the dialog between the original cast members."
2806,8,"Big shoes to fill, so this is a sliding scale","So I'm not into big blockbuster movies normally. I prefer more cerebral, laboured, art-house indie films. I find the constant overwhelming spectacle of noise, explosions, and unrealistic worlds which derive from spinoffs of pre-existing lore, mythology, and legends exhausting and cardboard-thin. However with this iteration of Star Wars, and I don't know why the others, including the classics, never had that effect on me, it feels like there's an air of magic, and childhood wonder wrapped into it. Perhaps I'm wrong, but what I got a sense of is that every actor, creative, and person on set had a childhood reverence and excitement in them when it came to making this movie. And it doesn't matter that you will be staring at odd looking aliens, or seeing humans interact with machines in implausible ways, or that people's names, or that of planets, are sometimes outright ridiculous. It matters that, 3 minutes in, you just don't care, and end up watching the whole thing with a smile 3 miles wide. Awesome."
2807,9,Won This Guy Over,"I loved the new movie. I have read plenty of reviews where people tear it apart and rip on it for repeating things the franchise has done in the past. Please chill out. This movie is the next in a classic FRANCHISE. You can't be upset when a franchise follows the formula and pattern that makes the franchise successful. Rocky boxes in every movie. Fast and Furious has lots of fast and crazy car chases. All the Jurassic movies have dinosaurs and mistakes by people. All the Harry Potter movies have magic. Star Wars has light sabers, fights, droids, and good and bad Jedi knights. This movie follows the formula of the first three movies that were very successful because this movie wants to be very successful. J. J. Abrams knows how to make a successful film or television show. If people are ragging on the movie, please remember that it has been almost 40 years since the last good movie and this one was better than Episode IV. Please don't romance the past and remember the movie as something better than it was. The originals are wonderful and classic, but this movie is amazing and follows the formula to keep the franchise successful."
2808,9,Perfect formula for a successful franchise,"The first film I ever saw was Star Wars, in 1977, I was 7 years old, my dad hated it , he didn't get it - this was before the multiplex , at a time when at the end of the film, you could stay in your seat and watch it again, a time when you had to queue round the block to actually get into the cinema, suffice to say it was a long time ago ,,,,,,,"
2809,10,Not a Reboot nor a Remake - this is a Masterpiece!!,"This movie feels like a remake of a previous episode. The development in the abilities of the protagonist happens way, way too quickly for my taste and it leaves me with the impression that the galaxy is safe even though there are still two more movies left."
2810,6,Recycled plot,"One of the best features of this movie it has, unlike the Prequel Trilogy, is its use of practical effects and not overuse of CGI. Now the CGI is not too much of a problem, but it was in the Prequel Trilogy. The BB-8 is outstandingly real, and the food that Rey ate is real too. This movie brought back what the Original Trilogy had: practical effects."
2811,10,The Best Apology Note (Movie) for the Prequel Trilogy,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Star Wars fan. Ever since a kid I have been completely captured by the wonder of the SW universe, whether that be with the films, the novels, the games, you name it..."
2812,7,"A return to form, but it could of been so much more...",This has got to be the best Star Wars movie ever it is so fun and so exciting. And if you're wanting to see this you're in for a treat as this is the best movie ever. So if you haven't watched the other Star Wars movies first I recommend you watch them or else he will be spoiled from this movie but yeah this movie is pretty good although there is some sad parts at the end. There are some spoilers a tribe will not show because you will not get the movie but this movie is the best out of the series maybe start work at eight will be the best and yeah this is a pretty good mood watch it it's the best but watch the first of hours movies first to be happen and be sure we'd good reviews on this movie and Hopefully you'll like it too because I liked it it is full of action lasers lights tapers generaliz hopefully you'll like it too because I liked it it is full of action lasers Lightsabers storm troopers and more!
2813,,Best Star Wars ever,"Full of comedy and continuous action. Did not disappointment for a continuation of a classic collection. With a plot that keeps you guessing 'what will happen next.' I personally have never been sure whether I am a Star Trek Fan or a Star Wars fan, but once I watched this film it proved to me the true side I am on. Obviously, I am a Star Wars fan now and forever. There were times that I cried, lots of times that I succumbed to laughter and other times full of miscellaneous emotions that you will only know if you watch this fantastic masterpiece. In conclusion, I hope you take concern in watching this film because it is worth 2.20 hours of your life."
2814,9,Star Wars Back in Action,"I really enjoy this film with it simple but very entertaining story and good acting from everyone. Many people say it's bad well to that I say Ep. 1, 2 & 3 but each to their own. It's not the best film ever made but neither was the original but it's fun to watch and really gets my inner 7 year old star Wars fan feeling going. But on a serious note, it's a film franchise about wizards with laser swords with edgy teenagers, men in White plastic armour and aliens that look like anything from hammerhead sharks to teddy bears, stop taking it so seriously, critic it by all means but if you don't like it, it ain't gonna kill ya."
2815,7,"Honestly, it really good and entertaining but not great but it's fun","Saw SW:TFA in IMAX 3D. Overall, a disappointing experience. If giga-decibel volume, over-miked banging, multiple explosions and fireballs, a preposterous plot and an unimaginative soundtrack (John Williams: were you really composing that loud but limp music?) qualified for awards this film would sweep the Oscars. IMO the acting was, for the most part, of the deer-in-the-headlights variety. The special effects no big deal... 2001 A Space Odyssey did better. The repetitive ""deus ex machina"" tricks and the over-the-top sound levels detract from a script that seems to have been written by a Playstation programmer. The acting is, for the most part, uninspired; perhaps the cast was reduced to lethargy (hence the over-amped soundtrack?) by the pedestrian script. I don't think I was the only one one to leave the packed movie house unimpressed: I saw few smiles and heard no enthusiastic comments as we filed out. Let me stop right here and summarize: this production does not live up to the hype or its predecessors."
2816,2,Disappointed...,"To be completely honest with you, i was shocked. Every aspects, from actors to sceneries were amazing. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, there was no council meeting, republic voting, all that politic bullshit. It was pure action, the new actors aren't that bad i'll tell you that. I was wondering the whole time:""This seems familiar, i've seen it somewhere..."", then i finally figured it out, it was ""The new hope"". When it ended, i was begging for more and just can't wait for episode 8. I highly recommend everyone to see this, especially the people who had seen the original trilogy, this will definitely bring a new atmosphere to the ""Star wars"" franchise."
2817,10,"An excellent movie, this will change everything","The most common complaint with this next chapter is that it is too much like A New Hope. That it doesn't do anything new or creative, it just recycles the same ideas. I can understand this to a point, but this movie is packed with brand new ideas, fresh and exciting new characters, and genuinely feels like an honest continuation of the stories we grew up on. The echoes of A New Hope are there, but they are twisted and turned in a new way, and serve the story well. Sure it's got it's flaws, but what Star Wars movie doesn't? The Starkiller Base, while a little too much like a third Death Star, is not the focus of the climax (unlike the first Death Star assault); it's all about the new characters and their conflict. It really must be a chore to hate this movie, because it's fun, humorous, exciting, and feels like the original trilogy in the best way. It's a great film, and it served it's purpose well: covering up 30 years of lost time without beating us over with exposition, introducing new characters while also reintroducing old, and setting us up for a new trilogy, leaving questions to be answered."
2818,9,"It's Back, and it's Good","i freaking loved this movie, the characters were amazing and the movie looks and feels amazing. a lot of people liked the movie but a lot didn't like this movie and i am gonna discuss some of things that the majority of people didn't like. some people might say i'm fanboying and defending something that doesn't make sense, but this is my opinion."
2819,10,a great start to a new trilogy,"JJ Abrams deserves credit for preserving much of the cinematic feel the original trilogy had. The scene composure, pacing, and special effects all capture the important feel of the star wars universe that was lacking in EP I-III."
2820,8,A New Hope for a New Generation,as i didn't quite hop onto the hypetrain weeks before the movie started i have to admit that i got a little excited three days before the actual release and as a fan of 4 - 6 i have to say that i totally was shocked about how average the film was.
2821,6,the dark force of movie making,"SPOILER FREE I was extremely hyped for this movie, and I REALLY wanted it to be good. Fortunately, it was! There are a few problems though, but nothing major really. Overall this film was a great experience from start to finish."
2822,8,"Very good, but with a few minor flaws",So I just watched Star Wars and I can't stop thinking about it. I was feeling a little bit sad about the movie but while writing this review I'm feeling better and that's actually my idea... :)
2823,7,"In overall, Star Wars is great","I am and old Star Wars fan and this time I was not disappointed. After the sad experience of the prequels, I felt back in the same spirit that made the original trilogy so great. JJ Abrams managed the material with great respect and put a particular attention in creating a proper continuity with the first movies. I was particularly impressed by how the environment and the technology look the same. For example, the holograms you will see on the Tie Fighters, the X wings or the Command centre look exactly like the ones that were available with the '70s and 80's cinematography. The script is good and leaves several subplots open for the future developments. It is true, as some commenters have already reported, that the TFA ""homages"" to the previous stories can create a feeling of quasi-remake as done in ""Jurassic World"". My personal feeling is that while in a couple of cases some coincidences were too forced, the repetition of the events is in the logic of SW universe and in the Force balance as was heavily suggested in ROTJ."
2824,9,The Force is strong with this one,"In a year of follow-ups, 'The Force Awakens' is the muddled mix of a sequel, a remake, and a homage. A weak attempt on a potential spectacle."
2825,7,Remake of sorts,"I have never written an IMDb review before, but felt compelled to write one after seeing J.J. Abrams take on Star Wars."
2826,5,One of the most disappointing movies I have seen in my lifetime,"Thanks to the new actors and characters totally loved it. Saw it twice in theaters. Might go again. First off... Oscar Isaac is my hero. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and the not as popular Adam Driver (more later) all brought a new spark that got me pumped for two more movies! Adam Driver was awesome. I don't care what anyone says he did great and his character is sick. The more I reflect the more I liked him and what he brings to the table (something Isaac and Boyega can't). I have talked to a lot of die hard fans about what they thought as an end result and everyone liked it. Sure we all have parts we wish went how we would have wanted them but they did a good job making something that people would like to see again and again. The biggest part of this review I think should be what Daisy Ridley brought to the table. Lately there have been lots of female action heroes in movies and she is definitely one of the up and comers. I just like that women would actually say I like that character which is new to the Star Wars movie franchise. Great move on their part! Definitely go see this movie!"
2827,10,The franchise lives on! No spoilers here.,"The movie featured a couple of the actors from the first trilogy, most notably, Harrison Ford but he has sold out and is now working against MAGA with non-MAGA actors! Other than that there are no cute christian women who attract a man and set a fire in his loins with her bosom."
2828,,Liberal Fantasy,"I went to see Star Wars the Force Awakens with such anticipation and glee of a new but sentimental outlook and loving thought to the original Star Wars trilogy, excluding the prequels disastrous over the top scenery and far too much CGI special effects, which was saved just by fantastic lightsaber duels. "
2829,8,"""Almost there.....but it just impacted on the surface""",8/10
2830,8,A great film flawed by lack of ideas,Luke Skywalker has vanished. The First Order and the Resistance race to locate the map to his whereabouts.
2831,8,The best entry in the saga since 1980,"All the way back home from IMAX I was wondering why this particular one seemed to be for me the only not-so-awesome episode from all the Star Wars"" films. Every other one I simply love and hold dear like a part of my childish memories, but this one did not have even a small part of epicness we could see in the previous movies. No scene will be remembered as a classic, no actor will become a new generation movie hero - neither a villain The old faces from the original saga make this film good and it's not only a sentiment – they are now much better as actors (Mark Hamill's look at the end of the film is you just need to see that!). Unfortunately the young ones have much to learn and I am not only talking about the Jedi skills. My final rating is 7/10 and I sadly need to say I am simply disappointed as a Star Wars"" fan. The character Rey, although as a mix of Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman, she's only a kid and it's hard to identify with the kids on the plan as they are very average in every aspect. On the other hand, Rey started better than young Anakin, so she still can show something better in next two episodes and I hope she will. Finn as a character was given a role of another Afro-American that needs to make a lot of wows"" and he's overacting like the pilot in The Matrix: Reloaded"", so I just confirmed my concerns I had after watching the trailers. Kylo Ren is not even a shadow of Darth Vader The soundtrack is nice, special effects are amazing (worth watching in 3D – especially for X-Wings, Ties and a Star Destroyer). I think J.J. Ambrams did more good with Star Trek"" to give it a new life. I expected much more than improving a visual aspect. Maybe it's a Disney thing At least my wife loved it... And they didn't rape Harrison Ford this time! I suppose we should be grateful for this detail."
2832,7,"At least they did not ""rape"" Harrison Ford this time.","#StarWarsTheForceAwakens will go on to break many box office records, but I was underwhelmed. It's a good movie, but I expected way more. It's too much like Episode IV (which built such a rich universe with great characters and plot), yet is hurried and linear by comparison. Also, the older characters (as much as I loved them) need not have so much screen time. Moreover, the movie should have been called Episode VIII, since there are at least 3 major back stories (that of Kylo Ren's rage, Luke's disappearance and the super weapon's construction) left untold. But I have great faith in Abrams and realize that he 'watered down' the story to appeal to a wider, newer audience, namely Millennials. He will definitely have a more complex story to tell in the sequels. Still, I wish Abrams hadn't safely painted-by-numbers and made the movie that he truly could have made - Lucas took a bold leap with A New Hope and the audience rewarded the brilliant film. Daisy Ridley as Rey is superb and her character carries the film, ably supported by John Boyega's Finn. What I expect to see from the sequels: Rey not be the obvious Skywalker child, Poe Dameron becoming more Han Solo (even part Jedi given those flying skills) & Finn redeeming the Stormtroopers and a greater Empire-Resistance reconciliation. Alas, I fear there is little hope for Kylo Ren, except for more lightsaber duel sequences with Rey and an almost inevitable redemption story in the making, catalyzed by the aging Luke Skywalker."
2833,8,"Good film, could have been great, but portends great sequels","Growing up in the 70's and 80's, I had an emotional connection to Star Wars. This movie did strike a cord with me while watching it. But the next day I felt like I'd watched my kids rendition of the same play that I was in back in highschool."
2834,7,"You'll love it at first, then you'll hate it","Have you ever tried to make a gourmet meal over a fire pit? That is exactly what J.J. Abrams had to do with this movie. Some people expected him to make a movie that will somehow surpass one of the most iconic movies of all time. He had expectations put on him that were astronomical but has to stick with a story, characters and plot that was ""revolutionary"" back in the 70's. Honestly, he does pretty good. I wont say this movie is perfect or flawless, but it is a movie with great call backs and just enough feel of the originals while still keeping up with the times. Having read some of these reviews I feel bad for the people that made this movie. They cant win. This is a great movie. Visuals are stunning, great camera work (for the most part), acting is good, action is amazing, yet these Star Wars lovers (generally) wont accept this is a good movie. Why? Because your girl friends cooking is never as good as your mama's."
2835,8,Back off haters!,"I would like to start by saying I loved Star Wars as a child, I enjoyed the films and even thought the prequels were entertaining. However, I can't understand why everyone thinks The Force Awakens is so much better than Episode 1-3 (other than the one inexplicable twist Episode 7 is better), except maybe for the fact that JJ Abrams has effectively remade Episode 4 without calling it a remake or a reboot!"
2836,7,An enjoyable remake of Episode IV (Spoiler alert),*** SPOILER ***
2837,3,The universe that doesn't evolve,"Like the originals, Episode 7 is a tapestry of set-pieces that build towards a spectacular climax. One or two didn't quite hit the mark, being a bit half-baked, storyline-wise, or were a bit convoluted. In the main though, each successive scene built on the previous one, looked fantastic, and carried the story forward at a nice pace. There was a little bit too much dialogue of the ""reflux the sulphium generators or the hydroverb's gonna misalign the pentavox!!"" variety, but that aside, I found the script quite tight, fast-paced, and lacking in the cheesy clunkiness of some other movies in the series. Much has been said about the 'real sets, and real locations' and I applaud that, but there was still plenty of eye-ache inducing CG. All in all though, this is a well-made, exciting and often moving film, that looks fantastic and is held together by largely excellent performances, with no obvious weak link. Easily good enough to ensure that Episode 8 will be keenly anticipated."
2838,9,"Balance is Restored, in a Tour-De-Force","Disclaimer: I saw the original (now 4) over 25 times in 77 and 78, the Empire Strikes Back over 30 times in 80 and 81, and Jedi 15 times. My expectations were very, very high for this movie."
2839,9,"Fantabulous - Even If You Saw the Originals in 77, 80, 83","JJ Abrams did another masterful job ""re-directing"" a great sci-fi adventure. It was well directed, great cinematography and the characters are very well developed. I loved it, and my 14 and 17 year old kids did as well. Kylo Ren's character was done very well and Adam Driver was able to get away from his weird persona in Girls. Bb-8 was another fun part of the movie without being too goofy. I like Rey in the movie, her spirit was pretty amazing and my daughter seemed to connect with her. I The team definitely encouraged the audience to watch the next movie based on the ending. I would suggest this movie to most ages, it was a fun interplanetary run through JJ Abram's movie goggles."
2840,9,Great Movie...Fun and exciting for 2+ hours.,"OK, so I have seen the very first installment of Starwars(i.e. episode4) but I was a very young child (12). I have not seen any other episodes nor have I read any of the novels/materials on the subject. I decided to watch starters 7 and omg to me it was good, entertaining and most importantly I feel that it is targeting people like me who don't know too much about the star wars trilogy and wants to have a good time. Thus i cannot say that it is or it's not keeping everything true to the original concept of startwars. Was it memorable to me? Yes and it has intrigued me to look up more about star wars. In case people wanted to really feel ""essence"" of star wars I suggest people see a film called ""The hidden fortress"" since this is where star war was inspired from but tweaked to be in space."
2841,,Total Newbie,"This is a great movie, a trip of nostalgia with balanced characters and lovely cinematography. Perfect blend of CGI and proper requisite. The last 30 pages of reviews are nonsense. I'm totally flabbergasted by some of them, haters going to hate. Is this nonsense what a platform of free speech bring? (It's just so sad that you lot can't give it a sensible review). "
2842,9,Some of the reviews on this site is just abhorrent,"This was the first Star Wars film I had the opportunity to watch in the cinema and I have to say, despite some others' opinion, I was positively surprised. I am a Star Wars fan even though I am only a teenager. The thing is, I had no expectations from ""The Force Awakens"". I was indeed really excited about it, but I had both doubts and positive presentiments about it. After I walked out of the theatre I was really pleased with the film, but there were some exceptions. The main issue I see in this film is Kylo Ren, both because of the actor and the character himself. In my opinion, Adam Driver is not suitable for the role. Speaking of Kylo, there are many flaws about him: he looks nothing like his parents, he acts like a moody adolescent and there are also some things about him that don't add up such as the fact that the Force is strong enough with him so that he can stop a laser in mid-air and keep it like that for quite a while, but when encountering Rey who is a first-time user of the Force, he seems weak. Not to mention his light saber skills and the fact that instead of a Force master, he told Rey she needed ""a teacher"", as if she was a child who had to go to school. The other thing that caused me discontent in this film was Han Solo's death. I know Harrison Ford is old and he said Han should have died, but the way he did was the most upsetting. It was a rather pitiful death I'd say...getting betrayed by his son. Also, it's not the first time the father and the son are on different sides in a Star Wars film. All in all, ""The Force Awakens"" was truly enjoyable and I say ""hands down"" to the both visual and sound effects, cinematography, directing and acting."
2843,7,Actually an unexpectedly pleasing film,"Firstly, I believe this movie has been getting a lot of Bad reviews because people are upset that it's basically a copy of new hope. But after seeing the disaster of the prequels where the director actually tried to be creative, I can't blame Abrams for playing it safe. The film itself was good, with the perfect amount of action that is appropriate to the movie. Abrams was able to create clear, steady shots of the fighting scenes rather than shaky camera shots that ruin the scene, allowing us to really get absorbed in the action. The visuals were absolutely stunning, with many of the iconic ships and items of star wars getting a HD rework. Perhaps the best change from the original sequel is now, the stormtroopers can actually aim! The fact that Finn was a stormtrooper gave us an inside look how the first order(empire) actually found and trained their soldiers that weren't clones, something that had not been mentioned yet. "
2844,10,Good not Great,"I saw the movie in the opening day, December 17th, with a great emotion, like we, the oldest fans, who saw the first trilogy on theaters in 1977, 1980 and 1983. Yes I'm a 40+ years old guy who love Star Wars and the history, sci-fi, plot and let's say: the philosophy behind the movies. It's was clear that the focus in this new trilogy are not the oldest fans who knows the history, I found very few moments to be proud and consistent with episodes I to V. The main target is the young audience, barely 25's and less aged who maybe never have seen any of the previous movies. My adolescent sons came with me to see the movie and instantly adores it: fast paced, classic Disney jokes, great in many aspects... but later they started to think: How Rey uses a lightsaber without jedi training? Just closing her eyes? And the jedi mind trick, turned in a cheap joke? How can be a light and dark side trained Kylo, dejected by Finn and Rey? yes, my sons have seen all the episodes. I just say, and it's only my point of view, that the script, mainly written by Abrams and Kasdan, was not bad at all, just it had to be more consistent with what we saw in episodes I to V. In the way the movie was made it's like a new fresh concept of The Force, not found and shown like George Lucas in his movies. My only hope is that episode VIII and IX explains the twist created in this movie, in, let's say it again, a more consistent way with the original history."
2845,7,Sad good movie,"THE GOOD: This movie is an amazing attempt by Disney to revive the franchise. I find it has a very similar feel to 4-6 rather than 1-3. I love that they are easing the old story arch into the new story arc rather seamlessly. They did a great job at taking advantage of the advancement of the characters age (Han solo, Luke Skywalker, etc.). The storm-troopers were much more human and gave off a really cool Nazi vibe. The movie ended on a perfect note and there were certain parts where I really wanted to cry from nostalgia. "
2846,9,An excellent movie lacking some details.,"I saw a movie the other day where an evil guy in a mask was cavorting across the galaxy looking for a droid that had plans stuck in it by some rebels. The droid was found stranded on a desert planet by a, what looks like, insignificant character. A number of action sequences followed and a large planet sized thing was going to shoot another large planet until some small spaceships found an insecurity in a toilet duct and blew it up. The insignificant character turned out to be significant and there seems to be heavy hints that nearly all the leading characters are related to each other (or will be when they fall in love at some future date). I then decided I had seen Star Wars often enough so went out to see Force Awakens."
2847,7,Did I See This Already?,"Oh dear dear me. I wanted to like this film, I tried, I really did, I actually went into the cinema with an open mind, after hearing my friends rave about how good this film was supposed to be. I am very ""old school"" when it comes to ""Star Wars"", I was brought up on the three original movies, and like anyone born in 1970, I do appreciate that the fact I love them now is down to a massive dose of nostalgia. I hated the prequels and consider them an insult to the original concept, but also, again appreciate that fans are very divided about this issue. But I heard good things about TFA, friends told me everything was back in place, and I started to maybe think that my initial cynicism when the trailers came out was completely unfounded. So I put my dark thoughts aside and went to see this latest treat with an open mind, a degree of excitement, and a very clear head (I'm doing Dry January). Well, what can I say, from the minute we observed the old guy handing over the secret thing to whatshisface (Poe), I had already sighed audibly and was itching to leave for a cigarette. Cue explosions and stormtroopers and random ""villagers"" being shot, and a droid whizzing off to deliver the secret thing to whoever because Luke SKYWALKER has gone missing. Or did we find that out later?? I don't know. And quite frankly, I didn't care... And so it went on, "
2848,1,"Steaming pile of Bantha droppings, just plain awful.","OK, I think EVERYTHING that could be said about this film has already been said, and much of the criticism is valid, I am not going to go through all that again."
2849,8,Watch it twice and then decide,"I'll keep it brief but this movie is a fanboy and film fans dream. The best part about episodes 4-6 were the incredible intricate story lines and shocking twist. The best parts of episodes 1-3 were the great special effects and awesome lightsaber duels. The horrible plot made the prequels horrible pieces of film but Star Wars the Force Awakens combines the best part of these two sets of movies with nostalgic homages to our favorite moments. Visually its a masterpiece and the brand new characters are fantastic. But the star of the show besides JJ Abrams (the director) is old Han Solo. Harrison Ford has always hated the franchise and is not the nicest man in the world and felt it fitting for the character to die, he got his wish. Abrams rips your heart out of your chest stomps on it and then brushes off with a lightsaber battle from our new protagonist Rey (Daisy Ridley) and places it on a mantle with yet another death star explosion (cliche maybe, awesome yes). overall its a masterpiece of film a pleasure to watch and fun for everyone not just the nerdiest of dewbs."
2850,10,Han Solos swan song,"J.J Abrams did it! The seventh installment to the Star Wars saga delivers to both fans and general movie goers with great action, acting and overall direction. Although the story could be said to have been seen before, 'The Force Awakens' serves as a great start to the new trilogy. Full credit to J.J Abrams whom was tasked with bringing the biggest franchise in film history back to the big screen in such a great way. Ridley, Boyega, Issac and Driver, deliver powerful performances becoming both memorable and important characters in the Star Wars universe. Ford and Fisher both deliver good performances especially Ford, jumping right back into his scavenger role as if thirty years had not passed by. Overall the film is always entertaining and pulls you right in with its nostalgia and direction. So yea, I drunk the Kool-Aid."
2851,9,"A great return to form, not perfect but it sure as hell captured the Star Wars spirit.",Too many people are rating this film down because the story follows a similar idea of A New Hope. The problem with these reviews are that they are rating the film as if it is a stand alone.. These are the reasons why I loved this movie. (Spoilers)
2852,9,Good start to a new trilogy,"Before I begin, I'm a person who's very critical of movies and I'm a bit hard to impress. "
2853,7,It was entertaining and worth it.,The intensity of scrutiny and speculation that has surrounded this production after Disney's 2012 procurement of the franchise has been revealing. A snapshot of the times we live in.
2854,9,Awakened and stirred.,"I must say that people need to calm down about calling this movie a rip off of the first one. Yes, the movie does take the structure of the plot from the Star Wars: A New Hope, but summing up a movie in 5 sentences and based on that saying that they are the same is just plain ignorance. The characters are different, they have different views, different goals and the character development goes very nicely in hand with that. Instead of a the mighty antagonist, that was Darth Vader, we have someone who is driven to the dark side by the fear from the lack of his own skills. If you know a little bit about the extended universe, you know that this is often the driving force behind turning to the dark side. Also the view from the point of a stormtrooper adds a lot to the story and finally we see them as more than just objects to be killed. Rey, which is the force sensitive main character, comes completely from a different background than Luke and feels much more mentally grown up, than he was, when we met him. Also this time the main character does not go to save someone just because he likes her appearance. All in all the movie has a similar STRUCTURE as the old Star Wars movies but it also feels different and fresh. I have left the cinema with a smile on my face and looking forward to watching it again."
2855,6,Not another angry review,"After watching the 7th instalment to one of the most iconic movie franchises, I must say I was very impressed. JJ Abrams did a brilliant job by making the film have some of the brilliance of the originals and some new and very impressive elements to this film. I was thankful there wasn't any lens flares like in the star trek film because that would have become very frustrating. I feel that the film struggled with making the plot develop and because of this, they copied some of the original films idea (blowing up the evil space station that has a weapon that can destroy planets). I think the film is a very good instalment to the franchise and I could consider it to be in the top 3 Star Wars films. It's enjoyable throughout and I didn't want to miss a thing just in case something would happen.The film had me at the edge of my seat at times with its high risk and intense battle scenes which were executed brilliantly. I'm happy the film went back to using practical models instead of CGI as it gave a more realistic feel and atmosphere to the setting. There was very little use of green screen which allowed me to feel the large scale of the worlds the characters were in. Killing off a main character is very risky. Han Solo is such an iconic and fan favourite character that I was very surprised he would die. I can't see the character returning as he was stabbed, then fell a couple of hundred feet, then the space station also was destroyed and exploded. Then again, we don't see how Kylo Ren leaves the star destroyer so maybe he got Han out just before it explodes. Kylo Ren was a good movie villain. He had so much anger in him and because of the manipulation of Supreme Leader Snoke his hatred for his parents and Luke is understandable. It was hard to develop the character in this film so when he was in some scenes, there had to be a massive thing for him to do to allow his character to grow; like smashing everything up with his light saber in anger in two different scenes. I feel like they made the character too similar to Darth Vader. Darth Vader needed the helmet to be able to breathe, Kylo Ren just has a helmet to cover his face. Yet again being similar to the originals is that there is a big boss who doesn't show up much in the first, but gradually will get more and more screen time. Supreme Leader Snoke is very similar to the emperor. He persuaded a young, promising Jedi with a tiny bit of the dark side and turned them into evil characters. The emperor and Supreme Leader Snoke also don't care much for their apprentice. The character Rey is a very good character in this film. We have only had one film with this character and she will be so much better once she is trained by Luke. She has a mysterious past which I believe could be great to have a massive plot twist like in the empire strikes back. Maybe Rey's parents were strong Jedi warriors or maybe a real dark Sith lord. I feel that if it's another Sith, then it would be too repetitive. Bringing back old characters was a good thing to do from JJ Abrams. While watching I loved seeing memorable, minor characters from the originals like Admiral Ackbar. It made me smile when I saw these characters and it made the film extra fun. A character I was disappointed with was Captain Phasma. When I first saw this character in the trailer, I thought she would be a strong character who would play a big part in the film. I was hoping she would be as cool and as good Boba Fett, but she wasn't. As Captain Phasma was played by a good actress like Gwendoline Christie who I like in 'Game of Thrones' I was thinking the character would be great to watch. Also, Gwendoline Christie said that Captain Phasma would beat Boba Fett in a fight. Clearly this was just a selling technique. Seeing Luke at the end of the film was great. The last scene was amazing. There was no dialogue which I believe made the scene better. You could see in the character's facial expressions what a magical moment it was. It has got me so excited for episode 8 so I know what will happen next with all of the characters. Overall, I think this was a great film to watch and was very fun. The world may be fake but the stakes felt real. I know I have been critical of the film but I seriously did enjoy it and I would recommend it to anyone, Star Wars fan or not. It was a great watch and I can't wait to watch the next films to come."
2856,9,"Fake World, Real Stakes!","Nice movie, solid cast, nice visuals, good characters , plus, it's STAR WARS!!! And everything would be fine if I haven't seen the movie already. As it's the same as New Hope. And everyone who has ' A New Hope' fresh in their minds is aware of this. 1.Rebels vs bad militarized guys lead by a guy with black helmet (Vader-Kylo Ren) 2.Guy with helmet is after information hidden inside a droid (R2D2- BB8) 3.Droid's owner gets caught and is taken onto a space ship. (Leia- Poe) 4.Droid escapes on a desert planet 5.Droid is found by a force- sensitive protagonist and they bond (Luke-Rey) 6.The force- sensitive protagonist finds a teammate on a desert planet (Obi wan, Finn) 7.Bad guys kill the whole settlement on a desert planet 8.Droid owner gets rescued from the space ship 9.They leave desert planet in M.Falcon and they soon meet Solo and chewbacca 10.Protagonist slowly reveals his force powers 11.Dark hologram (Emperor-Snoke)commands from somewhere 12. Father- son reveal.. 13.Finn wants to leave our group of friends as he doesn't care about the greater cause. But then he comes back to save the day (Han Solo) I just realized ; this will take too long to write everything down... In short; then they bond, team up as the resistance. And they are up against a gigantic space station that is blowing planets up. They hold a meeting in front of hologram table and they blow the station up by using x-wings and by disabling shields on the ground. Everything the same as in ' A New Hope'. Disney played it safe and I can understand why. Disney want's at least a billion world- wide. So they didn't take any chances, they used familiar stuff they knew it will work. I guess it's not easy to please everyone, especially SW fans and their expectations. When you're making a movie that has a lot of fans even before the movie is made...I guess you don't get too creative and you don't take to many risks. I enjoyed the movie, it's nice, solid, and it's star wars. But ''this feels familiar''-filling was too strong. It's almost as if around the middle of the movie you knew exactly what to expect and you just wait for the movie to roll out. It's OK to throw in stuff from original SWs. For fans, nostalgia and to get that familiar SW filling. Old characters (Luke,Leia,Han etc,), Luke's saber, Vader's helmet, recognizable ship designs..it all works well and ties you to the originals. But you don't have to do the exact same story and all the same beats of the original movie. It's a remake/reboot as much as it is a sequel."
2857,7,A New New Hope..-SPOILERS,"Yes, I'm yet another person to point out that Rey is a Mary Sue. The whole movie, I wanted her to fail at least as something, but no. She flies the Millennium Falcon almost perfectly, and can fix any problem it has, despite calling it garbage. Her good combat skills, I understand. She lives alone in a savage desert world with slave traders everywhere.Honestly, the real life events surrounding the movie are much more interesting than the movie itself. Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, and seeing him back on the Millennium Falcon got me a little teary-eyed. Not much of a spoiler, but yes, Han Solo is killed. Harrison Ford is very old now. He doesn't have the energy to keep acting. At best, he would have had a few cameos in Episode 8. Seeing Rey finishing Han Solo's sentences is actually what made me realize she was a Mary Sue. The movie was also very similar to a New Hope. The empire makes a new ""Death Star"" with a very obvious flaw. The heroes destroy it, and it blows up. The end."
2858,3,"Star Wars, The Mary Sue Awakens","OK, I loved star wars movies (the old ones) and just watched episode VII tonight. My feeling is that is was great, it feels like star wars, and I would definitely recommend to watch. I would agree that JJ Abrams did not reinvent the wheel, he mostly uses existing ingredients from episode IV, but he still did a very good job!"
2859,8,Come on! This was really good!,"There's enough nostalgia, storyline familiarity and cinematography polishely packaged by JJ and team to make this a worthwhile movie experience for the average star wars aficionado "
2860,8,Enjoyable but not memorable,"First off, see the film several times. The first viewing will leave you so overwhelmed with information due to sensory overload and a dense back story that you'll probably leave the film with a bad taste in your mouth. After waiting decades for this film, your first viewing won't be a pure one."
2861,9,Star Wars for a new generation of characters and viewers,"Anyone that gives this a low rating is either a troll or a die hard star wars fan thats gonna hate on every star wars movie because there impossible to please.although this movie has problems, its definitely not a 1/10 2/10 3/10 4/10 5/10 or a 6/10. Anyone thats giving this that kind of rating, Don't LISTEN TO THEM. This movie is way better than the prequels with better dialog, action, characters that you like with 5 seconds of screen time, pretty much everything the OT had and everything the PT lacked. This is literally no reason for anyone to give this a lower rating than 6. I will admit that this movie is similar plot wise to a new hope, but it has pretty good plot twist and was still a really movie. Its probably not as good as empire, but in my opinion its as good as new hope and better than ROTJ. Fans need to stop complaining on this amazing return to the star wars franchise."
2862,9,Don't listen to anyone with a below 7 star rating,"Star Wars is a saga that I deeply cherish, it had been following me since I was 5 years old and I still am a big fan of it. You can't imagine the excitement when I heard they were going to make a new film soon, something I literally had dreams about. I will say, I think the 3 prequels could have been much better. But onto the new installment: The force awakens."
2863,7,A reboot? Maybe not that much,"I am an avid Star Wars fan, and was instantly terrified and excited to hear that Disney had bought the franchise and would release the sequels. My fears were confirmed when they announced they were destroying the history and canon I grew up with and loved for 30 years."
2864,9,"Awesome movie, instantly better than prequels.","Of course you should watch it, just don't expect to much out of it. "
2865,6,MIxed feelings,Whatever you do: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THIS FILM!
2866,9,Not perfect but very close.,"I'd have to admit, if this were a standalone film it would be fantastic, because JJ Abrams and his new crew of Star Wars makers did a really good job. However, I have no idea why, but for some reason he and Lawrence Kasdan decided to steal most if not all the aspects of ""A New Hope"" into this new storyline that would either make or break Disney's reputation for how well they can handle Star Wars."
2867,7,"I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for ""A New Hope""","First off, I gave it 1 star to offset obviously corrupted IMDb rating. Has anyone noticed how every big budget movie has a very high rating that gradually dwindles down? That includes this one too. I remember when it was released the rating showed over 9.0 - which tells us the movie is outstanding. Same thing happened with the new ""Batman"". What happens is, people check the ratings and if the movie is praised then it's worth going to theater. Wrong! Someone is controlling this and fooling us. Same with this movie. If it was an action flick outside and not connected to ""Star Wars"" franchise I would give it solid ""8"". But since it's a continuation of a cult franchise and so poorly and Hollywood-like made I have to give it ""5"". The visuals and sound were outstanding. Story and actors selection - very poor. "
2868,1,Star Wars = New Marvel,"I'm going to go ahead and say that I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. I mean, I enjoy the films well enough and some of my best friends are HUGE fans of the entire universe that has been created for the property. But look, I grew up with the original trilogy on licensed VHS tapes and watched them each several times. I saw each of the new trilogy in theaters. I even played a few of the games (I was a boss at Shadows of the Empire on Nintendo 64). But I never delved too deep into understanding the universe and how everything interacted with one another. I can't tell you about many of the ancillary characters and their political leanings, okay? Just not in me."
2869,10,The best sequel film,"The Force Awakens is what Star Wars fanatics wanted, and it definitely does a good job at hitting familiar notes but also balancing that with newer characters. The overwhelming negativity in these reviews clearly do not reflect the views of most, but they're not supposed too. The Force Awakens has been accused of stealing elements from the original and I can understand why one would say this. However, no one accused Creed of being a near beat for beat remake of the original Rocky. Abrams' direction is wonderful and surprisingly emotional with beautiful long takes and wide shots. This may be the best directed film only second to Irvin Kershners The Empire Strikes Back. In a short sense, this is the best Star Wars film since Kershners cinematic masterpiece."
2870,10,Great return to a classic franchise,Im going to offer two reviews. One review for this IMDb review board and another review for this film.
2871,8,One of the best star wars films since the originals!,"I mean, JJ Abrams does an amazing job at keeping you on the edge of your seat. He slows the movie down and then speeds it up to such a high pace with the close action fight scenes that blow your mind. Some awesome scenes. It is reminiscent of the star trek remake he did, which was mind blowing. The problem I have is that, as with Star Trek, you already knew the characters. You don't have to start going into lengthy depth into their background. After watching this movie, I'm still clueless about any of the new characters. JJ Abrams briefly touches into the background of the characters leaving you with more questions than answers. It certainly builds up the suspense for next time, but it turns this movie into a full blown action movie. They'll need to spend an hour of episode 8 going into the background of the characters which will make the next one quite strange, otherwise we'll still left wondering who these people are and where they came from. The villains do need to be more evil and sinister. I think the casting there was a little weak. No one holds the scene as Darth Vadar did. I did like what JJ Abrams did in taking it back a step in CGI. Episodes 1,2,3 were a bit too much. Stunningly amazing, but to extreme. My problem is, JJ Abrams has done the opposite giving the sense that its not the future. You get the sense that the original episode 4 there was more advanced technology. The rebel base just seemed a little tacky, and the millennium falcon appeared more like a toy than a futuristic space ship. But for me, the scenes that just make no sense should have no part in a movie. There is a scene near the end where Kylo Ren started walking across a bridge over a pit that appears to be 2 miles long. Why even attempt the walk? It didn't make a lot of sense. Then when you go on a mission to destroy the empire base, you send 3 people? In the Return of the Jedi, at least they had 2 dozen going down to the planet. Just seemed odd. And when the rebel fighters are attacking the First Order base at the end, you see about 6 fighters going in, and 6 fighters leaving. Somewhere in the battle they lost over half their forces. What happened to Rebel's fleet they had at the end of return of the jedi? Then there was the scene where Princess Leia says they didn't know anything of the First Order's new weapon. Seriously! When you see the weapon, its bigger than the death star. How could they not know about it. Aside from that, a good start, but not amazing. 8 stars."
2872,8,Typical Abrams,"First of all there is no point in filming this film in 3D version. . . plot and even the environments are much alike the fourth installment. . .almost puked when Kylo Ren removed his helmet. . .as usual Harison Ford is edgy. . .if Rey is gonna lead the next part, then I'm tapping out of the coming sequels. . .unlike the former parts its lacked aliens , the environments where rather earth like. . .the saber is cool though, with a little more body to it. . .is Finn somehow lured into joining the resistance by smearing that blood on his helmet ?? this film is overrated, since they have got a lot of new fans , who haven't had the chance to watch any of the former sequels in theatres. . .and its only good for watching one time (barely) . . .and Rey gets the force , without any training ?? and kylo is going to get his final training ?? usually i don't write reviews. .but this made me. . .yuck . .yuck . .yuck.. .i watched this film on Ariesplex Sl cinemas, which is 4k D-max 3D , 64 channel Dolby atmos, but it was not much to expectation regarding the sound department only at few places gave me goosebumps. . .rather than that its mellow. ."
2873,7,Episode IV remake,"I saw the original in 1977 when it came out in the theaters. It's strange but I've only seen the first three and none of the ""prequels."" I was skeptical about this one but I'm glad I got over that. Yes, the plot is a little stretched and we already knew the outcomes of the battles before they were fought (save for one) but the humor, the interactions of the characters, the visual effects, prepare yourself to be rocked. The International Harvester tractor with jet engines and the prehistoric vulture pecking at the scrap metal had me in tears of laughter. "
2874,10,Absolutely Fantastic,"The movie would be great if it was a new IP, but it is part of starwars, a franchise of unparalleled popularity and unlimited imagination. Despite all the great actions and CGs, it fell short of expectation for having a recycled story line."
2875,7,A good standalone movie but a step down from the original,Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the second greatest Star Wars film of all time and it greatly tops the prequels.Every time I watch it I never get bored because the pace is set perfectly and JJ Abrams did a stupendous job with this film. It copied the originals quite a bit but it stuck the landing and gave the audience more to look forward to in the future of Lucasfilm. The CGI wasn't overused but some characters did not need to be CGI such as Snoke and Maz Kanata. Plus the Rathtar seen was kind of stupid. Like why didn't the Rathtar just eat Finn instead of dragging him? But these tiny flaws don't compare to the over-all spectrum that is The Force Awakens and I'll admit I was skeptical when I heard they were making ANOTHER Star Wars. But this proved me wrong and I am highly anticipating the next film in the series. And of course Rogue One and the Han Solo film.
2876,9,Star Wars is a great film for all generations to come.,I will be quick and concise. 
2877,7,"If you ever asked yourself: how does episode IV would have been with modern filming technologies, this is your movie.","How in tarnations can this movie get a rating of 8.5???? Why are people doing this? The movie has absolutely no depth.There is nothing that moves you,no well written drama, no great direction. It just moves with ever increasing boredom from one scene to the next. The movie never feels like a serious attempt at a Star Wars movie. Even Ford can't save it. Ford and Leia look forced on the movie. It doesn't make you sad, happy, angry, anxious, hopeful, wishful. Nothing. You are just sitting there, munching on an overpriced sandwitch and wishing you hadn't believed the people who reviewed this very mediocre piece of movie making on IMDb."
2878,2,8.5???? Really?????,"I came into this movie absolutely pumped and I was not disappointed at all! I enjoyed going into the movie without having no idea of the plot of the movie, it left sort of a suspenseful feeling inside of me. JJ Abrams took this and made magic with it, I've always been a fan of him starting with Lost and continuing into today, so I had full confidence that he would make something special with this film and he did just that. I would have given this a 10/10 although during the movie there were areas of sudden comedy. I understand that adding comedy to serious movies has become a thing lately and it's adapted into today's film, but some parts I just didn't find amusing. But, to all the readers though and the Star Wars fans, get your butt to a theatre and see this movie! I promise you will not be disappointed."
2879,9,Worth the Wait!!!,"After leaving the cinema there's a real sense of satisfaction, finally the Star Wars film that has been 30+ years in the waiting. It bypasses any disappointments from the prequels and goes right back to basics."
2880,9,Not perfection but Star Wars as it should be.,"I never write reviews, ever, this is my first. To be honest I have never felt such a strong need to write one. After I got home from watching this I decided to look at the reviews (I had been avoiding the Internet for two days so I didn't get spoilers) and to say the least I am flabbergasted. Don't get me wrong, we are all titled to our own opinion, but you can't say you are the 'BIGGEST' Star Wars fan ever, and then proceed to spell Chewbacca wrong, AND say you were a fan of Jar-Jar. You just can't (in my opinion anyway.) Then you rate it one star. I'm sorry but even if the film did suck (which it did not) a one star is a pretty ridiculous rating. But I'm not going to spend this review hating on other reviewers, like I said how you feel is up to you, but I do feel the need to put my input in a review. So here's a pros and cons list. Pros- Music, they used the characters themes perfectly along with adding more. I liked this because it really connected this film to the originals. CGI was used VERY tastefully, unlike the prequels, this wasn't cartoon like, obviously there's going to be CGI but they used the minimal amount. (I mean c'mon the Millennium Falcon was actually a real scale model) Characters, the acting was phenomenal, whoever disagrees, I'm sorry. The emotions were real and raw, Harrison Ford of course had part in that, but also it being Daisy Ridleys first feature film, she was incredible. Along with all the other characters. I see a lot of people criticizing Kylo Rens character, but I think he was perfect. You could see the struggle in him, and I know he's not as bad ass as Darth Vader, but that's kind of the point. They're creating a new character. One with conflict, and If you can recall Vader had major conflict. The depth of this movie, with the first six the storyline was straight forward, not a lot of background to the characters unless they were main. This film added the depth, Rey struggling to grasp the force, or when she first touched Luke's Lightsaber, how it transported her, none of the other movies had scenes like that. Same thing with Finn, and the little scenes that add up to him wanting to no longer be part of the First Order. It all added to the film making you feel with the characters. When Luke finally appears, with his them playing in the background, I know a lot of people are upset he didn't say anything, but I disagree. Ending it how it did was perfect. There was no one liner that ended the film abruptly, it was a long awaited scene, that will be continued in the next film. Instead of it pretty much being a ""To be continued"" storyline it could be independent. "
2881,9,Loved it,"Like I said in the title, it's just the Star Wars that we know and love."
2882,9,It's the Star Wars that we know and love.,"I never write reviews so this is my first. I was only inspired to write by the hugely negative and unfair reviews focusing on events not concerning the film. I don't care about the directors past works(people talking about star trek, wtf?), nor the other films or the possible future films, just the film in question. "
2883,7,Good film but they told the wrong story.,"Okay, first things, first, *SPOILER ALERT* okay, so the premise is OK, they have a new death star, yada yada yada, and in the end, I feel like it was destroyed WAY to easily, but honestly the characters totally made up for all of it. Love Daisy Ridlley's acting, I see an Oscar winner there. Adam Driver was great as Kylo Ren, and John Boyega-SO FUNNY! I though Carrie and Harrison could be a little more emotional with each other when they reunited, but I'd give this a 10/10 if the plot was a tad bit more unique. There was a different feeling to it that I can't quite place, probably the filming style, probably the wit, probably since it's my first Star Wars movie to see in the theater."
2884,9,"Loved the characters, somewhat disliked the Premise","In no Galaxy can this movie be seen as a 1/10. Anyone who gives such a score is not ""clear of nostalgia"" or ""a harsh critic"", but some moron who got too hyped for the film and felt that it was going to be the best thing ever. This film is incredibly well made. The acting is good, the special effects are stunning, the practical effects aren't too obvious, the writing is excellent and the new characters I am now in love with. "
2885,7,"Ignore those who say this is a ""rip off""","The hype for this movie was something I tried to consciously avoid. Going in, I knew only what the trailers had shown, as well as Kylo Ren's name. Aside from that, some cast details and nothing more. I'd like to take a moment to mention that this was not easy, as potential spoilers and ""leaked details"" flooded my news feed constantly over the last few months."
2886,9,Well-Done and beautiful in many ways,"I watched this movie for the first time last night and have been excited to see it since the moment I heard they were making a new movie. I have been an avid Star Wars fan my whole life and felt a certain connection with all the previous movies. When I watched this movie, I did not even feel like I was watching a star wars movie, it did not even capture my attention as much as phantom menace did- and that's saying something. "
2887,6,Not too terrible,"First, let me say that I did watch all six previous episodes in preparation for ""The Force Awakens"". As such, I am indeed comparing this latest film to its predecessors, which is a bit unavoidable. In doing so, I'm giving the film 5/10 stars--a lower score than I imagined myself giving, and indeed the lowest score I've given any of the Star Wars films. Here's why..."
2888,5,Good Acting and Well Made--But a Terrible Plot,"I hate to see all the reviews on top of the page giving it 4 and 5 out of 10. I don't know what is wrong with these people but i respect their opinion. I'll start with the negatives. Oh wait, there weren't any in my opinion. There were many many similarities to New hope but i believe that that doesn't affect it negatively, actually it somehow improves it. From the beginning to the end, I was filled with nostalgia which is what made this movie amazing to me, combined of course with the new stuff. J.J. Abrams combines nostalgia with new characters and events brilliantly. Anyway, it is just what I wanted after the Horrific prequels and if you like star wars you need to see it 100%"
2889,9,J.J Abrams does his job and he does it very well,"Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens was absolutely incredible. The theater experience was the best movie watching experience I have ever endured. It's worth the hype and so much better than the prequels. In fact, it's my favorite Star Wars film. The cast and characters, old and new, are all phenomenal but Daisy Ridley (Rey) stole the show for me. I have fallen in love with Star Wars all over again. Thank you JJ Abrams for a story that will live on for generations to come. Wow! Bring on Episode VIII! The greatest Star Wars movie of all time and the most fun I've ever had in the theater. I just bought it on blu-ray at a midnight release and will enjoy this film for the remainder of my life. Just amazing."
2890,10,An Amazing Return to a Galaxy Far Away,"I've watched the original Star Wars many times growing up, and I know the story inside out like anyone else. Classic films that many people like my self have been wanting back. I saw the movie today and walked away satisfied and eager for the next one. I read some of these highest rated reviews and it's literally awful how full of yourself and pessimistic some of you are. You're giving the movie a 1 star, for what? Most of you have a delusion of 30 years of fan boy gigginess that nothing released will live up to your standards, unless it was made directly after the Return of the Jedi. "
2891,10,"Ah get over it fanboy's, the movie was massively entertaining and better than the originals","It's episode 4 (and 5 and 6) minus the occasional boredom (I mean it takes ages before Luke leaves Tatooine). Does that make it rip-off? If you consider Episode 2 being a ripped off Episode 5 because it had a similar plot structure and Jango/Boba Fett, Slave 1, a chase in an asteroid field, a city in the clouds (I mean water), then yes it does. The Empire/First Order is obsessed with weapons of mass destruction, so what? The Jedi are all but extinct again? Well, who would want to rebuild the old Republic the way it was when, apparently, all that the Jedi Order can do is produce sexually frustrated and emotionally unbalanced individuals."
2892,10,A promising start of something new.,I was pretty excited and I went with high expectations in the film. This was followed by disillusionment . A nice children's film. The film is bloodless. The story is predictable. Better than Episode 1-3 due to the economical use of CGI and better acting. The chemistry between the main characters works. Beautiful are the dogfights and the debris that fly across the screen. Also the arrangement of the Stormtrooper had succeeded . But the film is ultimately only the infusion of the old. A revival. The film lacks the courage to add something new. The result is hardly tension or surprise . For me it is now clear that Mad Max Fury Road was ultimately the only innovative action-art-house film this year that has impressed me.
2893,7,Only the infusion of the old - nice children's film,"I see all of the reviews about everybody so upset over TFA , but honestly was it that bad? Did it let down my expectations? Yes. However, I also don't regret seeing it. This movie from the start had me hooked, but as it kept going it seemed at points it was dragging along. Im just like everyone else who tried so hard to not read anything about this before i saw it because i didn't want to ruin it for myself. This movie is very predictable and at points boring. I will admit i did figure that it would be Fin in the final battle as the Jedi, not Rey. That was the only surprise to me. We all knew that Kylo was the son of 1 of the main 3 from the original trilogy, i knew right when Han yelled Ben, Kylo was going to kill him. I think that the way Kylo was handled was a complete waste of a bad a** mask, but also it shows the weaker side of the sith, which is something we haven't really seen before. At times the humor felt pushed, and corny. Han & Chewy are hilarious (as usual), and when Kylo was told a droid stole a fighter, his response made me laugh. My biggest peeve about the entire movie throughout i was watching it was no light-saber battles. However after the movie i thought about it for awhile and episode III there was a lot, which honestly was too much. No light-saber battles throughout the film really put the emphasis on Kylo and Rey's battle to be epic and feel monumental. Which it succeeded in my mind. Overall a good quality movie and i will definitely watch it again in the future."
2894,9,"Not completely terrible, but not fantastic.","The movie was good, but not great. Not better than my 2 favorite Star Wars movies (Revenge of the Sith and Return of the Jedi)."
2895,7,Star Wars EpVII or EpIV reboot ?,"In 2012 after hearing about Disney bought Lucasfilm LTD I was among all other fans that were skeptical and scared of the future of the Star Wars franchise. When the teaser 2 trailer was released in June 2015 and after watching the trailer I was so hyped for this film. So after watching the film, Does Star Wars The Force Awakens delivers?"
2896,10,"Star Wars ""The Force Awakens"" is 100%","Star Wars is back and it feels fresh and different. JJ's universe looks and feels gorgeous but some of the depth and epicness of the originals was lost in the process. Although the film offers exhilarating action and a very fast pace, with little time to give viewers a better understanding of whats going on across the galaxy (giving very little of what the prequels maybe gave us too much). Humor is very present, and jokes work well for most of the film, but more then once, silly quotes ruin some dramatic moments and ultimately, ruin a little bit of the epicness and gravity of some moments. The range of emotions you can get with this film however is very wide, from nostalgia to pain, from anxiety to comfort. JJ learned with the prequel's mistakes. The plot is light, uncomplicated and straightforward. It will be a huge hit with kids and people who are not very familiar with Star Wars, while the crazy amount of fan service will also please the old school fans. If you don't go to the cinema with extremely high expectations, you might even surprise yourself. It is not best Star Wars movie ever, but it's a hell lot of fun."
2897,7,"Fun, action packed, but missing some of the epicness","if you have never seen a star wars movie before then don't bother reading the following as you wouldn't understand how much this piece is lacking in originality, content and epicness !"
2898,4,death of originality,Wishing You All A Merry Star Wars !
2899,10,A Honest Review:,"Star Wars is Star Wars there is nothing more to say.OK i will agree that the writers didn't make the story good enough for the new film but why do you hate J.J.Abrams ,he is just the DIRECTOR .He doesn't write the script.The movie is definitely not bad at all it's cool and fresh.Disney wanted it like that because they needed to be sure that they will get enough money from the new movie of the new saga .They gave Lucas 4 billion dollars for Star Wars .The second and third part of the new trilogy will have entirely different plot from the original trilogy.OK i love the original trilogy but it's not bad to see new places in the saga new characters and a new villain."
2900,8,Not so good but it's definitely not bad,"I intentionally didn't read any reviews before seeing The Force Awakens because I didn't want to go in with any preconceptions. Having just seen it, and having thoroughly enjoyed it, I was curious about what others thought and I just don't get all the negative reviews. I won't offer any spoilers, and so won't speak to specifics, but I will say this. I was in college when the original Star Wars just came out and it blew me away. Later, I was mesmerized by The Empire Strikes back and riveted by Return of the Jedi. Those three movies stand in my memory, along with the original Alien, as the only movies in my life where I totally and completely lost myself in the films and forgot who and where I was. Well, after 30 years, this one did that for me once again, and I loved every second of it"
2901,10,"Well, I loved it.","I am a little dismayed at the amount of negative reviews for this movie. Star wars has been, and will always be a fantasy adventure story for those who are young and those who are young at heart. It is not the Dark Knight."
2902,8,"The Force is strong with this one ( No spoilers, I promise!)","Not bad. Just very similar to A New Hope and I really didn't like when movies use ideas alredy used. The Starkiller Base is just another Death Star, Snoke is just another emperor, Kylo is just another Vader, but more conflicted and more young. I see that J. J. Abrams loved the Originals but didn't really liked the Prequels. I love that they bring back Han Solo and Chewie. Also, in this movie Finn's character is enjoyable. Rey is an amazing character with a lot of development. Also, Rey's Theme is a materpiece. The last scene with Luke is awesome. With no words, a lot of emotions. Overall TheForceAwakens was a good movie. Star Wars awakens after 10 years of waiting on the big screen. Just it played to safe."
2903,7,Modern A New Hope,(This review is a rough script of a review video so it isn't structured to be read as a review and has been cut down to allow for the 1000 word IMDb limit but still gets the point across.You can see the video version that this was originally intended for here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=babmKS6NJS8)
2904,10,Solid movie as expected,"Very watchable movie. VERY disappointed that they did one of the same things bigger doesn't cut it . all the writers available to Disney. And your can't come up with a different big thing. I would rather see the old stars bow out. Although good to see. Again all the talent at Disney, all the space novels,writers and you can't come up with a new character to have the secret. With old characters in smaller parts.a lot of things excellent in this movie. Prefer old characters to help new ones. New worlds. New hero excellent, partner very good.trouble they get in good. Finding a certain ship very good, but felt the writers did not know what to do with it. Flyers and shooter figured it out to quick how to fly it and more troubles to get it running old, outdated equipment."
2905,6,Good,"I would have given this movie an 8ish, however, all the people giving it one star (as though it was worse than Jem or the Last Airbender) have forced me to bump it back up with ten stars."
2906,10,"Seriously, if you gave it one star your opinion is obviously tainted.","I don't get it ... Most bad reviews are from people who are IMDb members since 19th of December, and giving this movie 1 or 2 stars .... so lets face it, it's not a bad movie and it doesn't deserve it. So may I put it on a neutral perspective what this movie had to face: - 32 years of no decent star wars instalments (except the last 8 minutes of episode3) - First film not influenced by George Lucas, thus finding new creative people for the job - Disney buying the franchise for 4 billion dollars - A fanbase discouraged by a really bad executed sequel trilogy - Creating a new fanbase for star wars while pleasing the old - Putting the old Star Wars spirit into the 21st century - Introduction a new generation of heroes and simultaneously telling the story of the old"
2907,7,What else to expect? Then a fun ride?,The build up to this movie reminded me of the media hype surrounding Jurassic Park (1993). I was wondering when they would try it again. I went to see it anyway because it was getting rave reviews from everywhere else. 
2908,1,Media Hype,"After 33 years of waiting for the long anticipated sequel to the 1983 box office hit Return of the Jedi, people were eagerly waiting for the sequel and many people were also very doubtful of it being successful and true to the franchise and its roots."
2909,9,A true re-imagination of the classic original trilogy,"What do you people want? Prior to episode 7, I distinctly remember die-hard fans complaining how the prequels were pure garbage. Now you're all saying you miss the prequels? Do you even know what you want? This movie was great! I'm seriously baffled by some of these reviews. I'm sure if this series is ever rebooted, or another entry releases in 20+ years, you'll all yearn for JJ's Star Wars. You people have no idea what you want and will just complain no matter what is put forth. Cut the crap"
2910,10,Star Wars fans are insane!,"Great story, great characters, great movie. It's a must watch movie. This movie brings the hypes for more Star Wars especially this new trilogy. It was well created movie. It provides a new hope for every generation. A spectacular film that will keep the franchise going for many years to come. The Force Awakens also brings back the Old Trilogy which is an enjoyment and fun. It brings back the old Star Wars."
2911,10,"Great Movie, Must Watch","He has no demand for his hackerism and no scruples of course.  As for this REBOOT: First the Disney magical princess really looks ugly  to me in this film.  Second, I really hope Luke got some big bucks for this film despite not  being in it.  Third, the janitor deployed to the battle field needs to play other  characters besides the eventual lover of the princess (his gay come on  in the hangar is a good subplot).  The first Star Wars trilogy had vision and was fun. Adults could enjoy  the clever philosophy and your kids could laugh and giggle at the  action. I certainly couldn't take my grandchildren to see this remake  even though Disney is aiming a remake at kids. For one, it just wasn't  cool. Why bother to try a reboot if you cannot even make it 1/10th  better than the original? More obvious doesn't make it funnier.  Leia is quite stone-faced; and as far as anyone can tell, the only  member of the cast who wasn't forced. She actually brings no emotion to  her character. The emo vader groupie (don't get excited Disney  contractors!!) is just embarrassingly bad. Even his/her mugging for the  camera is bad. This guy can act like a kid plays Mr Dressup: I've seen  better performances in a cartoon Here he/she is a disaffected emo with  daddy issues. And Harrison Ford already admitted he did it for the cash  and is there to provide tongue-in-cheek playback  But this film is seriously bad.  This is the first time my wife looked at me and said, sorry, but I  can't take any more. And she walked out.  I didn't expect to see CGI of the quality in a kids movie that is a  REBOOT; and it was not even OK, just enough for what it was: a  destruction ""horror"" film of mostly froth. It was a bad script with  poor direction and very abjectly bad acting.  The team that worked on this has an office on whose door it says  'Accounting Department'"
2912,,Did you know Jar Jar Abrams is hired again when other directors rejected Disney this summer?,I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by a landslide in my opinion. There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original.
2913,9,Top Two In Star Wars Movies,"Nostalgia-fest. Similar plot and scenes as the original trilogy, particularly A New Hope. The torch gets passed from the old characters to the new...but in the end, that's OK imo. Kind of how comic book sagas reboot with slightly different origin stories."
2914,7,It's a Reboot...but that's OK,"I've had the displeasure of speaking to a few people who called this movie the worst Star Wars movie ever. This is simply not the case. The movie definitely played things safe by echoing a lot of what happened in episodes IV and V. But that didn't necessarily make it predictable. ""The Force Awakens"" was written to regain the trust of the fans who were scorned by the infamous prequel trilogy. And this movie succeeds brilliantly. The humor is never forced in this film. And every funny scene is actually funny! The special effects are used sparingly, and the practical effects look wonderful. "
2915,9,Simply Marvelous,The big hype has come to an end and I saw the film last night. Having been kept in the dark about the story line throughout the trailers (which was a very good move and what trailers are lacking recently) I was disappointed to realise I have already seen the film decades ago. 
2916,7,The reboot awakens,"A lot of criticisms I see here are, in my opinion, part of the story. Kylo Ren is not a Sith Lord, at least not yet. He is strong in the Force, but cannot harness its power totally. His tantrums are showing he is weak. He is not as strong as Darth Vader. Vader is who he emulates. Thats why Han Solo says ""take the mask off, you don't need it."" He is dressing up to be an intimidating Vader-like warrior. Having him take off the mask early in the film shows that. Kylo Ren is not this godlike powerful Sith. This narrative continues when Finn and Rey aren't totally annihilated by him in a lightsaber duel. A Force sensitive in Rey can beat him without formal training because he is weak. "
2917,10,SPOILERS: Look into the details,The biggest problem with Force Awakens
2918,6,Remove the importance of the Force & Training.... Say goodbye to Star Wars!,Well... the visuals were absolutely brilliant. If this was a film without any history then it would be awesome!
2919,2,A shame...,"I will probably be the only one, but I really do think that this movie is the best star wars movie yet. It had awesome acting and John Boyega and Harrison Ford really did their job. When the final battle between Finn and Kylo Ren began, I really was holding my hands up to my face with my mouth just open. Very nice unexpected plot twists, like the death of Han Solo (I F**KING WARNED YA). BB-8 was an awesome droid, being very cute and hilarious, but not overexadurated and trying-too-hard-to-make-us-laugh-y. It had some really small flaws though, like Rey once helping out and knowing more about the Millennium Falcon than freaking Han Solo or sometimes being too similar to the other movies, but other than that, a supreme movie and a great experience over all. 11/10 would watch it again."
2920,10,The best one yet,"is very awesome movie on 2015, although i can see many meme for this movie on time lines etc. many people talk about this from children to milf :D.. nice nice."
2921,8,Awesome Movie 2015,"I was very excited to go and watch this film and had been anticipating it for the last few months. I was not disappointed. It managed to tick all of the boxes for what you expect in a Star Wars film without being overly nostalgic to the originals. The overall plot line was good but it felt quite safe, I anticipate that the next two of the trilogy will be more divergent. "
2922,8,Original but nostalgic,I'm not 'into' Star Wars; never have been and I don't really like sci- fi movies all that much in general.
2923,8,General Review,******SPOILER ALERT******
2924,7,There has been an awakening.........,This movie captured everything I wanted to see in a Star Wars film. There was much conflict about it being a 'dumb' Disney reboot but it is quite the opposite. It is the revival of a timeless franchise yes there were familiar aspects but there is also much new. People also disliked the villain Kylo Ren saying he wasn't evil enough. Even Vader couldn't take it upon himself to kill his son Ren killed his father in cold blood. It was a very entertaining film bringing back old characters and introducing new ones. It is the start of a promising new trilogy. It also left us with multiple good questions to seek answers to in the next film like who is Rey? Why did Finn become defective? I personally loved this movie as much as any other Star Wars film and am looking forward to Episode VIII.
2925,10,A Hated on masterpiece,He likes it.isnt that the point?why are reviewers being mean to a good film then?
2926,7,My kid has developmental challenges,"Well first off, this will contain some spoilers so reader beware."
2927,8,Good Star Wars Movie-Spoilers,"I watched this movie on my arrival to Hong Kong few days ago. Also I have read many reviews after watching the movie, positive and negative. Many people say that this is an Ep4 reboot, OK, I will bring my thoughts on it. I like how things were developed in the movie, the fast pace, badass Kylo Ren, dark colours of remnant Empire, cruelty and the feel of ""what will happen next"". Things I didn't like are general Hux (he is just a wrong actor for this role), the name of Snoke (sound like sb is going to sneeze), the ending itself - Luke, are you mute?"
2928,7,"Well, it was OK, but....","People said when episode I came out that it was the best Star Wars ever. But in time when the hype cooled down they realized how stupid that movie was. This one is no exception. Please do not take this review personally, it's just an opinion."
2929,1,Quite possibly the worst movie ever! (IMO),"This is an amazing movie! Definitely better than the prequels! The acting was great, the SFX were great, and the special (but sad) scene at the end was emotionally powerful. The use of practical effects made the movie feel like an original trilogy movie. Director J.J. Abrams has certainly outdone himself this time. For the people who are saying it is a rehash of Episode 4, yes, there are elements from episode 4 and plenty of easter eggs, but it is far from a rehash. This is a new movie created to introduce new characters for the upcoming trilogy. Please go see this movie, it is definitely worth seeing, Star Wars fan or not. May the Force be with you!"
2930,10,A great movie,I thought the the movie was great and it had that Star Wars. Feel it made me really happy to see that Disney did not make a movie like the prequels but instead bring back the class and fun of the original trilogy. It had a great score by Robin Williams the acting was fresh and it all came together nicely. If I had to think of one thing bad(which I tried) I could not and My favorite thing of all is that it makes you want to see Star Wars 8 right after so much. Another thing I thought was great was that leading up to the movie I personally did not like the trailers so it just blew me away when I saw it was a good movie and since I saw it opening night I did not get any spoilers which can really brake this fragile movie. In conclusion it was a masterpiece that is going to be remembered forever as one of the greats.
2931,8,Great movie,"The best Star Wars movie so far me !J.J.Abrad did excellent work in this prozect with Disney company and we can not wait to see the other films of saga.he seventh installment of the Star Wars film series, it stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max ON Sydow. Produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and Abrams' production company Bad Robot Productions and distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, The Force Awakens is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi; it follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight alongside the Resistance, led by veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor group to the Galactic Empire."
2932,10,Watch this movie,Just came back from the theathre and just wow... This was in my opinion the best movie experience I have ever had. Overall it's my 2nd favourite Star Wars movie after Revenge Of The Sith.
2933,10,Masterpiece,I remember watching New Hope as a 10yo child. Seeing Darth Vader for the first time when he entered the narrow corridor of Corelian Corvete was very memorable experience for me. I remember I had to turn of the VHS for a while because I was so scared :). In my opinion it is one of the most intimidating villain characters ever created in a movie. With that being said we can say that the bar was set up pretty damn high.
2934,7,"Average, yet fun and solid...",Huge Star Wars fan here.
2935,10,A positive return but could have been better!,but not awful either. I think all the hate extends from people's fond memories of childhood. These particular glasses are always rose coloured :D
2936,7,Not great,"Ignore the hype. Star Wars Episode 7 is nothing out of the world. It is a fast-paced, sci-fi adventure movie which would make Star Wars fans happy and also entertain the uninitiated and the non-fan."
2937,8,Nostalgia and Coincidences galore in this enjoyable sci-fi,"For months I've this movie has been hyped up, and as I stood in a queue that looked like it had neither a beginning nor end, I was buzzing with excitement like every other person in the queue."
2938,7,"Felt like a Star Wars movie, But left me with a sense of disappointment *Spoilers*","In the previous Star Wars, all the major characters had flaws. They faced their own downfall and stood up stronger against it. Anakin Skywalker fell to the Darkside but overcame it thanks to the love of his son, daughter and wife. Obi Wan lost against Jango Fett, against Count Dooku and finally against his student, Anakin Skywalker. Han Solo was frozen in Carbonite, Leila got shot and the list goes on."
2939,2,"The bubble popped, people are waking from a dream.","This movie was a great reunion for the saga. The only catch, it was quite independent. It had very little emotional references There were only a few references. Most being in the Millennium Falcon. There were very little at all to the prequels, most to the originals. Darth Vaders burnt helmet was amazing to see. And Luke Skywalkers return was unbelievable. I am very much looking forward to episode 8 and episode 9. But also, I am looking forward to discovering the identities of Snoke and Reys parents. Also, Luke may be a grey Jedi now. A Jedi that is put between the light and dark side. Could it be. Could phasma be Luke's wife, whom left Rey on jakku. What happened to Finn and Kylo? Does Finn become a Jedi? So much to wonder and so much to learn."
2940,9,This movie is fantastic and a great reunion.,"Being honest here until star trek came out in 2009 i had no ideia what it was but after seeing the movie it was amazing good action good performance very funny you name it. So I has a lot of expectations for this movie and J.J. Abrams did a very good job. Expect some scenes where it looked like the actors didn't gave a f*ck about the acting everything in the movie is very good. I see a lot people complaining about the characters being boring and that's not true the characters are probably the best aspect of the movie despite the action and the CGI, which looked very good. About the CGI i see a lot of people complaining about some characters not looking very good but personally that didn't bother me. Don't worry about the hate it's having every time I see a negative review it's related to being just like episode IV. The only resemblance between episode IV and VII is the fact that the enemy ship gets destroyed at the end but beside that you don't see much in common."
2941,,J.J. Abrams did it again.,"Star Wars, what can I say this movie has beaten most of my expectation. The movie I watched wasn't like the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy it was something more especially something great for us younger generations to get into the whole star wars franchise. The force awakens had great humour, great acting and voice overs, the action scenes were decent but could be better, the most beautiful scenes came from space it was so vast and magnificent, this film was exquisite with a lot of beauty. I recommend the force awakens for anyone wanting to get into star wars but can't because this is a film we have all been waiting for and now that it has finally come, we should utilise some our time to watch The force awakens."
2942,8,My Point Of View,"I was quite worried when I heard Disney had boughten Lucas film, but years later, it obviously paid off. Handing the film over to J.J Abrams was a very smart move, since he is not only a beloved StarWars fan and has experience directing other Sci-Fi movies like Startrek. This film feels a lot like StarWars with a returning cast, and a new cast. Its plot is like they said, everything old is new again, and it is because it uses A New Hope type story, and puts the new cast in Luke Skywalkers position, and uses the original cast as the Ben Kenobi type leader, tutoring the new cast. Allot of other reviews for this movie are throwing it under the bus, but those reviews contain no facts or helpful information. The force awakens uses amazing visuals along with amazing battle/flight sequences. The story leaves us with big time unanswered questions, but keep you waiting in a good way, like wheres Luke, and after Rey finds him, What does she do with him. The story kept me watching, it was funny, emotional, and charming. It gives us an idea of what happened after Return of the Jedi, and it creates a bridge from the old StarWars universe, into a new StarWars universe. There are certain problems, minor however. The Starkiller base seemed a little under used, and I think it shouldn't have been destroyed just quite yet, they should have left it as a secret weapon and nobody knows where or how it works, other wise not to sure why it was needed in this movie. Other wise I loved all the Characters, All the acting, All the effects, and the story was very pivotal, and emotional."
2943,9,This is a true Starwars film! For true Starwars fans!,"First time reviewing a movie on IMDb... but had so many thoughts about this movie, I wanted to share a few of them with the World."
2944,8,Fantastic movie - with slightly predictable plot line,I Have A Bad Feeling About SPOILERS!
2945,7,"Very Good, But Not As Good As The Original Trilogy.","This movie can be a tad bit better. It seemed really bland, it might be the hype surrounding it. This movie isn't bad no it is AMAZING it did really well introducing old characters. The problem is the story it didn't give much information nor did it give much action. But this is the start, there are 2 more. The 8th would probably make more sense so i hope the director doesn't mess this up. I can see that this is really a copy of a new hope. It pretty much has the same story line. They started in a desert onto this resistance council and defeated a gigantic deadly star that belongs to the bad guys. I am still very pleased with the new star wars. Even though it had the potential to be better it also has a bigger potential to be worse so they did a good job.Good job JJ"
2946,8,Didn't fulfill Potential,"Over the past couple of years, Hollywood has made an attempt to bring back as many successful franchises from the past as possible, either through reboots or straight-up sequels. Needless to say, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is one of those attempts, and it is definitely one of the better ones! With that being said, it was still not as convincing of a return as I had hoped due to the awfully predictable script, and the general lack of surprising and exciting moments. "
2947,6,Something Old is... Still Old,My star wars thoughts. By the honorable James H. Armstrong.. Esquire 
2948,9,My star wars thoughts.,My first review in 5 years of being an IMDb member and the sole reason being the reviews I have previously read for 'The Force Awakens'.
2949,7,"In a word ""Decent""","I felt that it was going to be a let down movie. The title and the enormous marketing arriving before the first release, kind of announced that. I really hoped that I would find something in it to like, but it was not the case: - bad acting, - copy paste story, - no new interesting characters, - fighting scenes are lame,"
2950,1,...just a wannabe,"There are a suspiciously high number of 1/10 ratings for this film, the lowest mark possible. That would mean the writing, directing, acting, cinematography, sfx etc were all of the lowest possible standard. Do you believe that? Of course not because it is nonsense. One review even claims that the sfx are of the same standard as they were in the original film, yes, because that had a cgi character in it didn't it!"
2951,9,1 out of ten? Don't be ridiculous!,"This movie was great, and I understand why hate is coming through. Many people believe it is just a rehash which it kind of is, but it takes a different turn and makes it feel new and it's still enjoyable for new fans and old alike. The action was great, the movie was beautifully crafted and casted, Daisy Ridley gave an amazing performance as well as Jon Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, and Adam Driver. Jon's and Oscar's characters have great chemistry just like Jon's and Daisy's which makes the characters relate able. The old cast is back and gives out great performances as well. As an old fan, the movie made me cry, pay deep attention, fall in love with it, and scream with joy. It is a movie with flaws just like any other movie made, and worth your money."
2952,10,"Great Movie, but why the hate?","I'll make this very short: TFA really is the Star Wars movie I was hoping for and waiting for since I was kid. I cannot agree with anyone who disliked it for the elements that were recycled or for Kylo Ren or even the amount of humor. Everything is there for a reason. It feels organic, real and so Star Wars. The universe itself is as believable as in the originals. "
2953,9,A worthy sequel and my #3 in the series,"Now sad to say I'm one of those star wars fans that got owned by Disney after they made all of the expanded universe a different timeline. I have read, watched, and played, everything star wars. Here is my review for the movie."
2954,10,A review from a hardcore fan.,"Wow, nice feeling, sitting in a cinema and watching the real Star Wars. The Star Wars we watched as kids Jabba looked a bit different though, got a few teeth and was more red and stuff.. don't know why the death star was destroyed by blue squadron, also it was a moon guys – no – this is not a moon, turn back Solo looked older too and wasn't there something with teddy bears in the forest Well they didn't quite get it all correct but they sure tried."
2955,7,Solid Movie,"This movie is flawed, to say the least. Most of the main characters are played by novice actors, and it shows, the acting alternating between some genuinely impactful drama and lighthearted action, and cringe-inducingly misfired attempts at likewise. The script likewise alternates between bland, dry, filler, and clunky, overwrought lines where the writers were obviously trying too hard, and precious few scenes in the goldilocks zone where the script flows organically."
2956,8,The Prodigal Son Come Home at Last,"On first viewing, four years ago, when all the thirst for Star Wars was there, this was a very good movie. Then fast forward to one night before The Rise of Skywalker and a few minutes after rewatching The Last Jedi... The Force Awakens is a weak, safe, nostalgia-driven movie. It has zero heart and zero risk. It's a play that's good enough to keep the audience around for what was to come, but on its own, it's just... okay."
2957,6,A Weak Movie,"I am not a person who really reviews films in words, sure I speak about films with friends and family, I love films as much as the next person. This in fact is my first posting but one I decided to do as Star War's marks a landmark in Film History and my thought of cinema as a child. It was a fairytale, in fact it was ""the fairytale"", the one that truly shuddered the World! Like everyone else, the hype on this film was so big, it had to catch up with me before I watched the film. The Hype this time reminded me of how I felt as a child waiting for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" to appear after the original was released. The Hype probably set a bar so high the film would never reach it. That said it still remained even when I finally took my seat at the Cinema waiting for the film to roll."
2958,8,Is the childhood magic back for another generation?,Hey everyone.
2959,7,"Small story in a BIG UNIVERSE, and not just any universe - a Star Wars universe.","I have wasted times on many things before. This was the worse one. Everything was so predictable, even coronation street is a lot more exiting than this errr advertisement? Science fiction yeah right.. Same scenes, same stories as the previous sequels. Go home and do your washing and ironing.. Please stop making this movie again, leave it. Please employ more creative people to make unpredictable movies. Please do less computer animation Please try to be more sensible when you make movies. Please use logic when you make sci-fi movies. When you can use anti gravity machines, laser bombs etc, you wouldn't need laser swords to kill your enemies."
2960,1,Is this a movie???,"I really enjoyed this movie and was so glad to see that it was nothing like the prequel films. It brought back memory's of the old films, this combined with new ideas for the characters like the storm troopers was great . I couldn't give it a higher score than an eight as I feel that these remakes can only get better. I can see why people have strong views about this movie as the whole Star Wars thing means so much to so many, but this is a great movie and deserves a place alongside episodes 4,5 & 6. My two step sons really enjoyed this film and are glad that there will be more to come as am I. There were some great performances from characters like Fin and the CGI was spot on, sets were great the ruined Star Destroyers looked fantastic. "
2961,8,Awakening memory's,"I never comment online after seeing a movie, but I looked at some of the spoiler free reviews before and a good amount of reviews after I saw the movie,and I made an account just because many of the reviews were so unfairly low. The reviews I saw made me doubt how good this movie was going to be and killed some of my excitement for the movie. Honestly, if you believe this movie deserves a ranking of anything below a 5/10, no new star wars movie would ever satisfy you. Just go see this movie and take it for what it is, an enjoyable 135 minutes of Star Wars. Stop expecting anything new in Star Wars to be terrible or to meet unreal expectations. Also, taking inspiration from the original movies is exactly what everyone asked for, and this movie did a good job at recapturing the feel of the original trilogy and adding new elements from current film making. So, stop listening to many of these reviews, this new trilogy is going in the right direction. The only problem with star wars is a pessimistic minority of the fans who ruin the movie for everyone else."
2962,8,This is actually good movie.,"I think it's important that we all remember something with regards to this film: it is the first time a Star Wars movie has been shot without George Lucas. From where it left off, there hasn't been a Star Wars in cinema for 30 years. I take my hat off to Disney for creating a movie that is better than any of the first 3(episode I, II, III) without the help of Lucas. I for one thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any Star Wars fan. Yes, it may have used loads of it's plot from the previous Star Wars movies, but do you blame them for going back to basics and a winning combination? I am very excited for the next one, and think Disney have done a great job of producing a new, fresh and exciting Star Wars. Thank you Disney"
2963,9,Great movie,Some spoilers! Ahh!
2964,10,Let's relax and not overthink this,** I've not seen the 3D version; only the regular one **
2965,7,"Very entertaining movie, will watch again","The Force Awakens is a great addition to the Star Wars series. It's plot is laid out similarly to the first Star Wars movie, and I think many people are overlooking this. The movie is to be felt and interpreted by the younger generation as the first movie was by the younger generation at the time, and being a part of the younger generation today I believe they pulled this off pretty well, and I also believe this is the most prominent feature in this movie. I think this is why some of the older generations are disliking the setup of the plot line and the movie itself as well."
2966,9,"From One Generation to the Next - Why the New Installment of ""Star Wars"" is Not a Lousy Remake","Really good movie, enjoyed every second of it because the new good guys are really good. but it was not a "" great movie"" why? The new bad guy is in no way a match to Lord Darth Vader..."
2967,7,Good Movie...,"My short, NO SPOILERS review of Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens."
2968,9,A nostalgic yet refreshing Star Wars experience. Best movie of 2015.,"This is a fun movie, but don't expect any new ideas regarding plot and characters. Almost the whole story is a reboot of Episode IV. The director kept the look and the spirit of the original Trilogy, which George Lucas missed to do in the first three Episodes and which I appreciate. Rey is great and sympathetic, but basically she is a female version of young Luke with a little more fire up her ass. The pace of TFA is fast, it's good entertaining cinema. What I had wished for, was a little more space for Chewbacca and Han. Also missed Lando a lot. I found it hard to watch Leia, not trying to think ""Botox, Botox, too much Botox...."" all the time."
2969,7,Reboot of Episode IV,"The plot: everybody is looking for a small and moderately funny droid carrying highly classified and vital information. Does it ring a bell? The dark side has a new consistently bigger death star to blown up in a coordinated ground-space attack. Everything is just a 3D/4K remastering of episode 4 adding nothing at all to the saga. There is no decent light-saber duel in all movie, there is no Jedy in this Star Wars. They even re-staged Kenobi's death sacrificing the only interesting character left. The narration itself is idiot-proof; underdeveloped characters and nothing left to imagination. The whole family thing is confusing, lets repeat over and over who is related to whom. Overall I got the feeling that instead of concluding this saga they are trying to restart and milk it for the century to come by appealing to a younger public. Boring and mediocre"
2970,4,The force awakens. .. ... slowly,Well... The wait is over... Star Wars: The force Awakens is upon us... But does all the hype around this movie worth it?
2971,9,Star Wars is back and its incredible!,"Star Wars 7 provides wonderful characters, both new and old. The film begins with fantastic examples of beautiful cinematography and introduces Kylo Ren as a dark and intriguing character with clear direction allowing him to develop into this incredible figure in the star wars universe. The film also includes two new characters in the form of Rey and Finn who are both excellently represented in their own rights and only add to the already brilliant film, with excellent performances by both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega."
2972,9,"Fantastic, Star Wars has risen to prominence once again with an amazing entry into modern filmmaking.","Definitely makes up for the prequels. I was a little skeptical at first, feeling it might be catered to a younger audience with all the hype on BB-8. I felt they were going to undermine the original characters. And as a fan of the Expanded Universe I was a little mad OK maybe really mad (Kylo Ren style) that they were writing a new story line. However I love the new story.I love how the turbulent love of Han and Leia has not been all candy and roses since ROJ. I do wish they answered some questions they left us hanging with. Like who is Rey, how did Maz get Anakin's lightsaber and a little more detail on the first orders rising. But all in all awesome addition to the series. The Star Wars universe is getting bigger and I can't be happier. On one more note J.J Abrums did a fantastic job of directing (as always), I love how in the Millennium Falcon he used the old graphics on the computer screen and the chess board. Which was very nostalgic."
2973,8,Star Wars!!!!!!!!!!,"""I will finish what you started"" a promise made by Kylo Ren to Darth Vader, a mission reflected to that of Director JJ. Abrahams who has now taken over the reigns from George Lucas in continuing the legacy of the Star Wars Universe and in this film he has definitely recaptured the magic of what made the trilogy such timeless classics."
2974,,Force Awakens Spoiler free review!,"Before you judge my negative thoughts please notice I gave the film a 9/10... I've been a Star Wars fan all my life and having George Lucas direct them all we all have our expectations on how the films are delivered and presented! JJ did very well sticking to the Star Wars style but there was too many things in the film that reminded me of Star Trek, which is also directed by JJ Abrams of course. The first Star Wars trilogy (4-6) contained a lot of character building and relationship building, take for example the obvious change of character in Luke Skywalker from being a nobody to a confident heroic Jedi and also the relationship growth of Han Solo and Princess Leia. These all took time to build however I feel like the character and relationship building in The Force Awakens is really rushed and forced upon us which is unlike previous Star Wars films. The film is action from beginning to end, you can tell that they've wanted to make a film that is action packed and enjoyable for the new young generation of children who will grow up with the new trilogy of films.This yet again is unlike previous Star Wars films which tend to start slow and progress into it, giving the film time to build its characters. The storyline seems like a new updated version of the original trilogy. For me the storyline is far too easily compared to storyline in A New Hope and you can also compare the characters from the 2 films. All the villains in Star Wars have been brilliant, but for me Kylo Ren maybe the worst villain we've had throughout the franchise, comparing him to the obvious Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Count Dooku etc. All these negative comments I have made can not take away the feeling of how excited and happy I and all other Star Wars fans are to have a new trilogy of films! Non of the comments I have made can take away the fact that The Force Awakens is yet another fun, brilliant Star Wars film which ends with us wanting to ask a lot of questions and to find them out in the coming films. The Force Awakens is a must see for all Star Wars fans and I encourage all the younger generations who haven't seen Star Wars yet to get into it!"
2975,9,Basic Thoughts,"First of all, this is my first review and English is not my native language so please forgive me for any typos and bad grammar. "
2976,7,"(SPOILER FREE) Not bad, but it could've been a lot better.",Very minor spoilers within...
2977,9,"Underwhelming villains, borrowed too much, but otherwise total perfection.","I agree with several posters that this is basically Episode 4 but with better acting and cinematography. I expect a very similar plot line for Episode 8 with Episode 5, but I'm *hoping* this was simply a bridge from the old to a new and better story line."
2978,7,"'twas OK, better than a lot, especially the prequels.","It pains me to see so many negative reviews of this movie. After the awful experience that were the sequels (episodes 1,2 and 3), this film comes as a breath of fresh air, bringing the Star Wars franchise to its former glory. So what if it resembles, in terms of plot,'A New Hope'? Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. It is simple proof that this film wants to continue the legacy of the old trilogy. True, the similarities are striking (a new 'Death Star' called Starkiller base -destroyed in the same manner as the death star, a new droid carrying a message, and the examples are countless). However, it is how all these similarities are placed withing the context of a new, fresh storyline that make this movie simply brilliant. People tend to focus too much on the similarities with episode 4, whereas the emphasis should be on the new characters and the new direction of the story within the Star Wars universe. The protagonist, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is the heroine we have all been waiting for in the Star Wars franchise. Daisy Ridley's performance of this character is utterly mind-blowing. She delivers some of the best acting I have seen in any Star Wars movie so far. No wonder she instantly becomes likable. While some critics suggest that her evolution throughout this film may be a bit too rushed (her attunement to the force rendering her capable of performing mind- tricks, being able to defeat a partially trained dark side user), we have to consider that, during the last 30 years, or so, the force lay dormant in the galaxy, Luke himself renouncing the idea of training Jedi after his failure with Kylo Ren, who turned against him. The idea of 'awakening', as the title of the film suggests, has to be associated with a powerful manifestation or outburst of the force, that can be felt throughout the galaxy by the remaining force-users (supreme leader Snoke senses it). Rey is the manifestation of this awakening, which makes it easier for her to quickly become attuned with the force and able to unconsciously, and without any training, use it. The awakening would not be an awakening if Rey wasn't able to overpower Kylo Ren. Let's not forget that Kylo Ren, strong as he may be with the force, hasn't had any practice with a light-saber in a long time, with no force users left in the galaxy. He was certainly taken by surprise by Rey's ability to use the force. Thus, it is safe to say that the movie ingeniously portrays a heroine in becoming, a character that both the old generation of fans as well as the new one will adore. Moreover, it is about time that a female Jedi was cast as a main character in the Star Wars films. In terms of acting, this movie excels from all points of view. The performances of the actors were outstanding. Adam Driver, as Kylo Ren did an amazing job depicting a new , original type of villain that has more depth to him than the average villain. His performance was amazing. The same thing can be said about the rest of the actors and actresses in this film. Despite the lack of originality with some points in the story/script, Star Wras, The Force Awakens stands out as one of the best, if not the very best, movies in the Star Wars franchise, due to the unique, Oscar worthy performances of the actors, the depth and attention to detail, the emotions it conveys, the epic soundtrack, the nostalgia and the practical effects that clearly amplifies the sense of reality in the film. Congratulations, J J Abrams on a job well done. It exceeded my highest expectations. You saved Star Wars and re-awakened a dormant passion for the franchise in the hearts of millions of old and new fans. Star Wars is once again back, in all its glory!!!"
2979,10,A movie exceeding the highest expectations,Star Wars episode 7 is the most disappointing thing since my son....
2980,6,"An enjoyable, if not entirely original night at the movies","I did not enjoy this film that much. Compared to the other Star Wars films, this one is less enjoyable. The main problem I have with this film is how the plot is A New Hope's plot. I don't think it was a good idea to do that and it made the film feel like a remake of A New Hope. One other issue I have is how all of the new designs feel very toy-like and uninspired. The film, in my opinion, could have been much more enjoyable if it had its own original plot."
2981,1,Not that good,"Don't listen to any of the negative reviews. Yes, some of the things happen in this movie may seem familiar, but all these things are crucial to the plot of the movie. This movie is not just a rehash of A New Hope. This movie is everything the prequels weren't, with a good plot, good pacing, believable CGI and the use of practical effects, good acting, and realistic lightsaber choreography. The music for this movie was average for a Star Wars movie, but it made up for it with everything else being stellar. This movie is exactly what Star Wars is supposed to be and feel like, and watching it really made me feel like I was watching the originals again. For the people who claim that this movie had too many plot holes and unanswered questions, remember that this is the first movie out of 3. Just like many questions were answered in episodes 5 and 6, the future episodes will answer the many unanswered questions left by this movie."
2982,10,Great,"The Good: great plot, aesthetically pleasing visuals and stage-setting, humour, great screenplay, great camera work (dynamic, never a dull shot), excellent acting performance of new and old actors, good and innovative play with tropes and themes from the original, interesting continuation of the Star Wars franchise (world building), great finale, great use of pathos, real world settings and finally great and convincing special effects."
2983,10,Best Star Wars,"I'm still not quite sure why people expected a flawless movie. I mean, we have never seen one in the past. Not the original trilogy, not The Godfather, never has their been a movie that has nothing wrong with it, yet people still seem to think that was a given. Yes, it is flawed, but no, it does not deserve these extremely low scores."
2984,9,"It's not perfect, but no movies are. Get over it","I've read several reviews about, in all honesty, the biggest film of the year (for a few years for that matter); several have argued that the latest addition to the Star Wars saga is pretty poor."
2985,8,Star Wars fans SHOULD NOT be disappointed...,"Condensed the original saga of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi into The Force Awakens. A tribute the franchise needed badly to help fans forget Episodes I-III. Like the recent Mad Max film it was a relentless fast-paced modern action flick (without the originals' grit that made the originals so endearing). Great movie for children nevertheless. "
2986,7,Action packed homage to the originals,"There are good films which you inhabit during their length, there are superlative films which stay with you and then there are the myth-making phenomena which become a way of life. Star Wars firmly belongs to the third category and JJ Abrams' Episode VII has again made us one with The Force. If you were wondering whether to watch it or not, consider this a hard yes in its favor. When Abrams was recruited to direct a Star Wars film 10 years after the pulverisingly dull prequels, he had to satiate the fan boys, seduce a new generation into the theater and make Disney billions. Luke Skywalker would have sympathized, but the director -- just like the legendary Jedi -- has delivered on every single count. Whether you are returning to the seventh part of the series after watching every Star Wars film a million times or gently nudging open the door to the Galactic Empire, you will go home a happy, happy person. Oh, and at the box office, records are falling like nine pins. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the movie event of the year and it revels in the fact. The film has us from the moment the iconic reverse scroll appears and John Williams' rousing theme booms. Hyper referential and full of in-jokes, Abrams takes the best features of the original trilogy and gives us a loving mash-up. Significantly, he wipes the scars of the prequels by offering us a world where they never existed. The film takes off from where Return of the Jedi ended. It has been close to three decades since Ewoks danced to celebrate the end of the evil Empire and there is an imbalance again in a galaxy far, far away. Luke Skywalker has gone missing, a malevolent First Order has replaced the Empire and The Rebel Alliance has been rechristened Resistance. A lovable little droid is the key to restoring balance and both the light and dark side are looking for it. He is found by a feisty scavenger Rey (Daisy Riley). The rag-tag team is joined by Finn (Jon Boyega), an ex-Stormtrooper with a conscience. Representing the dark side is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a Darth Vader revivalist with a mean light saber which glows red down to its cross guard. Ren has a passion for dark helmets but he doesn't need them. With or without them, he breathes menace and fear. A deserving heir to the most iconic villains in the cinematic history? You bet. What he shares with the other two newcomers to the franchise – Rey and Finn – is a strength tinged with human frailties and self doubt. It makes all three of them real and relatable. Rey and Finn especially stand for the young viewers because they have heard of Leia, Han Solo and Luke but are not sure what is myth and what is reality. It takes Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to appear and assure them, ""The Dark Side, the Jedi—it's true. All of it."" Which brings us to Solo, still the beating heart of this franchise, crooked grin and swagger firmly in place. Star Wars feels an even better film when he tells his furry sidekick Chewbacca, ""Chewie, we are home."" Carrie Fisher's Leia is also back as the leader of the Resistance. Older and wiser, we hope to see more of her as the franchise progresses. But as the older cast members steal the scenes, the youngsters have made an assured debut. Boyega's Finn is funny and sensitive in equal parts. Full marks to Abrams for casting a black man as the lead of a billion-dollar franchise. But it is Riley's Rey who is a real find. The moment she walks onto the frame, she owns the film. A scrappy scavenger, Rey combines heart with spirit. Her feisty portrayal makes it one of the most feminist films of the year. For a franchise which has made quite a habit of portraying damsels in distress, Rey needs no man to save her. She is exasperated when Finn tries to hold her hand while escaping from Stormtroopers. ""Let go of me,"" she tells him imperially. Oscar Issac's Poe, while underused, recalls the younger Solo. He is happy to tell anyone who'll listen that he is the best pilot in the Resistance. While the young cast members are all amazing, it is the droid BB8 which absolutely steals the show. A vast improvement on R2D2 (sorry fans), he combines the roly-poly movements of a droid with expressions of a puppy. You expect it to roll out its tongue and start licking Rey any minute. Bram's also offers us something George Lucas failed to do in the prequels – action that appears and feels real. Abrams manages that by judiciously mixing CGI with more homegrown means like putting people in suits and using robots. A light saber battle in a wintry forest, planets being neutralized and face-offs between TIE fighters and X-wingers, we get them all. Astounding planets of all kinds – winter wonderlands, tropical delights, arid deserts and the bad guy's lair – also make the film a visual spectacle. Don't miss the cantina run by Lupita Nyong'o's Maz Kanata either. What the purists might complain about Abrams reliance on Star Wars myths and failure to break new ground. The Force Awakens repackages the familiar, adds sheen to the existing and stylises the relatable. Where the director could have explored a brave new world, he prefers to be derivative. In his defence, we will say that for now, it is enough. Smartly paced and full of wit characteristic of the series, this film is a copybook exercise in storytelling. There are holes in the script and obvious McGuffins but while the film lasts, you are prepared to ignore them. As it ends, you are already waiting for its sequel and some answers. You want to see the character arc of people both old and new because Abrams has etched them in your memory."
2987,10,The Force is awakened. We can feel the authenticity of Actual Star wars.,"Hi everyone :) Saw the last Star Wars movie yesterday (fan from birth ha ha) which pretty much enjoyed but felt kinda disappointed/annoyed at the same time... I mean graphics and all were freaking amazing and liked the story with Rey etc., felt goosebumps while seeing my fav characters from the past (!!!!!!), BUT... HATED the inaccuracies in the main story. I mean there is a reason there's a lore! "
2988,6,Inaccuracies all over the place!,"this is one of the best movies i've ever witnessed, it truly made a great appearance after a long absence (prequels don't count) and it has the same feel as new hope which is absolutely amazing. i liked how they introduced each lovable charterer in a unique and magnificent way, and it had humor in it with C-3PO, R2-D2 and the millennium falcon, i liked BB-8 a lot, i think he alone made the movie a great experience and i never got disappointed at any time along the movie, and the new characters don't fail at drawing a bright smile on your face, they totally fit in the star wars universe as we know it. overall i think it's fantastic and it deserves every single dollar it gets. 10/10"
2989,10,I'm very happy this movie came out,"The new Star Wars movie continues reboots the Star Wars universe, but at some cost. "
2990,6,It's plot lacks originality but the characters are magnificent,Why o why after almost 40 years is the same exact movie recreated as the one from 1977 ? This so called blockbuster is an exact copy of episode 4 with little bits from 5 thrown in to fill the 2 hour running time. Even the soundtrack is more or less the same.
2991,3,Star wars : The copy awakens,"Probably gonna catch A LOT of flak for this but here goes.. Now I LOVE me some Star Wars (saw ALL the films in theaters starting with episode 4 in 1977) but is it impossible to get a Wars film that doesn't involve blowing up something? Episode 1- trade federation blockade ship, Episode 4- death star, Episode 6- 2nd death star, now Episode 7- Starkiller base/planet. C'mon guys! It's kinda played out! There's SO MANY other story arcs to explore other than the ""there's the bad guys, let's go blow them up!"" PLEASE Hollywood, put your thinking caps on! It's not impossible to do. Episode 5 (my favorite of the series) didn't involve the whole ka-blooey thing! ﻿"
2992,9,Ka-blooey,"I really enjoyed it, i went to see it in a local cinema having had mixed reviews so i didn't go in there with high expectations. The film is so much better than what i had been told from my friends. Don't go in there expecting it to be like any other Star Wars, its so graphically different can really see how much CGI has really helped sharpen things up. Equally the acting is great. Having heard an interview on a radio station the lead female was cast very late into the production so they not had long to film her into the story line. Well done to the young actors, i look forward to watching them grow."
2993,10,"Nothing like old star wars, better or worse, you decide","I thought it was excellent and I love the feeling of watching the old trilogy again. JJ Abrams is sci-fi king and I love his TV-series Lost,Fringe,Person of Interest(executive producer) and Star Trek movies convinced me that he would make a great Star Wars movie. "
2994,10,Great movie,"Now, like a lot people I could hardly contain my excitement for this new Star Wars film, and while the prequels left a really sour taste in my mouth, I knew the magic was still there, waiting for the right person to tap into it and breathe new life into the franchise. This is Star Wars after all, and the anticipation for this film was huge, so huge in fact that it almost seemed impossible to meet such sky-high expectations. Well, I can assure everyone that after 32 years since Return of the Jedi (in my mind the last great Star Wars film), The Force Awakens delivers on all fronts, transporting us back to that galaxy far, far away and it's glorious! It truly captured the heart and feel of the originals and like the original films I felt a whole range of emotions which is what Star Wars is all about."
2995,9,It's back!,"I dont see a single piece of reason of whats all the fuss is about!! Poor direction, dull screenplay, trash script.... this one is probably good for kids, they can watch this instead of cartoons 👎👎"
2996,6,Over-rated,"I saw this movie in a sold out theater. Families, couples, young, and old patrons. Excitement was in the air. "
2997,9,People need to lighten up,"I would argue that 'The Force Awakens' has been the most highly anticipated, and therefore hardest to make, Star Wars movie thus far. "
2998,7,"Underwhelming, but competent, Star Wars sequel.",Sorry for my English
2999,10,"It's not perfect, but it's good.","first i am no hardcore star wars fan at all. i love sci-fi/fantasy stories be it books or movies. i just felt that this new creation is just episode 1 in a new costume. of course the movie is very well made. top notch cgi. besides the absolute flat and uninspired carrie fisher, amazing cast."
3000,7,episode 1 all over again,"Right, well. Never thought I'd live to see the day when so many people, so many original fans of the SW movies, would give such a cheap, poorly-written excuse of a movie so much positive attention. This has been mentioned time and time again, so no use of repeating it. But f^ck it. THIS. IS. A F^CKING REBOOT. disguised with pretty CGI and seemingly 'new' characters. Right, Disney. JJ. You might have fooled many, but not all. The characters in the original trilogy (and the prequel) were *memorable*. They were *fleshed out* role-models. They actually seemed like real human beings. But this? A typical over-powered lead followed by an annoying, irrational and nonsensical side-kick with a serious case of megalomania. Ah, scratch that. BOTH of them are over-powered megalomaniacs. Typical marie-sue/gary-stu situation here. "
3001,1,"Cheap, overrated ripoff","Great film that is simply sublime update of the original 1977 episode IV. story is well paced with drama, action, comedy and tragedy. Effects updated as it's surprisingly a mesh mash of the prequels with the 70's retro as half of this green screen but is so photo realistic you can't tell. The use of film and original lenses gives true gritty gravitas. Overall wonderful new and old characters that keep you intrigued for the sequel with many wonderful questions . "
3002,10,Best film of 2015 after watching 80% of cinema releases at my local multiplex,"Before going into this movie, I was a bit nervous. I did not want this film to be a bit of a disappointment like The Phantom Menace, not saying I hate that movie. After walking out of the IMAX theater, I was amazed. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is my favorite film I have ever seen, and I have seen many of the greats. The story takes place, 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The First Order, the new Galactic Empire, is looking for the map that leads to the missing Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, while the Resistance is trying to get it as well. First off, the casting is amazing, especially Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey. The story was great, and don't care about ""the plot being too alike to A New Hope"" because pretty much all of the Star Wars plots are like that. The characters were very well thought, especially Kylo Ren. The twist is amazing, not spoiling it. I have no negatives what so ever. Unfortunately, I can only give this film 10, and not higher. I loved it, so I saw it again in IMAX. I highly recommend this film."
3003,9,Best Movie I have ever seen!,"The film was really awesome and yet brilliant, It was the best film I have ever seen but some scenes were really sad and horrifying."
3004,10,Star Wars,Solid B+ but could have been an A+
3005,8,Loved it..... But.............,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was able to compliment the older style that people love the series for, and were able to blend it into our current culture in one of the best ways imaginable. JJ Abrams seems to grasp the need for practical effects but also realises the advantage CGI gives him. Harrison Ford reprised his role in one of the best ways possible. Seeing him and Chewie fight side to side like they once did was quite the spectacle. I'll highly recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens as one of the best comebacks to a franchise I've ever seen and a movie for newcomers of JJ Abrams work (myself being one of them) as a great place to start. He clearly knows what he's doing and respects the source material enough for it to be as great as he's made it."
3006,6,Great Way To Make Up For The Prequels.,"Loved it! I'm going to see it again in a few days, can't praise it enough Sat there for 2 hours like a little kid on Xmas morning"
3007,10,Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,"I've just watched this film with my 8 & 12 year old sons this weekend, and after reading many bad reviews of this film I feel that i have to leave my opinion. All three of us really enjoyed this film. It is well acted and there are good performances from two British up and coming stars. The film has plenty of action from the start, and although the story is a bit weak it keeps you engaged until the end. There are plenty light sabre wielding scenes and all the usual CGI effects you would expect without spoiling the film. The film tries to stay true to the original series but I feel the inclusion of Hans Solo, Leya and Luke Skywalker weren't necessary to the plot but we're probably there to boost ticket sales. After recently watching the full series of films, I have to say that this film is far better than I,II ,& III and is a worthy sequel to Return of the Jedi."
3008,7,This is a good family film which is worthy of the original.,"When I first walked out after seeing Episode VII, I really impressed. From the combat on the ground, to the battles in the sky, this movie looks amazing. However, there were a few things that took me out of the moment when they happened. First, the amount of ""One Liners."" I understand that the original Star Wars trilogy was full of them, however, the contributed or didn't interrupt the story. When Poe is staring Kylo Ren in the face and says, ""So who starts this..."" is during a very intense scene in the movie, and it totally killed the mood of the scene. On top of that, it made Kylo Ren look extremely weak. All the build up of stopping the blast beam, and his attitude was ripped away at that moment. The only other thing that bugged me, as well, was the amount of comic relief. Again, I know in the originals there was comic relief, for example, the scene where Leia says she would rather kiss a Wookie. That's great because its developing the connection between Han and Leia. In Episode VII, Kylo Ren is being a baby and throwing a temper tantrum, and while he's doing so, two stormtroopers are walking that way, hear it, then turn around and walk away. Why was that part shown? We already saw him destroy his own machinery earlier in the film after being told about Rey and Fin. The first fit was showing and developing Kylo Rens character. That's great, the character is reviling something about himself that we didn't know. The second time, could have cut that out and it wouldn't have changed the movie in any aspect. "
3009,8,Check it out,"I think the main reason we all saw the movie was Luke Skywalker, who doesn't show up until the end of the movie...That was not the only thing, the story line to it was a little dull if you ask me. All in all the move was good. But with all that being said it was a pretty good movie with everything a movie needs. Twists in the plot such as Han Solo murdered by Kylo Ren (His Son) was a nice twist in the story, though me and my family are huge Han Solo fans it was a nice twist to the story I have to admit. If a little more effort was put into it I think it would've been a lot better. I would say I recommend this movie to people but it is out of theateres, so you should buy it on DVD if you have not seen it yet."
3010,7,Okay Storyline...,"With all the hype of bringing back the original cast, one would think this movie would have been fantastic and geared around the old favorite characters. Right? WRONG."
3011,5,Not what I expected,First of all it was a great movie!
3012,9,"If you like the Star Wars series as a whole, go ahead and watch this one too","Although many film critics disliked the idea of creating a new Star Wars movie, saying that people should leave the beloved masterpiece alone. Viewers think it's a blast from the past, crowning it movie of the year. There was a lot of hype when it was rumored that the all time classic would add another sequel in 2016. It drew a lot of excitement because many people thought the series had come to an end. Many critics felt that the Star Wars franchise was perfect and was best to be untouched. Saying that it will ruin the entire series to bring in new characters and to create a new story. For the first part of the movie, it seemed as though they were right. A lot of time has passed, we follow new characters, and a new villain making people wonder what happened in between. However, the story takes a turn when the two protagonists, Rey and Finn, meet with Han Solo. He helps to explain what has happened in the past, and how everything has come to be. From then on we are reunited with all of the original characters, such as Princess Leia, R2D2, and many more. Each time giving a background on how they have made it to this point. It is a combination of new and old in a perfect way, causing them to unite to defeat the new enemy, Kylo Ren. The movie was a top box office hit, appealing to both the old and new generations. Many of the critics have died down, and viewers are already crowning it movie of the year."
3013,9,Summary,"Star wars the force awakens is a great film which continues the saga into a new era. This film did not live up to all the hype it had, but is that even possible?"
3014,10,Good stuff,"After watching the initial reveal for the new star wars I was overcome with joy. I grew up with star wars from a young age and went to watch all of the prequels at the cinema and I loved every thing about star wars, from the lightsabers to the death star. I unfortunately wasn't around when the original trilogy was coming out. I don't think i'll ever forgive my parents for that one. So as soon as it let me, I booked tickets to see it. Even then I was only able to get tickets to watch it in 2D on the 23rd. As soon as the credits at the start of the movie began to roll I was hit with a myriad of emotions. I had no idea how to feel. Of course I was excited, but I was also really worried for the film, if it was a failure, it would've ruined most of my childhood memories. I am pleased to say it wasn't."
3015,8,The Force Awakens Is Exactly What We Have Been Waiting for,The Force Awakens is the seventh installment of the widely popular series known as Star Wars. The Force Awakens is trying to reignite the old movie serious and bring it into the new generation of movie goers. The seventh installment brings new technology and effects to better build upon the old stories which everybody already loves.
3016,7,A movie full of visual beauty and flow but lacking in originality,There may be spoilers. Star wars the force awakens is the best of all the star wars movies by far . All the new actors in this movie made it great especially Daisey Ridley and Adam Driver.They were the breakout stars of the movie. Adam driver was a great villain and he will be in future episodes.Daisy Ridley did a great job as the main hero of this movie and her performance was amazing. The overall story and action was spectacular.So the new cast and story is what makes this a great space epic . Oscar Isaac was also great new addition to the cast he did a great job as the best pilot of the resistance. All the original cast of the first trilogy did a great job even if there part was brief . I also loved the new droid BB 8 he was funny and a great side character. John Boyega was awesome as the ex storm trooper he was funny loud and great. So all in all this was great movie. So go see it as many times as you can before it leaves theaters .
3017,10,Star wars the force awakens is the best star wars movie,"The Force Awakens is supposed to be the triumphant return of Star Wars. After the commercially successful, but by many fans disliked prequel trilogy, Episode VII sets out to get Star Wars back on track, to rekindle the magic of the old movies, to inspire a new generation of Star Wars fans and to satisfy all the fans of the original trilogy."
3018,7,A New Hope – now with even bigger Death Stars,This is very entertaining with an exciting universe that really comes back to life in this new first episode of the series.
3019,10,Great movie,"First I would like to state, that this review will contain (heavy) spoilers. Everything I write is of course just my opinion."
3020,7,Alright Space Fantasy,"After reading a bunch of positive reviews by the critics I expected this film to be pretty good. It was hard to do worse than the god-awful ""Revenge of the Sith"", with Frankenstein-like acting by Hayden Christensen and even the cool emperor Palpatine made look like the cartoon character Judge Doom in ""Who framed Roger Rabbit"". But ""The Force Awakens"" managed to take the Star Wars franchise to new lows. "
3021,3,I want my money back!,"In so many ways this feels like a remake of New Hope, so I'm going to focus on the strengths and weaknesses relative to that."
3022,8,So many wonderful things - poor editing,First of all the force is back baby!
3023,9,Star wars is back!,"You know what, after reading through many reviews on The Force Awakens, I have become very angry of the overwhelming number of people saying that the movie ""didn't live up to the standards of the originals"" or ""bored me"" or ""was basically a remake"" and I want to slap you all in the face! They finally brought back Star Wars after so many years, and in order to make the best out of it, the creators and J.J. Abrams decided to make the plot of The Force Awakens similar to the plot of New Hope. They definitely did this to not only draw in the older crowd of people who grew up watching Star Wars, but also relate to the new generation of people who have just come into contact with the great series. People are being way too critical over the repetition and the overwhelming amount of plot points that are similar to New Hope. "
3024,9,Repetition yet Necessary,"In my opinion it was a remake of a new hope but it also has some unique qualities. I also think that it's more than a remake it is the beginning of a young woman finding who she is and what she was meant do. I would like to add Daisy Ridley did an Amazing performance of Rey. I also totally agree with the video I saw ""How Star Wars: The Force Awakens Should Have Ended"" Why call it ""Star Killer Base"" just call it ""The Death Star Three"" In most sincere opinion it was not a ""Padawan"" cast It was a cast of Jedi Knight cast it was awesome. Very experienced and well trained. Harrison Ford did amazing when he got killed, but it was weird because every movie I seen him in he lives. Harrison Ford will aways be the Han Solo but I don't know why I think this but to me I always liked him as indie better but I will still have trouble deciding on being Indiana Jones or Han Solo for Halloween. All in all I thought it was an amazing movie."
3025,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review,"I, and as I see many others have already stated, have seen this movie before in the form of ""A New Hope"". And just like them as well, I was gravely disappointed...at first. I had to watch this movie twice, and even plan on going back to watch it a third time, to fully understand what is going on."
3026,7,Episode IV: The Force Awakens,"I would give it a 7.9 or a 7.8 if possible. The film was good an enjoyable. However, if you take personal opinion and nostalgia out of it, certain aspects of the film are paced a little too fast to get all the character development in and to simply move along the story. It must be said how a lot of the ideas story-wise are slightly unoriginal. That being said, the fast pace works well at times and the characters are developed enough to care about and become interested in. Overall, this film makes a vast improvement to the prequels (which I do like) and opens up the universe to a new generation. It also lets the next 2 films focus more on character development and some different story ideas, although they might go for one similar to Empire Strikes Back...."
3027,8,Good,"Would you be miffed If I told you the main plot story was that some cute droid has a secret plan given to it by the rebellion forces and runs off with the dark side and storm troopers in pursuit then the rebellion learn there is a great sphere space station that is intent on destroying planets and they must infiltrate the base via emerging Jedi , Han and Chewy who work a plan to lower the shields so the X wings can blow up the weak spot and destroy it ? I know I would be."
3028,7,Cliché after cliché . New ideas needed.,"I was very excited for this film. And I almost cried when the the text read:"" A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far Far Away..."" The new characters were awesome and pretty awesome in my opinion. And the new villain...Very cool and pretty handsome.I liked how the stormtrooper FN- 2187 turned from the First Order to the Resistance.(Sort of).The explosion and fighting details with the lightsabers were defiantly different but very detailed in which I loved. I also loved how all of the original characters returned. The only thing I hated about the movie? Was when they killed Han Solo off. I cried during that scene. Just seeing an original and love-able character being killed off is really tear wrecking. But at the end of the film when Rey and Luke finally meet, had me get goosebumps all over my body. It was very chilling and exciting. Although we have to wait almost two years for Episode V|||. I can handle the wait. My favorite scene out of the whole entire movie? When Rey and Finn fought Kylo Ren and when at the end of the movie,after Finn got injured badly,Rey gave Finn a goodbye kiss on the forehead. I legit screamed:""Awwwhh.."" throughout the entire movie theater. And.And when I was in the theater, every time an original character or if Rey or Finn or Poe did something totally awesome,the audience would clap and I would clap along lmao. An absolute amazing movie! 10/10."
3029,10,Amazing Movie!,"First I'll point out that if you're trying to return to the universe in the original Star Wars, that's a futile wish. That film was a product of many things: 1977, a low budget, the burden to invent a new universe, and a young George Lucas to name a few. This film cannot be what that film was because it is not a product of any of those same things. That's not inherently a good or bad thing, just know that it means this movie is different and the next ones will be, too. I consider this review to be spoiler-free, but everyone seems to have their own definition as to what this means. I will speak broadly about characters and themes, but not specific events. Proceed as you see fit."
3030,7,"A little rough, but some diamonds inside","Like every Star Wars fan, I approached this movie with the thrill of tremendous anticipation. With Disney's investment, and the combination of new and old talent, the possibilities were limitless. I would never have believed that with so much potential, this movie could deliver so little. Yet, it is so unoriginal and un-compelling, that I have no hesitation recommending you to pass on it."
3031,5,Uninspired remake of 1977 Classic,"One of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015, more than lived up to the hype. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a film that has brought the Star Wars cinematic franchise back to life. With the prequels disappointing most fans and movie goers, this film had high expectations to return this iconic franchise, back to its glory days. Director J.J Abrams not only met these expectations, he hit them out of the park. Abrams had a high bar to meet with this film such as, introducing the Star Wars brand to a new generation of fans, expanding the Star Wars cinematic universe, making up for the disappointment of the prequels, engaging the longtime fan base, and of course making an exceptionally good movie. Abrams did not disappoint with any of these objectives. Put on your nostalgia goggles because Abrams brings back some of the most iconic aspects from the original trilogy. Any fan of Star Wars, or anyone who has seen the original trilogy will appreciate what Abrams accomplished in this film. It will be hard not to have a smile on your face when some of the original trilogies most beloved characters return. Characters such as, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, C3PO, R2-D2, and Luke Skywalker, will make fans giddy when they appear back on the big screen. Abrams did not forget about the classic props form the original trilogy either, showing massive crashed star destroyers, imperial walkers, X-wings, and of course the Millennium Falcon. Seeing these classic props will make any fan of Star Wars excited. Abrams makes all of these props more visually stunning then ever before, no Star Wars movie would be complete without these stunning visual effects. With realistic special effects as well, Abrams creates an outstanding galaxy making each set feel real. With these outstanding visual and special effects Abrams makes the galaxy that is far far away feel like it is right next door. Following in the original trilogies footsteps the acting was exceptional. Harrison Ford returns and delivers once again as the heroic Han Solo. Ford is as compelling and charming as ever. He dives deeper into his infamous character, which allows viewers to see a new side of one of their most beloved heroes. Ford connects with his audience more than he ever has before, and his role makes a major impact on not just the plot of the film, but the other characters as well. Daisy Ridley debuts in her role as the main character Rey. She is a fresh new face, that Star Wars fans will enjoy. Ridley plays a desert orphan waiting on the desolate planet of Jakku for her parents to return to her. As the film progresses and Rey starts to grow as a character the film becomes more and more compelling. The main villain Kylo Ren is played marvelously by Adam Driver. Never has Star Wars seen a villain with so many layers. A former Jedi in training, Ren turned to the dark side. However, Ren still feels the pull to the light, which is a quality that a villain in the Star Wars saga has never had before. Each of these actors bring a personal aspect to their characters in ways where the audience can connect with them, and allows this film to stand out from the rest of the films in the Star Wars saga. Fans and movie goers will be pleased with the job Abrams did with this film. ""Star Wars; The Force Awakens"" is much more than a sequel. It is a riveting film filled with great acting, classic props, and stunning visual and special effects. This is not only a great addition the Star Wars saga, but it is also an outstanding stand-alone film that rivals the franchises original trilogy."
3032,9,Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review,this is the first movie i have ever gone to see back to back and i must say it lived up to the hype.
3033,10,Lived up to the hype,"If you're in any way in love with the original trilogy and like me grew up on it, then I urge you to go see this movie!"
3034,9,Great movie with a real Star Wars feel,"Even though most people say it was not very good, it was good."
3035,8,Great but was underrated,"If you've read other reviews you might think this is a total disaster deserving a 1 or 2 rating. That's TOTALLY ridiculous off cource. As other reviewers noticed this episode is very close to a remake and feels like a crowd pleasing effort. Haven't we seen this story before, what is actually new here? From this feeling the trouble arose as the movies most important and difficult challenge in my thought prior to seeing this episode was how to replace the villains from earlier episodes. This is were the movie fails the most, even in the movie itself one villain feels inferior to Darth Vader. He just dressed up to look similar to him and added a voice-mask, come on... The other major weakness is with the force. Here you can figure out and develop force powers and fencing skills on your own. A half trained Jedi is almost defeated by a storm trooper and inferior to a totally untrained Jedi. Feels like the character development was rushed. And last of my complaints, Why so ridiculously little Luke Skywalker? not even one word of dialog. There are other minor things I didn't approve of but no big deal. Effects was good but looked and felt same as old episodes, were they leftovers? Liked the more serious light saber duels. Loved the music. I wish next movie takes more risks, focus more on character development and gives us something new instead of this old-new-remake approach. Best of luck with the villains, they are gonna need it."
3036,7,NOT bad just too familiar,"Spoiler ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Han solo dies and Finn almost dies. kyle REM is Han solo son and kills Han and almost Finn to be like Darth Vader. bb8 is Poe Damon's BB unit and the jacket Finn wears is Poe Damon's to. so happy kyle REM dies. Rey found BB 8.Rey finds Luke sky walkers light saber and has a vision. Rey can use the fore and mind control. kyle REM is like Darth Vader. J J Abrams has made a lot happen in between star wars 6 and before star wars 7 so that is a lot that happened. Leia looks so different i couldn't even tell that was Leia cause she looks so old. i like it a lot my favorite star wars was the 3rd now it it the 7th i think poe and kylo(first order,stormtroopers,Capitan phasma,flame troopers, snowtroopers,sandtroopers),bb8,rey,finn,han solo,Leia."
3037,8,spoiler alert,"The force awakens has few flaws but it does a lots of things right, the actors do a good job of flushing out the characters but there are some wasted actors like mark hamill and Max von Sydow, the soundtrack is really good, John Williams did a really good job, as you may know the force awakens has the same plot as new hope but it does in different way, for example the cantina scene is in both new hope and the force awakens but they have different purposes, in new hope <br /><br />the cantina scene purpose was to introduce han and chew, the force awakens cantina scene purpose was to split up the group, I can go on and explain the purpose of scenes that match new hope, in conclusion the the force awakens is a fun movie, it has its flaws but it has a lot of good stuff in it."
3038,7,a flawed but a good movie,"There was a palpable feeling of excitement in the theaters of America on December 18th, 2015. Fans alike, young and old crammed into their seats, adorned with light sabers and Darth Vader pajamas, waiting for that familiar melody and those bright yellow letters to engulf the screen again. Taken over by the Disney franchise, fans were interested to see if the company could uphold the reputation that Star Wars gained after nearly four decades of films. Eager and ready to be acquainted with beloved characters, new friends and a new adventure, the crowd was silent as the story commenced and our journey into space began once more. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the story of the restructure of a new Empire called the New Order, led by a merciless and lethal Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). In attempt to complete the work of deceased Darth Vader, Kylo Ren has planned to destroy entire solar systems at once with a newly designed laser. Only one thing stands in his way and it lies within a droid that has disappeared onto the dessert planet of Jakku after a battle. Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger living on Jakku discovers and befriends the lost droid and learns of the vital information that it holds and its' mission to deliver the information to the Resistance. Both are sent running from storm troopers who have been on the search for the droid and are whisked onto an adventure with a rogue storm trooper known as Finn (John Boyega) in order to help the droid to complete his mission. The characters are thrown into battle between the New Order and the Resistance, as well as battling who they think they are and whom they truly are inside. American philosopher William James once stated, ""A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"". In the film industry, the same can be said; a finished movie is only as strong as its weakest actor, or perhaps its weakest director. J.J. Abrams, director of blockbusters such as Star Trek, Super 8, and Mission Impossible, has seemingly hit another ball out of the park with his latest work, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Abrams took on the trying task of attempting to follow in the footsteps of the original director and master Jedi, George Lucas, to create the familiar ""galaxy far far away"" that the world has loved since A New Hope in 1977. From the record-breaking income of two hundred and forty-eight million dollars during opening weekend in December of 2015, his attempt would appear to be a success. Being familiar with the concept of science fiction in film from his previous work with Stark Trek (2009) and Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) could have aided Abrams in the creation process, but might as well have been his Achilles Heal. From film to film, though action packed and full of adventure, there was a lack of creativity and imagination, which transferred over into his directing of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Though the films surface amazed and entertained audiences alike, there was little backbone to its origin. It felt as if Abrams had picked apart the plot lines of the previous films such as A New Hope (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and glued the pieces together as a hodgepodge mess, filled with similarities in story, predictable outcomes, and generally a lack of any original material. This inability to provide the film with new substance left the finished product feeling more or less copied, but with subtle differences here and there, proving J.J. Abrams to be the weakest link in the creation of this blockbuster film. Breaking a record isn't an easy thing to accomplish but Star Wars: The Force Awakens made it look like a walk in the park. In one weekend, it broke the box office record at two hundred and forty-eight million dollars of revenue. Perhaps its success was due to the restoration of a classic film brought back to life in a new light, or its interesting new characters and plot line. Whatever the reason may be Star Wars: The Force Awakens took the world by storm. On social media there have been stickers created from the movie to post in messages on Facebook, as well as popular Gifs of scenes from the movies. In addition, countless artwork inspired by the movie and the actors has been filling Instagram. Being bought by Disney made the merchandise practically explode in stores globally. From action figures, to clothing, to the recently released preview of Star Wars: The Force Awakens LEGO video game, there has been a positive cultural ripple affecting everyone from this film. In addition to the popularity among merchandise, the movie was even referenced in the long time standing comedy show Saturday Night Live. A skit was performed where Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) mashed together the concept of a popular television show called Undercover Bosses with his role as Kylo, spoofing on if Kylo Ren were to pretend to be an employee in the New Order. This film was not only a record breaker for the top grossing income film but the most popularly distributed and influencing film on a wide scale in years. So as the film concluded, tears were shed and laughs were shared. I personally found it enjoyable but in my gut I knew it was missing that something special that made the other films so exhilarating. I would recommend this film to Star Wars fans as well as those who have yet to be enchanted by the galaxy far far away. I can say though that even with its holes that Star Wars: The Force Awakens truly awoke the force in all of us once again."
3039,8,An Awakening,"This new Star Wars movie is good but it is basically a remake of Star Wars:A New Hope. The main plot of the movie seems to lack impact on viewers. Certain events that should have had more impact just felt mediocre. In addition to that, I felt like many of the characters could have been developed more. The actions the main characters took were expected because the characters seemed very flat. The main antagonist is a wimp. Meanwhile, protagonist also seems tot perfect.The content of the movie is not as good as the older Star Wars movies. The technical quality of this movie is definitely better than the older Star Wars movies. All in all, this movie just lacked a good plot that would leave audience in aw."
3040,7,"New Movie, Old Plot",Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers
3041,3,This movie is the fast food burger to the American obesity problem...,"A majority of the bad reviews will essentially be framed within the argument that this was a verbatim reboot of the ""New Hope"" plot. While I will admit there are similarities, it's also worth mentioning that ""The Force Awakens"" ends with major portions of the plot yet to be fully realized. This is a good thing."
3042,9,Listen to someone who was there in 1977...,I thought Kylo Ren was supposed to be Han and Leia's son....No family resemblance at all.
3043,10,Where is the family resemblance with Kylo Ren ?,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is the film that J.J. Abrams was put on Earth to make, as evidenced by the ""Star Wars"" echoes in his hit series ""Lost,"" and the way he kept trying to turn ""Star Trek"" into ""Star Wars."" These tendencies could seem cutesy or irritating elsewhere, but they make sense in an according-to-Hoyle ""Star Wars"" movie. This new one, set 30 years after the events of ""Return of the Jedi,"" is funny, touching, and surprisingly light- footed. It boasts a lot of familiar elements, including Skywalker family mythology and another Death Star-type weapon, as well as self-aware lines about how things work in this series. www.cadoutze.ro The film ultimately runs up against the limitations of its own nature: like the James Bond films, the ""Star Wars"" movies are pretty much obligated to revisit certain elements, to the point where they might feel played out even if they hadn't been raided by other films, TV shows and books (including Harry Potter). But it's still an exhilarating ride, filled with archetypal characters with plausible psychologies, melodramatic confrontations fueled by soaring emotions, and performances that can be described as good, period, rather than ""good, for 'Star Wars.'"""
3044,9,My opinion on Star Wars,"As an admirer of the originals but not an all out fangirl, I wasn't sure if I would enjoy The Force Awakens. I had nothing to worry about, this film was a thrilling adventure with new characters that you connected with as well as seeing old friends. The first 45 minutes to an hour in particular were just riveting. "
3045,9,"Brilliant, thrilling new ride","After a wait that, regarding the timespan from the early eighties onwards, seemed both a like lifetime and the shortest wait ever for a Star Wars movie, I took off early and snuck into the first afternoon showing on the day it opened here in Holland. No doubt a lot of newbies and loyal fans will like it. Warts and all, that is, 'cause it certainly does have its share of problems."
3046,6,"Abrams More At Home Here Than With Star Trek, Still Little More Than Fan Fic","I have now seen The Force Awakens a couple of times, so i will try my best to give you an honest review of the movie. (No spoilers of course)"
3047,9,Star Wars is back,I've read many hateful reviews and am writing this mostly in response.
3048,7,Concerning Trolls,"Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens. I expected this movie to be phenomenal for so many reasons. The first reason is that J.J. Abrams directed the film and wrote the screenplay. Secondly, he introduced a new, complex, and beautiful story line. Third, many new characters were introduced in Episode VII. And finally, fourth, the special effects promised to be groundbreaking. J.J Abrams has directed many inspiring and creative movies and TV series like Star Trek Next Generation, Lost (television series), and Fringe (television series). His perspective is fresh and unique while still honoring the heart of the Star Wars franchise. When I actually saw the movie,I had some criticisms, but overall, I really enjoyed it. "
3049,8,A Fresh Look At A Old Franchise,"This was a fantastic first installment in the sequel to the original trilogy and it really felt like star wars. There were terrifying moments, heart wrenching times, and action galore. However, there were a couple of little things every once in awhile that felt strange, (i.e., when they would hold a shot for too long, or there was a piece of dialogue that felt too cheesy or cliché for star wars) Other than that, it was fantastic. It opened up a lot of questions and it seems like they left it very open for the other two movies and I hope Episode VIII improves on what Episode VII did, like Episode V did with Episode IV. I Can't wait for the sequel!"
3050,6,"I loved it, but there were a couple of things that felt ""forced""",I wanted to keep this short as very few people will read it. However to understand my POV you need some background to give it context;
3051,5,The Emperor has New Clothes....(or 'May The Forbes Be With You').,"Given the pathos that this specific title holds within, over 30 years of global fan community, a zillion books and comic adaptations, countless fan arts, documentaries, merchandise and an actual religion called Jediism, only one thing is for sure: you won't satisfy them all. Regardless of the movie made, the number of people who will be completely disappointed and even heartbroken won't change at all. Under no circumstances will there be a movie version of Star Wars Episode VII, which could possibly meets the expectation of the extremist viewers, who declares themselves the omniscient of the Star Wars franchise. And even regular movie goers might find themselves very disappointed in the midst of an adjusted schema called Star Wars formula. Finally there is a third criterion which could leave you bitterly gutted after watching this gig. It is called losing your ability to embark. Let's face it, we don't watch these movies like we use to anymore. The 12 year old version of us is long gone. By this time we already experienced a bunch of baloney within theaters. But the good news is: this movie is actually great. And that is all I want to say about this movie. Just let it in ;)."
3052,8,Three ways to feel disappointed...,"Great expectations for this movie that were not met. Better in plot than the prequels (Episodes I-III) but still lacking a lot to compete the very first movies (Episodes IV-VI). The visuals are very fascinating, but the script could be better. It is a good movie to watch, but honestly I do not believe I would watch it for a second time in the future (unlike Episodes IV,V and VI). Much of its rating for me is owed to the fact that is a part of the STAR WARS, yet as a stand alone film is not so memorable. Concerning the cast, it was good to see the old cast back on screen along with Daisy Ridley, whose acting, in my opinion, is very promising, unlike the rest of the new characters."
3053,8,Progress compared to the prequels(I-III) but still not so good,This movie is extremely solid and safe from a producer's perspective. 
3054,9,A really solid performance from every aspect,"This movie was fantastic! Awesome scenery, great actors, and overall a great plot. The action was mind blowing. Although the ending was not quite up to my expectations...I would greatly consider this movie. It was really hard to notice any real flaws in the movie. The acting was spot on and everything was fluid. I also believe the cast did a beautiful job and the characters fit their roles and personalities well. I would also recommend watching the movie in 3D. This star wars movie was by far one of the greatest 3d experiences that I have ever had. Thankfully the trailers that were posted did not spoil any of the movie or ruin the whole plot line. Unlike most trailers, star wars gave the attention and the fan base that will always live up till this day."
3055,8,Great 10/10,"I came into Star Wars 7 with hesitant excitement, hyped over the prospect of a new Star Wars movie and cool looking footage which seemed to have a more serious vibe, and dubious over the villain. After seeing the movie, I feel both satisfied and disappointed, but looking forward to the next stage of this new trilogy."
3056,7,"Best Star Wars Movie, Not the Best Movie","i will admit the plot is strikingly similar to ep. iv, then again so was the plot of return of the jedi. beyond that it is superior in writing, acting, effects(obviously), character development, and overall polish. the setting and music are nearly identical to the first three. and it absolutely blows the prequels away. far, far away!"
3057,8,better than the original... almost,"Like a lot of people, I was very skeptical about ""The Force Awakens"" as soon as it was announced. However, my skepticism was thoroughly abolished after I went and saw this movie with my family on Christmas Day."
3058,7,I Was Pleasantly Surprised!,"This is not a detailed review. While I liked the movie enough to give it an 8, it felt as if Lawrence Kasdan made a checklist of everything that worked in the original trilogy and made certain to include them. Character on a desert planet desiring something more than the same old, same old--check. Cute robot carrying vital information--check. Amoral, charming character seeing the light and doing the right thing in the end--divided into two characters--one charming, the other finally deciding to go for the light--check."
3059,8,Paint by numbers,"The Second Best Star wars movie for me and the only movie from 2015 that scored more than 8 that is 9 . Just Stunning Package of blast from Beginning to End. Before Finishing the movie I was expecting One of 2 theories about the Sith lord to make it to screen . One was that Darth Plagueis is revived or either ways it was Luke Skywalker Himself . None of both made on the board . Everything in the movie was beyond anything acc to my theorize but I still think there might be a possibility that Snoke is Darth Plagueis . All I would say I could not miss this miss movie , I just wanted to see A light Saber In 3D . The new Characters are just lovely especially BB8 but Lost a certain . In Short If loved OG trio , then definitely don't miss it ."
3060,7,The movie has revived the universe back,"As others have said, this is an awkward attempt to remake episode 4, but a poorly done one, at that. There were many times I laughed at the ridiculousness transpiring on screen."
3061,1,"Spectacularly, comically bad","From the moment the opening credits filled the screen, childhood nostalgia was renewed and the magic of cinema was gleaming. There was a sense of hesitation to not get hopes high, due to the disappointments that were the prequels (excluding Episode III which in general, despite inevitable flaws, was a good movie). And by the time the end credits rolled, that hesitation was gone. On the whole The Force Awakens was a strong beginning to continuation to a much loved franchise. However it was not without its faults, it was in some instances too closely linked to the plot of the original Star Wars and is almost bordering on too nostalgic and not a work of its own. It was not so much a masterpiece, but it did lay the foundations for what appears to be a promising revival of the franchises and beginning of a great trilogy. The hype of this movie was very much due to the return of the original cast, whereas the standout performances of the movie had to be the new cast (Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver) who gave fresh, humerus and believable performances. Arguably the best villain of the franchise is seen in Kylo Ren who adds a deeper layer to the villain frontier, Adam Driver shines and undertakes the role perfectly. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega share a special dynamic on screen and bond beautifully and lead the audience through the exhilarating journey which spans the whole galaxy. A galaxy which J.J Abrahams has managed to beautifully relive with the return to favouring of practical effects and a darker tone and learns from the mistakes made previously and takes the best parts of the franchise to make the movie fans have been waiting for since Return of the Jedi. Chewie We're Home."
3062,7,Foundations (Star Wars - The Force Awakens),"May contain spoilers Firstly, I thought it will be much-much worse Over 30+ years Star Wars filled its universe with enormous lore: books, games, comics, fan movies. And not all of them were just fanart, lots of stories were taken from not released official scripts too. Great stories, characters, plots ..and now Disney tells – ""f#%k you, this is no more Star Wars lore! Only we got true story"". I don't think what this is a wise decision... Now about the movie, cast and main characters: 1) Kylo Ren - why, god, why? When he took off the mask he looks worse, than Hayden Christensen did. He looks like Severus Snape's son. Strong and confident in mask, he became weak and stupid without it .Wow, how the hell trained Sith lord (or even if he is just an apprentice) got beaten by two people has not hold a lightsaber before? Why he not ripped them with force?? 2) Finn – okaay so now all billions of stormtroopers are gone (it is interesting – where they gone?  ), new troops got new outfit (small rebranding is very important in the time of war) and now are just people who were taken as children, to become killing machines. And in his first battle FN-2187 (Finn) suddenly somehow understand, that killing is bad and First Order is bad, blahblahblah. During all film he jumps from being frightened guy who want's to run far away, and reckless war machine 3) Rey – a girl from ""Tatooine-like garbage planet"", who suddenly understands how to use a force by herself.. She is kind and brave, but when it comes to Jedy thing the way how she manages everything by herself and it looks kinda far-fetched (yes, she might be Luke's daughted (???), but still)."
3063,6,I thought it will be much-much worse,"As a fan of the original trilogy, I was looking forward to this new Star Wars mooted as a nod to the original trilogy. George Lucas arguably lost his way with the prequels, and perhaps J.J. Abrams could find it again?"
3064,6,A New Hope steeped in political correctness,It was horrible. Just horrible.
3065,1,The biggest disappointment of the last 10 years,"I get what JJ tried here, play it safe, don't reveal too much about the events of the last 30 years and have lots of tributes to the original Star Wars. This is not a bad approach, but it doesn't live up to expectation."
3066,7,"Its a great movie, but not a great Star Wars movie. JJ failed to tell a story!","I liked the story, as I love the original Star Wars movies. However, it did feel like a repeat of all the other movies combined. That was disappointing. It is basically a repeat of the 4th-6th Star Wars: Droid has info that needs to get somewhere, Luke was betrayed by a Jedi that went to the dark side, they have to destroy another death star, etc. Having said that, I do have to say that the set was pretty good and the planets were realistic. It is better quality than the original movies, which can generate mixed feelings. Personally, I like that the quality has improved. I did notice that the costumes for the aliens were a bit more realistic, but not that much."
3067,6,Okay,"First of all the greatest strength of this movie is the action, brilliant battles between x-wings and tie fighters stand out as you don't even want to blink as to miss a second would be a shame. The storm troopers have been revamped not so much visually but more character has been injected, they don't run around aimlessly and they can actually shoot,some even have some dialogue which is nice compared to the originals,it gives a feeling that there are people under the suits and not brainless clones."
3068,7,"Strong in the force, but not that strong.",Where to begin ? 
3069,1,Very disappointing movie for kids,"Generally, I'd say the enjoyment surpasses the criticism I would make."
3070,7,A satisfactory viewing,Where to start? This movie is almost too much to digest. Hence why all the critical reviews in my belief. I will start that if you are a Star Wars religious fanatic that clings to every single drop of cannon it's obvious you're not gonna enjoy this movie. I have read reviews that are nothing more than people picking holes in the plot and characters for the entire 2+ hours of this film. They couldn't even enjoy it because they were too busy comparing it with some kind of Star Wars Bible concordance. Take a breath and please relax. My only major critique and recommendation for J.J. (If you are reading this) is slow down a little. You don't have to rush this story. In doing so you will make Star Wars nothing more than a action movie with awesome special effects and not the saga that Lucas intended it to be.
3071,7,Love it or hate it depends on what you expect,"Positives (+) 1.) The effects, costumes, and scenery were fantastic. I felt as if I was actually in the movie and experienced every crazy moment with Rey and Finn. 2.) Finn, Rey, and the other non-first order characters were so convincing and had me rooting for them throughout the entire film. 3.) The film somewhat copies A New Hope and has created a large number of angry fans because of it. I have no problem with the similarities between the two films because they help us to forget about the terrible prequels and remind us of how great the first three films were. 4.) The storm troopers were very brutal. They burned down villages and executed innocent civilians in the beginning of the movie. This made them a lot more intimidating than the storm troopers in the original trilogy."
3072,7,First Order is not a threat,"Boring play, boring story, apathetic Harrison Ford."
3073,1,"Boring play, boring story, apathetic Harrison Ford","Being an avid Star Wars fanatic for most of my life I was incredibly excited when I heard Disney had purchased Lucasfilm and were going to make more Star Wars films. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a solid attempt to reignite the franchise by bringing characters new and old together in an effort to fight evil and restore order to the galaxy, by doing so in a way that strongly echoes stories already told in the original Star Wars films."
3074,7,Star Wars for a New Generation,This is the sequel trilogy of the worldwide phenomenon known as Stars Wars
3075,7,Not excellent Just Good,"First of all some spoilers if you keep on reading: i love JJ Abraham's and i Love Starwars but watching the movie did not fulfill my anticipation. What i think is bad: First of all just compare it to a new hope, i was thinking we where going further with the movie about 30 years in time not to have a remake of a new hope? Ren was totally miscast in his role and feels like a bad dark side version of Anakin skywalker ( and he was also bad in his role, i did not feel any darkness nor any anger more like i am going to be predictable and say my lines) Most scenes don't feel new , except a few but it more feels like we have seen this before. More and longer action would have been nice, now it is fast action scenes, that more feel like you watched a music clip. JJ Abraham's is trying to put more star trek then starwars into it. No training to use the force? No knowing why Ren went to the dark Side? and more of those things.... seems he wanted to make a new hope remake with some new elements but lacked the time... SPOILER ............. why kill Han Solo?... you killed a myth there.. too much jumping from one thing to another, nothing feels finished more rushed. Good Things Good female leading role. Good new little droid who is fun Chewbacca is still awesome. Cool to have a black X fighter with an ace pilot. The fight on the planet with the Tie fighter vs X fighters was really good. Effects are nicely done. New order looks cool. Improvements for the next one: More dark side in Ren ... more bad ass Training from Luke and some more jedi's. New area's-planets-and fresh unique scene's that would fit a star wars galaxy not to have the feeling ow yeah seen this before... Big ground fights that last longer then 2 minutes Bigger and larger space fights that also last longer. Hopefully some more time for some cool new characters on both sides."
3076,7,"Too fast , Too little , Trek Wars ? Feeling lost","Wow... I just watched it. I just changed my rating from 3 to 1 star in my attempt to try and lower that ridiculous high score that film has acquired from OBVIOUS human bots. There is no way this film can appeal to Star Wars fans. It doesn't and it is obvious from all the comments here. It felt like a Chinese replica of Episode IV. No Star Wars spirit in it, plenty of holes in the (unoriginal) plot and likable but unbelievable main characters. What's that with the girl kicking the baddie's experienced highly trained butt while she had JUST discovered she has the force herself?! The part that she was teaching Hans Solo how to fly his own ship was just embarrassing. I rarely leave reviews on films I watch but that one was such a huge disappointment I felt I had to. For me the Star Wars films are 6, and will remain 6."
3077,1,What a travesty,"Yes this was a decent and promising offering to the Star Wars series. Unfortunately the hype of the original trilogy will be hard to live up to. But this is definitely worth the watch and if people reviewed it a bit more objectively (i.e. not constantly comparing it to the originals), it would be a 7 or higher."
3078,7,"Moments of greatness, inspired yet predictable","I really wanted to like this movie, and it was honestly visually pleasing, but the story was just a remake of episode 4! I was very disappointed to see the same story with just a few very tiny twists to it. This movie essentially has a death star that the rebels need to blow up. The actors themselves did a great job in the own parts, but the story just ruined it for me. Also, Captain Phasma did nothing in the movie! If you watched the trailer, you have seen all of the exciting scenes with her! There were a lot of fight scenes in this movie, which are pretty entertaining. The only exception to this was the final fight scene. Rey had learned she has the power of the force for maybe 20 minutes and she has already figured out she can control peoples minds and grab lightsabers with the force. I feel that Kylo could have done a lot more in this movie make him at least seem more bad a**. I will still watch the next star wars to come out, but I don't understand how it is getting phenomenal reviews when the story was such a ripoff, I guess the visual component and all of the nostalgia is getting the high reviews. I wanted a star wars story that was new, somehow unique, but this movie was almost an exact duplicate of the original trilogy, but there are different names."
3079,7,"I thought this was episode 7, not episode 4",First of all let me say that the reviews of 1 to 3 are people being way too critical; there is no point in all these little nit picks making your opinion so bad without even mentioning the good parts of the film. As always with reviews there will be slight spoilers but I'll try to keep them few and far in between.
3080,7,Great film despite the little flaws,"People asked, ""how was the movie?"" Well, my wife slept through some of it,and I stepped out to use my cell phone."" It was incredibly boring and mediocre: episodes 1-6 were much better than this. Episode 3 blew episode 7 away. It's as though Disney put forth the least amount production effort in the movie after acquiring the franchise and is counting on the cult status of the franchise to drive ticket sales; unfortunately it appears to be working."
3081,2,"If you are a Star Wars fan, you will be very Disappointed","I really enjoyed watching this movie in the front row in 3D, it gave life to a film that has been enjoyed with a dimension missing. I feel that they tried to put too many Star Wars references and stylistic feels into one movie. Hats off to the colorists, dp, and whoever else worked on choosing of lenses, cameras, and tweaks in post to keep the color of the Star Wars films we know. There is one hangar/hanger scene in which the angle of the camera was low and looking up however in the original trilogies the camera was eye level in the hangar/hanger scene. A very minute detail, other than that, some people were saying that the hyperspeed state was different, I didn't notice much a difference however I probably should watch it one more time to catch more details than I had before."
3082,6,"Overall Look, Great; Technical Details, Eh.","The story continues with episode Ⅶ. A beautiful looking,edge of your seat,popcorn movie filled with great sound and visual effects."
3083,7,The beginning of a new ride.,"I usually just ignore IMDb reviews because usually they're terrible, but I have to say the reviews for The Force Awakens in particular seem to have been written by a bunch of mindless idiots that couldn't even be bothered to offer an original thought about what they liked or didn't like about it and just came in here to post some hyperbole nonsense about why you shouldn't waste your time with this film because it didn't live up to their expectations after reading several hundred books."
3084,7,Better than we had any right to hope for.,"I just thought this movie was so boring and would never watch again. Like 2 hours of pure and utter boredom. Don't waste your money in going to see this movie. The only positive thing in that movie was the little robot ball that rolled around the place making noises. Like how could someone find the inner strength to kill their own father is beyond me and travel to find Luke Skywalker and he doesn't even talk in the movie like come on! A dead rip off of the original movie, Episode 4. From the crappy looking infinity CG roll opening sequence, bar scene and light sabre fights to a janitor identifying a weakness in the battle star, this movie is chock full of inside jokes and tired ideas. The only redeeming grace for this movie is a solid performance by Harrison Ford as Han Solo and a compelling performance by Daisy Ridley as Rey who represents the resurrection of the Jedi. Fun to watch and full of action, but there are numerous dead spots and far too much nod to the Star Wars wonks of yesteryear."
3085,1,Terrible movie,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS* As any star wars fan, or anyone in general, I was pretty hype for this movie. Once I saw it, I was severely disappointed. If you saw the original, then you saw this. The bad guy (Kylo Ren) was basically a pretentious teenager with severe family problems. The emperor is Snope, which doesn't even sound relatively menacing at all. As for the ""romance"" between Finn and Ray, it's basically this... He gets friend zoned and makes any attempt he can to try to get her to like him. Of course, this leading to the final fight, which made Kylo Ren look worse. He could barely beat someone who had almost 0 training with a light saber. "
3086,6,"It's a remake, but a fun remake","Lucas' prequels set the bar so low that a documentary on mating habits of African swallows would have seemed good by comparison, but that does not diminish the fact that Abrams has essentially accomplished the first part of his mission. Considering his awful reboot of Star Trek, this is more than a slightly skeptical viewer might have anticipated."
3087,7,Better than expected resurrection of the SW universe,This is a Great movie and it will be the same for Ep: VIII (hopefully)
3088,,"Great, but not Fantastic","First of all, as a huge Star Wars fan, I find that seeing a Star Wars movie on IMAX 3D with the latest CGI technology was astonishing. That movie was very beautiful. It successfully captured the essence of a Star Wars movie and I am not just talking about space and Jedi battles. I am talking about the mythical aspect of it like the good versus evil, light and dark, hope and despair contradictions. I am also talking about the constant change between order and stability for chaos and destruction."
3089,7,Good old Star Wars action but déjà vu,"I love the star wars films especially the originals. I was expecting a lot from this one as it was at last the ""newest"" episode. I wanted to be amazed and reinspired. I liked the idea of a defecting stormtrooper and I like the new Jedi girl. However the film was spoilt by too many repeating themes...a new and bigger death star? Really? A son/father, one dark side, one good? An old, wrinkly looking alien (like Yoda) who seems to know everything? The Empire basically renamed as The First order. The leader- masked, cloaked and in black (just without the heavy breathing)? Han solo back to being a smuggler for no apparent reason? It felt as though the writers felt they had to do almost a remake of the very first film just to get younger viewers up to speed. There was also no explanation for so many things e.g. why were they all looking for Luke? Why had no-one done anything about the new death star before it became functional? Why do they seem to have gone backwards in 30 years? Why has Han's and Leia's son gone to the dark side and why aren't they together? It was spoilt even more when Kylo Ren took his mask off..he just looked like some haughty student. He just was not scary any more. This disappointed me almost as much as when darth vader was unmasked in return of the jedi (never got over how ugly Anakin was!) Spoiler: and when Kylo Ren killed his father it just seemed so unnecessary and meaningless. Did the writers just think oh yeah we will make it like the opposite of when Luke fights his father. As we had no back-story for it, it just felt like a cheap trick. I have still given the film 5 because despite all this i enjoyed quite a lot of it. Liked the effects, liked the humour and I did like seeing all the old characters again. My kids were thoroughly entertained. Just a pity it did not live up to all it could and should have been."
3090,5,More like a rehash than a revival of this series,So much of disappointment. Where do I even begin?
3091,5,This force did not awaken me,"I did not enjoy this movie much. The locations were great, the visual effects were not bad, but that was pretty much it. The acting was abysmal and the storyline was non existent. Despite the title, the dark theme from the first 3 movies is not present here. The 3D was not great. It had the same cardboard cutout feel for all of the characters so it was not realistic at all (as expected since it was upgraded from 2D to 3D). The two leading characters did have some chemistry together, but it was still plagued with terrible dialogs and also the cheesy jokes even in the most intense action scenes. There is never any sense of suspense or danger in the movie especially when you see a girl about 5 foot nothing that weighs 100 lbs taking out 10 guys who are twice her size in matter of seconds."
3092,1,Was bored out of my mind with all of the cheesy jokes,"The hype, the anticipation, the wait.............. were for this?!!! I mean where do I start? I am struggling to find at least one good thing about this movie but I honestly can't. What a BIG disappointment."
3093,1,OMG & I thought Gravity was over rated,I am writing this review as I recently saw Star Wars episode VII in cinemas.
3094,5,BB8 was the only good thing about this movie. Warning spoilers.,What you find in this movie:
3095,1,Disappointing,I really wanted to love this movie...
3096,5,The Return of... the same old stuff,"Star Wars franchise hit the bottom with the Force Awakens 7th episode. I was so let down I really couldn't believe what I just saw, and let me tell you why."
3097,4,The disappointment of the year,"I guess its interesting that Hans solo had a baby that was the leader played by Adam driver...and his mom was princess Leigha? I was trippin. I was annoyed. I was like in one of the awesomest theatres I've ever been to.... the Arlington theatre in Santa Barbara. It was funny cuz they were having all these specials on the menu regarding characters names like jj abrams nachos and Hans solo popcorn.... and the movie happens...I took my first cigarrete break like...when the woman almost was tempted to give away the 88 baby model of r2 d2 for food rations, because she was getting jipped selling mechanical parts . but it blows the most because I don't know what happened...I left. I knew that there was some big headed alien giving direction to Adam drivers character, and that Finn was liberated from his storm trooper existence thus joining the resistance...which is what everyone is called who doesn't exist within the dark lords control....I guess"
3098,4,just waiting for yall to find Luke?,"I can't understand how this movie has a 8+ rating on IMDb. The whole movie was just a rip off, there was nothing new , nothing interesting, just a reboot of something that didn't need a reboot at all. When did I lose my connection to the force? So many people think this movie was awesome and I can't feel this at all. Is my generation that hive minded that Disney was able to manipulate their weak minds with weeks of pre-hype and advertisement? I never joined the ""the prequels aren't good"" circle-jerk bandwagon, though I never thought they were as good as the originals - their ratings on IMDb are actually fair. But I liked every single prequel movie better than The Force Awakening."
3099,1,Makes me question my ability to judge,"To preface this review I will say while I am a Star Wars fan I am not a huge Star Wars fan. That is to say I have no real emotional attachment to the franchise although I've rewatched the movies quite a bit. I get more emotional about the sullying of Marvel super heroes and Batman than any other film. I'd lose my sh** if James Bond were made black, but could care less what diversity is put into Star Wars. I'm just not that much of a purist."
3100,5,"A remake of the original trilogy, without the charm of the original.","On one level, I was pretty skeptical of the idea of a new Star Wars movie. The unfortunate Hollywood trend of rebooting and rehashing old franchises with sequels, prequels, and requels with only occasional success (Mad Max) has made me wary."
3101,2,Not the chosen one,"There were good Star Wars... there were bad Star Wars... Some of them had deep story, characters, created the franchise and good memories, some of them left a bitter aftertaste of characters, but at least had droids, CGI, action... some semblance of a plot."
3102,1,It can't get any worse... or can it?,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did, but I just couldn't. It was lifeless in general, with a beyond weak main bad guy, and a heroine who was magical in her abilities far beyond anyone in the previous movies except the Emperor himself. The special effects were OK, but damn, the lens flares need to be stopped. JJ ruined the hyperspace effect just like he ruined warp drive in ST. I hope that like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the next one is a lot better. Since JJ won't be directing, there is some hope. I doubt I will see it in the theater, I will probably borrow a friend's copy like I did with ""E7-TFA"". "
3103,5,Abrams needs to be prevented from ruining any more movie franchises!,I renounce Disney and Star Wars.
3104,5,Star Wars: The Disillusionment of a Fan Base,"This is awful, I could not believe my eyes, I left the cinema sad, frustrated and disappointed. Such a bad plot (in fact a copy of old episodes), no story, no star wars feeling, where is star wars in this movie? "
3105,1,"A total disaster, I want my money back!",I don't have words. 2 words actually.Copy/Paste. I watched this movie 10 times now and it became increasingly worse with each viewing. 
3106,5,Boy oh boy. J.J Abrams! I will never....ever... forgive you for being what's wrong with Hollywood. Lucas was right.,"The magic of the first three episodes of this series is all but dead. At least episode I-III had some originality. ""The Force Awakens"" is the most derivative and unoriginal of the series. Like another reviewer noted, this isn't a sequel - it's a remake. The three new heroes are just carbon copies or younger versions of Solo, Skywalker and Leia. Kylo Ren is just a better looking Darth Vader. It's nice seeing Ford as Solo again and he provides a spark, but even that wears thin after awhile. Fisher (demoted from princess to general) looks like she can't wait to shoot her scenes and go home. There are virtually no surprises and what plot points that aren't telegraphed you can see coming from a mile away. The effects are OK and there's some decent action, but you're better off just watching ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" again rather than waste money seeing this - unless you happen to be 12 or one of those idiots that likes wearing glasses to see a movie. What a ripoff!"
3107,5,"The ""Empire"" has no clothes.","** Update, I would like to say that I am extremely grateful that I did not spend the money on seeing this movie in a theater. I watched at home on a purchased DVD for about half the cost. And that my friends, is 3 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back. Lawrence Kasden ought to be ashamed of himself for the casting of this movie. Dude, you have done better. "
3108,3,"Star Wars, The Force Awakens - Contains spoilers","Lets be honest, this movie was far less than par. I had great hopes that this movie would be held in high regards, much as the original movies were held. However, it fell short by a long shot and left me more than disappointed. I even managed to rent it a few more times, hoping that the movie would grow on me yet it never did. The acting was horrible, the story line was horrible, the overall thought that was put into this movie was... yup, Horrible. Its like they took ""A New Hope"" and made it worse and just to make the old and new crowds seem at ease with each other, they brought back the old original characters for some poor reason that makes less sense than any. Finally, who ever created the names of ""Star Killer Base"" had no common sense and apparently just wanted to get the movie done. This goes the same for Kylo Ren who had much potential until his unmasking at which point the movie took a huge spiral downwards into its final fiery resting point. If a fan, go watch the movie. Enjoy what you can then move on."
3109,4,The force has left the movie.,"I rate this movie based on fact that it was meant to entertain and hype me for upcoming sequels, it did its job poorly.I saw this movie in IMAX the day before yesterday, my impressions are still fresh, I would like to start with PROs first."
3110,1,The Average at Best Awakens,"Currently this movie is sitting at an 8.4 on IMDb. Even with the ""new movie effect"", that score is pretty ludicrous."
3111,5,Big Fat MEH.,"Force Awakens is kind of movie which makes you miss James Cameron. The visionary director who actually understands the need and desire of the audience. Force Awaken even lacks the philosophy offered by original movie. It's a product which is made with only one intention, 'Feed the hungry fans and cash the cow'. Starting with the story, it was like watching A New Hope's mesh up with Jurassic World. All elements of the Original movie were present. The Trio of young characters, the good turned bad antagonist and his relationship with the protagonist. Even the death star and some old stars were there. There absolutely is no real goal in the movie. We movie from securing the map to preparing the Jedi to destroying the death star. And story itself has holes big enough to swallow a galaxy which is far far away. It seems that in last 30 years only earth have progressed in technology and biological domain, the galaxy which was so advance 40 years ago, now seems be living the same. Like the original series, antagonists are not killed and neither the family of protagonist is revealed. I wonder if they have any idea about DNA and biology. Also it's not clear that how come antagonist know a lot of technology. From a 30 years old spaceship to a newly built death star. She knows the right circuits to pull out. Characters seemed to be very distant throughout the movie. There absolutely was no chemistry between Han Solo and Princess/General Lea. Who unexpectedly is never mentioned to be from Jedi family. Although after recent success of female protagonist oriented film series, they did pass the torch to a girl. Moving to visual effects and cinematography, perhaps the focus really was to add unnecessary and blunt action sequence. Much like prequels directed by George Lucas, colors were blurred and not so bright. There was no need to watch the movie in Imax or 3d, the worst a director can do to a 3d movie. J J Abrams really lacked a vision here. It is just like watching a 2d film. Acting is okie, Although I did not understand some of the wits. Daisy Ridley is great in her role. She wore the role over and is the best thing in movie crossover. Harrison Ford is good and easy in his role. Carrie Fisher is alright. She did not have much to do that explains more than enough make up even at crucial times. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac played split up of Han Solo's character with not much required jokes. One goes with high expectation but returns very disappointed."
3112,2,One goes with high expectation but returns very disappointed.,This movie is totally unoriginal and stole the plot from the original Episode IV. I did think it was fun to watch and I'm glad I saw it. But I don't think it will be memorable. And I think a huge opportunity was missed to move to the next chapter. The plot contained:
3113,4,Unoriginal,This film was a huge disappointment to me. Here's why:
3114,4,A Disappointment on Every Level,"To be exact this movie is around the 6,5-6,9 depending on if you view it as part of a series (then lower rating due to story) or a standalone flick (then a bit higher). "
3115,5,"Nice wrapping, no substance","JJ has done some sterling films, this however is awful, unless you are 8 and watching Star Wars for the first time in which case you will no doubt love it."
3116,1,Holy Sweet 7 pound baby Jesus,... and it isn't asleep either. I think it's dead.
3117,4,The force didn't awaken... (no spoilers),This movie is CLEARLY a REMAKE of Star Wars A New Hope. All they did was substitute a girl for Luke's Role.
3118,1,"It Sucks, a Clear remake and flaming bag of a forced story line","I gave this a one star on Netflix' 5 point scale which translates to 2 stars here. I only give a movie one star if it profoundly insults my intelligence which this movie has accomplished. The story was a rehash of ""A New Hope"" with scenes sequenced together by Disney marketing using data analytics to optimize our ""delight."" Little to no character development and most dialog quite corny, possibly written by interns while the professionals worked on special effects."
3119,1,A desecration,"I was bored with this film, I started playing with my phone and didn't follow most of it."
3120,5,Disappointed,"I never write reviews, but this time I couldn't help it! What a disappointment! I don't even know where to start.... From the title, perhaps? STAR WARS they called it.... You gotta be kidding me!!!! This is no STAR WARS. It's a lame attempt of imitation, and a bad one, too! While I was watching this movie at the theater, all I could think was: the STAR WARS Saga, the real one, is dead. Which is very sad, because they have wasted a great opportunity of doing something really good. I am a great fan of STAR WARS. And I don't mean only the first three films, but even the last three ones, the prequels that so many people didn't like very much. STAR WARS has been the first film I ever saw in a movie theater when I was a child. Since then, that Saga has been my favorite, always. Therefore, I went to watch this movie with the best predisposition in the world. I had high expectations, too. After all this years, I thought, they will come up with something great and memorable. They have had enough time, money, and resources to do so. I have nothing against J.J.Abrams either. I had enjoyed the two Star Treks, alright. Besides, I have been reading lots of novels from the Star Wars Universe for a long time and I quite like most of them. There are tons of ideas and intriguing stories in those novels, even for bad screenwriters with no ideas at all of their own. So, there is no excuse! Instead, they just remade the same old story, again: droids carrying precious information stranded on a desert planet, pursued by storm troopers. A Death Star (again) but this time it is an entire planet, which doesn't make any sense, if you know just a bit of Astrophysics. And then what.... another Empire? After the other one has been destroyed a few years earlier??? Where does this new Emperor come from? And again the space station can be destroyed only by lowering the shields (this time by a team of people who have no plan and no idea on what they are doing) and by flying X-wings through the structure and placing a perfect hit to a specific target...... Same old story, we have seen all this already. But this time it was much, much worse because of bad actors, bad performance, no meaningful dialogue, no development of the characters whatsoever. Who are those guys, anyway??? For people like us, who know something of the Star Wars Universe, they make no sense at all. A girl, who knows nothing of the force, can beat a Sith Apprentice holding a light saber for the first time in her life??? You gotta be kidding me! A Black clone trooper? Weren't they all a perfect replica of the Bounty Hunter Jango Fett??? And weren't they programmed to obey orders without even thinking (order 66, for example)??? Not to mention that he is able to hold his ground against a Sith.... have Abraams even watched the old movies at all??? Please don't misunderstand me. I love black actors when they are up to the task. Mace Windu was great in his role and I liked him. It's the film and the story that are wrong. And what the heck is that silly red light saber???? The best way to cut off your own hands for sure, LOL! All in all, any of us could have done a better job. Even the old stars didn't make much of a difference. It was like they had nothing important to say or to do. There was no explanation or meaningful dialogue or feeling of any kind. Such a waste! If there had not been a Star Wars Saga before, and this movie had been the first of its kind, it would have been a complete failure. Nothing in common with the first Star Wars of Lucas that made history. When I got back home from the theater, I wanted to watch the true STAR WARS film once again to see the difference, and it was indeed like ""long ago, in another galaxy far, far away...."" another universe entirely. Am I going to watch the sequel next year? Definitely NOT. That is no STAR WARS. Not any more. They don't deserve my money."
3121,1,They dare to call it STAR WARS!!!,"Hated it. Was bored in the opening scene and the boredom continued through to the end. It wasn't Star Wars. Trying to capture the original star wars in 2016 was a bad move that only hurt the franchise. There was little depth to anything force related, there was no memorable dialogue, the music was highly unmemorable (snooze John Williams, please retire your best work is done), the only aspect I enjoyed was Kylo Ren. Snoke, Jesus, don't even get me started on what a failure his attendance was. Fans actually destroy their own franchises in the end by demanding what they know, and when they get what they know, they cry about it. I for one enjoyed and miss the richness of the sequels and believe the whole franchise would have been better off under Lucas's guidance."
3122,2,Bring Back George Lucas!,"This was Disney movie marketing magic at its best, very similar to a marketing paradigm exercised by a particular smartphone manufacturer that bears a fruit symbol, but back on track to the critique of this movie..."
3123,1,Uninspiring and over-hyped!,"If you think that the first three episodes are mediocre just wait to see this one. It is boring sequence of actions without any life in it. The only actor that actually get his role right is Harrison Ford, which is no surprise for him, but the rest of the cast is just plain awful. Princess Leia is old and there is no life in her acting. The new faces are far away from the convincing characters they were supposed to be and this is especially true for Kylo Ren. Man I was picturing Eddie Redmayne in this role, I think it was written for him. However we got something which is not convincing at all. One suggestion for the future, please try to act like you mean it. Not that you make this for the money."
3124,2,A movie I wished I never watched,"**To restate, after the first paragraph this review contains spoilers.**"
3125,1,A soulless film and beyond lazy writing,"On the surface, it would seem The Force Awakens did everything I'd want to see from it: likably interesting new characters, nostalgic old ones, entertaining adventure mixed with tragic heartbreak, and quality filmmaking techniques consistent with the originals. But while all this might makes one leave the theater feeling satisfied, it merely masks the gaping, fundamental issues at its core."
3126,5,All the Reboot/Sequel Tropes in One Movie,"Better than new trilogy, but much worse than the old. The main mistake - absurd evil. Ren is hysterical, constantly in fits of smashing furniture, in the final screams ""traitor!"" and for some reason strikes to fight Finn instead just take away his sword telekinesis. He is wearing a helmet is not impressive, but without a helmet at all turned out to be a nerd like disco-boy from 1970. Supreme Leader Snoke looks like Gollum. General Hux, how old he is, this general, 20, 25? Hustler make a career in the Order, or is someone son? The second error - ridiculous good. Skinny and always hungry girl wins mercenaries and stormtrooper. Stormtrooper - another simple-minded clown like Jar Jar Binks, who wants to kill half an hour of contemplation. And copies, copies, copies. Again the robot with information, again Death Star with a single point of failure, even entire scenes copied from the 4th series. "
3127,1,Force no more.,"Don't take any chances! Do virtually nothing original! Take NO risks! This is a remake of the first Star Wars movie, not a real sequel. We Star Wars fans have been duped! Disney is gonna make billions worldwide on this film - and on dumb toys made in sweat shops, God knows where - by making a film that is close to an exact copy of the original. Keep in mind there are hundreds of Star Wars stories in print to choose from. Or, God-forbid, someone writes an original screenplay. Oh, no, who would have thought of that? But the morons at Disney know the first Star Wars film was a big hit so why not make it the same exact story only shuffling around the characters: Luke becomes Obi One Kan-obi, our new female heroine becomes Luke, the new bad guy is Darth Vader - even wearing a mask to imitate his grandfather. Oh, my God, who comes up with this utter nonsense? Another death star and another innocent world destroyed. What is up with all the mind-boggling killing? Do people kill billions of intelligent beings just for kicks? Genocide on a mind-boggling scale is glossed over like it's no big deal. That's not exactly the lesson I want my kids to learn from watching Star Wars."
3128,1,Disney Played It SOOO SAFE! What An Incredibly Wasted Opportunity!,I have never been a great Star Wars fan and I honestly think I'm better off without all the hype that has surrounded the franchise in general and this movie in particular. I do like the original trilogy and I don't despise episode 1-3. 
3129,5,Predictable and unoriginal but isn't that exactly what the fans wanted?,Long time SW fan. I was very disappointed in this movie....basically a New Hope remake.
3130,1,Worst Star Wars Movie,"Disappointing at least. It was supposed to be a historical event, but it turned out to be a poor remake. Boy, Disney Studios had all the resources they could imagine! I could easily have written a much better plot!! I would have paid to do it!! I thought about taking my kids to the cinema to make them feel the same I felt when I saw Star Wars in 1979; luckily I saw it first and decided it was not worth buying tickets for all three of us. George, you sold your soul to Disney Studios. The Saga is dead. By the way... Kylo Ren, why do you wear a mask? And why did you take it off? You look much better with the mask on. And please! Take some lessons on how to use the light saber, an unexperienced storm trooper can defeat you!"
3131,4,"What have you done, George?","I thought after watching the first trailer, this 'thing' was going to be pretty mediocre. Only two days before the release, the critics on Rotten Tomatoes and YouTube gave the 'thing' an A. I thought I had to see this in theaters (I wasn't impressed with the audience's intelligence, and I'll start buying or renting instead.). Mediocre is an understatement. I'd rather have blood in my urine than watch this tripe again. Now I will give a review. ""The Force Awakens"" is a shameless, incoherent mess that does not deserve the word film. ""Battlefield Earth"" was more entertaining than this. I am not exaggerating. It lacks plot, character development, acting, cinematography, and, above all, inspiration. The plot is a dumb rehash of the very first Star Wars film. There is a third Death Star but this time it is a planet that is TEN TIMES BIGGER. Wow. A droid, BB-8, a Disney-fied version of R2- D2, has to bring a map to Luke Skywalker, who has vanished for no apparent reason, instead of blueprints of the new Deathstar, to the Resistance aka Rebels. This is beyond idiotic. Let's talk common sense. If you are going to vanish, are you going to leave breadcrumbs? Of course not unless you were my discrete mathematics professor. All the main characters run into each other by coincidence like I was watching ""Independence Day"" without the fun. This ""Starkiller Base"" is so IDIOTIC; including the name, ha! ""Mega Maid"" from Spaceballs actually is a better Death Star than ""Starkiller"". As the video game generation would say, LOL. This new base sucks energy from the closest sun while draining too, and, not just that, it has the exact same flaw as the other two Death Stars in which an X Wing can fire torpedoes down its shaft causing it to explode. This is unbelievably hilarious. Is this supposed to be a comedy? The characters lack any depth or development. Rey is a MARY SUE. She learns the Force within two minutes without the ""film"" giving any background to why she knows. By the way, she is not that hot! A solid 6/10! Finn, a black Stormtrooper, is a cowardly, idiotic buffoon who chases the white female protagonist trying to get laid. Did I mention he was a janitor?Wow, that is racially sensitive. Poe is wasted. Why include him in the movie. He only has 20 minutes of screen time. Oh yeah, to fill the diversity quota since he is Hispanic. This whole ""film"" was written by left-wing Disney executives. The original cast did not develop over the last 30 years. Han Solo is still a smuggler? WTF! He was a war hero! Leia is an idiot who gets Han killed. Chewbacca is there to sell toys. I saved the villain, Kylo Ren, for last. He is the biggest wimp I have ever seen in film history. He throws temper tantrums, murders a whole village like a mass murdering lunatic (how subtle), and wears a mask for fun. Awful. The acting is uninspired. Harrison Ford looks bored, confused, or embarrassed in almost every scene. I hope he enjoyed that money to fill his greed. The new ""actors"" need to go work at McDonald's especially the guy who plays Kylo Ren. Cinematography does not exist. Most of the locations used in the ""film"" look like golf courses. Jakoo is Tatoonine 2.0. CGI ranges from exceptional to laughable. The worst part is where Rey releases the god awful looking CGI monsters on the freighter ship. The cast and crew lied when they said they would use actual props as much as possible. Really, these people should be arrested. The editing is all over the place. The spaceships are uninspired and belong on Sci-Fi channel movie*. Everything happens in this ""film"" because... ""Whatever, we need to make a movie so we can make a bazillion dollars!"" None of this had a purpose but to make a quick buck. The original cast is way too old. That has already been stressed ENOUGH. John Williams score is so bland and that really breaks my heart. I cannot blame him. He is a gifted genius who at 87 really deserves better at his age. The guy was sick, and the ""movie"" already sucked so oh well. This ""director"" Jar Jar Abrams produces nothing rehash crap so he can make big bucks off of it. What a fuck1ng disgrace. The only saving grace for us all is Darwinism. Let nature eliminate those who are way too stupid including JJ Abrams. This is the 3rd highest grossing movie of all time. People are dumb and it is dragging society down! Edit #5"
3132,1,"The Critics, Cast, Crew, and Disney executives need to be arrested for ruining film.","How do you call incredibly bad writing combined with even more incredible bad acting from bad cast, some light-saber forestry management, material recycling, pretty good direction and fantastic sfx? Something that is not just stupid, but Disney stupid? Yup, that's the one. This movie. I've watched the first movie in the series when I was pretty young and I though ""wow!"". Probably (only) kids would also like this one. It's simply horrible from an adult point of view. Fiction with no science. A bunch of randomly piled ideas from previous sequels put together. But not so boring. One expects something (new or at all, for that matter) to happen but it does not, and the movie is over. One gets sick from wooden figures called actors (except maybe for Chewbacca). One cannot believe that there is nothing more to say (or to tell) in this saga after the previous sequel, yet they make a movie out of it. Out of nothing, that is. If you ever were a true fan of Star Wars, forget this one for your own good. If you want to become a light-saber woodcutter , feel free to learn. My God, why did I watch this?!"
3133,2,Fairy tale with no fairies and no tale,"There are many reasons to be disappointed with this pointless movie. But there are far fewer reasons to like it. I was most impressed with the expansive landscape shots of Jakku. And everybody loves the furball, as well as Carrie Fisher, who, it should be said, apparently overdosed on BoTox for the role. She somewhat resembled a mannequin in her own image, and then shows up on television to demand that we not discuss how she has aged (oh, the narcissism!). "
3134,3,YAWN (spoilers),if frost three movies where given screen of 10 stars and then next three movies where given lets say where given 7 or 8 stars this star was movie should be given 4 or 5 stars.
3135,1,its okay not as good as other star wars movies,This is sadly the murder of an era for me. The movie missed everything that mattered by light years. It did not have even the slightest of George Lucas' touch. What's worse is that it had so much potential! The castings were good but why couldn't they provide a quality plot that was true to the spirit of Star Wars?? How ever can you end up with such utter rubbish? AARRGGH!!
3136,1,.... so sorry that I watched it.... it leaves you with an awful aftertaste...,"Off work for Jesus' birthday. Tree in the lounge. Family visiting. Mum babysitting. Nothing on at all at the cinema except for the new hotly-tipped ""Star Wars"" film. Having been appalled and disappointed by the Disneyfication of the most recent three contributions to the franchise, I frankly really didn't hold high expectations for this latest effort. To be perfectly honest I thought that it was most likely going to be formulaic and simple, guaranteed to rake in lorry loads of cash."
3137,5,Suspiciously similar to Episode IV...,"Star Wars 2015 was, so I believed, supposed to be the follow up to the first Trilogy that included gritty stars such as Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. True we did get a glimpse of the old Hans Solo and boy was he great. Not so the new wave of actors invading the Galaxy! When Luke Skywalker learnt to be a Jedi Knight, it took time and patience - and it was worth the wait! Not so the young pretenders! In the space of a short time they were able to become the Superheroes of Time and Space."
3138,1,This film and its actors show little sign of the punchiness and grit that is Star Wars,"Having seen this film I was disappointed, to say the least. I won't go into the obvious parallels with ANH, as that horse has already been beaten."
3139,4,Did it occur to anyone else?,"1) Bits and pieces of the old movies, sloppily meshed together with ""clone wars"" style plots - some episodes of clone wars might actually be more interesting to be honest. "
3140,4,One of the worst movies of the franchise. (Spoilers),"First off let me say that I actually enjoyed the prequels. To be sure, they had an overabundance of CGI and some wooden performances but they had the involvement of George Lucas. And he was true to his original vision. All of the situations in the prequel trilogy were in his early drafts back in the 70s. Of course they weren't as good as the originals but how could they be. I hated JJ Abrams Star Trek movies he essentially destroyed the franchise by disrespecting the fans and the material. Here he does the laziest thing imaginable. He recycles the first film(which by the way is the best one to me at least-better than the Empire strikes back because it is the only film in the series which stands on its own. There were a hundred different ways they could have gone with this and he chose to remake Episode IV. Daisy Ridley is good but the character of Finn was a joke. And Kylo Ren?! Are you kidding me? Say what you will about Hayden Christensen in the prequels at least his fall had resonance. Kylo is a joke. Why does he wear a mask? He doesn't need it. Other reviewers on this site have mentioned the plot holes and I will only touch on it briefly. Finn knows how to use a lightsaber?! And Rey knows how to use the force so quickly?!. Even if she is Luke's daughter which I suspect she is she shouldn't have learned that quickly. Lawrence Kasdan who was the co-writer should be ashamed. I think he did it for the paycheck This movie is a cash grab nothing more. It will make a ton of money and sell a lot of toys. The worst part was the death of Han Solo. This was such a cheap moment and played strictly for shock value. This character, one of the greatest in movie history deserved a better ending than this. This is cynical lazy filmmaking. It is essentially a bad fan made film. The best thing about it was the use of practical effects. The original trilogy(and to a lesser extent the prequels) gave you a sense of another time and place. This movie didn't There was no magic. The worst part was how did the First Order come to be? The Empire was destroyed at the end of Return of the Jedi. Was the Republic that careless that they would have allowed this to happen again? This movie is Star Wars in name only. If you want to see the real story watch the prequels and the original trilogy. George Lucas was involved in those films for better or worse and they are his movies. This is a copy and a cheap one at that."
3141,3,Lazy remake of episode IV. Star Wars in name only. Abrams ruins Star Wars.,"Don't get me wrong, the cinematic a and 3D effects were top notch but for anyone who grew up with the original franchise this film was a mix of story lines of New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. I think this is targeted at those who grew up with the 1997-2005 trilogy and made for today's teens. Firstly, I'm not bragging or saying my claims are more valid than anyone else's opinion but I minored in Film and Media Studies in college with a 3.65 GPA in my minor. Let's go over the numerous shortfalls and storyline redundancies in the franchise. First, it's 30 years or so later in the Star Wars world yet the only effective way to send messages still is via hand carried messages stored on robots- first R2D2 and now the new little robot ( kinda dumb). Second, how has the new Empire have the capability to build a machine to harness the sun's power but no way to stop intruders from getting in to blow it up? You'd think they'd have multiple redundancies built in to protect a massive failure. If it's that important, have multiple guards near every door and heavy guns on top in order to stop a full on assault. Next, I doubt it's a straight shot to the targeted planet that's light years away- there will be other stars or planets blocking a straight line shot. Second, it should take years for the blast to arrive- not seconds, otherwise if you flew light speed from the first planet, you smash into the next in less than a second. Next, unlike the shock of hearing Darth Vader was Luke's father, I could see 30 minutes ahead of time that Han and Lea were the parents of the new sith. Having Rey travel to train under Luke is exactly like Luke traveling to find snd train under Yoda. Luke and Rey will now train ( possibly find scattered Jedi across Galaxy) to fight the giant Sith and the other New Order team. I give the effects 9.4/10 and the story 4/10. Wow, I could've come up with a better story arc for this film and have had Abrams fill in the details. Anyone else who grew up on the original trilogy feel betrayed by this film and it's supposed turning points? How did this get such good reviews?"
3142,4,What an unoriginal Star Wars film- copied so many aspects of original films,"Apparently, the only purpose of this film is to please social justice warriors (such as tumblr users. Pretty sure they are happy Star Wars has been destroyed for everyone else). This is an absolute fiasco for the entire franchise. This is everything that should not have happened to this saga."
3143,1,"No, just no.",Is it possible that somebody has wanted to deliberately destroy the Star Wars?
3144,1,This was and will be the biggest crime in the history of cinema!,"Before I saw the movie, I'd already read some bad reviews. I'm a huge SW fan so I decided to go see it. I couldn't believe how poorly made this film was. Acting was mediocre to say the least with the exception of the droids and Chewbacca. The old cast trio acted very little in the film, especially Mark Hamil who appears only a couple of minutes. The light saber fighting scenes were poor and uninspired. I don't want to go into EU, non-canon issues as that's a personal opinion. For me it was a bad mistake not to follow the EU with all the epic material out there. I mean there is material right there, served on a golden platter. The villains were weak as it's usually the case with Disney's movies, all talk but no backbone. To have the main villain, the leader of the ""First Order"", be defeated by a girl who never touched a light saber before in her life... that spells disaster in my books. Where is the ominous presence of Darth Vader, Count Dooku, Darth Sidious, Obi Wan etc.? Where is the epic atmosphere of the previous films? What of this ""Supreme Leader Snoke""? He looks like Gollum! Where on the galaxy did they find Luke's/Anakin's light saber and stored it in a chest in a basement?? That light saber was cut off Luke's hand and dropped in the chasm of Bespin's bottom (probably down in the ocean) in episode V. How did Kylo Ren find Darth Vader's mask? That was burned on the moon of Endor some 30 years ago. Finally the story. Ah the story, it seemed to me I was watching a remake of Episode IV... come on! Another bigger, badder Death ""Planet""... No background, no nothing. I really do hope, George Lucas buys back the franchise, disavows this film, and makes a proper one."
3145,2,Disappointment,Possible Spoilers:
3146,5,Flash VS Substance...,"I was really hoping that JJ Abrahams would bring some new grit and edginess to Star Wars. After the disaster of the last three movies it was obvious fans needed/wanted more. So what did we get, an almost mirror copy of the original Star Wars. As expected, just to try to make it seem better, they put it on steroids, making everything bigger and faster and cuter. The movie has no soul, no heart. You don't care about the new characters, and the old characters don't matter. I went twice, just to see if maybe I was being overly critical, hoping that a second viewing would temper my disappointment. No such luck."
3147,1,A wasted rehash,"I expected an update since this film is set in the future, and not a prequel. Everything about this movie seemed dated. From the costumes to the music to the spacecraft to the plot points. What a waste 57 bucks to take my family of four to a 3D movie."
3148,3,What a snore!,This is a prime example of a modern movie with stunning visuals but lame writing ...not a bad way to kill a few hours whilst stuffing your face with popcorn and playing with your phone but overhaul the story had to many stupid moments that you'd have to be utterly mindless to forgive.
3149,5,The force isn't with the writers,"This is not about making movies anymore, and certainly not about good story telling, or good acting, or anything good. This is all about HYPE, like the latest Bond movies, Star Trek, and whatever Hollywood is dishing out these days. Disney is nothing more than an attraction Park for kiddies and their parents who have to go along for the necessary photo albums. I won't repeat what has already been said, but yes the movie is awesome as a bottom feeder in cinema history. The one star I'm giving it is in compassion for the actors who tried their best to do something with the absence of a script. Sometimes, you can say ''it could have been better''... but not with this one. There is nothing in there for Rey to salvage. All junk not even worthy enough to feed yourself. I'm old enough to remember seeing the original Star Wars in a cinema, the joy and excitement I felt, nearly all of us science fiction fans felt at the time. Waiting in line to enter the cinema, it dawned on me that almost none of the people waiting were born in 1977. Such a pity there was nothing exciting to see or feel for them like we did then. Some have talked about nostalgia. But this thing is not about nostalgia, it's about harvesting the most money possible with hype and trailers and nothing else."
3150,1,Painfully dumb!,*** This review may contain spoilers ***
3151,1,Can't anyone write an original story anymore,So very very disappointed with this new starwar film.. can't believe how dumbit is.. Spoiler ahead. This movie has Lots of action with new stars. But Han Solo dies so movie is not going to be good in next Star Wars movie. So very very disappointed. Luke Skywalker Was only in 2 percent of film so that is a major major disappointment. Laia was only in this film 10 percent of time. Another major disappointment . This movie is not worth the money' it's not worth buying it on DVD' such a major disappointment and crap.... I really think they ruined the Star Wars saga.... And I lost hope.. Hopefully next time they could have a better more reliable director Instead of a movie that is pure trash' actually Trash is better than this film.... Unless you wanna see just new characters and same old action stuff with no new story no new nothing go for it.. so I give this film 2 stars ........ 
3152,2,Star wars At it's Worst... Overall trash...,"I don't normally feel compelled to write reviews, but the amount of 10's this rework of the original movie is getting demands balance. Many of the reviews on IMDb emphasize the myriad of issues that The Force Awakens suffers from, many of these from the point of view of a die-hard fan. I will not pretend for a second that I am a die- hard fan myself, but having watched the original films as a young kid and then have the prequel series (despite its own flaws) released as I grew up, I certainly became enamoured with many of the themes, characters and overall package of entertainment that each Star Wars movie offered. By the time Revenge had been released, I had certainly not come to expect the highest quality acting or scripting but what I had come to expect was a certain level of wonder, exciting battle sequences, bad ass antagonists and somewhat respectable protagonists. Star Wars The Force Awakens nails everything it was always going to succeed with, sparkly effect ridden battles, the cameos of old characters and basically just having the Star Wars universe present in the movie. However, Star Wars The Force Awakens fails in almost every other regard, which I will run through; 1.) Pathetic Antagonist Sith (Kylo Ren) - One of the most exciting things about the previous movies is the presence of powerful antagonist characters (sith) that can only be overcome through particular hardship by the Jedi/protagonists. Darth Vader and Darth Sidious took 3 movies to be overcome in the original trilogy, Darth Maul took Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn on 2v1 in the Phantom Menace before going down to Obi-Wan's hacks and Count Dooku whooped Anakin, Obi-Wan and even Yoda before going down at the start of the Revenge of the Sith. KYLO REN, the Sith character from The Force Awakens was extremely promising, albeit very similar initially in terms of characteristics to Darth Vader. However, the combination of him removing his helmet and being some Serverus Snape looking emo weasel, having multiple batty tantrums and then getting beaten by the female protagonist, who hasn't ever used a lightsabre before fighting him, makes Kylo Ren by far the worst antagonist to exist in the Star Wars universe. He's already been made to look like a total sissy before the beginning of episode 8, truly a let-down in this regard. – Additionally, the chrome storm trooper officer, while being shown off in the trailer, does absolutely nothing in the movie except help the rebels shut down the shield to blow up the Death Star Mk2. 2.) Completely Re-hashed story taken from Star Wars A New Hope – not much to say here, even the titles of the movies are similar – young force-gifted person awakens on desert planet, saves droids, destroy death star etc etc. Many other reviews go into just how ridiculously copy-pasted the story is, if you can think of a plot- point from A New Hope then an almost identical one probably exists in The Force Awakens. 3.) INCONSISTENCIES – Came to realise some of these through scanning other reviews and thinking about it myself, but The Force Awakens, while extremely faithful to many themes and motifs of the Star Wars Universe, screws many of them up. The most obvious and ridiculous one would be the way that Rey, the female force using protagonist, literally gets told of the force's existence by Han Solo and then somehow (without explanation through the course of the story) figures out how to use Jedi-Mind-Tricks, force pull/push(telekinesis) and how to use a lightsabre (eventually beating the Sith Kylo Ren who trained UNDER Luke SKYWALKER and then KILLED ALL THE OTHER DISCIPLES HE WAS TRAINING). The Jedi-Mind-Trick scene was added purely for use as a plot device and for comedic value. Someone also please explain how the lightsabre Rey eventually receives (AKA Luke's old lightsabre) is BLUE, when the last lightsabre he had was GREEN because he was forced to make after losing the blue one in cloud city after Vader cut his hand off. If the First Order are supposed to be the new, even more dangerous Empire, why have they gone and made an even more idiotic and moronic version of the Death Star. There are even more 4.) Over excited, over-acting from the main characters. Seems like a bit of Disney charm here, in an effort to make the wooden acting more acceptable they have made the main characters far too intense and at times very cringe in their interactions. Finn was much better than Rey in terms of how his performance fit his character, but let's be honest, we all know why Rey was chosen for this role (Keira Knightly look alike AKA Natalie Portman look alike) and it wasn't for her acting – instead just a lot of shouting. Ultimately, the movie was entertaining enough, especially in IMAX but the problem is that was purely because I initially thought I was in for something special (which I continued to believe until about midway into the movie due to pure faith in the director, technology available and early responses) and because of the effect sequences (which didn't provide anything new you wouldn't have seen in previous movies.) What the movie is extremely successful at, is being a flawless commercial success in the way that it has got everyone to pay top dollar for a very low-quality, poorly written, acted and characterised movie that has been almost entirely copy pasted from A New Hope. It will be exciting for people who don't know star wars for sure, but even for someone who has only watched the previous movies one or two times each, The Force Awakens offers nothing new and f**ks up a few things it probably just could have copy pasted as well, ONE STAR"
3153,1,"New Hope Remastered, with a pathetic antagonist Sith and annoying protagonists",What went wrong with this movie? Was it too much comedy? Or the countless plot holes and wtf moments I had while I was watching it? I really don't know.
3154,3,Most overrated movie in history?,"So I finally saw Star Wars VII and Oh my...this movie has a lot of flaws - When it does things right, which sadly doesn't happen a lot, it does it perfectly."
3155,1,"Too many flaws to enjoy the movie...Started really nice, but gets annoying at 30 minute mark.","Went to see this movie with lots of hype, but wow can't believe it was so bad and on top of it can't believe the high rating. Acting was bad with none of the actors look involved, setting was bad with the same old Death star stuff droid having the clue, Pacing was very slow as there was no surprises with lame dialogues and silly comedy in between and during climax we were forced to watch for 5mins the expected to occur - ren kill han, CGI and action were ordinary compared to current trend of action movies and script was the worst and its better to not talk about it. Finally JJA, please leave star wars. I feel that the main reason for such a high rating is just nostalgia of hardcore fans. Nostalgia is good but they can't make a movie just for that sake. Keep nostalgia aside and watch,it is a pure bad movie. I am done with Star wars. This is by far my worst movie of the year."
3156,1,Forget Nostalgia - This is one of the worst movie of the year,"I did not like The Force Awakens. Just to be sure where I am coming from, I revere the first three films (4, 5, and 6 in the new ordering, just to be clear). These movies and their message are a constitutive part of me and of how I see the world to this day. I do not know if George Lucas produced a masterpiece somewhat by chance, if he was guided by superior powers, or if he is simply an incredible genius who lost himself in the Hollywood jungle with the subsequent second/first trilogy. Whatever the explanation, the first three movies are, to me, among the greatest stories ever produced. "
3157,3,"Copies form, not substance of the original",Omg...star wars episode 7 come on.....thats what I thought! ........................................................... now I've read all the reviews and to be purrfectly honest there is no point in me saying too much other then the exact same thing as most other honest true star wars fans.....its basically scene for scene and word for word a mix of episode 4/5/6
3158,3,rinse and repeat!!!!,"I was eager to watch this movie as I had heard so much about it but at the same time I was sorely disappointed with the work JJ Abrams had done with ""Star Trek"" so going into it I knew this might not be the best Star Wars movie made."
3159,4,Haven't I seen this before?,"I even loved the new ones. Even the Phantom Menace! Got into the theater ready to believe ANYTHING. But, the Force Awakens is so soft on all spots! Huge story holes, super-predictable and the ""new"" ""heroes"" lack any emotions and depth and star quality. Unfortunately Star Wars now follows Marvel and DC into making action driven, emotionless and plot hole movies... Our only hope on stopping this on going Star Wars parody is ONLY IF we the audience send the creators a powerful message against this horrible take on the Star Wars myth! "
3160,4,"If we the ""audience"" can't get the wreck of SW7, be prepared for even worst Star Wars films!","Yes, this is also my first review on IMDb and probably the last. This film desperately needs lower IMDb ratings as it's turned out to be a steaming pile of money making Disney crap!! "
3161,1,The defection of Finn should have been the focus of this movie,"I enjoyed those first three movies way back when. The next three I only saw parts as I watched it on network television and they were so bad I changed the station during commercials. Star Wars died then but the story was not quite over. Along came the worst series in the history of television ""Lost"". I watched it and was fooled once but never fooled again. I remembered the name JJ Abrams. He made a Star Trek movie or two or whatever but I remembered his name and I did not pay to see Star Trek. Then he made this movie and I did not pay to see it either. Why did you Star Trek fans and Star Wars fans pay to see those movies when you should have known better?"
3162,1,The fans are the idiots,"Just managed to see the movie ... All I can say it's: Extremely disappointing. The acting is BAD all around (the only ones decent are Harrison Ford and somewhat Carrie Fisher) and the directing is, if it's possible, EVEN WORSE."
3163,3,Bad. Just BAD,"After butchering Star Trek, J.J.~Abrams has now set out to slowly bleed the Star Wars franchise to death. It is hard to believe how little of an creative spark he actually has. The story is essentially a boring remake of the first (original) Star Wars movie, with only some sequences out of order to make it look like a new film. The only new idea was making the villains even more strikingly incompetent than in the original movies. The main villain is a Darth Vader wannabe reminiscent of an emo teenager who cannot do anything right, especially not fighting with a light saber. The new ''emperor'' looks like Gollum (literally played by the same actor) and his evil ''elite'' forces consist of baby-faced yuppies. On the good guy side, the main characters are a bland ex-stormtrooper who without any effort overcomes his imperial brainwashing, an desert scavenger-ninja woman who -- without effort -- turns into a skillful Jedi (well, skillful enough to defeat an allegedly trained evil Jedi), and an ace pilot who so far does not much more than being an ace pilot."
3164,5,Not much beyond nostalgia,This film could have been so much more. Great films have great character development and evoke an emotional response other then boredom. The force awakens has very few high points. The only one that stands out for me is the few moments of tension excitement and interaction between Rey and Finn as they fight to learn to control the Millennium Falcon while trying to evade the TIE fighters on Jakku. This is the only interesting action scene in the film because it ties back to the nostalgia of the original and evokes emotion as the characters get to know one another in a tense situation. The rest of the film falls flat in my opinion. Poe the pilot who is supposed to be a cast member of substance seems like just another extra in the film. Same for the chrome trooper. The films story line is basically plagiarized from the the original star wars film. There is nothing wrong with creatively using certain elements of prior films that work well in your story but this is just a lazy ripoff. The film does have some creatively interesting concepts that could have been taken further. For example the starkiller base needing the sun to fire its weapon was creative and really could have been used to build tension. I was thinking while watching this they could have borrowed for example the concept used in the classic story of Dracula where the heroes are trying to get to Dracula before the sun goes down where he is most powerful. They could have built a lot of tension doing this and having our heroes fight a platoon of first order troops and Kylo. Could have had several of the non essential characters like Poe get badly hurt or killed trying to fight Ren to disable the shield thing. Could have had Solo die falling on a detonator and saving everyone (Bridge on River Kwai style. They could have had them dying trying to do this and have Ren kill them using his jedi powers. Point is they needed a climactic struggle that involved meaningful sacrifice and tension. This fell flat just having them plant a few bombs and have Solo just walk out alone and get killed by his petulant kid. These types of ideas have been done before but they are not blatant ripoffs like this film did. The character development in this movie was awful. The Finn character has one battle and defects. Sorry but they should have had him in a few battles and shown some kind of relationships with other troopers before having him just go off in the first few minutes of the film. In fact if they showed him having a friendship with chrome girl and then have him go awol making her have to chase him down it would have been better. The characters get very little back story so you really don't care about them. They make Finn and Poe like best buddies when they barely knew each other in the film. The film would have been better with one climactic action sequence and more character development. So many better ways to do this movie. Hell they could have made a chase movie where Kylo had to deliver something to the starkiller base in order for it to work. This would have built tension. They could have sought Luke out for help. I don't know any number of ideas are better then this bore. I cant figure out why these people are so bad at film making. Perhaps they haven't watched very many older great films to see what works.
3165,4,Uncreative script with no real tension and one dimensional characters,"I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a young boy. I don't know every corner and crevice of the Star Wars universe, but I know it quite well so I was pretty excited about a new film. Well, let me just say that I am very disappointed with J.J. Abrams and Disney. They had the opportunity to create something fresh and meaningful and an chance to add to the story but instead they recreated A New Hope with a few new characters and far less appeal. Way to go Disney!! I won't go into details since there are a ton of YouTube videos and articles on the Web that already do that, but to put it all in a nut shell, The Force Awakens is a film we have all already seen. The only thing that is new is some in your face political correctness. I will not be going to the theater to see the follow up films, and will wait for them to come out on Netflix. I know I won't be missing much if anything at all."
3166,1,Unimaginative reboot! Star Wars is dead.,1) Finding Nemo meets Despicable Me meets A New Hope:
3167,4,Some title suggestions for the re-release of TFA in special edition in 2050 that will undoubtedly make billions,"Well I really didn't expect much when I saw that they were going to try and make another Star Wars and I didn't get much. This movie is trite and redundant. You know there is definitely room in movies made from previous films for references to its predecessor but this film just has the same thing happen that happened in the previous films (just bigger)and thinks you won't notice. Finn is a terrible character. You don't know why he does what he does and he really has no reason at all to be in the movie except to be annoying. Ray would have been an interesting character if you knew more about her from the beginning. And who is God's name came up with the villains in this movie. At first when I saw the big bad I thought I was in a Marvel film and not Star Wars, come on people. And the Darth Vader substitute is just some whiny boy in black clothes. This movie has the worse dialog that I have ever heard. Listening to Harrison Ford speak became almost painful and Carrie Fisher was worse. When the movie was over my daughter asked me where the real Star Wars characters were? I was asking the same question."
3168,5,Trite and redundant,"After waiting numerous years and having to put up with the dreadful prequels of Episodes I-III, we were finally treated with a new installment of the Star Wars Saga. We were told it was going to be gritty and back to the roots. We were told the old cast was coming back. We were going to see Han, Chewie, Leia, and Luke again. We were anticipating."
3169,4,Dragged in the dirt,"If this were written by a ten year old for other ten year old children it would be acceptable (perhaps) but it has no believable characters,no character development, no back story for the last 30 years and a rehash of tropes from episode 4. I can only assume that it has gathered any positive reviews due to black hat Search Engine Optimisation and outright bribery. The best acting was from the robots. The music was mostly bland and forgettable (nothing even came close to Duel of the Fates or Battle of the Heroes), most of the scenes were soulless rip offs from the Original Trilogy and the new protagonists were equally vapid. And let's not leave out Kylo ""Scotty Evil"" Ren, a character who encapsulates the film in a nutshell-a weaker copy of something much better. Would Darth Vader have been as Iconic as he is if he had thrown a tantrum when he couldn't find the Death Star plans? Disney could have so easily used stories from the Expanded Universe like Dark Empire or The Thrawn Trilogy-instead, they opted for a lame attempt to free ride George Lucas' ideas and 'Disneyfy' them with flawless, 2D characters."
3170,1,Written by a 10 year old,"I want to say that this is the first Star Wars movie which I didn't have the need to see twice or more. First six movies I can watch over and over again, with the healthy pause between them, of course, enjoying them each time. This one, and I fear next to follow, I simply didn't have the usual need to watch again. I felt kind of strange. Something was missing."
3171,5,Much weaker than first two trilogies,"It's like hello, whats wrong with Hollywood these days? This is a part of a major franchise. They could get anyone to direct this - anyone. How come they came up with this amateur as a director? The film comes across like a badly rehearsed play in an amateur theatre."
3172,5,What is wrong with that director?,Never have I been compelled to write a review for a movie before. It might deserve slightly more than 1/10 but that 8.6 average is a gross misrepresentation of the movie and an offense to the rest of the saga. 
3173,1,They Didn't Even Try to be Original !!!,"So. I was under the impression, that this was supposed to be a sequel, not a remake. It markets itself as a sequel, so there is no reason to think of it as a reboot. Yet the plot and the characters were recycled from the old movies."
3174,4,One of my greatest cinematographic disappointments,I went to see this movie yesterday and actually enjoyed the visuals and cgi after it got obvious that I can switch my brain off... again... like for so many others in recent times.
3175,3,"3 Stars for the people who actually deserve to get acknowledged, but its not J.J.","People's response to this movie has been, at times, emotional. It would seem that this was the point, since the movie added essentially zero to the saga, the universe. I won't give any spoilers, but there isn't much of a plot, it really seems more like an excuse to draw different audiences and make it a big hit. It worked, apparently."
3176,3,"Unoriginal, silly/goofy, and implausible","I came out of the cinema yesterday thinking that I'd just seen the original Star Wars film re-filmed with different characters. The plot, especially the critical junctures are 1:1 carbon copy of the original Star Wars with some elements of The Return of the Jedi thrown in."
3177,3,People have been fooled by smoke and mirrors. The Force Awakens is a lousy rehash that cripples the SW saga.,"The Force Awakens Rant. So I watched Star Wars The Force Awakens again last night. Just because I had to make sure I didn't like it. WARNING SPOILERS, even though the spoilers are predictable and lame. The first 30 minutes of the movie is amazing. You get that Star Wars feeling and actually care about the new characters. Right about the time Han Solo enters the film, things surprising start dragging. The plot starts becoming convenient and predictable, and I'm not even talking about the major plot points the film rips off from Episode 4 and 5 and even 6. Safe is a perfect way to describe this film. Safe and boring. I didn't even care when they were taking out the super mega Deathstar, and I don't even think Jar Jar Abrams gave a s%&t. Who knows? Maybe it isn't his fault. Maybe Disney told him to remake Episode 4 because they do not respect Star Wars fans enough to give them an actual movie. This wasn't a movie, it was propaganda begging Star Wars fans to like the new cast and new direction by treating us like babies and sandwiching in nostalgia in between recycled plot-points. And the character of Rey. She was likable until she became a Mary Sue. I'm glad what's his name had the balls to call her out on it because no other critic did. She became an unstoppable Jedi Master within seconds and just because we're all guessing she was probably trained by Luke as a child; but that doesn't make it any less boring or believable to watch. The light-saber fight between Kylo Ren and Rey is just laughable. I'm sure Rey is supercharged with the Force or whatever other bullshit but the fight wasn't believable to watch on the big-screen. Strong female characters are one thing. Watching Uma Thurman kick butt all over Kill Bill one and two is believable because she is a strong female character based on something called character development. The movie was just lazy. After the first 30 minutes, it was just lazy and bad filmmaking. The reviews of the film are bulls%&t. It isn't anywhere near as good as Episode 4-6 or even Episode 3 for that matter. I wonder if the hype-train was this bad with Phantom Menace? The Force Awakens isn't a Star Wars movie. It is Star Wars fan-fiction at best. And don't even get me started on Kylo Ren. At least BB-8 was good. Star Wars is dead."
3178,4,Star Wars is Dead,Besides quite a few plot holes. 
3179,1,The force is depleted,"I'd like to believe there are literally thousands of Star Wars fans sitting out there, desperately trying to like this film. Please stop, there's not that much here to like."
3180,3,Save your money,THE PLOT A droid containing vital information escapes the imperialist First Order onto a desert planet where it is befriended by a young woman. The droid has to get back to the resistance forces. They escape the barren planet on a junked out smuggler's ship with the First Order in pursuit. A masked man in black wielding the force captures the girl and takes her to his giant battle station and interrogates her. Then the base fires its secret weapon destroying entire planets in one shot. A group of unlikely heroes both young and old band together on a rescue mission to save the girl and destroy the battle station before all is lost.
3181,5,You could do anything in the universe and you redo A New Hope?,Was coaxed to go and see TFA by my 22yr old daughter and went with a very open mind. I am totally bemused by the 9/10 star ratings and reviews of this film.At best it's a 4.
3182,4,Hype over substance.,"This movie had the trademarks of the first six episodes. Lots of action and great special effects. The acting was OK, but it's the story is where it went wrong. The movie was kind of boring until Solo showed up, his sarcastic remarks were witty and funny. It made the movie, in my opinion."
3183,1,Could've Done Better,"In ""The Force Awakens,"" we see how a massive entertainment corporation co-opts talented writers, producers and actors, pulverizes their contributions into a shallow, incoherent pulp, and yet still succeeds commercially through a ubiquitous cross-promotion campaign."
3184,2,Disney Forcefeeds a Rotten Sequel,A Spoiler alert is in order.
3185,2,Bad as predicted.,This was so disappointing - it was just a remake of the original. The special affects were terrible. It really is a Harvard business study on hype and marketing.
3186,3,Star Wars - the force makes you snore,"If you were to look at this movie without any of the previous Star Wars movies in mind, it's a decent action movie. The acting is okay, the characters are meh, the special effects are very pretty and some of the one-liners aren't entirely cringe-inducing."
3187,1,What a waste.,"This movie is so PC it's sickening. Phantom Menace was better solely based on the fact that it took chances. The guy that played Kylo Ren was painful to watch. He made Hayden Christian look like Leonardo DiCaprio, which is quite difficult to do. Harrison Ford just cashed his check and phoned it in. Ridley and Boyega actually did well considering the material they were given and had decent chemistry so there is still hope I suppose. Don't quite understand the high rating compared to a movie such as guardians of the galaxy, considering it is a better movie in a similar genre. So many plot holes for example why is the light saber drawn to Rey this isn't a wand in Harry Potter. Anakin cycled through sabers and Luke had two. Hopefully the new director does a better job. Rant over....."
3188,2,The Worst,"After watching the movie to the half , i said to myself , "" what was that?."" I stopped and start to watch it all over from the beginning next day. I didn't watch star wars , this was kid's movie , with full of unprofessional horrible actors, The acting of the girl and the storm trooper (boy friend )was so bad and silly , that i was shocked , what was the director thinking when he was shooting the movie !!!! At the first scene when the storm troopers they landed at the village , the way they were walking and running , it was so funny and naive , it gave me the impression that this is one of the comedy movies , try to joke on the original one . The face of the actor in role of han solo' son , looked like "" robin hood "" unpolished movie , no way close to his role as dark force."
3189,4,Disappointing,"Looks like The plot of this movie was written by a five years old child, nothing makes sense, the series is sinking to a new low, if they are going to do another movie better look out TV writers, look what they are doing in Game of thrones for example, can not understand what is happening with the studios, it is like the goal is make dumb movies for dumb audiences, what a swam song for Star Wars, the new actors are OK, sorry for the veterans, the all seems completely out of place, advise to the people which has not seen the movie yet, look the episode IV, this one is the same but without all the aspects which made the first Star Wars movie great,all and all a very disappointing movie."
3190,1,What a Mess,Saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Huge disappointment! 3/10...
3191,3,Torture!,"Like so many I am a massive fan of the original 3 movies and although the prequels didn't measure up to the first 3, they did stand on their own in terms of story line and character building, but The Force Awakens was, I have to say a real disappointment. With J.J Abrams, Disney's budget, the original movies writers all involved in the project there was so much hope for this movie, but at the end of it you realise the only hope was a poor politically correct remake of the original A New Hope."
3192,1,A Poor Remake Of A New Hope.,"It did not have any new content.Lazy done. Remake, and very cheap. I am sure Disney will try and relaunch the whole Star Wars again, with cheaper actors. I am not going watch another star wars again after this one. Waste of my $20. I think the movie has fallen to the wrong hands, and the producers will not be able to live up to the old fan's expectations. As a movie alone without even mentioning expectations, this movie still fails to impress an average viewer. The only reason I think this movie got anywhere near an 8 is because of all the hype. The story line is missing, the actors barely have any connection with the audience, in exception to few old ones. In conclusion, this movie is a 6.5 without minding that it is successor to Star Wars, but the fact that it is a Star Wars this actually deserves a 0 out of 10."
3193,1,Awful,"This Star Wars movie is a complete disappointment. At no point in the movie, I have felt the ""Star Wars"" feeling I used to get (even in Episode 1 I felt it). The final scene maybe, but that's about it."
3194,2,What a disaster...,"So, after years of waiting, many people have been eagerly anticipating some sort of fix to the Star Wars universe. Sure, the prequels weren't the best, so whatever is to come should be better. The prequels didn't feel like Star Wars to some, or there was too much CGI, or too much politics, or Yoda was butchered or something along those lines..."
3195,5,"The wait is over, and Star Wars Episode Four marks its debut on the big screen...again!",A missed opportunity. The biggest let down of this movie was the script everything else was great but the story was lazy and a massive let down.
3196,1,We all knew it was going to be a let down........,4/10
3197,4,The Force Mistaken,"Firstly I have loved Star Wars all my life, I didn't even mind the prequels (not including Jar Jar of course). I've read the EU books and comics. I was so certain this movie would be great and I was so looking forward to it I bought two lots of tickets, 2 to the midnight screening and 2 for the next day. After this movie I will never watch Star Wars made by Disney ever again. As has already been said this movie is a bad remake of a classic, there is absolutely nothing original in here, I mean seriously a droid on a secret mission on a desert planet, on the same planet Catniss Ever...oops I mean Rey a Force sensitive young person with unknown parentage, Death Star 3.0 and they still haven't worked out how to protect that main reactor...really?? And the scary thing is I could have lived with that but here's the bit that left me really depressed. Han Solo has gone from being a Smuggler to a General and a war hero, back to a smuggler and the kind of guy who abandons his wife and friends and then he's dead, and no one cares! Even Chewie is upset for about 30 seconds; all I can say is they must have good Prozac in this Galaxy. Luke goes from farm boy, to hero pilot, to Jedi to...hermit???? It makes them both look like cowards and these are not the characters I grew up with. This is NOT character development, this is regression and lazy story telling and there's lazy story telling throughout this movie. We're supposed to believe these two heroic individuals who always stood with their friends and faced the Emperor and Vader have run crying because Kylo Ren killed a few people and then they left Leia to clean up the mess. The new villain is completely unconvincing and throws tantrums, presumably because his parents never loved him enough or whatever. I loved the Originals because of the characters and how steadfast they were together, this has forever destroyed that. Leia should be running the government, Han should be commanding a fleet and Luke should be training Jedi. The New Order should be the Rebellion. and the new villain should not be a Skywalker...this is another I am your father moment and it's bad. If you take the special effects out of this movie you have a bad bit of fan fiction. No Hope rather than a New Hope - this movie has no heart at all."
3198,1,Just awful - wish I'd never seen it,When Disney bough out the Star Wars franchise for billions of dollars it was natural to expect more movies to come out. This in itself is not a bad thing as the movie business is there to make money and new content entertains viewers.
3199,5,Reboot of Episode IV on steroids but otherwise nothing special,"With an 8.6 rating at time of writing, I expected better. I expected something better than the prequel movies. I was wrong. I'm beginning to think that Disney has been paying people to write positive reviews on various movie review sites. Yes, THATS how disappointing it was. I can still feel nauseous, as a star wars fan. Half the theater booed at the end of the film, and I wished there was someone I could hurl my rotten tomatoes at."
3200,2,I tried to like it,"Warning spoilers ahead! The plot was all over the place like the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. I thought it was gonna be a find Luke skywalker movie then Finn and Ray would become his new students, then it randomly jumped into the ham fisted Death Star 2.0 plot. Onto the new people. Finn came off Cowardly and moronic randomly which is disappointing because I thought he had so much potential. Then their was Ren and Ray where Ren started out bad ass then became all weak in the end. Then there's Ray I've haven't seen this much of a Mary Sue since Anakin in episode 1. Then there's the entire thing with the politics I had no idea who the first order was are they what's left of the imperials? Are they a bunch of people who warship the old empire? What are they! Someone tell me! Please!? Then there's the resistance! Wouldn't they just be republic special forces? Why is none of this explained! Like at all! I mean I know why they did this they didn't want us going this is just like the prequels with to much talking but instead they had the opposite problem with not enough talking! There has to be balance otherwise people are just gonna be annoyed. Sorry for the rant/ any errors I wrote this on my phone."
3201,1,Plot stupidity and the Mary Sue!,To be honest i think it deserved a 5 star rating. But after all this hype and stupid fanboy (and probably studio paid human bots rating) i wanted to balance this crap of a movie out. This doesn't deserve to be called a Scifi because there is no science in this one. Its the worst Star Wars Movie by a mile. The plot is totally ridiculous - a droid hiding a map is hunted by the bad guys - seriously? You can't be more unoriginal and uninspired then that. So boring and so predictable like a weather report. The acting is a joke - except Harrison Ford who is just doing his job. The dark side has been turned to a bunch of high school pricks. The stormtroopers look like some kind of ducktroopers. I guess they made them completely rounded so every toy company can easier make all the plastic trash they want to sell. And then there is some bam boom bang and some 3d effects - but again nothing special - easy to forget. I think after the hype has settled even Albrecht will admit that this is a epic fail.
3202,1,The fail is strong with this one,This review may contain spoilers.
3203,2,"Great special effects, mediocre story and a missed opportunity.","Star Wars is one of the most beloved franchises from people of all ages. It started with its beginning roots telling the story of the evil Galactic Empire bent on ruling the galaxy while hindering the progress of the Rebel Alliance, to the backstory of how the Republic was deceived by the Sith who enacted war under the guise of the Trade Federation. This film, however, mocks the genius, the integrity, and the furious action packed thrills that existed in all the other films that preceded it. This film is the perfect example of 21st Century Hollywood capitalizing on a franchise name for pure profits while playing it safe. Disney had its eyes for years on this and knew to take advantage when they got the chance."
3204,1,Star Wars: The Profits Awakens,"This is not a sequel, but a carbon copy of the original trilogy mashed into one."
3205,1,A nonexistent hope for Darth jar jar,I went to see this with a friend of mine who really loves SW. He seemed to really enjoy it but I didn't.
3206,2,Every Star Wars film gets worse each time.,**SPOILERS**
3207,1,Basically a remake of A New Hope with shocking character kill off!!!,"this movie was at best a 4. the 3d was just average. avatar by far was much better flick. hell to think i wasted all that money . i was around for the first one when the line was around the building. back in those days it was very entertaining. for all the money Disney made i know they could care less what i think. its quite comical what the masses find entertaining. well they all voted bush and Obama in twice, why not think this was a great movie. again an average dude with not very high expectations of today's overpaid actors and actress's. go and see it if you must. i am guessing that they are planning on making a star wars movie, now one a year. hell make it a TV series and let me stay at home and watch it."
3208,4,blah on blah,although a very easy film to watch as a star wars fan; it was all too similar to the previous movies lacking any creativity or imagination when it came to the storyline thus making it hugely predictable. The reason why its so popular is because it is similar to the popular trilogy; people nowadays just want to watch something they are familiar with I guess. What's worse is that the main villain looks like some CGI guy from Lord Of The Rings and the subordinate villain didn't strike any fear or authority like Darth Vader or the Emperor did from the original trilogy. This movie actually made me appreciate George Lucas even more for his creativity on the Episodes IV-VI because this new movie lacked that completely. 
3209,1,"unoriginal, predictable, stolen too many elements from the old films","Here be spoilers... I was tempted to do my own video review for this one, but what's the point... this guy pretty much nails it. Not a bad action movie, but a pretty poor Star Wars film. Despite the locations, vehicles and costumes, I came away feeling like I hadn't seen a Star Wars movie. I love Star Wars and everything that Lucas added to create those worlds... but I'm the first to admit that Lucas is a poor ""actor's"" director... the result has always been weak dialogue that is unconvincingly delivered. At best, the first six films only had 2 or 3 scenes each where the cast managed to add emotional weight to the plot. I have no doubt that the actors had far less to do with that problem than the writing, direction and editing... Star Wars has always suffered from ""school play"" performances. In fact, the only 2 actors in first six movies who were cable of delivering their lines regularly with any level of credulity were Guinness and McDiarmid (in episode VI). I think that if you could speak candidly to any of the cast who had a decent acting career at the time, they might express a similar view. I suppose that was one of the biggest let downs for me. Having broken away from Lucas, I expected to see a lot more weight and credibility in the dialogue and performances. Unfortunately not the case. This inevitably leads to the viewer not being emotionally committed to the characters and therefore indifferent to their fates. I don't think this is an issue of genre. I believe that a movie's being fantasy/adventure does not negate good performances. The LOTRs movies are a reasonably good example. Snoke? Aside from the name having far too many possible similitudes that would lead to nothing but derision, why didn't they actually have the character be a giant? General Hux's ""N"" rally ranting and raving was presumably supposed to be reminiscent of a certain well known dictator, but ended up being plain laughable. The idea of a soldier who becomes repelled by the violence he witnesses is a good plot mover and a firm scaffolding for character development (although not particularly innovative) but here it was just not convincing and as such, entirely wasted. I think I expected a whole lot more from Abrams. And what's with killing the most renowned actor in the cast in the first 5 minutes? Von Sydow could have added some real colour. He had all of about two and a half minutes in the Wolfman, but it was one of the most memorable moments of the entire film. The locations suffered massively from the lack of Lucas and his team. Dull and repetitive. Where was the planet where people live in symbiosis with giant spiders who weave hanging nests in which the inhabitants live? Where was the dried up lava planet whose surface is now black obsidian except for the odd lava pool... where the inhabitants live in dug-out naturally formed mushroom-shaped-bubbles of that dried up lava? Those are just a couple of ideas I sketched out with my son 2 minutes after watching the movie... surely the new team could have done better? The one location that offered promise, the planet that was entirely covered in little islands was sorely underutilised. I did enjoy seeing the Falcon parked up in different environments. Some of the Death Stary/Star Destroyery interiors were pretty faithful. The movie also has some great 3D environment camera work. Chewie's been to the hairdresser too. Many people I have worked with share the opinion that the 2nd movie, in each of the prior trilogies is the best of the three. Maybe that's the aim here... to quite deliberately make the 1st somewhat lacklustre, so that the next will shine? This director is certainly no stranger to good writing and character direction... so let's hope for the best. All this said, it's still worth going to see on the big screen... especially if you have kids who are too young to be anchored to the 1st two trilogies."
3210,5,Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens (Gripes Review),"It took me awhile, days in fact, of discomfort to realize how offended I was at the BS that was Star Wars: The Force Awakens. There is no story, no drama, nothing special and bizarrely poorly acted cameos by some surprising actors that want to turn criticism for their bad acting into deflections about 'body shaming' or some such bizarre defense against actual valid criticism. This movie is not about anything. It is a feeble attempt to squeeze one more dollar from a public that loved the original star wars but in a way that took about ten minutes to write and twenty minutes to film the actual acting. The guest cameos were so poor that I cannot believe any intelligent director did not cut them from day one and demand better. I know I expect a certain level of entertainment when I go to a film and this was so far below standards that I may never see another Lucusfilm production."
3211,2,"Offensively bad movie, Unworthy of one dollar let alone one billion dollars","As a Lifelong SW fan in my late 30's, I think I was as excited as any kid or any other fanboy on the face of the planet to see another SW big screen movie. There were several warring camps going in. Those who loved old Lucas and hated new Lucas, those who were excited for Disney and those who were completely against. I like all the films, and the TV's shows and the games big fan! I watched 'Awakens' for the third time last night, the first time on the small screen after 3-D and Vmax 2D at X-Mas. The music was there, John Williams is a genius and a legend of our times. The 'Millennium Falcon' was back, and a return of some old classic elements, but the universe that J.J and crew had brought to the table was flawed to the extreme. Both mired in the past and stagnant in the future it seemed like an ill-conceived premise to bring back the original cast 30 years in the future."
3212,4,Who elected J.J Abrams king of ALL universes?,"There are major failures but the biggest, the biggest is the casting, especially for the main roles:"
3213,1,The casting is simple catastrophe,"I want to write a quick spoiler-less review for those who still haven't seen the movie. In summary, eh. This movie is perfectly average, if it were a color, it would be beige."
3214,1,Spoiler-less review,"Firstly let me just take the opportunity to say that I have been a lifelong fan of Star Wars. Episodes IV-VI epitomised everything I wanted from a sci-fi film. I loved the feeling that when the X-wings pulled into the trench of the first Death Star a lot of the audience felt compelled to tilts their heads as well. I engaged with the characters. And then Mr Lucas started playing about with the films because the technology was better. Maybe it was but CGI dates pretty quickly and this was never more obvious than when episodes I-III came out, especially when CGI scenes are followed by live-action ones. I've played more realistic video games."
3215,5,Wait a minute...,"I was very much looking forward to this episode and feel bitterly let down. After the conclusion of the original trilogy the creators had the golden opportunity to come up with a story without the shackles they had when filming the prequel trilogy. And did they blow that chance. Yes, they did. I can't even imagine how. The villain(s) are not very intimidating, not particularly bright either, there is no tension or any real build up to an intense climax. The new characters are mediocre at best as are the actors that were chosen to play them. It is a tired attempt to involve some of the original cast, the writers could have honoured them with a decent story. Very very disappointed. The points I am giving are for the production, it was good to finally see a SW movie in 3D, so that is definitely worth 4 points. The rest is worth zero, hence the total of 4."
3216,4,A massive let-down,"I have given this movie such a low rating because when one goes to see a star wars movie one expects to see lightsabres and jedi wielding them. There is nothing original about blasters laser cannons or spaceships. The things that are unique to the star wars franchise are the force, the jedi (and sith) masters that wield it and the lightsabres they use to demonstrate their mastery. What did we get in this movie, lightsabres wielded by people who have never seen one before, a villain that my son could have beaten up with a baseball bat, and not a single jedi. Don't let the ratings fool you, this is a Disney princess movie set in the star wars movie and the worst thing about is that it isn't even complete, the princess has only just discovered she is a princess. Even the worst previous star wars movie the Phantom Menace is better than this because despite Jar Jar Binks it has two jedi plus a great villain who gives us the best fight sequence in a star wars movie to date. Save your money and buy a copy of the Old Empire video game it is much better than this latest addition to the franchise."
3217,1,A Disney princess movie masquerading as a star wars movie,"It has been 30 years since the destruction of the Death Star and the Empire. We are introduced to two new factions: The First Order and the Resistance. Our two heroes and main characters will find themselves to be interlinked between these factions and will fulfil their promising destinies. In doing so, they are introduced to figures both new and old, figuratively and literally. Who will triumph?"
3218,3,Return of the New Hope Strikes Back,"When I saw the trailer for the first, I was so exited! I expected a lot! And i'm a fan of the series! Revenge of the sith being my favorite. The first chance I got, me and the wife went to see it! When the lucasfilm logo appeared on the screen I sussht my wife and was making myself ready for a great cinema experience! after about 20 minutes I knew the movie was not at all what I expected, There's absolutely no talent in this film, the story is mediocre, the storytelling is bad, the character development fails to grasp you and pull you along, and it feels like your watching a scrap book pasted together by a bunch of 5 year olds. this movies has nothing to offer except a smaller amount on your bankaccount and thats exactly the reason this movie was made. It left me with the same feeling I had after the Hobbit, desolation of smaug, and Jurassic world, So if you relate to that, and you're a fan of the series, don't get your hopes up for this movie."
3219,2,"Star wars, for the brainless","Plain and simple a fraud of a movie! Spoiler alert!! The movie has two original ideas: - Luke is missing/must find him! - The bad guy is Han and Leia's son. The rest it is a rip-off from A New Hope, changing the gender from a few characters, replacing some droids, changing the size and the name of Death Star and Galactic Empire and voila a new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens. Nothing spectacular except some CGI. Bad writing, bad acting, bad filming, boring music. If you are a SW fan (as I am) instead of this fraud watch Star Wars Rebels cartoons series for original and refreshing ideas, good scripting and nice Star Wars adventures. The writing team for the animated series should have been used for the movie instead of J.J. Abrams and his team of franchise killers."
3220,1,Fraud,"There is a movie theater in town where seniors can see movies for four dollars before four p.m. I take advantage of that if there is a movie I am interested in. Today I decided to give the Star Wars movie a shot if it would not be too crowded. It wasn't. I cannot recall if I ever saw one of the movies in this series before. If, it was not in a movie theater and it did not have my full attention. Of course it was impossible over the decades not to know some of the characters and I was intrigued because Joseph Campbell, who I admired, thought that the Star War movies were outstanding. He was a friend of George Lucas. Well, I may have to get the DVDs of the old Star War movies to judge that, but this movie was not outstanding."
3221,1,This was my first Star Wars movie and there was no awakening for me,"It is a ""mockbuster"" type of a movie - hi-budget knockoff of Star Wars: New hope. It looks like something that ""The Asylum"" has made, with expensive CGI. Nothing new, same old story taken from the first Star Wars movie. New actors were added to replace guys behind Dart Vader, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Unoriginal plot that added nothing to the Star Wars universe. The bad guys weren't intimidating, just funny. Rey was disappointing. Ray is a simple character that becomes highly trained pilot and then a master Jedi, just in a few days or even hours. This is like Assassins Creed 12 or Rocky 14 would look like. The Force Awakens = A New Hope. This is just a reboot."
3222,3,Mockbuster with expensive CGI,"After all the hype around the.... 'new' star wars, new bad guys, new good guys, new light sabers, new weapons, new droids, new planets ... it really turned out to be new NOTHING. "
3223,2,2nd order?,**SPOILER ALERT** 
3224,3,"Been There, Done That **SPOILER ALERT**","I actually like the movie in general. The cast is good, the special effects are brilliant, the music is moving and the overall sense of high quality work is here. But. "
3225,5,Typical JJ Abrams but not the Star Wars at all,"There isn't much, if any redeeming value in this film. It's awful from start to finish; in that it is consistent. There is no point in getting into the contrived events that take place in this movie as they are not even its biggest flaw. "
3226,1,This is a really bad movie,"As others have pointed out (but not as many as I thought) this ultimately feels like a poor re-hash of the franchise. Tenuously continuing the story time line in the hope of keeping the original fan base on board, there is a hint of desperation. Unfortunately the plot is an amalgam of episodes IV - VI with bits and pieces of I - III thrown in (for bad measure). A lack of characterisation and narrative drive leaves you (or me at least) caring less than you should for new and familiar faces. Oh well I doubt, given this false step, that the enjoyment of the saga can only stay the same or deteriorate! Let's hope not"
3227,5,Major disappointment,"Let me start off by saying that this movie technically doesn't need to exist. In fact, there's not a single Star Wars movie outside of the original trilogy that needs to exist. The original unaltered Star Wars movies are timeless, stand-alone classics and no amount of prequels, television shows, or further sequels can ever take away from the awe inspiring glory and wonder that those three films brought to the world. That being said, Lucas seems to have a problem with leaving well-enough alone and Disney seems to have a problem with not owning everything in existence and so, here we are with the infamous prequel series and now this latest installment in the franchise which to me, serves as the most forgettable Star Wars movie to date. Complete with an unoriginal storyline that many have pointed out is LITERALLY a re-telling of Episode IV but with a female lead (and a black guy because...you know...social justice and whatnot). Without giving away any spoilers I will stand by this claim based on the fact that anyone who's seen Episode IV can literally pick out the similarities plot point by plot point throughout the entirety of this film. Whether this was an attempt to breath new life into and re-introduce a dying franchise back into mainstream acceptance by presenting a new take on the original storyline that can be better processed by the short attention span of the millennial generation, or a way to try and show that despite the amount of criticism and damage that has been done to the franchise by the almost unanimous hatred for the prequels and various animated TV shows that this series still has a fighting chance at becoming great again, one thing is certain; it's not interesting at all. In fact, say what you want about the prequels, but at least they tried to introduce a hint of originality and freshness into the franchise...albeit a tad unsuccessful to some, but at least they TRIED. On top of that, these new main characters who we've been presented with (with the exception of Fin who is by far the most fun and interesting person to watch in this movie) are completely bland, soulless, and devoid of any kind of the vigor or energy that should inspire the viewing audience to identify with them. It certainly doesn't help that the actors and actresses behind most of these characters are sub-par at best, and even Daisy Ridley's performance is pretty much interchangeable with that of Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games. Combine this with slow paced storytelling, effortless dialogue, and high levels of predictability and what we have here is an incredibly boring film. It's not all bad though, as with most of Abram's movies the action scenes are spectacular to watch and there's enough charming humor throughout the movie to keep one from completely losing interest. On top of that it certainly was a treat to see Harrison Ford back again and his performance is without a doubt the high point of this film, and there's plenty of other familiarity with the original series that if anything should satisfy those who considered the prequels to be far too foreign. Personally though, I just wish a little more effort was put into reviving the passion and wonder of the first three movies while ALSO introducing a new take on the story that could serve as a vantage point for an entirely new and refreshed anthology in the star wars series. Bottom line, I'm sure your eight year old will love this movie."
3228,5,It is what it is...and it's not very good.,"OK, let's start by stating the obvious: JJ Abrahams sucks. He ruined the Star Trek universe, he help script Armageddon (yikes)... He is one of the worst, mot generic Hollywood junk food pusher there is. George Lucas might have turned insane at some point, but he was a TERRIFIC filmmaker when he made Star Wars, and a true film scholar. The amount of creativity that went into making his original trilogy is perhaps still unsurpassed in film history. "
3229,2,Unimaginative ripoff of the original trilogy,SPOILERS AHEAD
3230,4,very very ordinary,"...until a time when a halfway decent writer, director, actors, costume designer, set builders and music composer can be found. This movie was made for check-your-brain-at-the-door millennial bed-wetters, not for the more sophisticated movie-goer. It is a nostalgia movie and nothing more. Had this movie not been associated with Star Wars, it would've bombed at the box office and received overwhelmingly negative reviews much more akin to the recent Fantastic 4 movie."
3231,3,"Dear God, put the force back to sleep...",(potential spoiler here) 
3232,2,"Would have given it an 8/10, but...","If special effects were the only criteria, I'd give it an 8! And isn't it unusual that all the first user-reviews are very negative! IMDb usually puts really positive ones on page 1? But... I expect 1. a story that I can follow without thinking wtf is going on now, so 0/2 2. I expect characters that I can recognize and know what they are doing, so 0/2 3. then there is the acting. Well with so much FX there is not much time or space for the actors to do much more than say the lines, mostly without real emotion, 1/2, then 4. are there any especially good scenes? na, 0/2 Nor memorable lines. Still, with a current rating average of 8.2, somebody must love it all."
3233,3,"men, guns, bang-bangs, HEY, this is WAR ain't it so",I went to the movie not expecting much and it managed to go past my small expectations and make it a very bad experience.
3234,1,Very disappointing rehash !,"Growing up with Star Wars adds some weirdness to critiquing it. For instance, I was of the generation too young to find Ewoks or Jar Jar Binks annoying, though I'm pretty sure I knew Jake Lloyd (had to look that up...) was a terrible actor, even for a 9-year-old. I loved all the movies I through VI. "
3235,4,The worst Star Wars. This is Episode IV except in 3D. Literally.,Having watched it again on DVD I now say with 100% certainty that this film is a total trash remake of episode 4. 
3236,1,I couldn't believe what I saw at first,I've registered to IMDb just so I could vent on how bad this movie was.
3237,4,Extremely Disappointing,I understand that Disney spent big time just to obtain the rights but please a nut-less monkey could have done a better job than J.J.
3238,1,Worst Star Wars ever,"This is DEFINITELY a modern retake of the SW franchise, but it does not really deserve to be called a movie. It is more like a SW ride at an amusement park where you get to go through the entire earlier movies at a super-speed/snail's pace."
3239,4,It's like a sprint through the gift shop,Easily the worst Star Wars movie in history! J.J. Abrams is a horrible director! I have no idea why Disney chose him as the person to ruin what could have been a great Star Wars movie. I went to the theater expecting much more and I was actually excited to see the movie. After about 20 minutes I begin to look at my watch. I just wanted to go home and get drunk. I was so depressed that I just spent 40 dollars on this garbage. The PC police probably forced the director to include a woman and and African American as lead characters. Even an overly effeminate villain also thanks to PC brigade. The movie was in no way a sequel it was a rebooted mix of the previous 6 star wars movies. My 10 year old jack Russel Terrier dog could have written a better script then the retarded writers that Disney hired. If you like wasting money go ahead and see this movie.
3240,1,I was looking at my watch just hoping it would be over...,Repeat same story line from previous episodes that consisting of the following
3241,1,Sponging on market profits since the last Star wars movie,"There are two ways to watch an action movie. Either one forgets about one's critical sense and simply enjoys action, settings, visual and sound effects, etc. (I wish I could do this.) To be fair, on most of these accounts ""Star Wars 7 - The Force Awakens"" (SW7) delivers, notably the beginning in the desert (for instance the fighter chase among the imperial ships graveyard) and the beautiful final sequence on the island."
3242,3,The farce awakens: artificial remake of previous Episodes,"This was used to further the ridiculous notion that since it's a new year this girl can show up all the Men in the movie. Ridiculous. It's all been said. This is not about Star Wars. This is about using Star Wars fame to further along feminist pig propaganda since they didn't create it in the first place, and want to try and take it over with unrealistic political views. Why was the main character a female acting like a male that seems to figure everything out faster than everyone else? I know it's a movie, and complete weak garbage, but there are questions. How did she retain her feminine hygiene and keep her hair and make-up done, but still act like a man? Must have used those instant Jedi powers HUH? Just saying. And the female Yoda too. Give me a break! The seventh movie and there is another one? And all the sudden it's female too? Why weren't they there before? Horrible, pathetic, and beyond repair. Really? Han Solo, the greatest character died like a feminine little wuss? A little girl can fly and repair his ship, yet Chewie just goes along when he finally reappears. What the big push is to make this girl appear so masculine is beyond me. I can only assume that we will discover that she was being controlled somehow, and if not this crap is definitely dead, but why a girl?"
3243,1,pc feminist monkey garbage,"This is like having a money tree. Can't you just see them sitting around drinking their lattes and smiling at each other, phones in hands watching their bank accounts fill up? Just imagine, every year they can release a new reboot-quil. J.J., how many are there? 6? Okay, five more to go, buddy. Bang up job taking Star Trek even further away from the point than the intro to Star Trek Enterprise did (it's been a looonngg rooooadddd. getting from there to here). There's no way you could muck up Star Wars. Ask George Lucas, he says it's basically Star Trek for kids without any science and just the fun stuff! Actually, don't ask George Lucas. We don't even want his input, I mean look at the Phantom Menace, what does he know about Star Wars anyway (""lolz,"" latte sip). Well, one sure-fire way to not muck up is to just do the same thing again! If it's already been done, do it again! And even if someone else has already cashed in and it's been redone? Do it again! So JJ, for Episode VIII (or V or maybe it'll be back to I for some reason), when you make the feature length trailer, we're gonna need a winter planet for these AT-AT walker toys. And in the short length trailer, we need a two second quick shot of a snow planet and a walker stepping down and an X wing flying past the camera. That X Wing will be on screen for at least 9 frames, so make sure you spend a few hundred grand on having them build a model."
3244,1,"""Are you kidding me?"" is what you will hear yourself saying aloud.","and his films painfully show this. His STAR TREK crew seem like seniors just out of high school. In TOS, they may have been the same age chronologically, but they SEEMED like adults, not teenagers wrangling a starship....half of them seem like they could be in pimple cream ads. It seems i must add more lines for the sake of it, even as i said what i needed to say. "
3245,1,JJ Abrams isn't exactly MENSA material...,"This was the most unemotional, fast-phased movie that made no sense. The company who used to create original movies which lasted for many years, they are now remaking them in order to drain money and destroy the creation of other people."
3246,4,Disney has turned to the dark side and destroyed Star Wars!,"Really? You are literally remaking Episode 4 again? I mean THAT was your groundbreaking idea?? Lets do a thought experiment. Lets imagine this appeared as a piece of fan fiction. Would anybody really bother reading it to the end? I wanted this to feel like the beginning of the third part of an epic saga. I didn't want to come out of the theater feeling like I'd seen a corporate reboot but what else where we ever going to get. Retro visuals, little to no imagination mixed with safe blockbuster tropes and lashings of puerile fan service."
3247,2,Sorry but this was worse than Hit-man and Fantastic Four,"No specific spoilers below, but some vague hints to the point that anyone familiar with the Star Wars franchise may get a rough idea of where things go in the movie."
3248,5,I've seen this before,"I just came from cinema,and felt the necessity of write some lines,because I felt insulted. That's the true."
3249,1,A sad remake,Just as I expected.
3250,1,Awful,"I've always been in the minority that liked I-III. Sure there were the gaffs like Jar-Jar, but on the whole they had a fascinating story to tell and didn't retread over old ground. You can quibble about how the tale of the Jedi, the origins of the Empire, the Storm Troopers, and the Emperor were told, but it was interesting to see all of this fleshed out. And the development of Annakin Skywalker was well conceived and far more believable than I suspect many of the critics could make it if they had a pen, paper, and a hundred years to write. And, now that I've seen Episode VII, I can confidently say that the best is behind us."
3251,3,Recycled Retreading Relived Remake,Watched this on 123 - so glad I didn't pay good money for the 'pleasure' My kids loved it - very worrying trend for someone who is trying to write scripts that have some underlying credible narrative. Unfortunately one cannot see where they go from here. Just as Episode 1 was a harbinger for another two dross films one cannot hold out much hope for what comes next in the series. 
3252,2,Shakespeare said it all,"I can only echo the negative reviews that have come before this one. I really looked forward to this film as all the right ingredients were there. A new director, the original cast, a huge budget, how did this go so wrong? "
3253,2,Epic Fail!!,JJ Abrams has been widely reported as saying that Star Wars was 'for boys' and something they shared with their dads. He has since tried to apologise for this statement and say that wasn't what he meant to say but after seeing this movie the fact that he doesn't understand female characters or how they work in this universe is blatantly obvious.
3254,1,Abrams doesn't understand how Star Wars works for women/girls,"I would like to start this review but saying that I have seen all the movies and have read almost every expanded universe book that has been written, something that I highly doubt J.J. Abrams has done. There weren't many things done right with this movie except that the graphics looked good and there was not an annoying Jar Jar Binks-like character. The major issues that I see are:"
3255,1,JJ Abrams ruined Star Wars and possibly the future of the franchise,"I put the spoiler alert... but there is little to spoil here. It's just something that should never have been filmed. It's my fault, a friend of mine warned me. And I remember I didn't care, ""it's Star Wars, I even enjoyed the I, II, III... When I see the logo and the music starts... they should really try very hard to ruin it for me. What can they do so bad?"" Well..."
3256,1,An abomination,The letter grade would be F.
3257,2,"Relatively hardcore fan, hated the movie","I fell for the hype,too bad. taught I was going to see something great. not.if you saw stars wars,well then you saw the new movie,or at least 80% of it. what a big let down,for star wars fans. I saw it free,and still felt like I needed to get my money back.the hype wins,too bad.i am sure they are hoping the new female star,will be the next Jennifer L.just cant see that happening. she was OK,not 5 stars at all. and all the hype about the stars returning,well mark Hamel is in it for maybe 90 seconds. and not one word from him is spoken.funny hoe all the reviews I have read,never say one word about how much of the movie is just like star wars."
3258,4,star wars the remake,"I never wrote a single review in this website before but some kind of moral obligation told me to let the world know about my opinion. I red 20+ pages of user reviews about this movie and not a single one was positive, not even close. So let me understand this...is IMDb working with Disney to buy some credibility about this mediocre work of cinema? It wasn't good and everybody are telling you this so how the holy heavens get such high score? It is pretty clear to me that Disney is powerful enough to buy everybody but this is above ridiculous! I'm not against J.J. Abrams in fact I thought the Star Trek reboot was a good show....but this? Boring and awful. People are right to say the prequels were slightly better because at least were trying to stay focus on the story. God only knows why with such incredible material they decided to make this movie so sloppy and boring. CGI doesn't count because even a video game can look perfect and be a disaster at the same time nowadays. I saw all the previous movies at least 5 times, included the prequels, but I really cannot play again this one one more time because it's above disappointment. And it's really ridiculous this kind of result."
3259,2,Let me understand this...,"It would of been nice if it was advertised correctly, as a remake of the original Star Wars film. But I guess they wouldn't of made as much money that way?"
3260,1,Remake of Episode IV,"Young folks out there: Once upon a time in Hollywood there was a superstar named Marlene Dietrich. She was born close to 1902 and died in 1992, having made her first confirmed film appearance in 1923 and her last in 1978. When she realized it was time to quit because of advancing years, she quit completely. From being one of the most photographed women in showbiz she went to never allowing another photo of her again, except once. She knew that by being photographed when no longer beautiful her legend would be diminished. I preface my opinion of The Force Awakens with that introduction because 38 years ago I remember the premiere of Star Wars; and how the cast appeared in it and the two sequels: young and attractive, with their images and personas sealed forever in epochal material: a combination and legend forever that only gained power with time. So now to provide a box office safety net, Disney drags out and dusts off the original trio of protagonists in Star Wars, problem being they're far from young anymore. In fact they are just plain old. Carrie Fisher has the wry, knowing look of a sagacious grandmother, as if she's letting the audience in on a joke -- that sexy thing she used to be is nowhere hinted at. Harrison Ford reminds me of Henry Fonda or John Wayne in westerns when they were collecting social security; and who'd ever think Mark Hamill in full beard under a Jedi hood would end up looking like Orson Welles? By appearing in this film they run the huge chance of diminishing their personas as at least 2 generations plus remember them. In terms of film immortality, this is a grave sin indeed. The film would have been better without them; memories of the past overwhelm here, and their appearance is sure to disappoint those who have followed the Star Wars saga since the beginning. Do we really want to be reminded how much we have aged, too?"
3261,2,Star Wars Nursing Home,"This film had so many problems, that the Sequel Trilogy now has the potential to make the Prequel Trilogy look like the Original Trilogy. "
3262,1,Awful Fan-Fic *SPOILERS*,"I've read a lot of reviews of the latest SW thing, and in many of them the authors cite feeling as if they had been transported back in time to when they first experienced the first SW movie when they were younger. It evoked nostalgic emotions."
3263,4,Nostalgic Emotions...,"You see, if there were no Episode 4, The New Hope, this one would be a great movie. But Episode 4 already exists and it is far better than this mockery. The Force Awakens is, in my opinion, just a lousy remake of the Episode 4. There are: 1. Tatooine (aka Jakku), Droid BB-8 with a mission (R2D2), the main protagonist who finds the droid and tries to reveal its secrets - Luke (aka Rey), there is another Death Star (aka Star Killer) though this time it is bigger, there is another Darth Vader (aka Kylo Ren) who is, however, not even closely a match to a real Sith Lord. There is an ugly Emperor Palpatine (aka leader Snoke) and even Jar Jar Binks (aka sweaty Finn). Jesus, we have already seen it. WHY, WHY this happened. Kylo Ren is a retard, a washed-up EMO mumbler, who looks like he's gonna cry in every scene. Ray should have his head cut in half, so we would see him only wearing mask in Episode 8. Only Han was great in this movie. Leia is too old in my opinion. The magic between them is lost. And only one man was still undoubtedly cool and powerful, it was Luke, however you will see him only for about two minutes in the movie. "
3264,2,This was just AWFUL!,Ugh. Here's what the 11 year old kids I took had to say about the movie:
3265,2,Non-stop pointless action. No new storyline.,"Fittingly, on the night when the Oscars were announced, I watched 'Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens' - except they don't award an Oscar for one of the worst movies ever made. The script was bad enough but the dialogue was some of the lamest I've ever experienced. The acting wasn't much better (with the exception of Harrison Ford, who'll be missing in the next episode) and, if there was a director (I know, it was J.J. Abrams), it was not apparent. It made episodes I & II look like masterpieces. Just putting in some characters from a franchise that used to be good is not enough to make a good movie but, sadly, seems to be all too common these days."
3266,1,One of the worst movies ever! (***minor spoiler alert***),"I just watched TFA and although I expected the ""Master of Clonation"" J.J.Abrams wouldn't have deviated from the original formula I remained shocked to see that as a matter of fact this movie is a carbon copy of Episode IV. In order here we have:"
3267,2,The copy of a copy: an empty shell with the shape of Episode IV,"I'm greatly disappointed with Star Wars 7. OK, they wanted the movie to pay tribute to the earlier ones, but there isn't a single new idea in the whole movie."
3268,5,Disney took no risks and got no soul,"God almighty, but this film is trash. It is an unbelievably, obscenely expensive mountain of malodorous tripe, with a stench of worthlessness that rebounds around the galaxy. Before this, I had only seen the first one, which I dismissed, as anyone with half a brain must, as just a noisy kids' movie - who cares, right? But now it has taken over the world, and someone must speak up to say that the emperor has no clothes and vile body odour."
3269,1,For a (dumb) pre-teen audience - whatever their biological age,"OK, so I was really looking forward to this movie after hearing some reviews from friends saying it was great.... well I have no idea what the hell movie they were watching."
3270,1,This was the worst star wars to date (even over the prequels),"I have seen this movie in the cinemas twice now and I think, it is time for me to review it. First of all, I have to say, it is a solid piece of science-fiction action cinema. They tapped into the Star Wars nostalgia very skillfully and I immediately felt like 10-year old boy again. J.J. Abrams and his crew seemed to have put a lot of effort into costume and scene design to make the whole movie look the way a Star Wars movie should look. The actors (as far as a layman like me can tell) did a proper job and the score, although not as compelling as the epic soundtrack to Episodes I-VI, was good."
3271,2,Very disappointing Star Wars sequel,"This reboot/remake was a let down right from the beginning.the character building was bad full of clichés, childish acting and is a far cry from the original movies.the plot is inconsistent and fails to engage you in any way.there are a couple of scenes which show hints of greatness but not because of the acting/dialogue but because of the CGI.the main protagonist in the climax just closes her eyes for a few seconds and learns how to control the force? And beats a trained warrior in a light saber battle!!I don't know how this movie is in the top 250.if the next installment in this franchise doesn't do something good it will be a huge disappointment for the long awaiting fans."
3272,2,"Force awakens ??? I had to wake myself up at the end of this corny,clichéd childish reboot/remake",*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
3273,2,A Poor Excuse for an Original Star Wars Squeal,"I am sorry, I can't believe anyone would rate this movie over say a 5. I actually have seen this movie twice. First of all the plot is a reboot of A NEw Hope, with different characters as the main antagonists, but pretty much the same beginning. A secret mission going awry on a desert planet with a droid carrying important info. Droid meets young person, who dreams of leaving said planet and ends up helping the droid find its master. Girl and droid are rescued, hook up with the rebels(Resistance), but the girl gets captured and sent to the new gigantic space station where she is interrogated by a masked Sith Lord.. Of course the said Resistance finds the same weakness as with the original space station and blows it up. Of course over the course of this we meet most of the main characters of the old trilogy, who are a rather hollow version of themselves. It seems only Harrison Ford showed up to actually act in this one. The acting minus Ford and the new girl Daisy Ridley is lame. They should have killed off Leia and had C-3P0 blown to bits. Special effects were pretty good, but CGI is pretty passé anymore. The new villain(Kylo Ren) is basically a mixed up EMO teenager, who throws temper tantrums like a spoiled brat. The girl Rey is basically a Mary Sue character t hat can do no wrong and never fail. With no knowledge or training in the Force she beats the trained Sith Lord Ren handily!!!!! Women's Lib at its finest!!!! It took Luke the entire original trilogy to be able to even stand up to Vader. With the plot totally unoriginal, dull, and rather predictable, with the overall lame acting, this film really was probably the most over-hyped movie out there. Even the great John Williams fumbled the football with this weak soundtrack score!!!!!! Definitely thumbs down!"
3274,3,Worst of the 7!!!!!!!,"One of my mentors, the late Bill Stock, once told me ""John there are two kinds of people in the world. There are carnies and there are marks. The purpose of carnies is to take money from marks. The purpose of marks is to give money to carnies. Always be a carny. Never be a mark."" "
3275,1,Lack of originality and planet sized plot holes,"The original Star Wars trilogy was such a success for a huge number of reasons. But for me it was how they made me feel when I was a kid. The magic that seemed to surround those films was truly something unique.George Lucas' imagination was brought to life through hours of painstaking work from hundreds of people who truly believed in the Star Wars project, and I think that somehow this comes across when watching those films. The characters feel like real people and because of this we are that much more immersed into the story and invested in its outcome. I can watch the originals today and they are still magical (particularly Empire). This is something that only a handful of films can do, Jaws and Alien spring immediately to mind. Anyway I will stop writing about things that you are most likely already aware of. I just wanted to let you know that I, like most of you would consider myself a real Star Wars fan. Now on to The Force Awakens."
3276,1,The end of a beloved franchise.,"It's a trap! The siths made this film for making us hate it, and turn to the dark side. "
3277,1,"It ruined SW, but don't hate it, because hate is the way to the dark side","Admittedly I've never been a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise, and when I went out to see The Force Awakens today, I kinda expected too see an overblown kid's movie wrapped in mind blowing CGI effects."
3278,2,"Lacks energy and charisma of first three films, numerous plot holes, not even a good children's movie.","I saw the first Star Wars movie when it premiered in the theatres; I was 24 years old at that time. I have always been a big science-fiction fan, and I consider the Star Wars series to be the best of science-fiction in the film media. The main reason for the success of the Star Wars series has been the guiding hand of George Lucas. In every episode, he created some stunning new world along with amazing creatures and thrilling action. As I feared, this impetus was lost when Lucas Films was acquired by Disney. The Force Awakens is an extremely good movie, but it lacks the imagination of Lucas; it lacks the element of the ""spectacular"" in its vision; and it lacks the intensity of the older movies in the action scenes. It is simply a rehash of old ideas. With Disney in control instead of George Lucas, Star Wars has now become nothing more than just another kid's show."
3279,5,"Star Wars: Big at the Box Office, but Declining in Quality",I cannot really review this movie without giving away the plot so will focus on the acting and theme.
3280,1,The Worst Sequel to the Series,"First off i want to start off by saying that i don't hate the prequels, in fact i thought that the prequels did a lot of good things (like expanding George Lucas's world and making it bigger and also creating a back story of the emperor and how anakin came to be Darth Vader) but i thought the acting was sub par and the dialogue could have been improved and cgi was an issue also. That being said all in all i enjoyed all 6 star wars movies because they were all unique in their own way and they always felt like star wars to me!!, but The FORCE AWAKENS falls short of this!!! I won't spoil this movie because there's nothing in this movie to spoil, Its an exact reboot of the originals except its not even as good!! going into this movie i knew it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but i didn't expect that this movie was going to copy and paste the plots of the original three movies. I also thought that the movie didn't make much sense, there were many plot holes that were not explained like the rise of the first order, why is the rebellion still resisting when they defeated the empire? And who is Rey?? why do we know nothing about the lead character in the film after an entire movie??????? and why is kylo ren named Ben if he is Leia and Han's son? in the extended universe there were 4 grandchildren of Vader, Ben Skywalker, Jaina solo,anakin solo and jacen solo who would turn to be Darth caedus. Or what about the lost armada? I feel like Disney destroyed the saga because it doesn't offer or expand anything new, and just reuses the same plot from the previous episodes!! anyways i don't feel like ranting anymore because there is nothing left to say other than this movie is a rehashed turd! IF YOU HATE THIS MOVIE LIKE MY COMMENT PLEASE!!! Also don't believe what rotten tomatoes and IMDb rate this film, its a terrible mindless movie."
3281,4,Disney should have used extended universe READ No DARTH CAEDUS?????,"This movie is a mix of a lot of things. It's probably a lot of fun if you are watching it without having watched the old movies or without being an actual fan of the Star Wars universe. The special effects I found to be very good, having watched it in IMAX 3d I gotta say it was an awesome viewing experience. That's about all that's good about it. It is entertaining. On the other hand there is so much that's bad with it, oh my God. To begin with, it doesn't feel like Star Wars. It's action scenes feel very different, like it's a totally different movie. The locations, everything just feels like a different sci-fi movie... The character development is just awful, or rather, nonexistent. Fin is just a coward basically who is ridiculously friendly judging by the fact that everyone he meets becomes his best friend right away. He just doesn't feel like he belongs there in any way and really is placed there just for diversity purposes. Han Solo and Chewbacca enter the scene out of nowhere, makes absolutely 0 sense that they would just happen to pass by, and then the gangsters they owe money to just happen to show up, making it clear that even though he was a general in the old movies he is now just a loser and a scoundrel again.... and then the way he is killed off, I mean, Han Solo was one of the main characters that made the originals amazing and I fell like they just completely disrespected the character. The chemistry between him and Leia is gone, he is just this eager to please old fella who instantly makes friends with everyone, it's just stupid. Everyone is making friends. The bad guy is a teenager with anger issues and a crap personality, the son of two of the most beloved characters in the trilogy is a spoiled brat who can barely kill a guy that just picked up a lightsaber and has no force powers or training whatsoever and gets his ass handed to him by a girl who also never picked up a lightsaber before, I mean, how much of a loser is this guy? The new emperor is CGI and looks like Golum... what else, the new empire is a ripoff of North Korea, with the winter scene and ""supreme leader""... The story is the exact remake of episode IV, it even has a new Death Star... it's just altogether bad. The script is filled with lines that are supposed to make you nostalgic but they just feel forced.... The jokes are not funny at all... it's just bad... bad... bad... Entertaining to watch but that's about it, bad story, unoriginal, bad script and also does away with a lot of the books and games that happen in the expanded universe, basically making all of them non canon and ruining them... a movie made to sell toys...."
3282,2,Very disappointed,REMAKE!!!
3283,1,We will always have Episode V,"In short, this could have been good, perhaps great in its own right as it has been over 30 years since ROTJ. It fell short on all fronts: character introduction, depth, development, empathy and purpose. Some veteran actors did well with what they could with what they had (remaining). Yet interactions of known characters were so short and shallow when passion was needed most. Every scene was quick and snappy with zero time for the viewer to soak in the world or situation, just pushed around to the next scene. Even panned shots and close- ups of vehicles were rushed and the fights predictable. I won't comment on the plot at all or the lack of story depth. This was only a sci-fi motion picture going through the motions. What you heard is true...all of it. A shame."
3284,4,"What you heard is true, all of it.","I am a huge Star Wars fan and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but now I wish I didn't."
3285,3,"If you like Star Wars, skip this one.","In a world where there are nuances and parodies of Star Wars everywhere from Spaceballs to Family Guy I would never have thought the franchise itself would fall victim to this trend. The similarities with A New Hope are endless but that's not what I'm going to write about. Star Wars always has an honest story to tell. This was more fan fiction than film yet even fan fiction can still be great. Some people don't understand that there's more to Star Wars than lightsabers and spaceships. The originals was a story about a revolution in a pirate themed sci-fi world with heavy Taoist philosophy and samurai. The prequels were sort of a cold war/medieval war blend, freedom vs fascism, and the originals being good vs evil. This film's themes were just so bland! I love a fun movie but in the end, it's completely worthless without proper context. "
3286,3,Fails to capture the imagination like the originals,"Having just arrived back from the cinema, I feel I must vent (or rather ""express"" my views) against this film."
3287,1,Unnecessary,"Predictable, lack of storyline, and does not compare to ep. 4-6. The effects were good and the backgrounds were cool is about the best I could say about this film. There are multiple scenes in this film that were so poorly executed that I was thinking WTF in my head. There will be ppl that rate this film highly and scorn others for denigrating this film - I've read the other low ratings of this film with spoilers and pretty much all of them are dead on what I thought of movie - a 2+ hour long movie that at its core it's creative objective is to ensure viewers are almost required to see episode 8 and go buy toys...lots of toys. I was disappointed in this film unfortunately b/c I so badly wanted this to be good - found myself making excuses for bad scenes in my head until it became undeniable of its lack of originality, creativity, and vision - the force is still sleeping :( ."
3288,3,Save your time and go watch episodes 4- 6 again,I watched IV-VI recently and they're a wonderful trilogy. Sometimes it's best just to leave things as they are and not try to cash in. The best minute of the film is the final one.
3289,4,Mediocre until the final 60 seconds.,This is my first review of a movie and I just had to put it out there. Guidelines on this site require that I put 10 lines of text in this review but to be honest I am not really sure this movie deserves that much. I do not know how critics came up with such high marks for this movie but scenario and characters felt like something that has no connection with the ideas established in the Star Wars universe from original trilogy. 
3290,1,End of the Star Wars for me...,"A simple benchmark for judging the merits of ""the film of the year"" is to ask yourself this question: if this film did not have almost 40 years of nostalgia-filled cultural context and cult following, would it be acclaimed as a cinematic masterpiece on its own merits? The answer is an obvious and resounding no. It has a vacuous and incoherent narrative arc, its characters are all tired old cultist clichés, the degree of repetitive ""oh no, they are going to die"" followed immediately by ""phew, they escaped"" is tiresome and the denouement or nearest thing to a climax offered by the film is straight out of the C-Grade sci-fi bottom drawer. Of course, if the question is: does this film have marvelous visual effects, then the answer is a qualified yes. Very good, but does not cut new ground. As the 16 year old in front me for the quick exit said ""could have made a better film myself""."
3291,5,Biggest marketing hoax of 2015,"Watching 'The Force Awakens' was like getting all excited looking forward to Christmas and then tearing the wrapping paper off your presents on Christmas morning to find the same old stuff from last year, instead of the giant lego set of the Millennium Falcon you really wanted. Let's go through all that stuff: Desert landscapes, snowy landscapes, forest landscapes: check. Strange aliens: check. Death Stars: check. Fanatical evil generals wearing weird peaked caps: check."
3292,5,The Force awoke briefly and went back to sleep,"I fail to see how this has an average of 8.7 when every review I have read for the last 3 pages is bad. This film bored me into the first 15 minutes. It is new hope all over again. The 'original cast' are brought together after 40 years, no, Luke is in it for 30 seconds right at the end, Leia steps of a ship and sits in front of a control screen for all of 3 scenes, C3PO and R2 are also in it for all of 2 scenes. Kilo Ren is the worst baddie in film history, Han was not his usual self either. One thing I would say is the CGI was good and not over done. it is just the story and the script which was a huge let down, the only reason this has smashed box office records is because it is Star Wars and everyone who is a fan would have wanted to see it. It has been over hyped and under played. I wont watch any of the other films especially considering a main character was killed off, this has killed the Star Wars dream for me! Gutted."
3293,3,Not Star Wars.,"The Force Awakens did something quite unique. It made me feel excitement, confusion, sadness, boredom and then ultimately disappointment, probably in that order. It started off great, a new cast who were all top notch (apart from shouting Nazi officer guy), a story filled with adventure and so many possibilities, all set in the Star Wars universe. What's not to like? And I must admit. The initial First Order attack, while it did feel like something from a TV show, was pretty good. Kylo Ren was shaping up to be a menacing villain and Poe and Finn were great new introductions. Rey too was pretty great and seeing the Falcon with Han and Chewie was a lot of fun. "
3294,4,Great first half then downhill. Recycled Star Wars.,"I was so pumped up about this movie looking at the reviews. This is the biggest disappointment in a long time, and we're completely deceived by the mass marketing, cattle thinking out there. The plot was a rehash but in a less believable way. Use of ""Force"" mostly absent and nonsensical. Fin and a few other characters are just ridiculous. I wish I would go see it again but with super low expectation and I'd laugh my head off. So many times I thought to myself that the scene or character's reaction didn't make any sense. How in the world can this be rated this high? Only positives: some gorgeous landscapes at the beginning in the desert. How did J J Abrams nail Star Trek so good and this one is so bad?"
3295,1,"Complete waste of time, how did they screw it up that bad?",Franchise killer JJ Abrams strikes again. 
3296,2,JJ Abrams does it again!,"First, let me point out what's good about the movie."
3297,5,Could be better,"Let's just say that when I went to the cinema I was expecting something totally different . When I watched the first ever Star Wars movie (a new hope) I was absolutely astonished, the characters were unbelievably unbelievable, the soundtrack made you you believe that you were in the film and the story-line was as if you were saying wow this is a good film and I want to watch on . This film changed my life and from then on I was forever induced in this film series . Now after I watched empire strikes back and return of the Jedi and the prequels (that I didn't feel really was a Star Wars trilogy) I thought the originals could smash the prequels at acting etc ... then in 2015 the new film was released ''the force awakens''. I was so exited I thought it was going to be even better than the originals because at that moment in time that year of film didn't wow me . I watched this movie and I thought it was OK and it was better than the prequels . Then I watched it again and I thought it was so embarrassing I might as well do this review . The characters were so boring !!!!!! How many times does Fin act as if he's out of breath . How many times does ray open her mouth for a sexual look to the audience . As the title of this review Disney are money makers and forever will be because they do not care . From the people my age (11) I only know three people who like the original trilogy because all the other kids my age love entertainment and don't go in-depth in the film . Isn't what that film means . The only reason people love this movie is because it's Star Wars, not of the acting, not of script but because it's Star Wars. If your reading this review look to films like raiders of the lost ark that have good characters etc the only reason I didn't give this a 1 is because I don't think every bad film deserves that of a bad score. Hopefully you understand what film means. Review by Fynn James Garry (age 11)"
3298,4,Disney doesn't know what the spirit of Star Wars is,"The movie is full of action and fun... but that is NOT what makes Star Wars special... This episode lacks any philosophical thoughts, criticism of politics, or religious metaphors. It is the end of Star Wars originality... Given the box office and the ""critics"" response, now Disney can forget for good about those elements, scrap any remaining intelligence and just rely on formula for the masses... And as noticed by many reviewers, this is practically a remake of Episode IV (Will the Empire -please- find another engineer for those Death Stars? One that avoids obvious weak points that can blow up the whole thing, and with the switches for the shields protected by password or something, instead of a lever on a remote corner?). Sorry, I am not looking forward for the next installment. So sad."
3299,5,The end of Star Wars intelligence: Now is just mass appeal,"Yes, JJ just spat out the first star wars movie."
3300,2,This not the movie to see...,"So I guess IMDb took some money to keep the rating high for this s#itty remake. What a s#itty world. You can trust no one. Only yourself. Make sure you realize that, or your life will always be one big S#IT! So now we are all going to wait for the next big lie. Episod 8, but we already know that it will be a remake of the Empire Strikes Back. And after another year at the end of Episode 9 Rey will probably stay strong at her last great battle vs Kylo Ren and she will bring him back to the light side of the force. And the ghosts of Luk, Ben Kenobi, Joda and Darth Vader will be watching them in rapture while the sun slowly sets over the s#itty copy/paste planet Endor. S#IT"
3301,1,IMDb shame on you!,That was a really awkward remake of episode IV.. with much worse characters and weak story. Sigh..
3302,4,When JJ ruins another movie series you used to like,"I was a big Star Wars fan some 30 years ago, in fact, for a long time, because of the original trilogy. Those parts were truly new and breathtakingly original and visually mind-blowing. The prequel trilogy's main problem was that it entirely depended on CGI which made it unbelievable, but in many respect was way more better than this new instalment. At least there was a new story. The Force Awakens succeeded where the prequel failed (CGI), I have to admit that, but the story is so bad, so-so bad, that it spoils every effort the filmmakers put in visually. The whole story is full of clichés from the original trilogy, in fact, feels like a badly cut version of that. The poor scavenger emerging as hero from the desert (not a farmer, but nonetheless a hardworking survivor with no parents on the horizon) the father's son turning bad guy (the reverse story of Darth Vader and Luke), a ""new emperor"" dark leader, a ""new Death Star"" etc, etc... The visuals, the scenes are not only similar but sometimes seem identical to the original trilogy's. Way too bad. Desert, desert town, town bar, the flagship, all the fighter ships, etc. All the way during the movie you have the feeling that ""yeah, yeah, I've seen it already"". "
3303,2,This is as bad as it gets,"First I will explain, I'm not a paid critic or fan boy or anything like that I just see some movies and give people a real review of a movie.Its mind blowing to see this movie is receiving ratings of 8 or 10 and people saying this is the best movie they have ever seen.The Star Wars Awaken movie has good visuals,but bad writing,bad story and to make thing worst, a very bad villain.The only thing JJ Abrams has done to the fooled masses is copy the same plot and story break up some of the exact moments in previous movies and tell the world he has directed and created a new Star Wars.I will ask only the few people in the world who have common sense.Why would a newly formed Empire or copy cat Empire i would say ,create another Death Star? This failed before, so someone will make a even bigger one that drains a sun and is bigger than a small galaxy?This is proof scripts in Hollywood are not edited or even looked over by high execs,or even story writers with great ideas with bringing a new experience to movie goers.I have never seen in my years of movies a main villain with power get man handled by weak regular characters.And as a result people around the world praising that this movie is the greatest thing that has ever been on a movie screen.The Star Wars Force Awakens movie is a Billion Dollar Fraud, it has fooled millions there are only a handful in this world it has not fooled."
3304,2,A Real Review of Star Wars The Force Awakens,this is my first review i watched this movie at cinema yesterday it really deserves a review I don't know what to say .. this movie is garbage .... i watched all
3305,1,Is this a joke ?? are you sure this is star wars movie ??,Note: There are only minor spoilers in this review.
3306,5,Not worth price of admission,"I'm not usually this critical about films but in recent years movies have had a tendency to pander to all audiences, and usually at the expense of the quality of the film. I'm not sure if this was meant to empower certain demographics, or if this was just a money grab (i.e. broader target audience), but the end result was predictable, unbelievable and almost laughable. All I saw throughout the movie was this ""hidden agenda"" in an otherwise simple and recycled plot."
3307,1,Sacrifices the story for a bigger audience,"This film gets a 4 rating only because of the special effects, which were terrific - some of the best I've ever seen, even the rather badly-named Supreme Leader Snoke. In terms of originality, plot, character and theme it fares less well. Parts of the movie are virtually the same as Star Wars (Episode IV). But I was prepared to give it a chance. The action in Act One was quite thrilling. But where the film fails the worst is in 2 places. Firstly, Rey is not sympathetic or believable. She got on my nerves because she knew how to do everything! Even Luke Skywalker started out by having to learn a few things. Rey is smug and angry and not very likable. Secondly, in Act Two the movie really fell apart. It felt like a cookie cutter plot hashed together from things people thought should be in a Star Wars movie, together with very cheesy moments whenever we met an old character, and some very forgettable new characters. I didn't buy any of these characters as real people. Even Harrison Ford's character felt like someone's impression of Han Solo. I loved the original trilogy but thought the prequels were lame. This latest edition came across as soulless, empty spectacle. An advertisement for a Star Wars movie. I was prepared for a disappointment, and I got one. Episode VII is sure to rake in the cash from hopeful moviegoers. But I doubt they'll be queuing around the block for Episode VIII."
3308,3,Disappointing,I walked out of the theater stunned and confused. With rave reviews and all the hype I thought this movie was going to be on the level of the original trilogy. Instead my childhood was destroyed before my very eyes. The prequels were bad but at least the didn't insult my intelligence by making an avengers style film with a star wars skin. Who would have thought I would have a new found appreciation for the prequels after walking out of this movie. That's how bad this movie was.
3309,1,God Awful,George Lucas would have never done that. He would have never killed Han Solo this way.
3310,1,What's next? Let's go kill Indiana Jones!,"We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm. "
3311,5,amazing return to the star wars universe,"Just to warn you, this whole review is one big long spoiler. So SPOILER ALERT!"
3312,3,A New Hope recycled,"In my opinion, this episode is created to capture kids and teenagers, not really for the old star war fans... so the story shouldn't be so complicated. Don't you see star war on kid's channels? That's where the company trying to position the movie. The big fail is the destroying of the death star scene..come on!!! even a 5th grade kid would have a better plot... there're so many ways to defeat the bad guy... why death star again and again. The CG should be better, seem like it's on a rush and behind schedule. Hopefully, at some point in the future of this sequel, they will have the will and select the right producer and director to make the movie great again. Not just for the money, you know."
3313,3,The reasons,Let's give this movie some credit. It was fun. It was pretty. There were some good humorous moments. And I can't help myself but be curious about two mystery characters (one being Luke Skywalker) and how they will play out in the next sequels.
3314,5,A typical JJ Abrams Exciting Disappointment,"One critic said the new Star Wars movie didn't have an original idea, not a single one. That was an understatement. Like that other overstuffed CGI Christmas pudding Avatar there isn't an original idea, image, bit of dialogue or anything else. Abrams and Michael Bay and Cameron and their ilk are mere studio contractors, pounding together obscenely unimaginative structures from the basest blueprints before blowing them up in a fireball of hype and noise. No art, just empty fury, signifying only box office."
3315,2,"JJ Abrams, I want my money back",Everything old is new again.
3316,3,Disney + Jar Jar Abrams = GARBAGE,"I bet the producers of this movie are now swimming in the rivers of cash very happy with the investment they made. And they have every right to do so. After all, they saw the opportunity and took it. "
3317,1,Money making machine..,"FA is rather a nostalgic clone than a continuation of the Saga. It brings back some of the old characters/actors, although mostly with the over-the-top feeling of a Comic Con convention, ""omg, is it him? is it her?"". It also brings back the cheesy atmosphere of 4-6, in opposition to the darker and more dramatic tone of 1-3 (which I had liked, because it gave more credibility to the dark side, making it scarier, and positively accentuating the contrast between good and evil). And it copy-pastes a LOT from the old trilogies. There is not much interesting here and definitely nothing innovative. Just a comfortably numb variation on the theme, which feels pleasantly familiar to some, but so familiar to be unexciting for those who were hoping in something new."
3318,3,The true attack of the clones.,"As far as I can tell, the planning stage for Force Awakens went something like this:"
3319,3,George Lucas is a sellout and J.J.M. Abrams is a cinematically illiterate toss monkey,"I will not spent more lines by criticizing the points that my colleagues here in reviews had already mention. It is an incredibly bad remake of the first movie, with the same plot, focusing on the public around 12 year old, to sell toys. This already had been said."
3320,1,Amazingly bad .: Spend your money on something else,"Saw 'The Force Awakens' yesterday and I have to say it left me...pretty underwhelmed. After six films I think I'm pretty Star Warsed out. Thematically it just seemed like a re-hash of Episodes IV and V, this new character 'Rey' being just another Luke Skywalker, a 'nobody', a scavenger on a desert-like planet that bears striking resemblance to Tatooine, who is unwittingly pulled into the whole saga by destiny. The story of the renegade Storm Trooper didn't really resonate as much as it could have. The whole relationship between Han Solo and this new villain: we've seen it before, nor did he seem very menacing to me, at all (not that I would want to be stuck in a room with him). Just like a lesser Darth Vader. As one reviewer mentioned as a stand-alone film, this seems like so many PG-13 action films we've seen. The plot was a bit predictable and clichéd at times, though the pacing wasn't too bad, but overall I didn't feel much suspense. It's like we'd seen it a hundred times before. I don't think the presence of the original three - now middle aged - really saves it. Little of the plot seems to follow much of the Star Wars post Return of the Jedi mythology that some fans might be familiar with, it just felt very disconnected. I haven't really been a Star Wars fan for years anyway, and if this is a third trilogy, I doubt I'll be watching the next if it's more of the same. Just my opinion, anyone else feel the same? Possibly, I have to say, the most lacklustre Star Wars film since the Phantom Menace actually."
3321,5,Underwhelming and a bit boring,"Money rule the world. And once again they win over the basic artistic decency. Despite my very average expectations, movie was even more dull. Force awakens is not even a new movie. They just reworked parts of the original trilogy and put new title over it. We have New Darth Vader, New Death Star(bigger and deathier), New Droid , new father-son conflict and that is it. For fans pleasure the even got Ford and Fisher taken out of mothballs, but all for nothing. They just look old and lost, and add nothing to the movie. Movie shows almost all the old characters but since there was no story for any of them, half of them have practically no lines!!! WTF? Can you be more lazy? The Force Awakens must have been created with single purpose, sell old story once again. Shame on you!"
3322,5,Meh,"I just want to say that I wish George Lukas was still in control of the Star Wars movies. I enjoyed ""all"" of the Star Wars movies except this one. "
3323,5,Expectations not met. Lack of originality. Illogical.,"Have I grown up, or is Abrams a regressed George Lucas? Episode VII is more Harry Potter than Star Wars, with Luke's Light saber calling out to its 'Rightful Heir', imitating Dumbledore's wand. And Rey turns into a Jedi not with training but by closing her eyes and calling out to the Force. Finn doesn't even need the Force. He just grabs a light saber and lashes out at Kylo Ren who for some reason is not using any'Force'."
3324,4,Space age Boy Wizards,"Haha... what a joke. The weakest star wars jet. The new BB-8 droid was the best part of the entire movie. No depth, only special effects and two main actors that does not make sense. Sorry, waste of time. My recommendation: Skip this one."
3325,3,Haha... what a joke,I went to this movie with such optimism and was left completely disappointed.
3326,1,"Help us Obi Wan Kenobi, You're our politically correct hope.","I have never written a review before, but I felt so much disappointed  after seeing episode VII, so couldn't stand my hand.  Episode VII was nothing but repeating episode IV 1:1 as follows: we  have new Darth Vader (guess who) we have new DeathStar (just bigger) we  have new wanna_be_a_jedi_knight... (guess who) we have new emperor  (guess who) the entire plot was repeating itself and there is nothing  more to say... I've really expected something new, something  promising.... something that made Star Wars a LEGEND!!!  Let's hope Episode VIII will bring everything this one didn't ...but  not just take my money!"
3327,1,"there is no more ""the force"", only the money...","The drinking of the Kool-Aid continues. I mean sure, the Force Awakens wasn't terrible and quite fun at times but it at best can be described as mediocre. As of now it has 95% on Rotten Tomatoes while films 1 and 2 only have 94%. Would the critics seriously have me believe that this film is better than Empire Strikes Back? "
3328,5,The Kool-Aid Returns,So Disappointed ! i just came back from the IMAX where after 1 hour watching this crappy remake of the n1 (which is the number IV in the 6logy)
3329,1,Seriously ?? i mean ....SERIOUSLY ?????,"technically this one hell of a ride, but the story is a mess. It gives the figures not enough room to breathe, the disappointing actors can't help either. And the cameos of the old three, well they should have been retired. It seems that too many producers had their fingers in this and wanted to include everything and please everyone, but in the end they failed. Yes, Tie-Fighters and Light-Sabers are everywhere, but the film doesn't connect me to the motivations of the protagonists and antagonists (they are laughable). George Lucas wasn't so good in directing actors either, but at least he had some good actors (McGregor, Guinness, Portman) and he didn't need to repeat himself in cameos. Its a bad remix of episode 4 that lacks rhythm and soul. Next time they should focus on one story and not try to tell three at once."
3330,3,"What a spectacle, what a mess","I went in watching The Force Awakens with extremely high hopes. For one I loved all 6 previous Star Wars movies and this film had all the ingredients for another good one. Kasdan writing the script, the John Williams score, a 200 million dollar budget back by Disney with the latest special effects, and the original cast we all love. My main 12 points of dislike for this movie are:"
3331,5,Disney Cash Grab That Offers Very Little To The Star Wars Saga,"I don't understand how this movie can get 8.2/10 with so many negative reviews... Anyway, just saw the movie and I just have one word for it: remake! We all have seen it in the first Star wars movies: a hidden map in a droid... a female running the lead (not Leia, but Rey this time), a huge killer weapon needs to be destroyed to save the resistance, dessert planet, a bar scene, son kills father who falls in a pitt... even the finals scenes where one pilot dives into a weak spot and destroys the weapon just in time... This whole movie is one hell of a disappointment. sure it makes money, sure it has space battles, X-wings and tie-fighters, but none of the magic of the first three movies, sorry but Star Wars is really dead to me!"
3332,2,remake and predictable,"The movie doesn't deserve 1 star, but I give it because I strongly believe that this movie is MUCH worse than Episode I, the phantom menace which has 6,5 stars."
3333,1,-Not a Star Wars Story-,"Many who will see this movie will not even have been born yet when Star Wars first hit the silver screen; so for those people the movie might be acceptable. But for those of us who witnessed the franchise at the beginning, it's hard to watch a rewarmed/rehashed movie plot that falls far short of the original. It's merely replacing the original cast, rewarming the plot (very weakly so), and then throwing in a VERY confusing and disjointed beginning that seemed to go on way too long."
3334,3,I'm so done with Star Wars,"Truly disappointing. Our family spent a significant amount to go see something new. It what we have always liked about Star Wars. Sadly, almost every concept and setting in this new movie can be traced back to something we have already seen. The film substituted action for new content. It was also hard to feel anything for the characters. It seemed like we were supposed to flywheel on what we had learned in the first six films and ignore how little went on interpersonally"
3335,3,Seen this one before,Empty.
3336,1,"Come back George, all is almost forgiven...","Every hardcore star wars fan knows for sure that ""the empire strikes back"" episode delivered the goods. The movie makers should by now have learned (they had plenty of time didn't they?) that people do love a good story and character development. None of this happened, even not in a galaxy far far away ... be it episode 4,6, 1-3 and now seven ..."
3337,3,Stupidity beyond the pale,"This review contains mild spoilers, but not major ones."
3338,2,"""Thank you.""",hooboy does this one leave an odor.
3339,4,"maybe on jakku it's an 8.2, on earth it's about a 4","I was so hyped for this one, really I have never been so excited for any sequel. As a kid who grew up on star wars and someone who holds the original trilogy in the highest regards, I was let down by force awakens. Kylo Ren is a whining emo version of Darth Vader, Han solo plays the ""kylo, I am your father"", Rey is a boring version of Luke. I could never bring myself to care for either Rey or Finn no matter how much I tried. Rey is able defeat a sith lord with no prior training in the force and use of lightsaber, black ex stormtrooper dude wielding a lightsaber. Looks like the art of using lightsaber and force training has been reduced to a joke now. They literally treat it like a sword!!! I can't help but feel the movie was trying to be part of the PC category. White female lead with a black and latino looking guy against all evil white men. Seriously, do the filmmakers think people don't understand what'g going on here? Why do they insist on tainting this franchise with the liberal PC movement going on these days? Can't put it down in words what a let down the movie was. This isn't the sequel the most legendary sci fi movie franchise deserved. The only saving grace for the movie was Han Solo and the appearance of Luke at the end. I am just heartbroken at the shameless butchery of my favorite movie franchise."
3340,1,Big disappointment,"First; Watching this movie in 3D was big mistake. Most of the scenes was originally 2D except few Space scenes. So why to wear uncomfortable 3D glasses for long hours and try to focus on to fast scenes? My eyes still crossed. Shooting of movie was not intended for 3D (near objects unfocused, no real 3D, fast scene switching even at amazing scenes etc.) "
3341,3,"Big disappointment as big as IMAX screen ""FAKE STAR WARS""","32 years later we finally get to see what happens after Return of The Jedi, and we get this movie... I'm gonna make this a little short and to the point. <.<"
3342,3,Extremely Disappointed,"Han Solo should not have been written off like this, being killed by his cowardly son. Darth Cardus in Legends was a way better villain and son to Han Solo and Leia than this unattractive, bad tempered fools."
3343,1,This movie sucks.,"I couldn't find more appropriate title for this review. As I walked out of the cinema, I just felt this strange kind of disappointment. It wasn't like I was watching a bad movie. This was different. Star Wars: The Force Awakens isn't a bad movie. It's just not a Star Wars movie."
3344,3,A very strange kind of disappointment.,Before I begin I have to say there are A LOT of spoilers here. It is because I have many things to comment on the plot.
3345,5,Abrams Does It Again,"The fact that this film has an 8,9 rating here and maintains a ridiculous 9,5 on another popular film-rating website shows that the critic community is corrupt. It's Disney, baby, not for nothing they have spent 4 bn on this franchise. What I have seen is a mediocre film, I have seen several much, much better sci-fi films, not to mention great films from other genres, which did not get such high ratings. This is a run-of-the-mill fare, typical of Abrams, who is a technically fluent craftsman but not a great director, not a film artist nor an auteur with artistic personality. A corporate hack, good at making movies to earn tons of money. He is another Michael Bay, though less talented, Bay at least has his own singular style and a certain cinematic swagger. I rate this a 3, and only for the sentimental value and for the overall effort. If great sci-fi films, like 2001: Space Odyssey, Bladerunner, Alien or Looper, deserve a rating of about 8 or higher, this simplistic and infantile story does not deserve more than a 3. If this gets a 9, Bladerunner deserves a 15, please. SW The Force has mediocre direction, infantile script, weak dialogues, mediocre acting, sterile action, mediocre photography and mediocre music. Shame on the film critics who rate it so high, I doubt their professional integrity."
3346,3,"a mediocre film, for nostalgic fans and children","Oh my what a stinker hard to tell what so many people saw in this especially if they grew up with the franchise(original was 5th grade for me). I wasn't happy with what Abrams did with Star Trek so I dreaded this quite a bit. While he didn't play fast and loose with Lucas universe he did nothing original and almost exclusively borrowed bits and pieces and cobbled them together from the old movies A bad Darth Vader clone, a bad Emperor clone, a bad death star clone, a weeble for a droid. The plot had no depth to it and although your in another time of the universe you get no back story on how this got where they are. The plot would have been far more interesting if it had revolved entirely around Luke Skywalker's disappearance and a mystery in finding him while more original villains thwart them. Yea Lucas's Phantom Menace was a stinker too but this first movie doesn't bode well for any to follow. Someone will put it on torrent don't bother to waste your time even stealing it."
3347,1,It's not even worth stealing via torrent,I was so excited to see this but my heart sank as soon as it started. 
3348,1,ripped the heart out of Star Wars,The Force Goes to sleep in this Disney/Abrams reboot marketing product.
3349,1,What a shame and lack of imagination,"This is Disney eating Episode IV, throwing it up and then we look at this vomit for 2h. "
3350,3,Felt my intelligence insulted all movie long.,"Until Star Wars: The Force Awakens came out, I used to trust some well known YouYube Reviewer's opinions. That all changed. How can you give it anything above mediocre is beyond me."
3351,2,Episode VII is not out yet - Prequels did it better,"You have all those millions of dollars , and you can not think of new ideas , but you must steal from past episodes.... i am disappointed....... If you need some new ideas , give me a call i have 1000 for free... Also casting for new bad guy is so bad... compared to Darth Vader he is a mama's boy... Do you think the good special effects make good movie... NO ... I was bored after 30 minutes of this film... This is my first review ...i write it because i must.... Don't get me wrong I don't think it's a one out of ten but it does not deserve to be ahead of films like the hateful eight and I feel bad for all the money Disney has managed to make for nothing original, I was looking forward to it, but was so disappointed"
3352,1,No new ideas...,"I considered the three prequels (episodes I through III) to be a step below the three original films. Well, now I consider episode VII to be several steps below both trilogies. It really made good even episode I, the weaker of the whole series... so far, because episode VII owns this well-earned right now."
3353,4,Just a remake... and a bad one,"This movie feels like an incredibly lazy piece of fan fiction, in which Rey has written herself in the ""New Hope""."
3354,4,How did this fan fiction get so highly rated?,"1. The things that Finn and Rey did in this movie were not consisted with how their characters were presented. For example, each one of them, when faced with a difficult situation, decided to LITERALLY run away. Minutes later, they were fighting the First Order with full ferocity. There was no character development as to why they suddenly stopped being whiny kids who want to run away, to the saviors of the new republic. People that literally run away like that don't randomly turn around to be heroes."
3355,3,Lack of character development and a poor comprehension of the star wars universe,"Saw an article with a list of 40 gaping plot holes, and I think that's about right. This movie survives no critical analysis, tho I wonder at times how objective I would be about the original if it came out today. There are too many to pull apart individually, and the lack of original thought in the script writing has been well covered."
3356,2,"The more I think about it, the less I like","I went to this movie because my guy wanted to see it, and I definitely am owed one big time!!! I don't know why the hype. This movie was terrible. There really is nothing more I can say, other than don't waste your time or money. Bad choice of actors, terrible attempt at humor and the story was all over the place. No real direction and no real great effects. Trust me, you will be waiting/wishing for it to end halfway through. I couldn't get past how terrible Princess Leia sounded and looked for her age..I get that people age, but geeze she sounded like an 80 yr old grandma who smokes 2 packs a day and looked to be the same age as Hans Solo ( which is not good considering he is 73 & she's only late 50's!) Take my advice, wait for redbox or if it comes to TNT or FX in a few years....you are not missing anything.."
3357,3,Don't buy into the hype!!,"I hate to be the one to point this out, but in the spirit of truth the movie is complete garbage. Once you get past the real sets and practical effects, the only thing done right, this movie is simply terrible. It has no depth at all. In the prequels with bad acting, terrible special effects and lack of real sets sucked yes, but at least they had a good story."
3358,5,"The Force Awakens, The Death of story driven Star Wars?","This was easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made, apart from the Star Wars Holiday Special. This film is an insult to Star Wars and that's mainly because, although I wouldn't have minded just a few nods to the other Star Wars films such as Darth Vader's helmet, the storyline is a rip-off of the Original Trilogy."
3359,2,Second worst Star Wars film,"It started with Marvel. Characters who simply make fun of bad guys, bad mouth them to their faces and destroy them without even trying. For some reason the audience ate this up and they've been making 10 Marvel movies every year using the same stupid formula. No tension, no connection with the characters, nothing to make me want to watch these movies, yet they are huge successes. Now this cancer has infected Star Wars, where no one respects the main villain, (why would they even follow him) the 'good' guys insult him to his face and he does nothing about it (he should have executed them on the spot). I really despise Marvel movies and this is what Star Wars has become. It's sad. I was expecting a Game of Thrones, where there are no real ""good"" and ""evil"" just motivations and people with depth and we can all decide who to like, but no, we have to have this garbage propaganda piece crammed down our throats. Other than this, the massive amount of holes in the plot are unforgivable. One of my favorite ones: a sanitation worker gets sent to kill people(why?) realizing he is not a killer, he decides to rescue our good guy and kill stormtroopers instead (which are real people now not clones)anyone else see how ridiculous it is for him to be against killing and then killing a bunch of poor brainwashed people? Oh, anyone else realize why they are making a spin off film about the rebels from episode 4? Just to have Darth Vader in it."
3360,1,Film making down the toilet,"Very minimal spoiler alert, but not very much. Let's start with the positive. Hmmm, well I tried. Oh- OK, the two new young lead actors are likable and have their hearts in the story. The problem with them is the same problem the movie has- there isn't much of a story. Also the action is exciting and entertaining, with a few pauses of a very basic story: boy meets girl, girl saves boy, boy saves girl, girl saves... aack! But I actually enjoyed watching the movie because it had enough twists and turns to make watching fun. Abrams did improve on the Star Trek hyper-action-no-personality-acting problem (found in ST) by allowing the two lead actors and Harrison Ford to talk enough to make them likable to the audience, unlike the plastic acting in ST. In short, the best news about this movie is that it is not the same degree of letdown as the new Star Trek movies (at least to me, but other reviews have said otherwise). "
3361,5,Death Star part deux meets Vader pert deux-action action action!!!,"This review DOES NOT contain any spoilers. So please don't downvote me just because my review is short or doesn't seem ""helpful""."
3362,1,"Why do I give this movie only a ""1""?",This Movie is the very definition of what over-hyping of a Director can do.
3363,3,Disappointing,"As a Star Wars fan I can only express my disappointment. Thank you Disney, for killing Star Wars. The writers were asleep on the job relying on old clichés and no originality. Boring! Shallow plot and dialogue. The casting was even worse which made everyone ill-suited for their roles accept Chewbacca. The directing and editing were horrible. The costumes were a joke. The leader of the empire had a hat that looked like it was fashioned out of vinyl-covered paper. Nazi flags hung in the background...how original. The new villain wore a kindergarten Halloween mask which served no apparent purpose. He revealed himself to be a wimpy version of Harry Potter's Snape character who had Daddy issues. Hardly scary! The lead actress was not believable having mystically acquired the ability of piloting every spaceship known to mankind without a plausible explanation. The lead male character ran around the whole film with his enormous mouth hanging open. His chubby, square frame made him wobble from side to side when he ran, which looked comical. He was better suited for a Shrek film. I was very happy to see more ethnic diversity in the film but they didn't need to recruit homely actors to prove their political correctness. Leia was so injected by Botox that she couldn't move her mouth which made her talk through clenched teeth the whole time. Sad, really sad."
3364,1,Great way to lose fans!,"I was totally expecting something awesome. Instead, I watched a regular ol' Saturday morning teen angst movie. Okay, it was great to see the original guys (where was Yoda?) but otherwise, who cares if Rey is in love with Finn? All the younger, newer, ones are young, almost teens themselves and totally cookie-cutter characters."
3365,3,Juvenile at best.,"I had been very busy but still excited after reading several positive reviews only to be disappointed at the cinema. Even telling myself and friends. Watch ""Star wars and die""."
3366,3,The Force is not strong in this Movie!,"Thankfully Harrison Ford had a significant role in this movie, he did his best to keep it interesting. Not too many positives, otherwise. The villain was a weak, immature kid...not someone to be frightened of."
3367,4,Same storyline as episode 4,Intro crawler & Star Wars fanfare. 
3368,3,"The Farce Awakens - ""I find your lack of vision... disturbing.""","Spoiler alert :I expected at least something better than all latest screw-ups such as Prometheus,Jupiter Ascending, the latest Superman etc etc - the list is too long . But alas the new SW-movie is a bummer.The main problem : a total lack of imagination and that's not the director's fault but the writers and moreover the producers. I'm trying to find stuff which I did not see before in Episode IV. X- wings check, Death star check, Darth Vader part II check,nice robot check, bar with band and scum check,Millennium Falcon check,Leila-Han Solo-Luke check, Rebel base check...and we can go on and on and on.Is it entertaining ? For me : very little. There are episodes from Star Trek Enterprise which are more interesting, darker,more twists,moving. I didn't care for any of the characters and what happened to them. Sorry , I did care for BB-8.Then I have a problem with some images which seemed to be rather grainy and a sound without any punch.The movie started rather well in fact and with good pace, but from the moment Han Solo came along it went down and was so so predictable. Leila's role was also better dropped. Bottomline : it's in fact part IV part II, predictable,lack of imagination. Two stars for BB-8."
3369,2,A new hope part II,"While Star wars has always has its fair share of coincidences/conveniences, this movie uses them at every turning point, completely ruining immersion as far as coherent story telling is concerned, some that stand out to me are: why is the starkiller base unguarded to such an extent that 3 people, without the use of any force powers can get in, why are there less than a dozen Stormtroopers around when literally 5 minutes earlier they had been ordered to scour the base for Ray, why did Finn happen to land within walking distance of Ray on the planet, why was Poe nowhere in sight when his jacket was close to the ship and Finn had landed so close to it(did he land there, and not bother to look for Finn?), how did Han Solo happen to be in the same system, and why did it so happen that the mercenaries showed up RIGHT on time so that Solo would be forced to leave with the protagonists? How did it happen that Ray can pilot, when that is uncorrelated with any of her scavenging activities? Why did the earth split exactly between Ray and Kylo, just on time to save Kylo? Why did R2 wake up just as they got blew up the new deathstar? Why was Luke's Lightsaber conveniently in some random cantina with a character we have never seen before? While the old star wars also shares some these, notice that the outcome of the scene doesn't change drastically in the old SW, while on this one the story depends on it. "
3370,5,Terrible Start,"Last night I and my son went to see the new Star Wars movie "" The Force Awakens"" Having been a Star Wars fan since 1977 when I saw the first one I expected the series to continue to be exciting along with a good story. Throughout the series I had some praise and some boo's for the saga. The first 3 movies were in my order Great, Good, OK then there was a lapse which brought on the next 3 in order of rating Boring, Snoring and finally ""YEAGH"" they got it right."
3371,1,"Can the ""FORCE"" get my money back?","You're a useless low-budget director and you have no taste or imagination when directing a science fiction movie, ESPECIALLY, Star Wars. Sadly the only exciting scene of the movie was its Trailer, and I must say you had me fooled. I can not believe that Star Wars is dead entirely as there are other directors who will have their chances at Star Wars. However, after seeing your ""directing effort"" (if that was your best effort) I am hoping other Directors will see your work and learn from your mistakes to prevent an almost total disastrous iconic pop-culture movie. Again, You're a useless low-budget director and you have no taste or imagination when directing a science fiction movie, ESPECIALLY, Star Wars.

However, after seeing your ""directing effort"" (if that was your best effort) I am hoping other Directors will see your work and learn from your mistakes to prevent an almost total disastrous iconic pop-culture movie."
3372,1,To the director mister abrams...,"What a crappy film, storyline: predictable, incoherent, stupid. Acting: well the type you expect from a low budget movie. Boring from start to finish. Already about 287 star wars books published which all do a pretty decent job of following the storyline. Than they decide to write this crap. The only thing making it even remotely look like a star wars film are an old relic from the original films and even more older relics some 80+ year old actors. "
3373,2,Hoping to cash out on name recognition only,"This episode made me appreciate the predecessors. I would watch them again and again but not this one. You can tell a movie was bad when you fall asleep or you don't remember the names of the characters which what happened. This was a movie about teenagers, not about Jedi, not about the Force, even not about the dark side."
3374,5,More like shattered dreams,"I could literally write a book about how bad this was. Way too many ideas and characters jammed into one film, and the one opportunity they had to bring the beloved characters together they didn't take."
3375,1,So cringe...,"How does this movie have an 8.4 rating? can't even understand it must be the the fan boys or fake reviews. lets start off I liked the original movies 1-6 even the prequels were OK except or Anakin in ep1 which I hated. I logged in just to review this POS film this is my first review. First off re watch ep4 and you can immediately tell they ripped the hell out of it. a droid with plans that the empire wants that a rebel has and another chosen one meets his mentor etc. not to mention Kylo Ren Someone trained by Luke and Snoke since he was a kid. someone who has destroyed Luke's apprentices when he was training a new generation of Jedi and scared him into hiding, just so happens to get his ass whooped by a non Jedi and a 0 experience force sensitive makes no sense. he also beat Rey multiple times with the force grab and push he just decides to forget that exists during the last battle. I had high hopes for this movie but come on this movie blows can't wait to see empire strikes back 2 I mean the first order retaliates."
3376,3,episode 4 remake with different characters,JJ Abrams evil genius here is delivering a narrative with the barest of details and then hoping the hardcore fan base does all the work filling in plot holes and gaps with over-elaborate explanations later.
3377,1,Cash in on Star Wars nostalgia with as little creative effort as possible.,"Now before I go on, let me just say that I am a huge Star Wars fan. I grew up with and enjoyed both trilogies (yes, both) and like a lot of fans have dedicated a rather sizable part of my life to the franchise. After all these years of waiting since the last movie, I was so excited to see the new Star Wars. In some ways, I'm still waiting for a new Star Wars."
3378,2,Really?,"I believe that people think this film is good because they have convinced themselves that it must be. Hardcore ""Star Wars"" fans are so in love with these characters that just seeing them interact with each other is enough to say the film is amazing. This film is far from amazing."
3379,4,All hype - no substance * warning spoilers,"Some say that there are only three original stories, some say five and some say seven. In the case of the Star Wars franchise this is patently NOT true; instead we get the same old story churned out seven times in seven progressively worse parodies of what was, in it's day, an original film. In this new version we have a somewhat badly drawn and remarkably underwhelming universe in which a bunch of hardly memorable characters set out to recreate a simple rewrite of most of episode IV - but with somewhat better special effects. To say that you could see what was coming from scene one is understating the utter predictability of the story, but perhaps Mr Abrams decided that predictability would magically make the characters readily recognisable, thereby eliminating the need for character development. This lack of character depth made it impossible to engage with them in any memorable way, it also made the romantic interest very uninteresting and highly unbelievable. Although it is a somewhat cringe-worthy production, it is just about watchable."
3380,4,A virtual scene by scene steal of episode IV but without the originality,--SPOILER ALERT----SPOILER ALERT-- --SPOILER ALERT-- --SPOILER ALERT--
3381,1,The Farce Awakens - Directed by Jar Jar Abrams // PC Stamped by Disney,"I give it a 4 maybe. I guess it was OK. But it was kind of like a remake of a new hope, but with boring heroes and a stupid whiney villain. The plot was okay, but like I said before it's exactly the same. There's a person on a desert planet, only a girl this time. The only differences that are between Tatooine and Jaku are their name and the fact that Tatooine has two suns and Jaku has only one. There's a droid (that this time around is extremely annoying) that holds valuable information. There's one leader that commands people around and wants to rule the galaxy. In the old movies, it was a terrifyingly great mixture of the voice, the makeup, and the feel of mystery in the scene. This time, however, we get this huge ugly CGI thing called ""Snoke."" Really? The Emperor sounds evil, mysterious. Snoke sounds like a mixture of snake and nose. They also have to blow up this one thing that is really easy to blow up. Apart from the parts that were exactly the same, the rest of the movie just ticked me off. The took the theory that you need years of Jedi training, ate it, pooped it out, and flushed it down the toilet. Also, the plot twist of Han Solo's death? I'mm going to be like Disney. Plot twist! I give it a 1. Overall I don't recommend this movie for anyone who likes Star Wars. But hey, a lot of people liked this movie. But a lot of people haven't even seen the original trilogy! That is crazy. That is sad. Sorry for any Star Wars fans that watched this movie. Honestly I'd rather watch the Phantom Menace. At least it was better than the holiday special. Not by much, though."
3382,5,"Please read, my feelings can't be contained in this summary","What a complete and utter waste of time and money, and a total erasure of the excitement I had to revisit and enjoy even part of the magic from my childhood experience."
3383,2,'The Force Awakens'. More like 'The Force is Ruined - Again'...,"That movie was made for only one purpose, sell, sell and sell. Massive lack of imagination. Just copied the Episode IV and changed the characters. Now all markets and shops are full of the new character. Disney and JJ seem more worried about merchandising that the movie itself. Now we have a introvert teenage with serious psychological problems who kill his father (looks like they found out the character on a newspaper chronicle) as Darth Vader. A girl who live on a dessert and find a robot with a hidden message, wow, what an explosion of imagination. The only new thing is that now everybody can understand the droid's language, so i can imagine it won't be a new C3PO. The Nazi way of the stormtroopers speech, the gangs chasing Solo, the storm-trooper using light-saber as a great Jedi. Everything pretty cheap and nonsense. Even star war video games have better script."
3384,1,Very disappointed,"Complete ripoff of New Hope. Full of corny jokes, bad acting, characters that are not relatable. Han dies in a way that is completely out of character. Full of plot holes and just generally bad story telling. Thanks for ruining a franchise that I have loved since I was six years old Disney. Your company is trash and Jar Jar Abrams, you are trash."
3385,1,Absolute garbage.,"I was so anxious to see this film being a lifelong fan of Star Wars. The more I read about it or seen interviews over quite a long period of time it seemed to just be plus after plus after plus. VII promised models and puppets and little CGI: AWESOME! VII boasted a freshly written screenplay steering clear of Lucas: AWESOME! VII will be helmed by J. J. Abrams: AWESOME! VII had a thrilling trailer: AWESOME! VII promised total respect to the most brilliant film series in history: AWESOME! VII will present to the new generation a brand new bunch of stars with Daisy Ridley seeming perfect for the lead: AWESOME! VII will grace us once again with the return of the original cast: AWESOME!.....VII promised, for me anyway, one of the most exciting trips to a theater I will ever remember....."
3386,2,"There has been an awakening, by the usher, because the movie put half the theater to sleep...","Firstly, this movie is truly awful and a disgrace to the name ""Star Wars."" The FARCE has definitely awakened! "
3387,3,"""Star Wars"" for a brainwashed Society","The story is an omnibus of Episodes IV, V, and VI. It has about 20 plot holes. All of the characters are shallow. Rey is a Mary Sue. FN contradicts himself throughout. Poe is a Gary Sue. Luke, Leia and Han have been stripped of their legendary status. The MacGuffin is derivative."
3388,1,The Force Awakens is the worst movie ever made.,What is so special about this movie.
3389,5,I do not understand the IMDb rating???,"While this obviously was not a terrible film, the problems it does have make the movie feel like it isn't Star Wars. It fixed all the problems with terrible writing and bad cgi from the prequels but it lost the one great thing it had, George Lucas. Although some people think George Lucas ruined the franchise, it is obvious that without him there is no star wars. In the originals and even in the prequels the storyline was brilliant, the sets were vast, beautiful, and imaginative. All of this was lacking in the new movie. It has light sabers, it had droids, it has the force and it even has characters from the old movies. What it was truly missing were all the things that made star wars star wars. The most important of those being George Lucas and his mind."
3390,1,No George Lucas means no creativity.,I honestly CANNOT believe that this movie has a current rating of 8.6 That is absolutely ridiculous. I created an account to review this movie because I felt so strongly about how trashy it was.
3391,1,Disappointing to say the least,"I kept hoping the story would somehow deviate from the first issued movie in the franchise, it may well have later in the film but I was already distracted by online Mah Jong and didn't pay close attention."
3392,2,I think I saw this in 1977,"Never a great fan, but always liked the visuals. But this this..... simply boring, could barely keep my eyes open, another death star, but a really big one, is blown up, another weird alien infested bar is seen, long and boring shots of old actors reprising 40 year old rolls. The one good thing is that the big visual scenes were beautiful, the wrecked desert bound space ship, the interior scenes where Solo is gutted by his son. The actor who plays the son is actually a really really good actor, kind of out of place for star wars, but something to comment on positively. I was glad to see that Carrie Fisher's diet and plastic surgery weren't too silly drastic. Can't for the life of me see why this movie is so freaking successful"
3393,2,is it plagiarism if you steal from your own stuff?,I am a mediocre Star Wars fan. This is not a hate review. But Ep VII really is not a good movie.
3394,1,Star Wars fan: Is it a sequel? A remake? A parody? Is this even Star Wars?,--Too Many Coincidences--
3395,3,Suspension of disbelief vanishes under the weight of too many flaws,"Everyone whom disliked the movie already described my feelings about it. Except, I will disagree with those that say they loved the first 45 minutes and disliked the rest. I thought the first part was too fast and development was lacking. I thought the second half had some jokes that hit their marks and even the realization of the force in our protagonist was at least interesting."
3396,5,It was OK,"and nothing more. They fed Disney's computer the basic parameters like 'we want to make money' and 'maximize shareholder investment' and 'sell a lot of merchandise' and this was spewed out. Next they wanted to find a director, someone who is Jewish obviously and has no vision, talent or integrity because doing a clone of someone's else work and focusing solely on making money and ignoring any artistic or logical sense would be key. Enter Jar Jar. The computer having spewed out that the hero has to be a gurl and the soldier has to be a black person were the sole variations allowed by the accounting department's computer (which didn't know that the troopers are clones - this computer is from Apple so has no DVD drive and didn't watch the previous films). I want to meet these people who claim they liked this mess of a film. Who are you?"
3397,2,wow this was an accounting computer generated bland money making scheme,"How you react to this movie depends on your need for instant gratification. If you like big-effects action to happen fast and keep happening, you'll love it. Unfortunately that's about the only thing that JJ Abrams has managed to do well. Everything else - and I do mean that - literally everything else has been botched. "
3398,3,A beloved franchise falls further,HA. 
3399,2,"Oh JJ, what have you done?","Under Disney ownership and with hacks such as JJ Abrams (with creative input from Simon Pegg...God help us) at the helm now, unfortunately Star Wars has been reduced to yet another Transformers/Marvel mindless action, zero plot franchise designed purely to reach the widest possible audience. The legacy of the iconic characters of the OT (particularly Luke) have been reduced to the point of them being almost unrecognizable losers. The previous six film story arc has been completely undermined to say the least and the mystique and nature of the Force simplified, dumbed down and instant."
3400,3,Entertaining but forgettable popcorn movie....horrendous Star Wars movie,"For one moment I had hoped that God stopped antagonizing me and that all the fakes and lunatics get felled now. But it is even better! In a genius stroke of how to save the Movie Industry a Star Wars Mastermind just did the most simple thing: He announced a new movie, which actually never existed, and hyped it until all the pirate pages were eager to go for it."
3401,1,The masterpiece of George Lucas,How is this movie ranking 8.6 on IMDb when majority of reviews are negative? How? 
3402,2,Outrageous! note: spoilers,Mary sue...<br /><br />She defeats kylo ren without any training
3403,4,Meh,"What makes this move an ultimate bore? - extremely weak plot, scenes built entirely from recycled material, ludicrously shallow characters, unimaginative execution? Or perhaps an overall feeling that the people at the helm of this business venture were extremely eager to deliver the ENTERTAINMENT and VALUE FOR MONEY and QUALITY and of course to target the right audience with an uttermost precision. "
3404,3,Utterly boring,One fan's nit-picking is another's death by a thousand cuts. 
3405,1,Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Cringe List,"Wow, has everybody been brainwashed or something? This is horribly bad, an absolute stinker of a Star Wars movie. I was expecting a new plot not a greatest hits mash-up featuring variety show style cameos. The acting is absolutely diabolical, especially from Ford and Fisher who dial it in like never before for a last fat payday. Many of the worst scenes are written simply to get one of the old lines in like ""I got a bad feeling about this"". The film lifts all the audio and visual cues from the first movie and merely shifts the generation up a notch, Luke is set to become Yoda, Han is Obi Wan, there's even a giant, planet destroying space station with a weak point to destroy. Anybody hoping the Jar Jar factor has been eliminated is in for a rude awakening, that stupid BB8 robot dominates the whole film. The concept that the latest merchandising craze should be a sphere with a sphere on top (ball + ball = BB and the eight shape = 8) and the fact that they are selling this tat hand over fist says more about the people buying it and this film than the people flogging it to them. Brainless, weak and lazy and before anybody asks what I expected from a Star Wars film then the answer is I WAS expecting a new plot or why bother with all the secrecy. This should be The Star Wars Christmas Special 2, it's on the same level."
3406,1,What a piece of junk,"I was really hyped for this movie. The trailer was awesome, it captured the atmosphere of the ROTJ-Aftermath perfectly (mighty Star Destroyer wrecks lay in sand dunes). And after seeing the masked villain and the light sabers my imagination went off ... I thought, well, there are still some Sith sprinkled throughout the galaxy and they form a terrorist group which attacks the new established republic. There would be questions about who the leader of this group is and what they want to achieve. I thought of a Republican army which gets somehow undercut by a malicious figure. I thought of Han and Leia living a peaceful life in retirement but getting involved in the handling of the terrorist threat. I thought of Luke leading a Jedi academy. I thought of Lando educating young pilots. I thought that those beloved characters meet after a long time to support the Republic. I thought ... and then I watched TFA and everything went down the kitchen sink."
3407,2,So this is how creativity dies ... with thunderous applause,Leia. 
3408,4,One thing to change it whole,"I grew up watching Star Wars as an 11 year old in 1977, so my middle aged generation of Star Wars fans are far from being over the hill or out of touch when rating this awful hyped up rehash of a politically correct, violent, badly scripted, poorly executed mess of a film created to entice the millennials to buy some Star Wars action toys."
3409,1,"You are warned, this one's not for the fans",I am so disappointed with the new Star Wars. So disappointed in fact that I was actually a bit sad. This movie is a typical big budget Hollywood film who enormous unrealistic plot holes. Literally no character development of new ideas. 
3410,3,I am so disappointed :(,"I must admit, I watched the first one in France when I was 9 in 1978 (France had to wait 1 year to get it) at The GRAND REX in Paris: GIANT screen, an amazing painted roof full of little stars on a dark night... the historic seventh art movie theater of Paris. So, yes, now for the young fanatics, I am part of the ""old farts"". "
3411,4,Like a Big Mac.... sounds great until you ate it.,"Estafa, fraude, fraud, scam, cheat, copy etc. It's only a reboot of IV V & VI episodes, made it to accomplish standards of U.N. & Human rights in 2016. Boyega's acting it's very superficial, and lacks the cliché of black actors comic movies characters ""attitude"". He always broke all the possibilities of realism in the movie. Entire movie and Disney's commercial urges delivers a big, enormous historic failure in the industry, if star wars was buried or almost dying J.J. Abrams take a jump to a infinite black hole well. I felt every minute: this is bad, this is bad, this is bad, and the sensation continues outside the cinema. At first I give 5 of 10 stars because I think like 50% of work was done but I'm realize the work it's only marketing, publishing and create noise and expectation. The result it's similar when you discover the fraud in small typo."
3412,1,Nooooo!!!!,It's time for Hollywood to stop living in the past. What a horrible movie. The plot was almost identical to the original only watered down and so boring I almost nodded off twice.
3413,2,A Great Cure for Insomnia,"J.J. Abrams... the man who gave us and surprised us (from time to time) with many highly entertaining and high-voltage action drama films and TV series... Here he came with the new ""Star Wars"". Yup, the man who also brought us new ""Star Trek"" (but, we are not here to talk about that). Now, honestly, J.J. Abrams has some of pretty good films, but most of them are pretty average. And sad to say... so is this film. Not only that he was set as a director and a writer, but we also have a return of Lawrence Kasdan as a writer and producer. And, to mention that Kathleen Kennedy is also there as a leading producer... but the main distributor is Disney. So, this is a high budget film that will come from very powerful movie corporations well known for their... toys and merchandise. I'll warn you for spoilers."
3414,3,"Just a piece of a nostalgic references. Yet, there's something else...",I guess I'm in the minority here and yes I enjoyed it for the most part (though probably mainly for nostalgic reasons) but it was tough to really lose myself in the film as I felt I'd been there before. 
3415,5,Re-Hash of the Jedi,"I couldn't believe my eyes, they just ran out of ideas, and repeated THe same story!"
3416,3,"Great PR, Made a lot of money but very disappointing movie","I saw TFA in 3D opening night and left feeling shocked. I didn't really believe what I just witnessed. So I went back a few days later again and watched it in IMAX 3D thinking I must have missed something. Well I didn't. I've since also read the TFA book and it only expands the story slightly, but basically goes hand in hand with the movie, with slight differences. The problem with this story is there is no emotional attachment to draw the audience in. When you watched episodes 4-6 you could feel that emotional attachment. Just think back to when the first teaser trailer came out for TFA, did you get so excited that you shed a tear?....:) Even the prequels had some of that feeling too, as long as ""Ani"" wasn't on screen whining about something...:) But the prequels had a great story, which I think a lot of people missed due to bad acting or whatever, and that was the story of how Darth Vader came to be."
3417,5,"A poor story leads to a poor movie, such a disappointment.","I am glad I am not insane and just lost my mind because people I know and people that are huge star wars fans are raving about this movie and I can't help but be like WTH did we just watch the same movie. First there are a few good things about this movie so I am not totally dogging it but over all this movie was a huge disappointment of mega proportions. Where the heck do I begin. Lets start with the camera work. Everything was so close up I felt like I was watching the whole movie through a telescope. Like things needed to be zoomed in to hide things, very amateur feel to it. Kinda like I was watching the first Hunger Games only without the shaky camera motion all the time. Characters lets see the storm trooper turned good guy was very lack luster kinda felt like he was just along for the ride and his character was never developed to the point someone might feel attached to him that he even mattered to the story. When he battled Kylo in the end and it looked like he may have been killed there wasn't one bit of attachment felt. He could have been killed off and it wouldn't have made any difference. Kylo wow this character was a complete and total let down. At first before he took his mask off he had potential. After he took his mask of that went right out the window any chance him being seen as a villain to be feared just shattered. The actor choice for this part was a complete and utter travesty the dialog was horrid. He wasn't some ominous evil presence any more he was just a spoiled baby in need of a good spanking. I'm not all that upset that Han Solo was killed off. Sure it sucks but what sucks even more is that he basically died for nothing really it didn't help make Kylo a real villain. Han died for no real good reason in a lame story remake / remix or whatever you want to call it. The new ""Empire"" pion leaders honestly projected more leadership and aura of fear than Kylo did. I mean seriously if the pion leaders in the old Empire had acted the way toward Vader the way the new ones did toward Kylo, Vader would have squashed them like a bug. Kylo was just all around sad and pathetic. Leia it was so sad to see her this way. You could really tell that Carrie Fisher was extremely rusty with the whole acting thing. Now on to the story. Droid escapes empire with life or death information only to crash on a desert planet and hookup with a desert bumpkin who must now get the droid safely to the Rebels so that they can destroy a massive weapon with the ability to destroy planets. Wait a minute I know I have heard this story somewhere before I just can't put my finger on it. It was sorta like a bad deja vu on an acid trip. So what was good? Rey was awesome, Chewie, Han, R2, and 3PO, and seeing Luke in the end even though he didn't say one word."
3418,3,Extremely Disappointed but expected from Disney (contains spoilers),"I saw the movie and it was OK, but definitely not what I was expecting after all of the rave reviews. I think these reviews came from people who never saw the previous movies? I was very disappointed with how the movie flowed. "
3419,4,Not the rave as touted,"After reading through a number of User Reviews, there is obviously no middle ground -- a vast majority of 1's and 2's, and a few die-hard defenders clocking-in at 9 or 10. I can argue a ""3"" but have no idea how anyone can seriously consider this effort memorable unless one is employed by the studio."
3420,2,"Some entertaining moments, but ultimately unsatisfying hash","We saw the movie yesterday. We got geared up to see The Force by watching the 3 originals in the series, and the first Chris Pine Star Trek which we really like (also by JJA). We were ready."
3421,4,Quite Disappointed,"The Force Awakens was held down by the objective of introducing new characters (many of them unnecessary) and leaving many unanswered plot elements with the seeming intention to expand the series sidewards through spin-offs. It banks on nostalgia by bringing back many of the old players and themes, but too often mishandles the talent and material on hand, respectively."
3422,3,Star Wars this wasn't,"THIS IS THE HIGHEST GROSSING MOVIE!?!? *spoilers*** One half of the cast is so old that they can't act anymore, the other half is so young they haven't learned HOW to act yet and all they create are 2 dimensional characters, IN A 3D MOVIE!!! the dialogue was full of clunky exposition, every scene with the old actors was cringe-worthy. the scene with kylo ren and han solo on the bridge was the strangest thing I've ever seen, it looked like it was out of a high school film class. PLEASE raise your hand if you honestly didn't know EXACTLY what was going to happen as soon as he went on the bridge the main villain was about as intimidating as my grandma, and every time something went wrong he just threw a hissy fit. the older generation got darth freaking vader, and we get this whiny weasel the visuals were so boring and uninspired, the action scenes looked like EVERY OTHER MOVIE, you could literally take scenes from star trek instead and no one could tell the difference. EVERY EMOTIONAL SCENE, whether it was kylo ren and even Luke skywalker at the end, IT SHOWED THEIR BLANK FACE FOR 10 GOD DAMN SECONDS!!! PEOPLE IN MY THEATRE WERE CRACKING UP!!! and THE WORST OF THE WORST was the final CLIMACTIC BATTLE! apparently in order to overcome kylo rens LIFETIME of training, all the main character needed to do was close her eyes AND TAKE A FUDGING NAP, and suddenly she is now fully trained."
3423,1,"GOD, what a LAME, STUPID, pointless action movie","I really don't get the over 8 stars rating for this waste of money, celluoid, talent and last but not least my rare free time. Besides the fact that J.J. already ruined another beloved Sci-Fi-Franchise for me I was willing to give him a shot at redemption with his take on the first part of a new trilogy. I have never been so disappointed before. First of all he serves an unoriginal and illogical with plot holes bigger than the Grand Canyon itself. I had hoped for a emotional ride reminiscent of the original first trilogy but unfortunately the whole cast acted as if they were refrigerators as nobody had any chemistry with each other. Not even Carrie Fisher and my childhood hero Han Solo aka Harrison Ford. And to top all that off, Abrams had to kill off the character I was so looking forward to watch again. No explanation, no emotions, not even a funeral. Complete garbage. I'm not gonna spend another dime on any product out of this universe. 3 out of 10 for the sfx work. Enough said."
3424,3,"You did it, J.J. ... You have ruined Star Wars for me ...","Everyone had high expectations for the ""new"" Star Wars. As a fan of SciFi in general, of space exploration and fantasy, I was excited to read spoiler free reviews that praised this film. I actually enjoyed the prequels, so I went with an open mind. The end result left me with a bitter taste of disappointment. Of course it is not a 1/10 as many other user reviews suggest, but I really cannot believe I saw the same film as all those who praise this as one of the best films ever. Adding everything up it is average at best."
3425,2,Disappointing rehash / nostalgia exploit with some good stuff,Err Sorry The Force Awakens. There will be a rant and then a review by an amateur about the film (go easy on me) I sound crazy but I just want to watch an enriching space opera. Is that so much to ask?
3426,3,Star Wars Episode VII I Mean IV.2 The Gender Politics Awakens,"Does it feel like Star Wars? No. Wonder what Star Wars would look like fast paced & gritty with hard colour grading, editing, & angle shots? You know, like Star Wars fan films? It's filmed in JJ style. Lucas used mostly flat & face shots. Yes it's static way of filming, but it is also a very classic way. It lets you focus on the richness of the scene. Everything was so streamlined in Force Awakens that it felt like a cheap 3D amusement park ride. "
3427,2,Anne of Green Gables in Space,"5 years? Really? They work on this piece of crap 5 years? I am very happy that i lost only 2 and 1/2 hours from my life. We must think to the poor peoples who lose 5 years from their lifes, to create this.. I don't even have a name for this movie. I was a big fan of Star War series. Not anymore. I cannot imagine how a movie can be so bad!! And i am just amaze on how much money they did with this junk. George Lucas, i accept your apologies. When you ask for. You kill Indiana Jones, now you kill Star Wars. Thank you very much for your great work."
3428,1,Losing my money and my precious time.,"I'm a great Star Wars fan but this was complete let down of seeing reboot of A New Hope and pieces of Empire Strikes Back. There is nothing new in this not even one fresh idea. The people that shine from this mediocre movie is Harrison Ford and Daisy Ridley, if they didn't put the rest of the cast in the next movie you wouldn't miss them.""Spoiler Here"""
3429,5,The Force is fast asleep,"Dearest Star Wars fans,"
3430,3,Did we wait all these years for this????,"Star Wars was totally destroyed by ""greed-for-money empire"" Disney and ""simple‐minded kid"" JarJar Abrams."
3431,1,R.I.P. Star Wars 1977-1983,Here is a list of why this movie blows and why it didn't feel like Star Wars.
3432,2,Did not feel like Star Wars,The latest Star Wars flick is the worst in the series. 
3433,4,Worst film in the series!,"Short version: at some point I actually started laughing... and not because it was funny. Up until today Episode 1 was the worst one, now it's miles away from episode 7."
3434,2,The worst episode ever,"This would have been one of the best Star Wars movies ever...if Episode IV did not exist. The plot is pretty much the same; I can't think of a single original element in the plot. Even the planets shown are copies from Episode IV and Episode V. The Prequels may be bad but at least it had an original story; the prequels had done quite well considering the outcomes were already decided before. But Episode VII had full freedom to steer it's plot in any direction but instead sadly they just decided to make an Episode IV clone to appeal to nostalgia and milk the cash cow. However, unlike episode IV the stakes weren't very high- the heroes' plans worked out more or less without a hitch. The new characters were highly unrealistic and the old ones are forced into the story. Rey is a mary-sue who is extremely good with machines; is able to understand droid language;can even understand wookie language even though wookies don't live in Jakku;is an ace- pilot who knows the Millennium Falcon better than even Han Solo himself and can use the force better than a fully trained Jedi without any Jedi training. Finn is a controversial character who refuses to kill for the First Order but is fully ready to kill his Stormtrooper brothers without any hesitation and remorse for the Resistance. Kylo Ren becomes an emo punk the second his mask comes off...This movie has stunning visuals and this is perhaps the only redeeming quality about the movie. The plot and characters however are grossly horrible. The dialogues were atrociously juvenile- ""Do you have a boyfriend, a cute boyfriend?"" and ""Who talks first? Do you talk first or do I talk first?"" are examples of cheesy dialogues scattered throughout the movie. Unless you didn't ever watch episode IV I don't believe you should watch this unoriginal trash.(This movie doesn't actually deserve 2 star, maybe 4 or 5, but the ratings have to be balanced)"
3435,2,A Horrible Rehash,"I have just seen The Force Awakens. The rating says its 8.5 on IMDb. There's no way in the world that this movie comes even close to that score . Maybe 8.5 out of 100 or staff at Disney or George Lucas' friends are busy clicking on the ratings. It was pure crap. As a Star Wars fan who grew up in the 70's as a kid , watching the original trilogies , it is an insult to all real Star Wars fans. I'm not sure if JJ Abrams or George Lucas of it Mickey Mouse wrote the script and directed it. Pathetic is a kind word to describe the lack of plot and originality . Save your money and wait for it to go straight to TV. I'd rather pay to watch episodes of Game of Thrones at the movie theatre ( which has credible plot and despite all the blood and guts and sex has terrific acting ) than this nonsensical mashed up version . I think George should cash in his cheque and maybe donate some of it to the writers guild and get some help . As for the director , he couldn't direct traffic . Put it this way , when the movie ended and the credits were rolling up on the screen, most of the audience stayed to see if they missed something because it couldn't have possibly ended in the way it did. The only thing that was missing from Luke Skywalker in the final scene was a fishing rod as he was staring out to see.... Probably staring into acting oblivion ... Avoid it....."
3436,2,Plot written by a stunt co-ordinator,This is my first every review of a movie and I had a look at the other movies this is rated near. Schindlers list only got 8.9 and this is getting 8.6 are people nuts? Anyone giving this more than a 5 must be a fanboy that will like anything with a Star Wars logo on it. 
3437,1,The Force jumped the shark,"There are too many reviews, already on Youtube, which pretty much summarize all that's wrong with The force awakens, one of the best might be one that's called something like ""how the force awakens sucks or how I learned to stop worrying and love the phantom menace"". "
3438,2,SPOILERS and what you shouldn't watch to avoid accidental spoilers,This film looks good but the story just falls flat and the editing in uneven.
3439,5,You can't make up for the lack of story and plot.,"I came into this movie with a lot of excitement and hype December of 2015. Once the movie concluded, it all came to a crash. All the scenes in this movie play on your nostalgia. It never tried to be it's own thing. Nothing new or refreshing was added. They simply copy the Star Wars (1977) blueprint."
3440,1,A shameless remake of Star Wars (1977),"A new Darth Vader that is to the original what a domestic cat is to a lion. And he is the son of a hero instead of the other way around - just drenched with originality! Solo, Leia and Luke make an unwanted return and all simply look old - and this was the theme of the entire movie - old and more of the same."
3441,2,Star Wars has lost the plot,"I meant to watch this in a cinema. Missed it, so bought the DVD instead. Now I wish I had gone to the cinema to actually hear people laughing. Not due to good humour but because of the absurdity of the entire movie."
3442,1,I'm sure there's better fan-fiction out there.,"Yeah say whatever you want about how if I didn't see it, I shouldn't be saying anything. Star Wars has won its glory through trailers, and these trailers all sucked. No one wants to see some collage of old movies rehashed into one cruddy work of film. Star Wars never was a copycat. I pray to GOD there isn't a sequel to this disaster. I've seen THE 6 movies and I'm not one of those people who separates it into ""prequel and sequel trilogy"", they are all as one and equally perfect. That being said, let's continue."
3443,1,"Never saw it, -100000000 out of 10. Pitiful.","Alright, let's get it out of the way. Huge fan of the original (Ep IV-VI) trilogy. I thought there were some redeeming things in Ep. I (Darth Maul, Duel of the Fates, Liam Neeson), but 2&3 were forgettable IMHO. I have not liked the Star Trek reboots, but really enjoyed the older Star Treks. Just wanted to give you a little background on other movies so you can understand where my tastes are coming from."
3444,5,The Force is weak with this one...,This movie was presented as 'episode VII' but it tries to be a reboot or a remake and it fails to be either.
3445,1,Depressing,"Great sci-fi movies are things of wonder. Think Blade Runner, the original Terminator or indeed Episode III - A New Hope. Alas the Force Awakens falls well short of any of these classic theatre fillers."
3446,5,Safety in nostalgia (Minor spoiler alert),I have waited and waited to see this movie and was furious when i reviewed it as its as disappointing as avengers age of ultron! I grew up with the star wars franchise and im a big fan of it thats why when it was announced their would be a new star wars film with majority of the original cast i could re-live my childhood.....or so i thought as its a decent attempt by jj Abrams but the force awakening FAILS as it tries so hard to show lot of cool shots and forgets about the essence of star wars the pacing is awful the humour is misplaced and not needed the timing for introducing the leading actors is by far the worst there is not a lot of character development. This is by no means a sequel but a bad attempt at a remake let me explain
3447,4,this is not the film you are looking for,"Right rating would be 6/10. Good execution, terrible writing, terrible story. Story is boring...What a shame!"
3448,2,overrated,"I mean wow the fact this landed in IMDb top movies list completely discredits the entire list and website. What is next Israel and its supporters will be branded peace loving, mountains will be called deserts and potato will be called health food especially in its French fries form??"
3449,2,Really bad,Positive: Daisy Ridley if fun to watch.
3450,1,I can't believe the great ratings - are you folks awake?,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was not prequel levels of bad. It was worse. There is absolutely nothing unique about this movie. It has no identity of it's own. The movie follows protagonist Rey, a young woman isolated on a desert planet (Sound familiar). She soon finds herself in the middle of a rebellion against the Empire... sorry ""First Order"", where she joins a group of rebel soldiers (*cough New Hope *cough) and discovers that she has an untapped potential to manipulate the force. She even meets an oddly shaped droid, who conveniently holds an important secret. In this case, it's the location of Luke Skywalker, who has gone awol. Rey is one of the most boring characters in Star Wars history. She's instantly good at everything she tries and receives no character development throughout the film. Unlike Luke Skywalker, who had to struggle to become a Jedi, Rey manages to use the force with ease, mastering every technique instantly. She's accompanied on her journey by Finn, a former Storm Trooper, turned comic relief."
3451,4,Star Wars: The Search for More Money,"It is bland to begin with, and after having used it 6 times it has lost all flavor."
3452,2,The Star Wars franchise is like a bag of green tea.,"Old fan here, writing his 1st review. Watched the movie 3 days ago and I'm still angry. For me the George Lucas's Star Wars are over. This is a remake and we all know what will happen at the end. No new stuff, no interesting story, nothing."
3453,1,"From all the stories out there, you came up with this bs?","Imagine they make a continuation for Lord Of The Rings. We would have a dwarf named Fride, working in a mine in the beautiful mountains, who would be then visited by a shaman called Gindolf, who would tell Fride, that an evil being called Saurator has risen to destroy every good thing in the world. Fride would find a necklace in the mine recognized from Gindolf as the powerful necklace that Saurator lost once. Fride now has to go to the ice lake, defended by Saurator's hordes of goblins. The necklace has to be brought to this lake, because it would scatter this necklace to pieces by it's cold. It took me half a minute to come up with this, and 5 minutes to write it down."
3454,1,"Mindless, unoriginal action sci-fi for the uncritical masses","This simply does not exist in the star wars universe. It felt like a nightmare Luke had which he very quickly woke up from. Let's use that story to remove these from star wars history. Bad acting, bad storyline. WEAK WANNA BE DARTH VADER. HA! And rise of Who?! TRASH!"
3455,1,Complete garbage. - please remove from canon.,CONTAINS SPOILERS:
3456,1,Unoriginal and plays it Safe.,This is the first time I've ever posted a review on this site but as a long time SW fan I just felt compelled. Mostly because people keep telling me how good they thought the film was. And so as an alternative to punching some of my friends in the face I've come to vent my anger here. Because really what the f**k was that? 
3457,1,Catharsis,"I've loved Star Wars since childhood, and I was looking forward to a new film, but having watched ""Force Awakens,"" I really wish this wasn't the ""new"" Star Wars. This film is at best Lazy, and at worst a work of plagiarism. Star Wars VII pulls so hard from the original 1977 Star Wars to lack any personality of its own. It has little (to no) character exposition, and the paper thin plot is served up with a healthy dose of political correctness. The acting is almost non- existent (replaced mostly by the occasional cameo or forced bit of humor). Disney, Lucas film, and Abrams should be ashamed for creating this pandering piece of garbage, but Star Wars fan should be more ashamed for supporting it. "
3458,1,Terrible.,"I managed to fall asleep two times at the end of the movie. Today's art of movies is based on ""some guy behind the computer and CGI software"". Crews of many people who had jobs for making good movies are long gone. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or a cartoon. Effects from 1977 are much better and realistic from these in 2000's - because people were making those effects, not some nerd behind the keyboard and a crappy software. Old crew from the movie is obviously tired from acting, being there just as a stone with a few dialog's. New crew is selectively taken to finish the movie at the beginning - no charm, no energy, nothing at all, starting from their looks, appearance and acting skills. Director of photography, screenplay, director and everything else is given free to a CGI ""mastermind"" as usual.As for the lead villain (and I'm not talking about a bad cgi character with a carton name), he is just a teenager with dad problems and rage control issues making him smash his computers. Like most other characters, he failed to evoke any emotions. I was surprised by a lack of feedback from the audience in cinema, it was just a silence for the entire movie. Even the moments that were supposed to be heavy with emotions were met by silence. This movie just makes you feel nothing at all. I guess at this point, whatever you make under a Star Wars brand, it will be a success, right? Horrible. I am genuinely sorry I actually paid money to see this."
3459,1,worst than the phantom menace,"**SPOILERS INCLUDED** While I do not think this film deserves the 1 out of 10 some of the reviewers on here are rating it, it is far from being a 10 out of 10 film or even an 8.6 out of 10 (IMDB rating at the time of writing). I believe 4 to 4.5 would be fair, which is a long way short of what us Starwars fans expected or deserved."
3460,4,Attepted reboot but Starwars deserves some real original story telling.,HK-47 with not approve.
3461,2,"Insulting, Lazy and Poor.","By giving this movie a 3, I'm being generous. A complete misfire all the way. I could have written a better script if I started yesterday. The only saving grace was hearing Chewie again. The best way to wash this horrible taste out of my mouth is to re-watch the original Star Wars and try to forget I saw this. None of the action scenes are even remotely believable. The dialogue is a joke. It looks like the only purpose of the film is to try to sell toys based off a couple new, lame characters. I seriously thought about walking out several times and now wish I would have. They must have paid Harrison Ford and Carrie Fischer one hell of a lot of money to appear in this since they sold their integrity to be a part of this utter disaster. Be warned, a waste of time and money!"
3462,3,The Force Awakens put me to sleep.,"Well... The long awaited SW7 was (for me at least) not a great one. It's as if you take the previous episodes, mix it and use it to create a ""new one"". I can't really agree with the new in this. Rey is like a feminine version of Luke with the ability of using the Force way too fast and without any teaching, she's the best at everything... Even the millennium falcon is a piece of cake! Let's talk about the saber which is know ""a conscious form"" able to choose his master.. Wait.. What.. Is it Harry Potter? Kylo Ren is like a big crybaby with emotional disorder and a high potential in demolition. The death of Han is nothing more than a vulgar copy of the death of Vader. Finn using the saber? Kylowho crush Rey with the force but not Finn? Finn a stormtroopers with...no lets stop it with : first fight and he p*** his pants."
3463,3,Deception,"There may be some spoilers, even though I have done my best to avoid them! "
3464,1,"The new ""New hope"" dies at the hands of the Disney money-making machine","I must say the movie itself without any connection to the other star wars films is pretty nice..Nice visuals,action,and for sure very enjoyable..but..Characters lack depth..and when there's no major figures,influential figures from both Jedi and Sith camp alike..then movie seems to suffer in that point..No Yoda,no Jedi masters,No Siths just Snoke(who looks like Golum by the way-aka Lord of the rings)..and u have Kylo Ren..If this guy is the portrayal of a real villain then i must be superman..He is just a kid..sensitive to the force for sure, but nothing dark about him..nothing scary..nothing special..The only highlight of the film is Rey..She stands out from all the characters..She has depth and she is interesting in all aspects...i liked her a lot..Well as i said the film itself is more than good..Cool i would say..I enjoyed it..but it was like a fairy tale..No darkness,the atmosphere was like a fairy tale..characters were very polished and shiny..U need dark atmosphere for that kind of films if u want to illustrate the fight between dark and light...they should rethink in the future..It would have been better if they made a ""Darth Bane trilogy""old republic has way more interesting characters than this one...Nobody is left here..Jedis and Sith are all gone..So..its kinda disappointing if u are a star wars fan..if not as i said its a very nice film..!!!"
3465,5,nice one..but not something special..,"I loved all the previous star wars movies (yes, even the prequels). "
3466,1,"Blockbuster: Unimaginative, cheap, no fantasy, lacked vision","********CONTAINS SPOILERS********** Let me just start by saying I have never in my life written a movie review before, but I saw this film the day it was released and have been seething with rage ever since."
3467,1,I will never accept this as a StarWars film,"This is the worst movie of the franchise, and its worst offense is how it diminished the importance of the Jedi. Until now, the Star Wars universe has centered on the Jedi and Sith facing off in epic battles for control of the universe. The lightsaber battles between each side's masters were what we all waited for in every movie. For TFA to show an ex-Stormtrooper and a young civilian, both with no Force or lightsaber training whatsoever, fighting the primary villain to a draw is a absurd disgrace to the franchise. They should not have stood a chance against Kylo, who was trained to some extent by Luke Skywalker himself. The only sensible sequence would be for Kylo to toy with them and try to enrage Rey to facilitate turning her to the Dark Side...but that didn't happen - as it was shown, Rey could have actually defeated Kylo. It is a farce and completely ruined an already severely damaged movie. "
3468,1,They ruined it,A small droid carrying classified data crash lands on desert planet. Meets teenage characters. Rebel Alliance needs the data to fight the Empire's new planet-destroying weapon. Rinse and repeat.
3469,2,Was this supposed to be a SEQUEL....or REBOOT? Failed miserably at both....,"Part I: score Be careful with the score and critics this movie has. It makes me doubt about the rate system (filled by users of course) which is supposed to help people understand if the movie will be appealing to them. For a person who has not seen the previous movies it barely makes 7 out of 10 (maybe it's too much). If you are up to date with the franchise (my case) it's a 4 out of 10 (again, maybe it's too much). On the other hand we have the fan boys unable to provide a biased score. Part II: story The main problem is in the story, repeating events from the previous movies but this time poorly executed. The pace is not natural and feels forced to perform a parade of previous characters and symbolic objects of this universe. We are presented the main characters Rey and Finn which develop an awkward relationship through the movie. From the moment they met every scene turns silly and starts to resemble teenagers drama were only superficial topics are brought to the table. Their action sequences together are filled by clichés, convenient events and jokes that just don't go with what this story represents (maybe with a superhero movie but not here). Bad guys or future threats are predictable, silly and easily defeated. In fact almost every scene in the movie is predictable, therefore there is no tension, fear for the possible death of a character, happiness because someone just got saved and so on. Part III: acting The performance is mediocre for many characters. At some points the problem seems to be with the script given and the situation that they are trying to represent. Old characters dialogue seeks to bring back old memories and quickly explain what has happened with them through the years. This leaves no space for present feelings and strong character development between the old and new generation. Part IV: Plot holes (spoiler's incoming, if needed jump to part V). I repeat, major spoilers here, last chance to skip this part. Well fair enough. So, if you have read other reviews then you know that the movie is full of plot holes. A few of them: - The distances between planets are not properly represented. Characters can just go to any planet immediately and find rapidly the person or object they seek. There is no need for a robot or something to scout the area (If they had had this technology in Episode I). -Han Solo knows the best place where his friends can be save from the bad guys. Yes, the republic. But it seems that he does not have a good relationship with the Princess and decides to try another planet to get help from an old friend. At the end of the conversation this friend implies that Han Solo should go to the republic which eventually he does. So, Han solo wasted everyone time, put his friends in danger and did it just because the writers could not elaborate another excuse to delay this travel. -A non-trained force user is able to use successfully a Lightsaber and the force power whenever is needed. -A non-force user can also use a Lightsaber out of nowhere if the situation is convenient. -Han Solo does not knows the Millennium Falcon as well as her first time co-pilot. -A Sith finishing his training loses a battle against an untrained force user. There are many more plot holes in the story but let's just leave it there. End of major spoilers here. "
3470,4,This is not what I expected to see,"Just quickly going through the most popular professional reviews makes me shudder because of either how parochially minded or ignorant these people are. The focus of this review, however, is not to draw on examples of poor reviews by critics, but I thought it would be an interesting observation I'd like to mention at the start of this. "
3471,1,Where do the professional critics get their delusions from? It's almost as if they are paid by Disney to deliver good reviews,"Like many others I went with highest hopes and anticipation into Force Awakens. The result was a rather shallow feeling. What did I just see? A funky remix of Episode 4-6? I understand the pressure JJ must have been from Disney's side during production. I also see the pressure the fan base is giving. But how can those crater-size holes in the script be justified, or at least explained? How can she fly off that planet with the Millennium Falcon and just run into Han Solo who has been looking for that ship for years? Please don't tell us it's the FORCE that has magically let things fall into place. That's too cheap for a franchise like Star Wars. The lightsaber in that box, the fact that R2D2 suddenly pops out the map in the end, the list of coincidences is endless. I'm disappointed, but I can also see where the whole franchise is heading. Concept-arted to death, produced without a soul. $$$ makes the world go round."
3472,2,disappointed,"Letdown of the cinematic century. I've watched cheesy 80's cartoons growing up that had more depth and cohesion than this movie. If we had of seen this as the original Episode 1 as kids, the franchise never would have happened. For those of us with taste and any idea of what the original was like growing up, this is a slap in the face. I want my 2hrs. back. "
3473,1,"F- Go home Starwars, your drunk.",***SPOILERS BELOW***
3474,1,The end of my love for the Star Wars franchise.,"First of all I don't see how this movie's rating so high. Must be twenty somethings who never saw the original trilogy and thought the special effects in this movie were awesome. Which they were, that is why I gave the movie a 5. The story is lacking. Like one person said in a review I read, ""Do the bad people in the galaxy have an ACME 'Build a DeathStar quick' kit laying around? How could something this big be built by remnants of the Empire, without the Republic knowing about it? Can JJ Abrams write? Didn't he do the same thing in Star Trek II: Into Darkness? Just took the plot from an original movie, rehash the same story, and add CGI with the same characters in a different time line? I kept up with a few of the books after the events of Return of the Jedi and JJ Abrams just throws them out as though it never happened and in turn creates a new time line. It would have been nice to see Admiral Thrawn come to life."
3475,1,A New Hope Redux,"Unlike other Star Wars movies, I can't watch this time and time again. Only went to the movies once, and that was enough. With other movies from the franchise I went to the movies 5 or 6 times just for the thrill of it."
3476,1,"It doesn't appeal to me at all, can't see it again!","The latest Star Wars episode 8 was entertaining enough, plenty of violence, explosions. But doesn't have the impact like in 1977 with the first one when all this was rather new."
3477,2,"Retread, Repeat, Discard","This movie doesn't deserve this rating,the way it insults everything Star Wars is about is beyond me. I am Star Wars fan,i don't care if this movie is better executed than prequels,only reason it is,because it was played safe and targeted popcorn flick lover audience,and pseudo,nostalgia driven Star Wars fans.why are we choosing prequels as ""icon of enemy"" and compare it to them?Who gives a ### about practical effects,or bringing back fast food nostalgia when there are so many plot-holes in this movie."
3478,2,Unforgivable insult towards Star Wars fans,"I want to start by stating I truly have enjoyed all Star Wars movies prior to this one. Even the prequels (which are obviously not as good) demolish this movie in plot, character building and EVEN action sequences. (there is only two lightsaber battles and they last seconds)"
3479,1,The Manipulation Power of Nostalgia and Mass Appeal,"I have just seen the film, and jumping away from the hype and comparing it to Star Wars, I thought the film was rubbish. The storyline lacked an engaging structure, the characters were wooden and 2 dimensional and that includes the originals, I wasn't looking at Star Wars I was looking at a dystopian teen drama like Hunger Games etc. The effects were spectacular but with me that no longers sells a movie, as I have seen them all, as we all have, they have become routine, storyline is the most important, as it has been since story-telling began eons ago. This story was corny with absolutely no character or relationship building, everyone became instant best friends and were labeled good or bad. Its runaway success owes more to marketing and capturing the good and evil zeitgeist in the air at the moment and the almighty supposedly rebooted brand of the most famous of all movie franchises, which compelled us movie/ Star Wars/ lovers to have a look. It's success went from there. But in all the Emperor has no clothes."
3480,5,The Emperor has no clothes.,"Despite my love for Star Wars and my unflinching desire to fall back in love with this universe all over again, having read what i can only describe as 'Love Letters' from some critics it has occurred to me again as it always does, how important it is that real fans voice their opinions rather than critics who run the risk of upsetting the studio that whines & dines them every time a film of this magnitude arrives. Dare they lose their premiere tickets to the next one. The Force Awakens has arrived and whilst it is nice to wallow in nostalgia & remember what it is you loved about this universe in the first place, it is also important to judge a film on it's own merits & not on it's name & status alone. The Empire Magazine film review is an excellent example of one person's love for a franchise blinding them to the fairly obvious. Stating that TFA borrows slight themes from ANH is an understatement of grand proportions but one that is understandable whilst in a darkened theatre but once detached from the experience of the cinema the flaws of this film become evident & much more apparent. In the modern age of online reviews & blogs voicing your real feelings & concerns about a film will have consequences for eventual sequels & spin-offs so fans if you were happy with this film and it's startling lack of originality feel free to keep lining the pockets of the studio that doesn't have to think anymore to make billions, but if you are one of those fans that, like me, have had a huge crushing disappointment please make it known, the future of SW depends on it. To list the inconsistencies, blatant rips from other (better) SW movies & just out & out mind numbing non-sensical plot holes would leave me no room for anything else in this review. The word lazy sadly springs to mind. In almost every scene there is a doppleganger to a previous SW movie from the desert landscapes to the information loaded droid to the father/son love/hate to the planet destroying Death star to the mask wearing voice changing villain & even to the point of recycling old dialogue. I mean if you wanted this you would just pop in the first 3 movies, surely? being a fan doesn't give anyone the right to treat you stupid! JJ Abrahms is a talented director who managed to chisel a fantastic reboot of Star Trek & seemingly had a handle on this kind of material but like every film that has gone before, you are only as good as the story & script and from where i am sitting this is just another, less fun re-telling of ANH with a bigger death star & an older Harrison Ford. If this was a stand alone science fiction movie without the brand, it would just come & go & maybe do low-mild box office. This is what annoys me most, the film makers clearly understood how important this film was to so many people and to treat it with such blatant disrespect as to just churn out a run-of-the-mill retread is just plainly aggravating. So much budget to come up with something so familiar yet so alienating to those that understand what Star Wars stands for as far as Genre Defining Fantasy goes. This pales in comparison and yet i am still in love with the idea of making more of them in the hope that maybe they can re-light the fire again & give todays 5 second attention span kiddies a taste of what it felt like back in 1977 (And i haven't even mentioned the killing of the most or at least one of the most beloved characters in the whole universe, but being that he was meant to be knocked off in ROTJ i will give that one a pass) Despite all it's shortcomings and there are many, TFA has it's bright spots most notably the sound & visuals which are as impressive as you would expect, the new additions to the cast do the best they can with the tired formula, the idea of a turn coat stormtrooper was at least something new added to the mix and sparks still fly when Leia & Han share screen time, it's just a shame that they decided to rely too much on themes heavily apparent in previous SW films. The new villain is one of the biggest problems to say the least, again Empire's review has stated that this is the greatest villain in SW lore, but anybody that believes that is clearly living in a world of coke & happy pills, it's true to say he is clearly torn, but it's more the Team Edward, team Jacob kind of torn than anything suited to a SW movie. A clearer and more fleshed out back story to the missing 30 years would have been in the film makers best interest here instead of all the laser blasting and flat jokes (There's a reason most people love 'Empire Strikes Back' the best, it's called story!) but maybe this is something they will concede too in the next instalment. In the end TFA will join Indiana Jones, The Hobbit & even it's own prequels as being a good idea in theory but sadly lacking in substance & originality in practise, a way to indulge your nostalgia without moving the franchises along. "
3481,2,Take A Step Back From Nostalgia & Review Honestly!,"The Force Awakens is a good kids movie but it's not the redemption fans were waiting for. The story line is weak beyond belief. Abrahams has made a massive mistake with following up on a Solo-son story line to mirror Vader-Skywalker relationship. It will leave true Star Wars fans frowning with frustration. There are some nice little nods to the classic films which are overshadowed by a seriously weak script. The attempt at humour should of been avoided. Some moments were almost an homage to Benny Hill. My biggest gripe with the movie is that the characters representing the Darkside of the force seriously are poor in design, execution and presentation. The villain of the plot is no more than a hair dresser in a black leather outfit. Worst of all who is the that blue thing sitting on an oversized toilet? Where is the explanation??? Guys have we heard of a background story??? Fans will see the hairdresser facing off against our heroine Ray in a battle to the death. Ray doesn't need any training and takes out an apprentice of the Darkside without too much difficulty. How's this for a storyline...the Death Star was big but the Killer Death Star is BIGGER...yawn! Take tissues...it will have you in tears...tears of frustration!"
3482,3,Weak plot...,Someone at Disney had to employ their families and friends to fool the movie enthusiasts. This movie was pure garbage. Nothing close to any of the Star Wars directed by Lucas. I was forced to go because of my little boy. End of Star Wars. Don't waste your money for them to charge you $20 more for drinks and popcorn too. The movie industry is going down the toilet.

3483,2,"A Disney Show for TV, Not Movie Theaters","Not surprising given the 4 billion price tag, Disney payed for the franchise. "
3484,3,Star Wars Episode VII - The Remake Awakens,"Hi, I just came out of the movie and this is the first time I write a review on IMDb: "
3485,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever,"If it is true that with the prequels George Lucas raped our childhood, with The Force Awakens Disney and JJ Abrams slew it and then had sex with its corpse. It is all very competent technically, but the plot is so goofy and over the top that anybody trying to make a spoof out of it will fail miserably. Rather than bringing anything new to the table, the film is more interested in mapping a ""new"" canon for gender and racial diversity politics that seem totally forced not to mention unnecessary in a galaxy far far away; among its other major sins it also introduces a rotten third act reveal, a lame send-off of a beloved character and a ridiculous cliffhanger of an ending that could qualify one certain actor for the briefest Razzie award worthy performance on record."
3486,3,I am not feeling the force here,"I would try and leave out spoilers, but all my hate of this movie is spoilers. So I really can't say very much about this film. It's pretty much like any other Jar Jar Abrams film, all flashy and shiny and zero substance. The plot we've seen it before, but it's a spoiler to tell you where we've seen it. Abrams story telling are as boring and predictable as all his other works he's done before, and then he lies when it's figured out. And then thinks he's fooled you once his predictable story happens. He's a hack writer in the truest sense of the word. And now he has just killed Star Wars for me so I won't even bother with the next 2 sequels in the line. I can't say why without spoiling it, so all I can say it this is not the Star Wars movie I was looking for. You blew it Jar Jar Abrams, you blew it Disney, and screw you too Lucas for you selling it and allowing it all to happen."
3487,1,This is not the movie I was looking for.,"As a STAR WARS avid fan, i went last night to the cinema to watch the Force awakens, but before I went, I thought, OK, so Disney bought this, so there will be some corny moments, BOY was I in for a treat, this is without doubt the WORST movie from the franchise, there are so many things wrong with his movie that it will be difficult to remember them all, but I'll try."
3488,1,Disney and J.J. Abrams are Dead to me,"I tried to like this, I thought it had some great features, visually it was beautiful, I thought Daisy Ridley and John Boyega played there roles well. Han and Chewie were great."
3489,2,Great visuals poor story telling,Ignore the name 'Star Wars' and see it for what it is. A digital pickpocket snatching your time and money.
3490,2,Admit It Disney Is Low Quality Trash,"I loved the original Star Wars 1977, and this is not SW7! This is a remark of the original. The same story by three different characters against Darth Vader 2.0 and Death Star 2.0! No new story to speak of, and I could guess the ending by halfway. If you haven't seen the first one, this might be a good movie, but for the veterans I felt this was a letdown. You get to see all the old characters from SW1, and that made some cheer. Great special effects, letdown by mediocre story, yes, including that twist for those who saw the show. I would have preferred to see other syfy like Avatar which had both good effects and story. There is no ending in this movie, you'll have to watch the next one to see where the story goes, ala The Empire Strikes Back."
3491,5,Am I the only one who found it a letdown?,OK for those of you with little time to spare I'll sum everything up unoriginal + political + deus ex machina + CGI + romance + drama + piggybacking a popular franchise = Star Wars The Force Awakens.
3492,2,As Original As 123 Fake Street,"If you haven't seen the movie, don't. If you have, there is a balm. Watch Episode IV (again) as soon as you can. There you will see a masterpiece of cinema that changed filmmaking forever. It inspired millions for generations. A Hew Hope has pacing, galactic scope, tension building, memorable characters, and a powerful spirit. Even the flawed prequels retain scope and vision. The story arc of Episodes 1 through 6 is about the corruption of Anakin Skywalker from childhood and his eventual redemption in death through the efforts of his children. The series has not one, but two of the most memorable villains in storytelling history: Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. "
3493,1,Lazy Bantha Fodder,"I have seriously never felt such boredom and disappointment in the cinema before. Maybe my expectations were too high but still, what a mess. Visuals were very beautiful at times but the rest felt like one big recycled turd :) Of the 5 (VERY sci-fi enthusiastic) guys that I went with, 1 really liked it and 4 were very negative. YMMV and lowering expectations may help :) Obviously, it is very hard to make a film that speaks so everyone but so why even try? I am well aware that the original trilogy was seen as involuntarily funny and that it was not without flaws but it had the momentum of showing something novel, bringing something innovative to the viewer."
3494,5,Never been so bored in the cinema,"As a pop-corn movie, it's not that bad. The acting is good, there is action, beautiful pictures,..."
3495,3,Episode VII: A New New Hope,"This is much worse than the old films from the 80s. Episode I, II and III are masterpieces of creative art compared to this! The story does not follow the original star wars story, there is no real action, no tension, no spirit, nothing. This is only in my opinion, but if you wanted to kill star-wars this movie would be the way to go. Had I seen it in the first place I would never have developed interest in this whole thing and read all the books. There are flaws to it that I do not wish to spoiler now but: There are actions performed that would never have performed in the original story because the are impossible to perform with that equipment. Others are just physically impossible. (Even in Sci-Fi) I can absolutely not understand why Disney did such a bad job on this. Star-Wars is clearly Sci-Fi but in this film you get the feeling that they just got the job done. They sold the name but delivered nothing of the feeling you'd expect. It's a shame,I think. (One can hope that it gets much much better.)"
3496,1,Total disaster!,"Immediate disclaimer - I am not a Star Wars super fanboy. I did see both trilogies more than 1 time and I did enjoy them both greatly ( exception would be episode II), however walking out of the local mall theater on a cold December evening and having just watched Episode 7, a nibbling itch inside my head kept asking - ""What did I just watch?"". When Simon Pegg said that J.J. Abrams' take on Episode 7 was going to take tips from the original trilogy, I did not expect it to take literally all of them. Throughout the screening I could not comprehend whether I am witnessing a comedic reboot or a pathetic attempt at a sequel, the writers of which succumbed to the pressure of the atomic hype and fear of offending the crazy fanboys by actually daring to implement new and unique ideas. "
3497,5,The Force Awakens But Original Ideas Don't,"There were times during this movie I had to smile at the familiarity of things. However, overall this flick was a let down. Not only is Luke, Leia and Han back, so is the entire script. If you saw Episode 4 then you have pretty much seen Episode 7."
3498,4,"Again, the Hype is with them.",I don't remember any other movie with such a potential that while looking absolutely promising at the beginning was more and more falling steep down to the level of garbage until the end finally came.
3499,3,"It was so good at the beginning, but ...","Not one original thing in this movie. And terrible acting. Carrie Fisher's mouth didn't seem to work properly. Even the ""hokiness"" of the originals was imitated to poor effect. It's the same story with different faces and a substitute droid. The same old ""who's your daddy?"" and ""come to the dark side"" crap, a little philosophy, but simpler so the kids can understand, I guess. Shallow and superficial. What a disappointment! When they ran out of ideas, they just substituted silence, heavy music and staring. Lots of great special effects, but so much of it a re-do of the previous movies. They even had a bar scene - again, a poor imitation of the original. No thinking allowed in this movie."
3500,3,An Imitation Star Wars Movie,"Episode 7 is really Episode 3.1. A few tweaks passed off as a new release. Great undertaking. Lacked screenplay. Get TV writers who can write serials. Even the day time soaps can keep it up for decades. Surely, there are some writers who can write well and keep a story moving for more than 20 hours or so. Why did I bother to go over the past plot beforehand? As Abrams's wife said, ""It's only a movie"". Maybe anything will please Star Wars fans. But this one doesn't stand up to the competition, grand or modest. Even Han was glad to end it all. Sorry Abrams. Your mammoth undertaking was missing a key ingredient - writers. Maybe a film is like a soufflé. It doesn't take much for all that work to fall flat."
3501,3,Yawn,"blockbuster franchise is back, and no matter how anyone feels after watching Episode VII, the box office returns are guaranteed. Major differences from Episode VI, being the director is J J Abrams (director of rival 'Star Trek' movies) and with minimum contribution from the original creator George Lucas."
3502,4,"Star Wars returns, the force disappears","by now almost everyone has pointed out how it was a rip off of all the prequels(1-6). so i'm going to point out some other aspects jedi and force are myth. why? how? its been merely 30 years since return of the jedi. and its quite clear that Luke was around long enough to train kylo(till he turned into dark side) which would be at least around 10 more years. so jedi are forgotten within 20 years? what is the matter with finn. first few scenes shows him as a broken, scared and mentally disturbed character who doesn't want to be a part of any battles and wants to run away. then in very next scenes he is off killing other storm troopers? aren't other storm troopers just like him? they were probably taken away from their families forcefully just like himself. and worse part, he suddenly becomes comic character within matter of minutes."
3503,1,"hated it so much that if force was strong with me, a sith lord already would have lured me into dark side.","So you wanna make a movie based on characters created by Mr. Lucas. How? Take a plot, characters and scenes from old SW episodes. Shake, don't stir. There are way too many repetitions based on plot of different episodes. And even they are kinda dumb. Let's say in one of the episodes you have seen a pretty cool chair. So scenarists in attempt to make a cooler one just made it bigger (!). There is ton of other examples, but I do not wanna have spoilers here. And this is pretty much it about the plot. I was trying to turn off brain and just enjoy the picture (the only good part, esp. in IMAX), but since they were selling only popcorn and no heavy drugs I did not succeed. I concluded that I might be pretty old for this. Or maybe if I was in high or middle school or wanted to believe in some kind of digested fairy tale hard enough I would like this 'epic' movie. Unfortunately I do not."
3504,1,Shame with good marketing,"Star wars! big movie! I watched the new Star wars movie today. all the commercial.. just sat there in the cinema...so excited...waiting...and now it started, me thinking ""This will be great:)"" but no it wasn't :(... There was no depth in this movie, to much rushing and bad actors. Nothing happened really, it was to easy. Snoke who is that? he just sat there...and how did this happened? no plot..and Mark only a 30 sec scene what the hell? Seems like we are missing a part,like a movie before this one...a big hole, what happened to Rey, what was she waiting for? family? what happened to her family? so many things are missing. I mean who are these people?!:O"
3505,2,Well that was disappointing,WARNING SPOILERS (if that's even possible in this case)
3506,1,A cynical remake,"Most people want lots of big bangs, violence and no plot....then this movie has that. It is almost a carbon copy of the original Star Wars movie. I wasted 2 hours waiting for the interesting part that never arrived. Glad I didn't spend my money on it. Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and of course Chewwy all did remarkably well considering it was a GOD AWFUL movie. Who they hell is Rey? Where does she come from, abandoned or kidnapped as a child? Where did the force come from in her? How come both Rey and Finn can suddenly acquit themselves so professionally with a lightsabre? I mean neither had ever picked one up before yet can 'swordfight' like old pros and win. Where were all the intelligent people who never thought to as R2D2 where Luke might be? Gaping plot holes that you could never fill with expanding foam. Left me cold. Let's see if they can improve. George Lucas is probably laughing himself silly to see how badly Abrams mucked up."
3507,3,Underwhelmed.,"Oh boy!, I can't even begin to fathom how in the world they could mess this up like that!. If you are one of the persons who thought that prequels were bad and it couldn't get worst than that....believe it, IT CAN GET WORST!"
3508,1,This is definitely not the droid you're looking for. Move along!,"So after waiting a decade and enduring 2 years of hype, this is the 3rd worst Star Wars film IMO after II and III. To be honest I don't know what could have lived up to the expectations set by all that, but this sure didn't come close. First the good. This was much more reminiscent of Episode IV. Gone are the excruciating C3PO puns and corny lines that sounded like they were written by and for a 5 year old (from the last 2 films.) The dialogue rang a lot more true in this script and the comedy actually worked. The CG was good until the planet started self destructing (ALA Star Trek) and it was just too much, obviously CG fake crap. I think Abrams got the point that fans wanted a return to the authentic feel of the original 3 films. It felt a little like those parameters were adhered to so strictly, this was almost deja-vu. I mean every element is virtually repeated right down to a cantina-style bar and destroying a death star. I won't fault him for that, but I can do without a death-star in the next one. The bad. Wow here we go. My hopes of seeing Hamill, Fisher and Ford in this movie (basically cinema history being made here) were dashed watching this. First of all, the years have not been kind to Carrie Fisher and she is almost unrecognizable. There is zero emotional connection between her and Ford even with the entire London Symphony Orchestra trying to play it into existence. There is zero emotional connection between Ford and the antagonist (his and Fisher's son) and while we're on the topic of the antagonist - who the hell casts these actors? Is it the same casting agent who cast Hayden Christiansen? This antagonist looks like an effeminate vampire more suited to the cast of Twilight. Not scary. Not intimidating. When he kills his father it just doesn't work. While we're on effeminate pansy characters, the leader of the stormtroopers is also a pansy. IDK if its a female or what, but I thought stormtroopers were clones. Guess not, cause one is black. And he is the protagonist. Well he and his female counterpart who saves his ass and inexplicably beats the antagonists ass when he says the word ""force."" Sarah Connor / Ellen Ripley move over, now Rey joins the magic club of girl bad asses. Except her transformation to bad ass occurs in a second with no setup or explanation. Bad. But the absolute worst, most unforgivable sin of this film, is Fisher, Ford and Hamill NEVER APPEAR IN A SINGLE SCENE ALL TOGETHER. Hamill is in the film for about 8 seconds at the end and doesn't even have a line in the movie. But to kill Han Solo off without getting him in a scene with Luke Skywalker is a colossal blunder that will forever haunt this film maker and franchise. Don't believe the hype."
3509,5,Forced is how this felt,"Ep1 was a masterpiece this is just crap and and all of those reviewers on YouTube Jeremy jahns , stuckman got paid to lie to your face. They grabbed the cash from Disney instead of thinking of the people who are real star wars fans. If you seen any starwars film you will be offended how sexist this movie really is Rey can use a light saber with out any training and is the best Jedi ever and kaio ren loses even though he had training. She does not need help and can beat Darth mual because idk screw logic also she can fix things in a hurry and fly better then Han Solo and define gravity the falcon is indestructible according to this film."
3510,1,Jar Jar Abrams why did you make this worse then ep1?,"The disappointment of this movie is as great as the trailer and expectation was. JJ Abrahms and Disney killed Star Wars. George Lucas, what have you done ?"
3511,2,Star Wars is died,"I didn't know anything about the story of Star Wars VII. And at first, it started pretty promising. Well, of course we've already seen some desert planets in Star Wars, but the setting with all that destroyed star destroyers, the AT-AT walkers was awesome ... there sure was a story to tell about this battle. But it didn't."
3512,4,"It has happened before, it will happen again ...",*****Warning Spoilers ahead*****
3513,1,Confused,"It's now a proved fact that IMDb's rating system is rigged. I have looked through many reviews on this movie, and everyone seemingly agrees that this movie is not StarWars worthy. Given horrible rating by 9 out of 10 people, but yet still seems to have an 8.4 rating. It seems if the makers of this movie put more money into the script rather then to critics and bogus ratings, we may have had another great StarWars movie. I am not surprised at all that this series has been ruined. What good movie has ever come from Disney? I have seen Disney make great child, occultic, subliminal, cartoons, but never a single good adult film. JJ Abrahams should get first place and the biggest statue in the movie hall of shame. Disney stick with what your good at. Child molestation, and MK ultra mind control. Leave the adult brainwashing to someone else PLEASE!"
3514,1,False Ratings,"J.J. Abrams didn't do a great job. I was so exciting, expecting so much from this movie because he did good with Star Trek. At the same time, I was afraid that he would turn this Star Wars into an action flick, my fear came true(the force is strong with this one). At the beginning of the film, when the credits were rolling, my excitement was replaced with fear, fear leads me to anger, anger leads me to hate, and now I'm suffering from yet, another bad Star Wars movie. Anyone who has seen the first 3 movies would expect more(A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi). What he did to the movie, is turning it to a superficial action flick, a remake of A New Hope (a third Death Star? really? Hasn't the dark side learned that it doesn't work?)."
3515,1,"J.J. Abrams's Star Wars is a reboot, not a sequel. He did a poor job.","I love StarWars universe. This was the first proper sci-fi movie that I watched as a kid and I fell in love with everything about it. I was pumped up for the premier and tried my best to be positive about the movie. Yes the visuals were good, 3D was 3D, the universe was well drawn and all that created an atmosphere of happiness, happiness of returning to a place you know and a place you love. But plot was a major disappointment. Somewhere in the first quarter of the movie I just could not believe what creators of the movie were feeding us – the same plot! It was nothing but a worthless remake. A remake that had lost all of the insights of the original, all of its characters, all of its dimensions, all of its creativity. I will not stop at every misery that this movie brought to unsuspecting Star Wars' fans, but one that was a particular disgrace was a storm trooper with a light saber giving a fight to Sith Lord?! This is messed up guys! To summarize, I think creators of this movie owe us, the people, an apology for this caricature they have made of the Star Wars enterprise"
3516,3,Disappointment,"Probably the last Star Wars movie I'll ever bother seeing! What can I add to the disappointment many others have expressed. You could drive a truck thru the plot holes and continuity problems. Nothing original at all, just recycled stuff from other movies. No matter how large and convoluted the venue, the characters always find each other in the nick of time. The faster than light reaction shot of Leia the instant Solo dies so far away was jarring and inexplicable. I also want to know how the rest of the team made it across a 300 or 400 foot gap to meet Rey when she climbs the last 10 feet of the wall! As others have noted, Storm Troopers still can't shoot, although X-Wings manage to shoot STs standing 10 feet from the good guys. And, by the way, if the mission is to capture Rey and the Droid intact, blowing the hell out of the building is not the most dependable approach!"
3517,3,"Derivative, Tedious & Preposterous",I wanted so badly to love this movie. But now I feel like I owe George Lucas a huge apology. At least Lucas tried to do an original story in his prequels. At least he allowed his characters to evolve.
3518,3,"Soulless, Assembly-Line Movie","I spent the money to go to the IMAX 3D showing opening weekend and I waiting outside the AMC theater for an hour and a half. I love this type of atmosphere at the theater and I was so excited for this film to be released. I figured that if this movie had the original characters, an unlimited budget, and years to write a unique script, it should be great! I could not have been more disappointed..."
3519,1,Worse than Episodes l-lll,***Nothing really spoiled in my review if you've seen Ep. 4*** 
3520,1,"Star Wars, Episode ""7"": The creativity force choked to death","A long time ago, in a theater far, far away, an eleven-year old boy sat in wondrous awe and fascination as he watched Star Wars, A New Hope. Not so long ago (last night), in a theater not so far away, a forty-nine year old man sat in utter disgust and disillusionment as he watched Star Wars, The Force Awakens. "
3521,1,"Whatever this movie is, it is NOT Star Wars!","sorry but I cannot believe how overrated this movie is. As someone who grew up on the original trilogy, and then subsequently had to endure the complete tripe that was Episodes I-III, I would've thought that they would at least leave what was left of Star Wars intact and not contaminate or spoil it any further."
3522,2,overrated rubbish,"Spoilers! I don't have to tell anyone how similar this movie was to A New Hope. At first I didn't mind the similarities one bit. I found them amusing and fun. BB-8 the new R2-D2, Rey with the obvious similarities to Luke Skywalker. When they reintroduced the old Millennium Falcon, I was very much into this movie. But the blatant and deliberate parallels never stop. Every other scene my reaction would be: This is just like... or she reminds me of... all movie long. "
3523,2,"Was very excited to see movie, but left very disappointed","This movie was very enjoyable and fun, so i will give it credit there."
3524,2,A Very Fun Adventure Film That is Barely Star Wars,"... but somehow it's unfortunately real in the present. I am completely shocked. My worst concerns came true. But to be honest to myself: what should i have expected from the master of empty and shallow mystery boxes, Jar Jar Abrams?? The talentless hack who gave us completely retarded movies like Super8 (train wreck) or Star Trek (Power Rangers on Warp speed)"
3525,1,A Long Time Ago . . .,I am always very honest with my reviews and do not write many reviews. But this movie made me write a review and inform public about it.
3526,1,"Bad acting, bad script, old plot with more holes than Swiss cheese",First review ever but I feel compelled to write after watching this movie last night. No spoilers in the review below.
3527,2,Poor script and no plot,"I watched this movie on the day it opened on the 18th. The theater was about half full. I got there early (about 1 hour earlier) thinking I would not be able to get good seat and will have to stand in line. I was surprised to see the entire empty theater upon my arrival so I choose my most favorite location for the seat. I also watched it in 3D. Although, it suffered from the typical cardboard cutouts standing next to each other type of feel for the converted 2D to 3D movies."
3528,3,So-so at best. Feels more like a cash-grab effort,"This film failed on every level. It's not a believable piece of the franchise and not even an acceptable movie. The cast is horrible and it's continually reinforced by moments of phenomenal acting by a few. There is very little story and it's mostly a rehash of the first three movies, yet it feels like i would have enjoyed it much more if i had never heard of Star Wars."
3529,3,Complete Trainwreck,"There is nothing that I can say here that has not already been said, so I will not waste my, nor your time writing anything other than this: Just look at the votes by users... 90% are 1 or 2 stars. Now, look at the score given by ""critics""... 7/8/9. "
3530,3,Recycled rubbish. Don't get excited,"I created an account on IMDb just to write this review. I have been reading along for over 15 years, but never bothered to write a review. I feel obligated to warn people for this terrible movie."
3531,1,Good reviews must be fake.,".. or why not just call the eagles, they'll solve everything."
3532,1,"Jump out of light-speed behind the shield, duh?",spoiler'
3533,1,Shallow bad very bad,****SPOILER ALERT******* ********SPOILER ALERT********** *********SPOILER ALERT******** 
3534,1,Episode VII: Darth Vader and Yoda roll over in their graves: The Rooster Awakens,"You would think that somebody involved in the making of this film would be capable of an original idea, but no. This is just a 2hr remake of the original 3 films. * It's as if they asked a 5 yr old to come up with a storyline for a new star wars film, right after watching the 3 original films. *"
3535,3,Utter Rubbish,"What a loss. Sad to see Star Wars in this way... Bunch of hormone confused teens running around, jumping like its high school."
3536,3,"What a loss, what a crap... Of a movie","Hi, I'll start spoiler free!"
3537,1,It's shameless plagiarism of the Original Trilogy and other movies/games,"I honestly think this is worse than the prequels. Yes they were poor, but they at least tried to forge ahead, and add substance to the universe. TFA does not. It lives like a parasite on the original trilogy. This is best seen in how the whole thing is a (lousy) dead ringer for A New Hope. I won't treat that here, as it's been well-examined in other reviews that I read before seeing the movie. However, I was taken aback by the ludicrous speed with which the plot advanced"
3538,1,"I owe ""The Phantom Menace"" an apology","After watching this movie. I felt really insulted to the max. 1st of all why is Storm trooper a black? I thought all troopers are clone from Jango Fett who look more like a Latin? Mace Windu the jedi is black, he is totally cool. How come now storm troopers became black? I'm not racist, i just strictly following the details of Star Wars since 1977. I am very sure clones are not black. The film makers of this Star Wars(2015) all obviously make this film and didn't even know truly what Star Wars are all about.. Plot makes no sense just as many other critics here describe. J.J. Abrams, really is a Death star. Movie sequel destroyer. Got no ideas of his own, just simply pick on those popular films made by others and suck money out from the fans in his so call sequel. I will remember to avoid all his films in cinema when i see this name J.J. Abrams. Hope the rest of the hardcore fans of Star Wars do the right thing and dun blindly support this kind of senseless film made by him to avenge the mess he made of Star Wars.. Boycott all his work in the future so we can destroy this J.J. Abrams Death Star together. Or become his money milking slaves and watch his film which makes no sense like a zombie. The choice is yours. Dun get mislead into the dark side guys. May the force still be with you. After Star Trek got destroyed by him and now moving towards Star Wars. Which film will he pick next to make his sequel and destroy after destroying Star Wars completely real soon in 2017? It is impossible and no way to salvage this failure and mess of Star Wars(2015).. Just download and watch for free if there is really a next one. Then maybe you can relax at home and have good laugh on how stupid the continuation of this film will lead you to. I won't pay a single cent on this kind garbage again. Lastly, i find this really strange. At least more than 85% reviews vote this movie 1 star (awful). How come its ratings still 8.4 till this point? Most likely movie makers paid some corruption fee to maintain its ratings and lots of fake votes trying to fool people. This is an outraged and lawless. Boycott the work of J.J.Abrams. He is nothing but a cheat. All the Star Wars made by Disney are not link at all. They just try to make it look linked up.. The book of the Star Wars already ended before Disney took over. I feel much better to think this way.. I never add any of Disney Stars Wars Production to my collection cos they are trash and not related. Real version of Star Wars ended with The Clone Wars. After that its just Disney's make believe Star Wars not link with the book at all."
3539,1,The End Of The Perfect Plot since 1977,"It was nice to see the old characters, again. The special effects were amazing. But the script/plot is disjointed and illogical. See 40 unforgivable plot holes on Huff Post. Eg., People with no experience flying fighter craft and operating advanced computers, etc. I ran out of space in this review. "
3540,1,One of the Worst Movies Ever,"I've already reviewed TFA here but after watching it one more time I decided to once again express my indignation with what has been done to the Star Wars saga. If the scrip had been given to a group of fans or consulted with one maybe these grotesque mistakes would have been avoided, and maybe TFA would have merited the Star Wars name!!! I bet many of them are more capable than whoever did this piece of lazy crap."
3541,4,Epic fail!,"Just imagine that this non decrypt girl suddenly learns to fly the Millennium Falcon with no idea. Then she suddenly has a miraculous use of the force with NO TRAINING FROM ANYONE. Forget that anyone with the force needs YEARS OF TRAINING. Obi Wan, Luke, Anakin, Yoda, Qui Gon, PALPANTINE. Then just add a PLANET KILLER super duper killer. ON TOP OF ALL THAT they decide to kill off Han then Luke then Leia. What a disgraceful waste of a story."
3542,4,Flawed in EVERY SENSE,Star Wars episode 7. Good on the outside... nothing on the inside.
3543,3,Good on the outside... nothing on the inside.,I was really looking forward to this movie even knowing that Abrams will be directing it. And now I wish I didn't watch. It was just bad. No other words for it.
3544,1,Disappointment all around,"I've just watch the film, because I didn't want to see it in theater to spend my money on something I know I wouldn't like. I watched it with an open mind and still didn't liked it."
3545,3,I will definitely not watch the next installments,"I have a feeling that this Star Wars movie was quickly made so that the original actors (Leia, Luke, Han) have one more chance to be in Star Wars before they pass on."
3546,2,More of a Remake,"As someone who saw the original SW movies in the theaters back in the late 1970's and early 1980's, I was immensely disappointed with this film. I am not against the idea of a re-boot, per se, but this was simply a point-by-point re-tread of episode IV (with a bit of V and VI thrown in). It seems they were just checking off a list of old plot points to cover:"
3547,1,Star Wars: The Force goes to sleep,"If this movie didn't have Star Wars name on it, nobody would even remember it in less than a year. Well, maybe we would remember Abrams getting sued for plagiarism, but the movie itself IMO is ridiculously unremarkable."
3548,1,The Remake Awakens & The Viewer Goes To Sleep,"Poor story, just copied from 4th part. No one told me ""Force Awaken"" will be just remake of ""New Hope"". Story is almost the same but much more boring. Characters are boring too, really boring. From the very begging of movie I wish that director put them to death and replace with some real characters. And there is so little of interaction between those characters. Director simplified to much the story. "
3549,1,"""Force Awaken"" didn't make it.",Not having any ideas or creative talent or knowledge of Star Wars they commissioned JJ Abrams to remake the old episodes.
3550,3,Disney does not understand Star Wars,"Actually, it was more like ending a universe. Abrams, clearly tried to disenfranchise the core audience and ever so blatantly turn the movie (next set of movies) into a scifi hunger games while alienating the original theme of what makes the sage\universe so unique. Rey\Finn are clearly a rip off of katniss\peeta. Not only was it poorly planned, but the movie left no climax or build up to a climax what so ever. I think the only thing you forgot was the berries. "
3551,1,Ruining Franchise Legacy,"Sigh. You know all I've been exposed to for 2 months has been Star Wars and when the movie finally came out all I could hear from friends, family and even trusted reviewers online was ""Its amazing!....Well there was this..."" Time after time I'd hear ""The plot is this..."" or ""There is a lot of fan..."" In fact, the more I heard about how people loved it, the more worried I got about how bad it was. I was so worried that I had convinced myself I had to separate myself from everyone and all media to clear my head before seeing this film. Finally in a stroke of spontaneity I felt like I could see it and my wife and I saw it in 3D. And it was bad, genuinely bad. Not the worst movie, certainly better than the prequels and the Star Trek 2000s films. Still bad though. Bottom Line - - There are two types of plot points in this film: 1) recycled plot points from the original trilogy 2) Coincidences on a Harry potter level of absurdity. - The characters come in three types: 1) Mummified versions of characters you once loved 2) Recycled character types of characters you once loved *cough Ray cough* 3) New characters who can't decide on what kind of character they are - What the hell is going on? Why is there a resistance again? Dark Brotherhood what? Zero explanation to what is actually going on or world building. Not everything is bad though, there are moments that made me laugh like a small scene with a woman bandaging up Chewbacca's wounds, and there are awesome scenes like a moment when a random storm trooper pulls out a high voltage Billy club. "
3552,4,Bit me three time JJ!,I was born in the 1970s so grew up with StarWars (I had most of the toys and watched the movies every Christmas when they were shown on TV). Naturally I was quite excited with the idea of taking my 7 year old son to see the new movie....
3553,1,The Force Is Finished,"The Force Awakens starts off strong and promising, introducing interesting characters like an X Wing pilot Poe Dameron, the new villain in town Kylo Ren, a Chrome Stormtrooper called Captain Phasma, and a new droid BB-8. The First Order (aka. The empire for the new generation) are after this droid, (Sound familiar?) because for some reason EVERYONE in the galaxy is after the elusive Luke Skywalker who's gone missing, and this droid is key in finding his location. So that's basically the gist of the very shallow story; FIND Luke SKYWALKWER. "
3554,1,This felt like a parody....,"This movie flat out sucked. All the other honest reviews on here do a great job of explaining why this is nothing but tomfoolery. I'm happy this movie sucked. I'm happy it killed Star Wars and I'll tell you why; because it means I don't have to waste another penny on any of the 90 upcoming Star Wars trash Disney is going to pump out in the next few decades. And for all you mindless sheep defending this lame duck, I have news for you! You are not allowed to change your mind about this movie! People you know will call you out for loving this film in a few years from now and you will look like a complete idiot. Those pricks running Disney will not fool me again. Episode 8, 9, 10, 20, 50 and 70 can wait for television."
3555,1,I am never paying to see another Star Wars movie ever again,"So after all the anticipation, the extra cash you now pay to see the blockbuster- what is it all about? I'll tell you... it's the SAME movie as the the first one (the one that started this whole rigmarole) Why? Similarities-"
3556,4,Total Emperor's new clothes- a rehash not a tribute...,"Spoiler free don't need them. One word awful,garbage,atrocious,No Hope wait thats more then one word well i cant count who cares this movie should of never been made how much money did Disney have to pay movie critics to get people to watch this thing i saw it once and never again and trust me if you haven't seen it don't worry about it just watch (BVS) or (Civil War) but don't spend money on the bluray not even digital don't even download it wait thats illegal definitely don't do that at the most go rent it don't spend $5-6 renting it through your cable provider not worth all that money lol all jokes aside really how did this film make over $2 billion in sales and get all the critics to praise this garbage called the force awakens more like the force sleeps yes (BVS) is not a perfect movie but it gives you something to look forward to in the future but this (No Hope) if i was Luke i would ride off into the sunset with chew,Han,R2D2, 3PO looking for the best chimichangas in the galaxy far far away never looking back who cares right and kylo ren you should of never taken your helmet off i lost all respect for you when you did you should take (deadpools love that guy) advice and never take that thing off again and j.j i thought you were making a star wars not a film about guys with space ships and elf like ears hold on there are movies like does ones already whaaaat. but who care what i say right im not a critic nor a fanboy im just a guy with a phone and to much free time on my hand WoW. Love you guys and look out for my next movie opinion not review i am not a ""professional"" i can bearly spell lol. See im going to submit this review with out doing a spell check hahahah"
3557,1,Star Wars: Episode 7 No Hope hold on is that right,"I didn't read any of the comments on IMDb, forums, official trailer,etc. before i watched the movie and to be honest i felt it was a very average production. It definitely wasn't that bad ... but it wasn't impressive either. "
3558,4,"Not that bad, but expected more",SPOILERS AHEAD!
3559,3,How to make a Harry Potter movie using only Star Wars elements,"As I finally got to see Star Wars last night I felt the soul of Star Wars universe evaporating before my very eyes. The movie was cringe worthy. Yikes. How can it be getting such good reviews??? With the exception of the original casting (Harrison Ford...) the acting was terrible. The character Finn was annoying and incredibly awkward. Worse then the addition of Jar Jar Binks. He ruined the movie. And just when I thought Disney managed to produce a cool sith lord Kylo Ren takes off his mask and reveals he's some mix of side show bob and the Jonas brothers goofy step child. And what about super size Gollum as the ""Supreme Leader"" of the dark side. "
3560,1,Worst Star Wars film ever made.,"First off, to address the rumors that everything in this movie has been lifted from the original Star Wars-- It's true. All of it. Han Solo himself would tell you that, using those very words. In fact, he did use those words in this movie. But I digress...."
3561,1,"Uncreative, Racist Director Remakes 1st Star Wars Movie, Disses Primary Audience","As the title says, this is simply one of the worst continuations of a story that I have ever seen. I was extremely excited to see it, and tried through the whole movie to like it, but J.J. Abrams butchered this movie beyond saving. Terrible, stilted acting from almost all the characters, a straight-up copy of plot material and visuals from previous Star Wars episodes, and some quite frankly cheesy effects for the force. The characters they picked seemed out of place, and they killed off Han Solo who was one of the only saving graces of the movie. One of the most ridiculous parts of the movie was the fact that Rey was able to discover that she had the force, and then use it competently within the space of about 5 minutes. The whole movie seemed like a funeral pyre for everything that has made Star Wars great."
3562,1,The Worst Continuation of a Story I Have Ever Seen ( SPOILERS),"So just finished watching this and now I realize what a God Lucas truly is for the movies he made. Cos this JJ crap is utter trash. Zero creativity, nothing new at all, just a rehash of the original 3 movies with a useless predictable death for shock value."
3563,3,Left a bad aftertaste :(,"So, JJ Abrams is tired of doing Star Trek remakes and makes a Star Wars remake instead. This time it's a remake of ""A new hope"" and ""Return of the Jedi"", skipping the middle part like Jedi-training and character development. JJ Abrams is doing a lot of things right with great scenery and cool special effects, just like Star Trek, but he is also missing a good story and deep character development, just like Star Trek."
3564,1,Not the Star Wars I remember,Too much tribute just equals a bad copy. Maybe I'm getting old but it was boring for 2 hours. No emotion at all.
3565,4,Bad copy,Looking back at it now.....it was a solid enough start to a new trilogy. There was certainly alot of potential for growth. It also had alot of corniness & annoying crap to it aswell but overall it was a solid start. So how? Why? What went so wrong? Why did we end up with the 2 movies that followed this & poisoned the very soul of star wars & it's legacy. I can only think; Disney. I'm sure there was much more to it but it's all i got. Profit before quality maybe? Who hired the writers? That was the biggest issue. Rian Johnson? Probably several reasons coming together but after the Rise of Skywalker i told myself i'll never watch another Star Wars & i've stood to that promise. If i get the itch i watch the original trilogy or the prequel trilogy. Sure the prequel trilogy has flaws but it's soul is still star wars unlike the abomination trilogy. Go watch them rather then starting this crap or watch force awakens then stop. There is your review.
3566,4,If your gona watch the new trilogy. Watch this one but then stop!,"Over the long wait for Star Wars: the Force Awakens, one question has been omnipresent: would a Star Wars film made without the involvement of series creator George Lucas improve on the controversial prequels? Or would it be what we feared most - not so much a real installment, as a marketing tool for selling action figures and LEGOs? As much as we had hoped otherwise, we now must face the truth: even when making Star Wars movies, Disney will be Disney."
3567,1,The Force Reawakens,"This movie ruined the whole franchise for me, why would I go to see a Star Wars movie without any Jedi knight? "
3568,3,why did you even call it a Star Wars movie?,"Besides the incredible wow factor one thing the original 1977's Star Wars did accomplish was setting the bar incredibly high for any SciFi films to follow, including the series own sequels and thus instantly creating a huge cult following."
3569,4,Disney's Paint-By-Numbers Production,Truly a JJ Abrams Star Wars. Good God almighty when I saw the final trailer I thought there might be hope. Went into the theatre hoping for the best. I have love for all 6 Star Wars Movies with possibly my favorite being the Phantom Menace; truly a great majestic piece of storytelling.
3570,1,Most Disappointing Movie Ever - So Lame!,I wanted to like this movie.
3571,3,A very sad dissapointment...,"Forever Star Wars has had White Male leading roles. This time thanks to liberals we have a teenage girl and a crooked black guy chasing her tail. Then the story plot is not about becoming a Jedi, or any chosen one with whom the force is strong. The movie is just left wing liberal agenda to brainwash society into multiculturalism. Carefully watch the left arm raised like a Nazi salute in the political part, demonizing the other side (right wing) with a Hitler like speech but on the dark side of course while their own hidden agenda within is far more sinister, white genocide."
3572,1,George Lucas has Alzheimer's.,"First of all 5 is for visual because truthfully they have ruined Star Wars with this episode. But lets just focus on the facts which are ""the GOOD the BAD and the UGLY"""
3573,5,"The Good, the Bad, the Ugly is all HERE","I was unable and so upset that I couldn't see this at the theater as I have been born into star wars (Thank you George Lucas). I bought it and watched it at home. Total Trash and disappointment. But again, thank you George Lucas for giving us 6 excellent films. I wish you would put your input into episode 8 to correct what a failure episode 7 is by JJ Abrams. He tried to copy cat you in the original episode 4-5-6- and failed miserably. I want to cry for what he did to your creation. I will hold hope for episode 8, but have my doubts. The only thing that gets me through this horrible film, is re-watching the original six. It would be extremely important if Lucas can give input in the next episode. He was so upset with the pre script for episode 7 he wanted nothing to do with it as Abrams destroyed his characters."
3574,1,I am glad I didn't see this at the movies,"As was summarized in other reviews, Force Awakens is very derivative of a New Hope. JJ Abrams tries to summon the nostalgia factor and he succeeded. Unfortunately if you compare, all the characters were ghosts of the originals."
3575,1,Jar Jar Abrams summons the Ghost of New Hope,"This ""movie"" was absolutely terrible. From the weak plot to the empty characters, there was nothing even remotely redeeming about this ""movie"". I shudder to call the travesty that I just experienced a movie, and yet somehow it has good ratings. Don't be like me, don't get tricked by those ratings, don't watch this movie. If I could stop even one soul from suffering the way I just did by writing this review it would have all been worth it. Honestly Jar-Jar was a more thought out and put together character than kylo could ever hope to be. The death of Han for the hero's journey is pointless. It leaves the viewer dumbfounded, and no not in the ""ohhh the whole audience is shocked"" dumbfounded. This is utter confusion at something that has no reasoning behind it, no greater purpose or meaning, simply the killing off of a character. This movie leaves a worse aftertaste than the hunger game novels. (Which were also pure unmitigated garbage.) I digress, no one in their right minds should ever watch this movie. It was a culmination of everything you could do wrong in a star wars film, and yet it has enough monetary backing to charge ahead despite having nothing more going for it than the name of one of the largest franchises in cinema."
3576,1,Terrible,"No more words to spend on it. Just watch it, you will understand by yourself... But since the review has to be at least 10 lines of text, I will briefly express my disappointment... I am not the kind of Star Wars fan that will tell you s**t about Ep. 1, 2 and 3, I am pretty open minded, and I found them quite good! But this movie... This movie is just so bad... From the Teenager Jonas Brother Darth Vader, to the annoying ""humour"", to the protagonist Jedi Girl that almost killed the bad guy swinging a Lightsaber without any training but already better than Obi Wan (because we wanna make something new), to the Bigger Death Star (because good things never go old), to the pointless black guy in a main role that almost killed the bad guy swinging a Lightsaber without any training but already better than Obi Wan (because here, at Disney, we are not racist), to the completely boring story, just a complete disaster! I could keep on listing the various things that made me feel robbed of time and money, including writing this review, but, luckily, the 10 lines of text have come to an end... May the Force be with you after you finish watching this movie!"
3577,1,F****n Awful!,"After watching this much hyped movie, I was left wondering - did George Lucas really write this episode as #7 of 9 30 years ago? It felt more like a remake of the first film, A New Hope. Or was it left that way when JJ took creative license? Whichever it was, I was sorely disappointed in this movie and will be the first of seven that I will not watch again. It lacked everything. From the time I was young I watched the first 3 lots of times. I heard about the 9 episodes that would someday all be made into movies and couldn't wait for each. All Star Wars fans will likely still want to watch for themselves, just set your sights a little lower so you won't be so disappointed."
3578,3,Did Lucas really write this episode?,"My intention was to go see this film with no expectations. I was doing okay until that text started rolling across the screen and the theme song kicked in, I started hoping."
3579,4,Disney not off to a great start,"The film is more or less a remake of part IV. The villain is pale in comparison to the other villains we saw before. Why he is wearing a mask is not obvious and is totally useless. The crowd in the cinema laughed at the final reveal of the face, an emotion the director of the film hasn't planned for that scene. The whole overall story is so useless and boring I can't believe that has passed the quality control. The film was watchable up to a certain point on a bridge in the converter building. After that it was over for me. I won't go into details but how in the hell could they do that? Is this the Star Wars for the New Age? Forget that for me then. All in all uninspiring and boring with great but no many overblown special effects. More a mishmash of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and old Star Wars....Last but not least: who came up with the names? What was that villains name? Snoke? Snake? Snape? Doesn't care a lot for it....."
3580,2,Boring,"As someone who grew up in the 70's and has followed the Star Wars since the beginning, this was a huge disappointment. I don't even know where to start. Disney must have jumped on the political correctness band wagon. It took me 3 tries to even watch. I turned it off the first time in the first 10 minutes. A black storm trooper? Thats like having a jew in Hitler's SS. Throwing in a young female to lead. OK I can get that. But come on, be creative stop following all the Hunger Games, Insurgents etc. Get back to the roots of the Lucas originals. Guess its true,""every generation has a story"" but at least stay on track. If you think Im wrong, just look at all the low ratings this was given."
3581,2,Waste of time,"I don't understand? the whole story is a deja vu...identical to original. why buy the rights to photocopy a movie? (a really bad photocopy) I tried watching it 3 times!!! I fell asleep every time! most boring and unoriginal movie ever. Not to mention this ridiculous formula that so many blockbuster movies follow, with witty characters who have no business being in the movie (especially Star Wars), but are there just to irritate or steal a few laughs from the audience...an audience that has been dulled by this repetition and they themselves cant tell anymore. Bah!"
3582,1,?How? gob smacked!,"If you have never seen a Star Wars movie this might be a 5, but for any true fan of the franchise this movie is a ZERO. This is basically a remake of the first movie, without any of the character development or cohesive story line. There is no feeling of connection with any of the characters and the acting and story on a whole is just poor. So much of this movie just makes no sense at all and is way over the top in terms of being unbelievable. "
3583,1,Nothing but a rip off remake of the first Star Wars,"They have managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes and successfully reboot George Lucas' original masterpiece. Much like Senator Palpatine (Darth Sidious), Disney's plan to overthrow the gullible Star Wars fans (Galactic Republic), was devious and ingenious when you think of it."
3584,2,Disney has done it!!!,"When I heard that JJ Abrams was going to direct I gave him the benefit of the doubt. After watching the movie I realize that once a bad director, always a bad director. I am a die-hard Star Wars fan who plays the games, reads the books and comics, and lives and breathes everything Star Wars. The storyline was mediocre but it made no sense when you look at the whole picture which is the Star Wars Universe. New planets are introduced and old yet important ones such as Coruscant and Tatooine are completely omitted. Some how the Empire has completely vanished and the Republic who we can assume was the Rebel Alliance governs the galaxy. The Jedi are somehow rebuilt and destroyed and this mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke, who seems a lot like a cross between Darth Sidious AKA Emperor Palpatine and Darth Plageius is introduced. Overall the story line seemed like JJ Abrams wanted to write his own version of A New Hope but he lacked the creativity that George Lucas has."
3585,4,A Slap in the face to true Star Wars Fans,spoilers ------------------------------------------
3586,1,Disaster ending...disaster movie !!!,"""Remember your failure at the cave..."""
3587,2,"""Remember your failure at the cave..."" #Fail #Fail #FAIL",Spoilers A Head;)
3588,2,Start Wars: The Farce Returns!,"Storm trooper and untrained Jedi fight of a trained sith???? Another large round thing to destroy something??? Plus there is such little going on in the film i almost fell asleep!!! i feel like they rushed the film, and basically used the star wars franchise to make money. you didn't even need to use the old characters just stick with the laws of star wars but a totally different story line.But instead everything ended up being cliché and i hardly felt involved in the film at all. ill give credit to the actors, was good acting!! by all means go and watch this film, but if you have seen the original star wars then don't!"
3589,3,No Imagination,"Let me start by saying I went to see this movie with no expectations, not to ruin the experience for myself before actually seeing it. But while I went in being curious, I came out disgusted and angry."
3590,1,"Horrible, disrespectful mock-up of the originals","Going to the movies to watch special effects and lots of gunfight is anybody's choice for an evening entertainment, and we all respect that. "
3591,1,"Promises, empty promises and generic spoilers, sort of, maybe.",No problem. I can explain it to you.
3592,2,You Want To Know How Bad This Film Is?,"Do not be fooled with all the mystery. The Force Awakens is a poorly remake on Episode IV; the original Star Wars. 1-Small robot lost in a deserted planet carrying a map with something (originally was a blue print) 2-Robot found by a young person who does not know but has a strong connection with the Force (originally was a boy now is a girl) 3-Escape from the planet helped by Hans Solo and Chewbacca and another person (originally Obi Wan now an ex trooper) 4-The big bad guy uses a mask and dress in black 5-Rebels get the map 6-Rebels attack huge planet/weapon by shooting on a hole and finally in the last minute blowing it before it destroy another planet (originally the planet/weapon was smaller) 7-Main character killed by the bad guy in black To make matters even more similar there is some kind of Emperor, a British general that does not like the black bad guy"
3593,5,An uninspired remake of Episode IV; the Force was not strong with the writers!!!,I found the film to be a COMPLETELY unoriginal and uninspiring reboot/rehash/remake of the original Star Wars trilogy. The Force Awakens is little more than a remake of A New Hope with some of the best ideas from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi thrown into the mix.
3594,1,I waited 32 years for this?,"I was so excited about seeing the Episode 7, but all ended with the scrolling text at the beginning of the movie! Really??? Luke left and everybody is looking for him.???!!!??? This part it's explained by the fact that he trained his nephew(Kylo), and Kylo was attracted to the dark side."
3595,2,JJ and Disney:The Destroyers of Hope,"Not much to add that others haven´t allready written, not real star wars but fan fiction. I had... a bad feeling about this since the beginning. Disney bought star wars, that´s a bad sign. I heard the title: The force awakens. Hm, I thought, that´s not how the force works, the force doesn´t awaken in you or anything. Who is the director. Ah, the one who made ""lost"", that´s a bad sign. "
3596,2,Poorly made fan fiction,"If this would have been the original star wars released in the 1970s it would have bombed and no one would know what star wars is today. This is Hollywood garbage at it's finest. From the beginning you can tell it's a bad movie, with the lost storm trooper. Then what is a Hollywood movie with out an interracial black kid and a white girl. Wait of course in the end someone needs to loose a hand!!!! Can I mention how bad the acting was from Han and the Princess. They were frankly too old to be put in this movie to begin with. And while they look like they are 70 years old their ""son"" looks like he is 19!!!! Are you kidding me? This movie is exactly what a commercially produced Hollywood script looks like. You can not poll a movie script into perfection. You can not use the old Hollywood recipe for making movies, we see right through this garbage. Not to mention the fact that the girl learns the force all on her own there. No she don't need no Obi won or yoda, she's got this! Or the lame attempts at humor through out which suggest that instead of having a more serious tone to the movie like the originals had, it had become nothing more than a pop culture money grab. They have literally ran this movie into the ground. They are frankly running off a name that will be ruined in one generation. As the adults who grew up watching the first series look back on the last 4 we basically cringe. I am glad I got to see the movie for free, as I would have hated to hand over $10 to see this junk. It is simply an attempt to incorporate all the old story into re running the same story with new characters. But it failed, and hard. JJ should have known better than to put his hand on this one. Unlike star trek, this movie series will never be relivable until it is taken out of the hands of the corporate Hollywood machine."
3597,1,not even JJ Abrams could have saved us from a commercial script.,"This movie was exactly what I expected it to be. A safe, unimaginative, nostalgia-filled cash grab. I cant exactly blame Disney or Abrams for taking the safe route after the backlash Lucas got for attempting to do something new, but I was still surprised at exactly how safe they decided to stay. Nearly everything is a rehash of episode 4. Same plot, same characters, same factions, even another death star."
3598,5,"Didn't expect much, was still disappointed.","The amazing fact about this movie is that you walk out loving it. The reality, however, is that you have walked straight into the Disney trap. A beloved charatcer- Han Solo, is killed off to capitalize upon your fondness for his character. Speaking of your fondness, of the first series..... this is a remake of the first 3 episodes. Star Wars is now a mickey Mouse key ring. Don't expect anything more than the serving up of your own love of the original 3 in another insulting smörgåsbord. A sign of the times really. They watch you, in what you say; and they give you back what you say. But this, my friends, is not art."
3599,5,Your have just been taken by Disney!,Warning Spoilers!
3600,1,"JJ Abrams, don't ever touch Star Wars ever again!","With all the hype surrounding the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and after viewing the film, one might be lead to believe that almost all of the budget was devoted to the marketing department. Perhaps it's not that simple, but the film itself was, overall, a complete letdown. From unwelcome and distracting humor interjections that fell short of adding a comedic essence, to one of the worst character deliveries in the introduction of new villain Kylo Ren, Star Wars: The Force Awakens left many leaving the theater unsatisfied and skeptical of the series' future. Many also claim the film is just 'lacking' something, which I believe are the result of three major flaws in the film itself:"
3601,3,Fails to Deliver,Hundreds of people have gone to great lengths to spell out exactly everything that's wrong with this movie. I've spent the last week ranting incessantly about the same massive flaws to everyone that's asked me how I feel about this movie. 
3602,1,Not much else that can be said,"I've been on a roll with movies. I've enjoyed the last 5+ movies that I've seen in theaters. In addition, I am a huge Star Wars fan who is even a fan of the prequels. "
3603,1,I do not possibly think they could have done it worse,"First of all I must say that I knew than JJ Abrams can't pull this thing off. His storytelling abilities were always– at least to me –insuffcient. Just look at LOST"" and the last installment of Star Trek"". Nobody knows what happened with those stories and neither deserves a second viewing. He is capable to throw in some cool stuff in his movies but he was always unable to dramaturgicaly develop a story and finalize it in a satisfactory manner. And the hype from his fans is mostly damaging for the movie. The same applies for SWTFA. I remember some guy on YT with a T-shirt with a logo In J.J. we trust"". Well, that trust was misplaced. But where to begin? First of all, the biggest issue with this movie is that if you have seen all the trailers you wont have to see the movie. Honestly, there is just a single scene in the movie that wasn't shown in the trailers. The rest is well known. It is sad, because many fans thought that JJ decided to limit the trailers to predictable stuff. But that was all there is. The entire movie. Second thing. The hype, which began some time ago was about the fact that there are not much CGI effects and characters in the movie. But – imagine! – the supreme leader of Nord Kor... I mean First Order is humongous, bad, childish and cartoonish computer generated image in manner of Azog the Defiler form the last Hobbit-Movie. Then, of course we have nacistic imagery which is always effective to show some bad guys, but the speech from General Hitler...I mean Hux at the festive launch of the new Death Star made me laugh. It was so over the top, and a funny copy of Hitlers voice and countenance. Further, we have some under-under-under-used characters like Captain Phasma, who was so cool in the trailer with her silver armor. I thought that she will be the main opponent for some of our heroes but alas. She was captured without a fight and put into a garbage compactor (not shown on screen so maybe she did survive, who knows? Or cares.). Then we have our main bad guy-mister Kylo Ren. What a disappointment! At the beginning of the movie he is really a menacing presence with some new powers of the Dark side, but then we get to know him better and I must say I don't understand him or his motivation. Even the sulking Anakin from the prequels is better defined than this dark lord"". But he had three movies to develop"" his character, maybe we will someday see why Kylo Ren became Kylo Ren. But at first sight, I have no idea how he became evil, or why, or how did the ayatollah...I mean supreme leader manage to bring him to the DSOTF. Furthermore, in this movie we have more of the same stuff from the original trilogy. A planet-destroying weapon. Again. With some Achilles-heel that our heroes might exploit. Again. Some fighter battles. Again. Everything is by-the-numbers and everything we have seen before. So dramaturgicaly it is Episode IV all over again. But on the other side, we have some likable plucky heroes (hmm...again). All in all, it could have been much better."
3604,5,A Missed Opportunity,The Stuff this film does right almost works against it as a whole. It left me wondering what could have been. Where they could have taken the story. The film evokes the spirit of star wars fairly well and brings me back with nostalgia only to totally leave me hungry for fresh plot that is also deeper. 
3605,5,"Oh, what could have been!?","For me personally, the main and the biggest flaw is the way Han dies. I was disappointed that he died at all, but if Harrison Ford didn't want to pay the saga any more its fine for me. Still, the way Han dies is just... It's just (hard even to say) - pointless, meaningless, useless. It changes nothing. It is not like death of Vader, as he saves his son or even death of Ben Kenobi. Of course, you may say: ""it's just like happens in life"", but what I expected from the movie was a ""fairy tail"" happening ""long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"". If any producers will ever read my or others review: please, just consider in a future if not asking some fans for their expectations. Other flows: another Death Star like super-weapon destruction with a tiny ships - with another trench run - nothing new (maybe Empire will learn eventually, that their battle-stations are vulnerable to small crafts ;) ). Mark Hamill listed at the top of characters appearing?!?! He shows up at two scenes for about a minute in total! Frankly speaking, I would like Han to resurrect somehow ;) I don't care if anyone think it's stupid, these are just my fillings :) or at least to ""appear"" to his son like dead Jedi like to do ;) I will see, maybe bad fillings about the movie will pass away with time, but for me Episodes IV-VI will remain the best saga (of my childhood and beyond)."
3606,3,I am utterly disappointed!,"the movie had no new stuff in it. the narrative in the story was bad, even though it was a complete ripoff from the old movies. just with better effects.. this movie failed completely. it forgot the very essence of what made star wars a success in the first game. the psychological transformation of people, yes there were unconvincing transformation in this movie. but nothing relateable.. so much action so little entertainment.."
3607,1,disappointing,"After a fairly strong first half, the movie - just like its main villain - eventually drops the mask, revealing a tortured and juvenile attempt at copying great ancestors. Yes, the plot is a shoddy carbon copy of ""A New Hope"" (with elements of episodes V and VI clumsily duct taped on), complete with a main protagonist growing up on a desert planet, a map hidden in a droid, a Death Star, a rebel base on a jungle planet and a mask-wearing main villain who answers to an even bigger villain who looks like a zombie and only shows up as a hologram."
3608,4,Star Wars: A Lost Hope,"I managed to fall asleep two times at the end of the movie. Today's art of movies is based on ""some guy behind the computer and CGI software"". Crews of many people who had jobs for making good movies are long gone. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or a cartoon. Effects from 1977 are much better and realistic from these in 2000's - because people were making those effects, not some nerd behind the keyboard and a crappy software. Old crew from the movie is obviously tired from acting, being there just as a stone with a few dialogues. New crew is selectively taken to finish the movie at the beginning - no charm, no energy, nothing at all, starting from their looks, appearance and acting skills. Director of photography, screenplay, director and everything else is given free to a CGI ""mastermind"" as usual. With all the lost of creativity, this movie is ruined like many others were before - Terminator, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Rocky, Rambo, YOU NAME IT ! If you want to be raped like Indiana Jones was in one of the episodes in South Park, go ahead, who knows, maybe you'll like it."
3609,1,"Anybody seen Southpark's ""Indiana Jones being raped""",Disney unthinkably Disneyfied it in a terrible Message to our youth. It's better not to think.
3610,3,"All this movie-making talent and yet,","How stupid was this movie? Bad story, same old decades old music, clichéd punchlines..."
3611,1,This was a stupid stupid movie,"This film is a catastrophe. Period. I swear I felt as if I was watching these fan movies on youtube, but worse."
3612,1,"A fan film of youtube, but worse. Jar Jar Abrams destroyed everything","I'll try to be short with this review, because my negative feelings might force me to write a lengthy 10 page rant..."
3613,3,Enough reboots on life support!!!,"No spoilers. I just wanted to give my review without spoilers. The screenplay was poorly written. The acting was terrible. The plot was garbage. The storyline was flawed. The cinematics were decent. The director was sub-par. Looks like the force isn't the only thing that can effect the weak-minded, so can mass media and propaganda brainwashing! From everything to the way the Falcon was introduced to the goody-two shoes Disney relationship between Rey and Finn to the temper tantrum throwing bad-guy--ever see Vader or Darth Maul throw temper tantrums? Me neither--because they were way too cool for that weak-assed behaviour! Also, even Luke had to learn to fight-remember he got blasted a few times by the floating ball thingy--yeah...so how is it Rey can just pick up a light sabre and be a Jedi master? Let me guess--the force? Uh-huh--then explain why Yoda and Dooku had to practice for years? They were strong in the force but they had to practice! So yeah-this weird movie was garbage from start to finish. It was boring in the beginning, insulting in the middle and funny by the end. Like a bad roller coaster ride, you just wanted it to stop before you vomited your guts out."
3614,1,Garbage Movie. Complete P.O.S,"After watching TFA 3 times and letting it settle down (a bit) on me, I feel ready to share my opinion. I know there are hundreds (and soon thousands) of funny liners making jokes with the ""force"" here so I'll spare it and go straight to the point."
3615,4,"After so many lessons throughout so many years, how could they do it wrong?","I saw this now as a fan of the series ( which would have been even worse),but as a movie goer who enjoyed some of the prequels and in general enjoys this sort of movies. But,boy was I in for a surprise... There is just no story or character development in this movie,there also isn't a single likable character even. The bad guy- the sith Lord - is just pathetic- he never even took part in a decent fight , until the very end when he fought some regular Joe who almost kicked his ass,although he didn't have the force and had touched a light saber once before, and was then killed by some girl ,who was so strong with the force that didn't need any kind of training at all( I remember in the other movies jedies had to train for years ,some with yoda even). The girls strong with the force - she didn't even know she had it 5 mins earlier, and now she is a master ?!?! How did the empire/first order even get to rule the universe, they troops can't hit anything when their lives depend on it,2 main character without any experience destroy swarms of them. Also - when defending the death star planet thing, the resistance sent like 6 ships,the bad guys sent ALL SQUADRONS, and they couldn't deal with 6-8 x- wing fighters ? Really ? Wtf...just wtf... All those defensive turrets couldn't hit anything either- who built and engineered them,really..it is just insulting to anyone's intelligence to watch that, even if they know it is just for pure entertainment. It is not entertaining, it is annoying and frustrating. I'm even too frustrated to finish this review. Don't watch it,it is horrible. I don't know how someone gets paid to make such a bad movie,if I were that bad at my job i'd be fired."
3616,1,How could they fail so miserably,"I loved #1-#6. Each had a unique story to tell. This #7 becomes the first one to completely fail. Here is the test............ Ask anyone a plot point from #4. I guarantee that is one of the plot points from #7. And yes, the center of the plot is again............Harrison Ford and his Millennium Falcon. Been there and done that. Sure, go watch it just for fun but don't expect to be awake when the credits roll around. Probably the most annoying thing was sitting there Thursday night and listening to the audience clap and fawn over every single object appearing in this movie which they had seen in a previous movie. If R2D2 trips on a rock there are howls of laughter. Ugh."
3617,5,Remake of #4,Abrams has done to Star Wars exactly what he did to Star Trek and to many people that will be good news. 
3618,5,Perfectly average,"Every true Starwars fan who has watched Ep. VI and know that Starwars was depth was beyond just the claim to Si- Fi and explosions, knows this film not only is a remake but a pitiful fail at that. The lead characters are sad. A black guy who's fear of killing causes him to flee and kill like mad for a girl who changes his persona after he falls in love within minutes of knowing her and his main achievement in the film is being the token black guy... (really!?) That alone is very disappointing."
3619,2,"Remake w/ pathetic main characters, multiple massive potholes, & Un-Starwars soul","The cinematic effects are gorgeous, the actors are quite good, it's fast paced, but one leaves the cinema thinking... really? All this mega budget and they didn't spend a penny on the plot, as it's exactly the same as the original episode IV?"
3620,3,Same plot only worse,"I couldn't believe the amount of copying (from old movies) done here. It's COMPLETELY the same as original one!<br /><br />How in the world could you come up with that story? I mean, even a piece of wood would made a better, original story. Character development is non existent, acting is below mediocre, actors themselves pretty forgettable.<br /><br />And Kylo Ren dude (he does act OK in other movies), but here? C'mon, remember Vader and Darth Maul? These guys were scary, this is just an emo kid angry at his family a bit. Makes me really sad you made money for, let's be honest, stolen/copied (bought if you like), already used story.<br /><br />This is an insult to all viewers, and especially fans I'd say (I'm not a huge fan myself, just a regular guy who liked the story and development before, even with flaws they had).<br /><br />And yes, great work on shutting down Lucas Arts, another team that gave us good times, on contrary to what we have now."
3621,1,Completely ruined Star Wars story,"The longer I think about this movie, the more it feels like a carbon copy of Episode IV with some admixture of Episode VI. Genders were swapped and races were changed, but very little is really new."
3622,5,Feels very derivative,"This is an extremely boring and uninspired film. The boredom comes from the plot and also from the pacing which is completely off: This is a 2+ hours film, and the film seems very slow, and full of scenes which are not very original and clichés (IE: ""Stormtroopers attacking village full of innocent people"")."
3623,2,Very boring and uninspired film,"I am a big Star Wars fan. I'm however not a Star Wars nerd, I couldn't tell you what race Yoda belongs to or what Boba Fett's spaceship name is but I know enough about the Star Wars universe to understand it. To me it is an exceptional coherent and amazing setting for space adventures, and up to today always had been."
3624,5,A beautiful empty shell,if it was just another sci fi movie it would prob get a higher rating but its a part of star wars and has a standard to stand by.
3625,1,such a shame,Someone tells me what faeces of movie I just saw with the title Star Wars? They killed Star Wars now for ever thanks to director JJ Abrams of faeces that he made. He must had to be arrested and fined and prosecuted as well as Disney the monumental faeces they did to the saga. What else awkwardly unsalted soulless without anything hollow and empty only in order to sell the faeces of the puppets that not fold its arms in the area of the elbows and knees. Today I have died along with Han Solo. Sorry there but faeces hell to JJ Abrams. And thank you for doing wasting my time in about 3 hours of some piece of faeces that I've been seeing in 3D.
3626,1,Disney AND JJ Abrams killed Star Wars forever,"I don't want to spoil it for anyone who didn't watch it yet but simply put it's a total letdown. What were they thinking? In fact Episodes I, II and III were light years ahead. I could watch it again and again. Episode VII is an utter disappointment. It is a mess! Why didn't they stick to the whole Star Wars formula of condensing an entire universe and making you feel as if the viewer was actually witnessing a movie based on space travel and planet hopping. This felt restricted in comparison to the rest. The 'Death Star' was a joke. The acting was also horrible. The facial expressions of Rey was downright amateur. Man this is sickening."
3627,3,Disappointed to say the least.,"I did not like this movie, I watched it on the cinema several months ago and it was really bad. I really did not know what was going on and I started realizing I should have watched another movie. The movie made me feel embarrassed and depressed at the same time. Several questions would come up into my head, why, how? What!! Actually, the movie in itself is not bad, the acting is overplayed, it is not that they are new actors that bother me, but they don't assume what they are doing, they should add something to this franchise of Star Wars. No need to be Harrison Ford, to add your personal touch, so I would be waiting for the next Stars to maybe change my mind."
3628,5,The force awakens? but I am still sleeping,* contains spoilers * 
3629,2,A supersized pile of empty calories,"I went with an open mind that 'The Force Awakens' would be a good new movie. It wasn't :-( I never felt the need to write a review before but this movie is so poor compared to the hype I felt compelled to do so! Feel like I've been chewed up by a shameless marketing scam! The visuals were good. The acting was poor! The characters never really sounded in danger- or made me feel for them- no intensity. An occasional good line but mainly very obvious boring dialogue. Had read it was as witty or wittier than 'A New Hope'- Nope! Worst, I must strongly have the Force, because I knew the entire story and visuals- in advance. There there were NO elements of surprise, even in details :-/. There was also little chemistry between the characters. Occasionally an echo of a scene from Empire strikes back between Han Solo & Leia but hard to believe the director didn't set up better scenes for any of the characters- new or old- with all the fondness for those earier movies. He obviously thought he didn't need to- marketing & peoples hope would make that redundant?!! I'd been fed the nostalgia line EG that there was the 'Alien Cafe scene' .. Sadly THIS time without the catchy music or original aliens! This movie is a blow by blow rehash of A New Hope & Empire Strikes Back with a sprinkle of Gollum (same actor & production house) and a poor version of Severus from Harry Potter, as Badies.. & nothing done as well as in those original movies...Visuals only bright spot- good but opening scene with character Rey, but shamelessly copied from famous Japanese Anime, 'Nausicaa' I hear from an anime buff friend. 1/10 for originality in the entire movie then!? Annoyed!"
3630,4,Over-hyped and Poorer quality Remake :-(,"What makes me so unhappy about this film is that, after the dreadful episodes 1, 2 and 3 (episode 3 was a bit better from the other 2), producers haven't hesitated in using the same formula. "
3631,4,Shake the money-maker!,A lot has already been written about the failings of this movie (and there are a lot and I only have 1000 words so I can't go into all of them) but there were a few specific things I'd like to address.
3632,1,it's like a rich guy made a fan fiction movie,Not sure why one would have to warn about spoilers when a written review is supposed to dip into aspects of a film but okay.
3633,1,"The complete dismantling of everything Star Wars, that spits in the face of logic and fans of the franchise","The best part, the CGI effects. The worst part, the derivative plot which borrows from all the previous Star Wars (and even Star Trek) movies. "
3634,3,Thinly-veiled Nazi symbolism,"There are a few things to like about this movie. Most of the first act, on Jakku, and a few shots and sequences after our two leads, Rey and Finn, leave Jakku. The acting of the whole cast is generally good - Harrison Ford, in particular, carries the movie through the middle section. It was also, as a long time Star Wars fan, just nice to see Han and Chewie and Leia (and finally) Luke in the movie. It was like seeing old friends."
3635,2,A lazy shallow and cynical movie,"Sorry, but I found the movie to be incredibly disappointing. Never seen any other such an epitome of non-originality. "
3636,1,Me against the world (SPOILER ALERT),"I'm so unhappy, I truly have enjoyed all Star Wars movies prior to this one but this movie was made for teenager.. so predictable.. The acting is mediocre No one stands out and brings a good performance. Too much feminism kills the artistic aspect. They have just made this movie for money, it's a shame to spoil ""this heritage"" Maybe if you are a teenager and you've never watched a Star Wars movie before this one, then perhaps there is a chance that you will like this movie.. I'm pretty sure that the fans themselves could have written a better story. I interrupted this movie 2 times, It was just too much for me to see it all at once. the only thing that i've enjoyed is the new droid, this new BB8 is cute :)"
3637,1,Disappointed,Well that was glib and not good.
3638,5,What a Waste,"While the movie entertained me at times and left me with positive feelings after watching it , I felt pretty disappointed ."
3639,5,For moments disappointing(script),"Yes, is that bad! All you loved in the other episodes will be destroyed by watching this movie.Even the prequels are much, much better than this! Never had the Star Wars feeling the entire time. Here are some reasons why i hated this movie: - Basically the same story of episode IV, come on... - Terrible villains, Kilo Ren is a joke and the supreme leader looks poorly made - We now know that anyone can pick up a lightsaber and start fighting like a champion with no training whatsoever... - Han Solo comes from nowhere and the monsters scene in is ship is terrible! - The final attack on the death star(again) is very weak with half a dozen Xwings against such fire power! - The idea to build a death star inside an entire planet is an awful idea cause we can't see it like we did in the old movies, so it has no fear feeling at all! - No explanation of what happened in those 30 years and no characters building of any sort - Very poor dialogue between main characters And i could go on and on... Very disappointed!!!"
3640,5,Star Wars saga destroyed by this movie,"This film was an absolute embarrassment to the Star Wars franchise. I grew up loving Star Wars more than just about anything and I thought this movie couldn't be that bad, considering it is part of the saga. I had low expectations, and even then, I am still disappointed in what I saw. I don't know how this movie is allowed to have STAR WARS in its title. First off: terrible scripting. Almost none of the characters delivered performances that related to the first six movies. I felt like I was watching an Avengers sequel with bad slapstick humor throughout and horrible modernized speech. Secondly: ZERO character development. Just about every character had no background whatsoever, and some characters felt added in for no apparent reason. Third: Bad casting. Usually movies have characters who deliver performances that feel right. Not in this movie. Other than the 2 main characters and the returning heroes, not one actor felt like a Star Wars character. Again, it felt more like Avengers or some other, modernized, Disneyfied movie. However, even the characters who fit their roles were dumbed down with the poor script written for this garbage. Lastly: Strong story is absent; plot is dull and predictable; climactic moments feel very anti-climactic. A travesty when compared to the traditionally strong story telling of the former Star Wars films."
3641,1,At least it cant get any worse than this.,......remake then instead of a sequel?
3642,5,So it was a.......,"First: I have been a Star Wars fan since the early 1980s. I LOVE Star Wars. By the time Return of the Jedi came round, I could feel a disturbance in the Force, and the Sith plan to destroy the magic of New Hope and Empire Strikes Back was fully enacted by Phantom Menace et al."
3643,3,Weak effort relying on endless battles in absence of character and plot,I had so much hopes about this Star Wars. When they said they throw away the EU (novels and stuff) I was intrigued because they could've write such a great movie without any limitation.
3644,1,I don't understand how people are satisfied with this,Awful - Just a rehash of the Original Movies.
3645,1,Lame rehash,"I was eager to see the new Star Wars film. I even love the prequels. When I watched the ""Force Awakens"", I felt that the director underestimates my intelligence. "
3646,1,A perfect depiction of our society nowadays.,"I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am in this movie. Mu hopes were up, and justified since there was a great director in charge of it. JJ Abrams usually delivers."
3647,5,The death of a great saga,"Unoriginal plot, characters, planets, space fighters, weapons, script ........ This movie makes the prequels look stunningly good. "
3648,2,Strange case of deja vu!,"Ever since George Lucas sold STAR WARS to Disney company, I feared about the future of these movies. I knew it would never be the same, I knew it would never have the same amount of depth, substance, soul, imagination and creativity. I knew that at the helm of J.J. Abrams & Disney company it will degenerate into generic fast paced action film and will lose its essence, magic and mythology. That is exactly what happened to The Force Awakens. Like Mace Windu said: ""Our worst fears have been realized."" For a STAR WARS fanatic and a huge fan of George Lucas such as myself who loves so dearly all six previous films and who truly understand the mythology and core of the saga, it was very bitter watching episode VII."
3649,1,The Force Awakens into a bunch of nonsensical fan film,"***IT CONTAINS SPOILERS*** I had high expectations of this new Star Wars movie and I got very disappointed. This movie is a huge fiasco. It brings absolutely nothing new, it lacks imagination, the plot is idiotic, the dialogues are idiotic, the story is a copy cat of Episode IV and an extremely poor one at that: secret information hidden in a droid on a desert planet, the resistance badly needs it and so does the First Order (poorly resembling the Empire); the resistance wants to destroy a new Death Star, just that this one is bigger. And so on."
3650,1,Huge disappointment,***SPOILERS***
3651,1,Meh...,"Warning this DOES contain Spoilers, they are necessary to justify my score rating."
3652,3,A complete rip off,"This is the first movie review I ever wrote but seen the insane 8.5 people gave this movie I had to do it. ""Sploilers Ahead"""
3653,1,The Assassination of Star Wars by the Coward JJ Abrams,"It was a good movie but my problem is that it completely destroys any attempt at continuity that Lucas had always striven for in what is, after all, his baby. The makers of this movie seem to have no idea of the hundreds of novels written by a host of authors in the Star Wars Universe that they have purposely or maliciously disregarded in this film. Somebody had asked if Hahn and Leia had children. If they had read the novels written by other authors i would have shouted from the rooftops 'YOU BETCHA'. For one thing, people, Chewbacca had already died in a novel written some years back. The only character that they seem to have taken from a recent novel was Luke's son Ben and even he has changed in this movie. Oh and one other thing. There was somebody who chose to embrace the Dark Side and that was one of Han and Leia's kids. I will leave it to you, dear reader, to find out who that someone is. Read the novels in the Star Wars Universe and you will see what i mean when i say the producers of this movies motto was most probably 'Continuity be d--. By all means create new characters. After all other authors who wrote novels in the Star Wars Universe can and did create new characters but without making a complete mockery of the continuity that Lucas strove for in everything written outside of the main movies."
3654,5,Where oh where is the continuity that Lucas desperately strove for???????,"Return to that time long ago in a galaxy far, far away. Relive that first moment you saw Star Wars IV and fell in love with the franchise, because you are pretty much getting a plot so similar that you may wonder if the rest of this new trilogy will just continue to rehash and polish what's all been said and done before. A more appropriate title for this visually stunning film would have been Star Wars: DejaVu or Star Wars: Revisited. No doubt that this film will indeed perform well this weekend; but that has a lot to do with the fact that so many people will view this film through an augmented reality and perceive it to be better than it actually is. The Big D can do no wrong, right??? All that being said, J.J. Abrams once again proves that he is a master at visual storytelling and his films are of a high caliber from a technical achievement perspective. The cinematography and editing are flawless and really help to mesmerize the audience and impress even those who are generally not impressed by visual graphics and sound design. Watching the screen as familiar faces reprise the roles that cemented them in cinema history is nostalgic and heartwarming. Unfortunately, the writers should have spent more time developing a NEW story versus relying upon nostalgia."
3655,5,The force awakens...then realizes it's done this all before and should've stayed in bed.,"I think your reaction to TFA will depend on what aspect of Star Wars you liked going in...if core to your love oft he franchise was the rag tag rebels and the hunk of junk ship, then this movie will have plenty you like. If you're into the jedi mythology...this movie is garbage as it massacres what we already know. If you're into world building...that isn't here. And if you're into the storytelling structure and Lucas' implementation of the mono myth...run away from this movie."
3656,4,Unimaginative rehash...,"This movie is terrible. After rejecting all the ideas from George Lucas Disney then decides to just copy episode 4 instead of actually make it into a sequel. Even the prequels were incredibly better than this. So many things wrong in this movie I would be here all night writing them all. This movie is the idea of Star Wars without the Spirit of Star Wars (original creativity) that all the other movies had. This movie is the very embodiment of the Dark Side. A corporate giant uses Fear (the dark side) to reject George Lucas's ideas because they were 'scared it would be like the prequels,' thus guiding them away from original creativity (the force) by playing it ""safe"" and making it just like episode 4. The prequels were wayyyy better than this btw. Even the unnecessary clunky aesthetics were ridiculous. The only reason the 70's movies have those aesthetics is because they were made in the 70's. Anyways this movie blows. After the clouds of smog have cleared created by nostalgia and shiny 'newish' things I think most will see that the force is far from this one."
3657,1,Star Bores - The Corporate Giant Awakens,"So, just got back from seeing the new star wars movie. I'd give this movie 2 out of 10 for the following reasons:"
3658,2,Star Wars: The farce awakens,This review will be more like a deeper analysis of the movie and therefore contains spoilers! You have been warned!
3659,5,Worth a watch but hurtful for the heart and soul of a Star Wars enthusiast,*SPOILER WARNING*
3660,4,Excellent product of Hollywood + Disney + Remake = Terrible movie,"The original Star Wars IV released in 1977 and it was the most avant-garde Science-Fiction(Sci Fi) feature film that audiences have had an innovative experience of the universal scale of mythology, intricate cinematography and also conceptual props design at the time. Star Wars VII The Force Awakens is the story about 30 years after Star Wars VI."
3661,1,No Novelty Film,"There is almost zero originality to this film as I basically borrows all its ideas from the first 3 films, apart from how one of the main actors comes in to play every thing else is from the original trilogy, now this dose not mean that this film dose not have its good quality's, the acting is very good and the visuals are excellent and you really do get sense of nostalgia when you are watching, another good point about this film is it spends a great amount of time on the supporting cast, unfortunately not all of them are good and there some that feel like they are in there for filler, so finally I'll say if you're expecting something new then you will be disappointed, if you want to feel like you're watching the original trilogy then I suppose that's OK but if that's what you're after then just watch the original films."
3662,1,Rip off,"I went into this latest expansion of my beloved star wars universe with very high expectations, there was a promise of a return to the values of the first trilogy of my childhood, contrary to the 2nd trilogies mistakes."
3663,5,"High expectations, mostly unfulfilled",*Spoiler Alert*
3664,4,Mediocre,"I only wish I could get back my money and time spent on this movie. I have been a fan since it first came and my Mom took me to see it at the Cine-Capri in Phoenix in 1977. I read Return of the Jedi before seeing it as a teenager and LOVED it despite the BS with the EWOKs. Then Lucas had to add in JAR-JAR to jack up episode I (still better than VII). Attack of the clones somewhat sucked (still better than VII). Revenge of the Sith was great. Then just as I feared, Disney screwed it up BIG TIME. Lucas put a lot of work into the Expanded Universe where writers had to keep to the time lines and stories. Disney screwed it up. Even my 10 year old son gave it a crappy rating when we left the theater. Since Disney screwed this up and took my money I am going to refrain from buying anymore products, going to their OVERPRICED park, watching anymore crappy a$$ movies they produce. Thanks for killing the Star Wars dream for my son too."
3665,4,The Farce Awoke in me,"This movie has about as many (or more) plot holes and inconsistencies as some of the worst B-movies of the Eighties. Nothing makes sense, nothing feels designed to have some meaning or to build drama, instead everything that happens is like a loose succession of trivialities:"
3666,1,A Star Wars void of character and depth is merely a giant ad for toys.,"What an original, well-made piece of art this is. Isn't it exciting to see brand new Star Wars films being made?"
3667,1,A Soulless Cash Grab,"So I went into the movie with so much excitement that i wanted to feel every frame of something that I enjoyed watched as a kid. However, I was rather shown a newer version of Star Wars - A New Hope. "
3668,2,"***SPOILERS AHEAD**** It's nothing that I expected, AT ALL!!! :(","This was not the movie I was hoping for... its slick and pretty, but is missing all the elements that made the original trilogy tick. There is no back story, no character development, weak plot points... and too much forced humour. Some of it works but most of it fails. This plays like a action movie... it should have made me interested in the characters - but it didn't. "
3669,5,Turn to the Disney side is complete...,"I am getting sick and tired of reading these ridiculous 8, 9, or 10 star ratings for this absolute piece of Disney garbage. I read on someone's Facebook post that they cried when they saw Leah...LOL yeah, I cried too but not for the same reason!!! I loved the original three and thought the last three were so bad I walked out of the Jar Jar movie. I had very little confidence going into this but figured how can so many people be so wrong. Well they are. DEAD WRONG! So here are my biggest gripes with this movie, which many people have covered here in detailed fashion:"
3670,1,Come on people!!! There is NOTHING great about this!!!!,This is not a George Lucas Film? No one can act? Not a decent fight scene anywhere? Luke Skywalker is only in the last 2 minutes so that's not even worth a mention.
3671,5,Worst Star Wars Ever!!!,i have read all the negative comments and unfortunately cannot dispute a single one. This is the worst movie i have ever seen...so badly put together that you would think that a bunch of teenagers at acting and directing schools had made it. How can this have happened? And why on earth is there an 8.1 rating from this site. Seriously?
3672,1,terrible.....,"Well where do we start with this review?... I guess with my first initial thoughts of WTF! This movie is awful, dreadful, and pretty bad to boot. Its like the original star wars was reminiscing about its past while sat on a park bench with a bottle of wine in a paper bag..."
3673,1,Don't waste your money on this trash.....!Boycott this movie!,This may contain spoilers.
3674,3,The bad taste in my mouth only got worse.,very disappointed. The plot was very simple and the cheesiness was over the top. 
3675,4,sucked,.
3676,3,Disappointment,"Looking with anticipation to the new Star Wars but all I got was a remake of a previous original. It was so blatant a rip off that I thought I was watching a rerun of an old TV episode. So the special effects (especially in IMAX 3D) were great, but the plot was so thin it probably took the writers about 20 minutes to come up with this script. We had some old characters (Han Solo, Chewbacka, Leah, etc) and a few new characters who resembled the original characters in their younger days. You had a Death Star, a Darth Vader wannabe, an android very similar to R2D2, a bar scene taken from the original, a lot of battles and chases, but no real substance. One can make the argument that every scene was a repeat of previous scenes from the original Star Wars. Star Wars fans should be very disappointed with the poor effort here and any lack of originality. I hope they do better the next time, but I doubt it as this will be a money maker regardless of the lack of script or original story."
3677,2,No originality - cheap remake of original.,"Well here is another kind of review....it contains some ""quality"" related spoilers but nothing about the actual story ....so its your choice to continue reading it or not.... I will take a different road in reviewing this movie ....after watching it this is *mine* how ""The Force Awakens"" was made..."
3678,1,Well another kind of review,"OK film, has cute and funny nostalgia, but, except for the OST and special effects, not as good as the first three episodes. The new leads lack the sharp tongues of Leia and Solo, that gave personality, and a bit of fun sexy tension to the characters. This movie is mushy until it gets disgusting.. How do you feel about your child watching a son trick his father, so that he can kill him in order to empower himself with dark forces? Not bloody, just morally and emotionally vicious and repulsive. A child killing a parent is a great sin. How can this not be disturbing to a kid and what lesson is to be learned that is great enough to compensate for the damage? And, you gotta believe Hans Solo deserved a better end! But in this PC world it is difficult to see the forest for the trees. People would consider such criticism as a veiled naughty way to reveal a spoiler which apparently is perceived as worse than giving parents fair warning about what they are about to show their kids. Patricide? that's cool, just as long as there is no gay bashing, what's the problem? ""Oh brave new world"" that has such PC in it. Chewey and the robots did well. Just the people are seriously flawed."
3679,2,"Disturbing, but no one seems to notice.","First of all: the tempo. Everything went way too fast, every scene was cut off before you could really take it all in. Big part of the appeal of SW to me is the big landscapes, that entire, weird, strange and beautiful universe. They didn't show that at all, it all felt so tiny, like a TV-show."
3680,4,"Star Wars, the twenty-first century Disney-kids version, with instant Jedi and the depth of a tablespoon.","the movie sucks BIG TIME, if I watched only half of it I would said great movie, but now, damn what a stupid copy / paste so many things are wrong, i have a lot of SW books, and the books that follow episode 6 are way batter than this peace of s**t just some example, they send 10 x-wing fighters against a whole damn PLANET !!!!! the planet is traveling through space , HOW????, it sucks a sun to power up , but the sun is 1000000 times larger that the planet, the beam from the death planet travels as a light and it would need years, decades, thousands of tears to get to the target !!!!, Finn the janitor knows every single detail about the death planet and gives it to the rebels ...."
3681,2,I want my money BACK,I sense a lack of innovation in the Force. The power to provide something new to the blockbuster seems to be slowly fading away. The one whom many claimed had joined The Dark Side maybe had more good in him than we gave him credit for.
3682,4,George Lucas: The Innovator,"I write the first time my review on IMDb in 11 years! Why!? Because I've just seen Star Wars: Episode VII. And it was good, not excellent, but good. Until I saw Kylo Ren without the mask."
3683,3,RIP old school Star of Wars!,"I won't have anything more intelligent to add that other reviews haven't already covered, however I felt strongly enough to add a review to voice my disappointment at this film. This is mainly due to the unbelievably positive critic reviews. It irritates me considerably to know that millions of people will herd like sheep into cinemas, paying top £/$ to see this Star Wars by numbers effort. For a film that we know will be analysed to the nth degree, it's unbelievable how wafer thin the plot is. I now see that George Lucas was right, the madness is in the detail. 3 films dedicated (plus the animated series) to showing us Anakin's decent into the dark side now looks time well spent when compared to this slingshot around the sun. Kylo Ren is a shockingly underdeveloped character - btw, how does he get all that hair back inside his mask? The story I wanted them to tell was his betrayal of Luke, his decent into the dark side. Instead this is washed over in 30 seconds of exposition. If only they had based this film around the excellent new characters & actors instead of trying to join them to the hip of the old crew. Every scene & action sequence after the opening 3rd of the film is held back by a sentimental connection to the old films that frankly adds nothing to the SW universe. The real pig in the inkwell is the end sequence, which comes across as a Children in Need, hammed up Bollywoodesque scene involving the best character actor currently is circulation - Mark Hamill, staring open mouthed & silent for 30 seconds whilst we come to the realisation that 'this is it'. Howl in pain!!! I honestly don't get it. J J Abrams, apparently you are just a mortal."
3684,3,"Please, someone have the nerve to hold out and just watch it when it comes to TV","I was aware of the hype and potential surprises that surrounded this movie, so I kept away from this site and others until I could see it for myself. I was longing for a raw glimpse of humanity and salvation through the guidance of the human spirit and the force. I was hoping to be taken on a journey with the protagonist, to see how she got to the present, and see surprising turns in the plot to gradually reflect the unfolding of the force at the right time. "
3685,4,Imitation. No substance. Like a cheap knockoff,"the story is absolutely horrible as it usually is with these star wars movies, the death-star destruction, the ewoks on the moon of endor rekking storm-trooper elites, jar jar binks, gungans, pod-racing, the almighty sarlac, all big battle-stations getting destroyed the same way, storm-troopers can't hit anything, bobba fett getting eaten by the almighty God sarlacc, Luke planting a light-sabre on r2d2 (Wat)? this is another perfect movie for toddlers."
3686,1,Another worthless star wars movie,"This movie gives you the same amount of thrills as any one of the expendables movies, in similar fashion too, the key word is nostalgia."
3687,5,"Forgettable, Generic, Meh","This movie is not a Star Wars movie ..... This is, I hope, a multi—million dollar practical joke before the release of Star Wars 7."
3688,1,J J Abrams accomplishes to tank Star Wars 7,"The star war saga continues. But the question arises does the force really awaken?? Then folks, m really sorry, because this episode has got nothing much to offer. The script was weak and the film was over hyped."
3689,2,"A sci- fi , highly predictable","So disappointing, I can see the title on the next one which will be the 5th one all over again, STAR WARS - EMPIRE GOTS YOUR BACK! Go for the overpriced popcorn or the trailers but don't expect anything new if you were born in the 60's and saw the first one back in 1977. The special effects are good but it's like most movies today, can't come up with an original idea, go back and remake the original with a new cast. I'm waiting for It's a wonderful life to be remade so we can really see what would happen to Mr. Potter at the end if he ever stole money and falsly accused someone of theft. They should combine that with the Godfather and we can see Mr. Potter sleep with the fishes."
3690,4,Reboot of the original and still the best....,"I've waited a while to write this review because I wasn't really sure how to word what I wanted to say. I saw the movie the night it opened and like everyone else in my cinema walked out in stunned silence. No applause, just complete silence. My husband asked me if I liked it and I still couldn't find the words so I asked him what he liked about it and he struggled to come up with something."
3691,1,polar opposites,"The plot of Avatar (yes, got the right movie): If you've seen Avatar, you'll understand - A powerful corporation (can you guess?) buys up the mining rights to the planet Pandora (the Star Wars World)."
3692,3,Just look at all that cheddar!,"Watched this at imax in 3d, and from beginning to end it felt a bit too hollow. The nods to past movies, actually reminded me of how fresh the original movies were. The only redeeming quality of this film was the introduction of a bit of humour."
3693,4,All the makings of an empty franchise,"As a fan of the original Trilogy, and not a big hater of the story behind the other three, I was hugely disappointed after watching this. It's a ""How not to offend the butthurt generation 101"" where they put a black guy and a girl as 2 main, well the main protagonist and the friend that goes along.It's basically a remake, It's too predictable and with only a few good moments in the whole movie. I was sorta bored at some points, cracking jokes with my friends. The long stares, the unsatisfying moments, the not so good acting of the main character. I'm not even exited for the sequel. 2 solid characters, main one sucked, the story was seen, the main villain sucked, and what I thought was just poor casting. Left me speechless actually."
3694,3,Star Wars: A New Disappointment,"After so many years of waiting it is a thrill to inject into the arm a new film in the franchise. The ST: TFA fix is short lived. Like a sugar rush. Inexorably, time ticks on. The high subsides and one is left, well, empty."
3695,5,Episode IV Remade In JJ's Image,Good points about the movie:
3696,1,Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope,"This is a white savior narrative set in space. If you have been to a movie in the last 25 years you know this story. A white person (usually male but not always) enters a culture of people of color. (any color not just African American.) He then liberates them. There are female variations (The Blind Side). The implication is clear. The person or persons are unable to help themselves without help from the white savior. Here we have Finn who appears to be the only black person in the First Order escaping from the white hegemony. The slavery inference could not be clearer. While it's true that Finn initiates the escape it's Poe who ultimately pilots the tie fighter. After landing on Jakku, he meets Rey. On numerous occasions Rey saves him. When he finally faces off against Kylo Ren it is Rey who once again comes to his rescue. So it's not a pure white savior narrative but it's a variation on it. Other users on here have criticized the films lack of originality and the fact that it is a remake of Episode IV. That is all true but that is the least of the films sins. This is a horribly racist film. Finn is the only black in the movie and while he does fight against the first order, he needs help from Rey and Poe and Han Solo (all white people) to achieve his final liberation. J.J. Abrams is Jewish. I'm not accusing him of being overtly racist and he probably isn't. But this film is another example of the white savior narrative that has become a Hollywood trope over the years. People have praised the film for addressing the (perceived) racial and gender inequality of the original trilogy. But in both the original and the prequels you had strong black portrayals (Lando in the originals and Mace Windu in the prequels) who were also strong characters in positions of authority and leadership. So the original films were much more progressive and far less racist than this film. I don't think you can blame J.J. Abrams but Disney has been criticized over the years for being racist. Probably not intentional but definitely there."
3697,2,White savior narrative in space,Tried not to mention any spoilers but the core of the review does mention a big spoiler (maybe) you be the judge.
3698,3,It is a small movie.,"Watching this movie is like seeing my childhood love-of-my-life girlfriend as a today fat, rude, ugly, broke, farting grandma'... It is not just a low-price copy of an work of art, it is a teenage movie with lasers. The Star Wars series had such a planetary success because it is something else but a mindless go-for-the-people's-money action hero movie. You destroyed the poetry, the romance, the elegance, the philosophical view of the life. The FORCE is reduced to a run-of-the-mill cheap spell, easy for everybody to reach and use if they just closed their eyes and tremble a little. The lines are constrained and cheap pub humor is sprinkled around like bird-poop on the alley. You took an van Gogh painting and turned it into a child draw. I hope you are satisfied with the profits, because you killed the art and the magic in the process. SHAME ON YOU!! You broke my heart and my dreams."
3699,5,Action Hero = Movie ZERO,"Recently I came to the realization that my biggest problem with this film, which increases every time I rewatch it, is that without its connections to Star Wars as a franchise this film would be just another forgettable family-friendly action/adventure popcorn film that very few people would care about after the first 24 hours of leaving the cinema. It offers nothing more than loud sounds, flashy graphics, easily consumable characters, a plot that reeks of laziness and the Disney stamp of approval beside a film tag that might as well say ""Hey! Remember Star Wars? Us too!"""
3700,4,Mediocrity buttressed by nostalgia.,We all know how the prequels disappoint to everyone (Episode I specially) and the huge expectation to this movie to bring back the magic and nostalgia that the prequels don't have.
3701,5,"""Not what you expected...""",Contain spoilers of something can't be spoiled much more.
3702,1,Money making machine melting low level intelligence Earth population,"Excitement,anticipation, delirious child hood feelings and in the end major disappointment. Those were the stages of my force awakens journey.This was the first star wars movie i left without my jaw dragging on the carpet. Every 'WARS' movie has had several moments that kept me rambling on for months like a major fan boy. The George Lucas prequels get a lot of hate which i still don't understand. Each one of those is filled with a couple of glorious action set pieces. Pod race, duel of fates (menace),jedi charge at coliseum, clone war battle (clones) and probably nearly all of ep 3 is fan boy perfect (besides the dreaded nooooooooo). And you know what,at least lucas didn't tell the same story 3 times. Which is probably part of why people didn't like them. It started out so promising.The orders senseless genocidal raid on the encampment slated what i thought would be a great base story to establish that these guys make the old empire look like the brady bunch. But then things started taking an all to familiar turn, to the point where i was asking myself ""havn't i seen this before"". The plans stored in a droid, the loner unsure of their existence in the galaxy but secretly knows that the grass has to be greener, etc etc. Acting, writing and all general film mannerisms were carried out extremely hammy, boy oh boy does this have Disney's stink all over it. I'm really not sure if i want to see the next one because with all the unanswered questions and lack of character background and development I'm anticipating a 6 hour movie. Maybe they should of killed of Solo in the next one because maybe then with a bit more insight to the characters he was interacting with, the death of one of the most iconic star wars might have been a bit more then just a filler scene. As for Luke, well all i can say is don't put his name as the first two words we see. Then proceed to make us sit though 2 hrs to get 20 secs of what we all have been waiting 10yrs for. That would be like lucas stopping ep3 before we got to see anakin finally turn to the dark side. I could ramble but any sensible star wars fan will know that this has to be a very mediocre entry in to the franchise.If the next one is another average star wars movie the Disney brain trust might be calling lucas to see what he's up to."
3703,3,Take your rose colour glasses off.,"Looking for new material, character development, acting, dialog, special effects....well, not in The Force Awakens or not much at least but you will get rehash feel of the first movie. It feels like the bad lines from most of the last 3 SW movies. I think we can actually have the best of all worlds on this series. Hire some great writers and use the heck out of ILM. Quit redoing a death star type weapon. Making the fighter scenes look like 1960-70's model special effects is not cool. If you want that look check out the original movie which was good then. I want the space stuff to look like the best our technologies can make - now."
3704,5,Same old stuff from original SW movies.....actually a lot of the same,"So many errors. So much disrespect for the original story. As a 55 year old father of four I was ecstatic that finally I would be able to share with my teenagers the wonderment of the Star Wars saga. Imagine my disgust watching this total betrayal of the original. Too much glitz and explosions and not enough plot. We waited for 2 hours and 2 minutes only to have the long awaited Luke Skywalker appear in the last four minutes of the film with nothing to say. I would have just assumed to be mugged behind the theater, to take my $80.00, than to sit for that long watching this boring movie. It hurt that there was no respect for the spirituality of the force. It was insulting that the movie seemed to be more concerned with being racially and politically correct for this day and time than to put real actors in place as leading protagonist. One year from now no one will be able to tell you names of the actors that starred as protagonist and antagonist, such was the failure of this poor script. In the end I returned home from the theater disappointed. The only thing my 13 year-old son had to say was ""Dad, can we put on the DVD of the 1977 Star Wars?"" We did with homemade popcorn."
3705,1,The Force Awakens? Put us asleep.,"Like many other honest reviewers, this is the first time in my life that I have ever posted a review of ANY movie. I feel compelled to, due to the utterly farcical high star reviews out there, fortunately by now in the minority."
3706,1,Yes.... Star Wars is dead...,Don't be tools of commercialism and hackery at the hands of Kennedy and Abrams. Get your own stories!
3707,3,Women should get their own stories instead of being Hollywood gender switch tools,"i don't know where to start, but here it goes:"
3708,1,Only stayed in the movie to see how bad can they ruin the franchise..,"The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because, after enduring the prequels, it was nice to see Han, Luke, Leia and Chewbacca again. Beyond that, I have some very big issues with this movie. First of all, if Luke (the superhuman Jedi Master) has gone into hiding and doesn't want to be found, then why is there a map that says ""HEY EVERYONE.... Luke IS HIDING OVER HERE"" and why does everyone seem to know about this map??? Second major problem, at the beginning of the movie, Rey had only heard rumors that the FORCE existed, had only just found out that she had Force ability and has had no training whatsoever, but somehow she's able to lay a beat-down on a trained Sith ???? And why does this same Sith Lord seem barely able to handle a light saber fight with Finn, a non-force using human ??? Third of all, in the first STAR WARS, why did the rebellion need detailed plans for the Death Star, a full invasion force and Luke's supernatural Force skills to destroy the Death Star, but in the Force Awakens, all that was needed was a sanitation worker with no skills, a few low level explosives and a couple of easy X-Wing blaster strikes to blow up the much bigger Starkiller base??? And why would Han Solo ""lose track"" of his most prized possession for so long, and then happen to conveniently look out the window and happen to miraculously find it flying by ??? "
3709,4,STAR WARS: The Plot Holes Strike Back,"Like most of you who have seen the originals, you must have seen the lack of originality in this script. Visually stunning, Yes. That's about it."
3710,5,"Blah Blah, Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah, Blah Blah Blah Blah",Worst Star Wars movie.
3711,1,JJ Abrams shall never be forgiven,"Well this movie was fun.It's interesting and it surely feels good to revisit Star Wars universe after all this time.Some visuals were quite nice too.Unfortunately this movie was killed by his own screenwriters.Never in my whole life I noticed so many plot holes in any movie.Almost every scene has some kind of mistake,contradiction or something deeply illogical or totally unexplained etc etc.Another Death Star with same weak spot? Luke's lightsaber lost in ep.V magically appears in Maz'cantina? Rey's instant jedism after no training at all? Finn's half-jedism because why not? R2-D2 suddenly turns on after years and years of inactivity? How wrote this thing,a child?"
3712,3,More plot holes that one can count,"Totally disappointed. Wasted my money. If you have seen the old series you will be utterly disappointed. Nothing to do with it. Plot absurd and I 'd say practically inexistent. I really can't figure out what was it all about, what have I watched. The old stars looked quite... old and exhausted, while the new ones had no talent at all. The whole film looks like a parody of the old series. Or is it exactly it and I have not figured it out? Can not find anything positive. Even the graphs were not impressive at all even if the technology is supposed to have advanced nowadays. On the other had I may have grown up.... Maybe that's the problem. I don't know. Maybe kids will find it more interesting than me."
3713,1,"Boring, no plot","The storyline relied on mere coincidences too much even at the beginning, and I did not quite like it how the main protagonist seemed to have just been drifted into the flow of galactic events only by those coincidences. Also, I felt it was unexplained how she was just immediately competent at everything, even to the point of using the force without any training. The really bad thing with this is the absence of the mentor-disciple relationship, which was an integral part of every Star Wars movie. Also, characters somehow did not bond, character development did not really happen, and it was not even needed, because the villains simply were just not that threatening to make it necessary. Lightsaber duels also were a disappointment, and the way Kylo unnecessarily was flailing around with his lightsaber, like slashing at the furniture in his angry tantrums just completely dispelled the aura around this weapon for me."
3714,1,A complete rip-off,***THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS***
3715,5,Spoiler warning: Very Disappointed by a Galaxy Far Far away,"Nothing more than the ''A New Hope'' re-filmed with better CGI, with the exception that the main villain of the movie is pathetic. Honestly,the main plot is IDENTICAL with Episode IV in every respect. In addition, you have a bunch of plot-twists that are revealed too early in the movie, plus a number of serious holes in the way the scenario unfolds. "
3716,1,The Force is weak in this one,"Seriously?! The Force is Sound Asleep. I went in with low expectations and it couldn't even clear that bar. I had to fake occasional interest so that my son wouldn't see my brutal disappointment in this film. I can't believe that with all of the time, money, and hype this is all we received. What was JJ thinking? I actually like both of the Star Trek reboots, now I'm afraid of what the next one will hold."
3717,1,My eyes were sore from rolling them so many times in disbelief.,"Disney just took the original Star Wars story and replaced all characters with blacks and females. Just because you changed the skin color of the characters, it doesn't add anything to the Star Wars universe. It's not better than the prequels. However it's still an enjoyable movie with some very good action scenes, but for me it's a huge disappointment. Oh and Kylo Ren is a newbie in this movie, he is not even close to a Jedi. The only good character is Supreme Leader Snoke. I can not say more than that. The new characters are simply not working, we can see some very poor acting from Boyega. Rey is average, Adam Driver is a good actor, but his character is poorly written."
3718,1,Overrated propaganda,"Where does one even begin with this joke of a movie? This has to be the most over-hyped and most disappointing movie of all time. The story is literally copied and pasted from A New Hope, only with horrible plot and laughably bad dialogue. The visuals is the only thing I can say didn't suck, besides Snoke looking like the orc villain from the Hobbit movies. The amount of plot holes in this movie is absurd. People hated on the prequels, but The Farce Awakens is exponentially worse."
3719,1,"Worst Star Wars Movie, and it's not even close!","Stunning and brave Ray lives as a pauper, on a sand planet once inhabited by the cooler and prettier Luke Skywalker, then she meets the ball robot and the random diversity cast, then they meet old Han Solo in a parallel universe where he is not cool, (everything isn't cool in this universe) then Raymond suddenly knows more than Han Solo how to ride the millennial falcon and repair it, then they dispatch of him, cause old characters are here to make room for the new generation, Daisy Ridley is a good looking actress and also capable, but Ray is not a great character, she never struggles because she can't be instructed by men."
3720,3,"non stop action, but sheetee","Absolutely HORRIBLE!! I wanted my money back and I saw it for free. No plot. No acting. NOTHING! They took the best parts of 4, 5 & 6 and lumped them into one movie and that movie sucked. Growing up as a kid the Star Wars movies were awesome. Always something new, always something different. You looked forward to going to see them. Then they got weak, real weak, with 1, 2 & 3. Now they put out some crap and call it a movie. They should be ashamed. All Star Wars fans should revolt and demand their money back. Gets the title of WORST MOVIE EVER!! Guess we will have to wait until the next one to see if this franchise is great or simply another money grabbing sleeper for the burn pile. I think I will go watch Star Trek from now on."
3721,1,Worst movie EVER!!!,The only two saving graces of this Star Wars outing is ole faithful Harrison Ford's Hans Solo and the new oldie Lupita Nyong'o's Maz Kanata. 
3722,5,"Average-y, Spark-less, Oomph-less, Point-less","This movie is the contradiction of what Star Wars ""A New Hope"" was back in 1977. The movie heavily relied (if not straight copy & paste)on ANH, but it lost all of its spirituality and what Star Wars was about. "
3723,2,Say goodbye to the era of great Sci-fi film makings,It was a remake. They should have went with the expanded universe.It was a remake. They should have went with the expanded universe.

3724,1,Remake of a New Hope,"I was really looking forward to this movie. However, halfway through I was ""please, stop!"". This movie was painful to watch. It had all the nice landscapes, the Millennium Falcon some returning characters... and that's it. No substance, a copied plot, characters who feel like cardboard cut-outs and dozens upon dozens of ex-machina moments to keep this mess flowing."
3725,2,This is not the Movie you are looking for,"Where to start with this awful movie? I'm disappointed, sad and can't understand how all these mistakes got through. It would have been so easy, but not for Jar Jar Abrams. He was even chosen as film personality of the year 2015. Yes, favouritism is reigning supreme in Hollywood! So, off to the movie, why is it so freaking bad?"
3726,2,The force is weak with this one....,"For fans who hated the tragedy that George Lucas created in episodes 1, 2, and 3, you may hate this movie as well."
3727,4,"Very entertaining, but...",How to begin? I guess i should start with something along the lines of;
3728,4,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Disappointment Awakens,"On paper, it is super easy to distinguish between a sequel and a remake: sequels are the continuation of a story established in a previous installment, as STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS clearly is; while remakes are the same film done over again in a (more or less) different way. Yet it is difficult, when watching THE FORCE AWAKENS, to shake off the feeling that you are actually watching an ever so slight variation on A NEW HOPE, the very first episode in the saga."
3729,5,"The Star Wars Megamix; or, J.J. Abrams Strikes Back","If you take this movie at face value and do not consider the previous Star Wars movies, it is very good. However, if you look at if from the standpoint of what-happens-next-in-the-Star-Wars-Universe, it is lacking."
3730,5,Ehhh.,"Plot is important. Very important. Aristotle thought so. Every major scene in Episode VII was taken straight out of past Star Wars movies. Others have eloquently compared it to earlier versions of Star Wars, so I will not duplicate their labors here. "
3731,2,"The Horror, The Horror. Aristotle would have ""had a cow, man.""","After re-watching episodes 1 to 6 for the first time in a while, it just puts into perspective how BAD this film was, and how it betrays everything Star Wars stands for. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a ""die hard"" Star Wars fan, but even I know this was trash. I remember when I was 5 and my family were staying up late one night to watch A New Hope. I only managed to stay awake long enough to see Luke & Obi-Wan meet Han & Chewie, but it wasn't for lack of trying because that film had my undivided attention. And it was no different when I got older. I hadn't seen Revenge of the Sith since the cinema...and I have to admit it wasn't as bad as I remember it being. Sure it was rushed and there were holes in the plot, but I didn't feel my IQ dropping or the need to leave the cinema. Jar Jar Binks would have been a better lead character than Rey. Not only was she shallow & 1 dimensional as a character, but this Daisy Ridley cannot act to save her life. Every time she was on screen, I KNEW she was acting, it was so obvious. JJ Abrams must have thought ""in order to really make this movie terribly bad, I'm going to go out and find the worst actor/actress possible to play the lead"", well mission accomplished JJ. And whenever Kylo Ren would have one of his ""sith tantrums"", it just reminded me of a liberal guy being triggered - not intimidating, not awe inspiring like a REAL villain should be. If Darth Vader just stood there and did nothing, he would still be a better villain. I'm honestly trying to find 1 positive thing to say about the movie, but I honestly don't remember it that well since I haven't seen it since the cinema and don't ever plan on watching it again via my own free will"
3732,1,Never thought I'd long for the days of Jar Jar Binks & little Anakin destroying the droid control ship on a fluke....yet here we are.,"Next time, give Timothy Zahn a call, now he can write. How bad can it be? Pretty dang awful. This follows the very first star wars trilogy, robot has info for resistance, bad guys hunt him down, death star on steroids, oh come on, give me a break. Is this the best you can come up with. It is an OK movie, if were by itself, but this tripe is a waste of time and money. I usually like J.J. Abrams, but this is his worst work yet. I can't stop thinking that a better script, that is original, might be where to start."
3733,1,crappy movie. Crappy Vader mask was ripped off from GI Joe: rise of the cobras,"Heartless, artless, empty and forgettable. This is NOT Star Wars, just another generic, shallow, mindless, 'action-packed' movie Hollywood is so good at churning out these days. It'll be irrelevant by next summer."
3734,1,"Smoke Monster, anyone?","Have you ever disagreed with someone about the quality of a production so intensely that you've wondered if the two of you even watched the same film? I'm sorry, everyone in the world, I thought The Force Awakens was a real snoozer. I'm not surprised that my eight year old nephew loved it, but I can't for the life of me figure out why the adults I associate with aren't offended at what we've been offered by Abrams as the continuation of the world's foremost loved space epic. "
3735,3,Star Wars: The Force Gets Boring,"It maybe Episode 7 but it might as well be Episode 4 because of the many references back to the original trilogy. I hardly remember what the second trilogy was about. Not only is this Star Wars repackaged for a whole new generation but it has gone PC. You won't find scantily clad female characters in chains here but you will find the same themes plotted throughout. Rey is the female version of Luke Skywalker. Kylo Ren kills his father just as Luke did. Then there are the Storm Troopers; fumbling sidekick droids holding secret messages; an adorable alien who advises Rey her potential ala Yoda style and so on. Abrams does try to inject more emotions into his characters but let's face it, the whole franchise is more focused on special effects, introducing new characters to sell more toys and products. It is very cunning in securing new fans, after all who can resist those light sabre battle scenes? Just the sound of one being turned on will whip up a little frenzy in anyone whether it be 1977 with New Hope or 1999 Phantom Menace. This is one goose that they will squeeze as many golden eggs out of for decades to come."
3736,4,Nothing new here,"if any film maker gets it right yep its definitely JJ abrams,he gets the job done properly at making reboot repeats.10 out of 10 for such amazing talented lazy screen writing.id give this movie a zero star but unfortunately I'm forced to give it a one star.shouldve been called the new hope awakens because this movie just copys episode 4 ,there is nothing new and no imagination at all.you would've thought that 30 years later after ROTJ there would be new space ships and original looking storm trooper uniforms but nope. and the planets had zero imagination to them.there was technically nothing fresh and nothing new at all.Disney should've stuck to George Lucas's vision and script they would've made even more money.R.I.P. star wars"
3737,1,wowww!!!!! such an awesome crappy remake,"I am not the world's biggest Star Wars fan, but I have watched the old episode 6 (and the 2 before it). Star Wars: The Force Awakens is number 7, but in number 6 Leia, Luke and her resistance rebels were victorious. In this film they are again rebels and just have one base again and so forth. What is going on here?<br /><br />The scenes are borrowed, but the acting is inferior also.<br /><br />I am writing this and becoming confused. What happened?"
3738,3,A Rerun With A Continuity Gap,"A big disappointment. More like a remake. Father and son meet in the middle of a station (bridge), a new Hedi realizes she is strong with the Force and learns how to fight and use it in like 5 minutes."
3739,2,"Copycat, written by 14 year old",OK so the special effects are good...big deal. SPFX should be used to help tell a story not replace it and what a poor effort this was in terms of story.
3740,1,Just a bunch of simple tricks and nonsense,"Why am I not surprised this movie wasn't as good as it was chalked up to be? I went into the theater hoping and praying that we would get a movie with a new plot but boy was I disappointed. I am truly getting tired of directors and movie writers thinking that just by throwing in some fancy CGI, you can basically make the story and progression of a movie little to NONE. I really don't understand how anyone could think this movie is anything but a rehash of Episode 4. It's so in your face how LAZY the writing and character development is. I guarantee that if you put all of the lines from the movie onto paper, you would have maybe, MAYBE 5 pages of dialog. I would have to say this movie was worse than Episode 1 (which is pretty hard to beat on the garbage scale). I forbid anyone else in the world to spend a dime to see this ""Movie""."
3741,3,"Same story, more CGI...",Spoiler-free review below:
3742,3,Disappoints,"Well, I saw the new Star Wars Movie done by schlock miester, Jar Jar Abrams. ""Janitors In Space"" is a better title."
3743,1,"Jar Jar Abrahms Mess, Worthless Sequel/Prequel/Whatever","The force is there, always, it surrounds us."
3744,1,The Force Does Not Awaken Plebs,"This is my first review, and I'm only writing this to say ""stay away from this crap"". A lot of people are convinced now that the prequels were better than this awful reboot/remake and God are they right. Why on earth, just to make money, you have to re-do entirely ""Star Wars - episode IV - a new hope"", and filling it with emo-teenagers a-la ""hunger Games""/""Twillight Saga"" with stupid dialogs (""... do you have a boyfriend""? oh please..), total disrespect of the FORCE and use of the old characters just to cash-in with nostalgia effect? At least, those first three episodes, despite being extremely full of flaws, were also full of devotion for each and every character and their back stories, and Lucas wasted a lot of time (our time maybe), explaining everything we had to know throughout the whole franchise. I'm not going to spend words on the spin near the end because by now everyone knows the fate of one of the most lovable heroes in the history of blockbusters. Watch that scene and just feel bad like you should. I mean we're talking about the guy ""who shot first""! Why the fk you have to transform him (and the rest of the old school) like a mono- dimensional figure, no evolution whatsoever... I mean... 30 years later and they're still playing the same character (the smuggler, the female general, the furry loyal friend ecc...) like ghosts or shells, like plastic figures for children. Shame on you J.J.Abrams and shame on Disney too."
3745,1,Total disappointment,"I'm just going to get right to the points that made this movie bad. In no specific order, here's what's wrong with Star Wars: The force Awakens: "
3746,1,I'm not exaggerating when I say this: This movie is terrible,"I wont babble too much on this review. The movie is visually stunning, but with almost 40 years of experience in special effects and a massive budget, could it be otherwise ? The score is way way less inspiring than the original ones which is a score you can listen to without watching the movies as it is one of the best movie scores ever written. The rest is totally unappealing... A was intrigued for a half hour, annoyed for another 30 minutes and then found myself waiting for the end to come as soon as possible as everything got really bad and tiring. I remember my reaction when seeing the prequels : we were all swept of our feet in contempt because seeing Star Wars come back to the screen was was we had waited for for about 2 decades. But as time passed and we saw these movies again we started to see everything that was wrong with them an now the consensus admits they are quite bad movies and they surely cannot come to grips with the original ones. I'm quite sure it will be the same with these ones, once the emotional effect gives way and people regain their senses. 3 out of ten for the visuals and the star wars universe, the rest is rubbish."
3747,3,"The Force Awakens, the fans go to sleep",They make you not want to watch this film. They are correct.<br /><br />This remake sucks beyond belief. I mean they made another death star and it has the same faults as the other ones!?!?!<br /><br />WOW
3748,2,Look at the keywords for this film,"The movie looks like Star Wars, in fact it looks A LOT like the movies we have already seen. Not much new here, just a retelling of the original storyline. It feels kind of like a money grab, playing on our sentimentality's The movie is just OK. If you had never seen any of the previous movies to compare to, then you would probably enjoy it. The killing off of a beloved character was not necessary, nor entertaining. He would not have been so easily killed. Once he stepped on the crosswalk you knew exactly what was going to happen and the character would have too. Princess Leia wasn't even necessary for the movie, especially for the little screen time she got. Apparently the new Jedis can develop their powers immediately and non-Jedis are pretty good with light sabers against fairly powerful force users. Villains were also sub-par. Disappointed."
3749,3,Disappointing,"When I first heard Disney was involved, I figured that it was only on paper, in reality Lucas film would own the show. I was terribly wrong... JJ Abrams clearly showed his ability in the high speed, out of space action that was evident in Star Trek. That is were it all ended for me. "
3750,5,A True Disney Disappointment,I saw the originals on VHS when I was about 8 years old and for 25 years I imagined and wondered what happened after Return of the Jedi. This movie could have been so much more and it left me wanting more because it didn't really give me anything at all. 
3751,3,Disappointed,I looked forward to this movie and was disappointed. All it turned out to be was a rehash of Episode IV A New Hope.
3752,5,Disappointing,"I can't believe this actually made it to the screen. It was like watching a cheap knockoff of A New Hope. It basically has the same plot-line - orphaned force genius growing up on desert world that acquires a droid carrying important documents. They even had the nerve to throw in a new ""Death Star"". All it was missing was memorable lines. And what is the deal with the actors?! Being able to act was obviously not a prerequisite to being in this movie. The villain looks like something more fitting as a Disney prince. To top it all off, the worst thing about this movie is that they completely changed the story. If you've read the expanded universe stories (which were canon), you will be greatly disappointed. This takes a completely different story-line. To justify their actions, all those hundreds of stories were de-canonized; it makes me think of when Pluto was de-planetized. Unless you wish to waste 2.5 hours of your life, stay away from this one and stick to the original stories. Yet again, J.J. Abrams and Disney ruin another franchise."
3753,1,Cheap Knockoff,"At the very first landing of the storm troopers, the first squad coming out of their ship ran towards the battle and past a dead trooper. How did he get there before them? If for some reason he got off another ship, why did he die pointing in that direction?(the same axis of attack as the first troopers running out of the ship) This bothered me right off the bat. Character development was poor. Han's one liners took too much time away from the development of the new main characters. Another death star, now planet/sized. Very unrealistic. When you had the old death star, you had a major battle with fleets and massive fighter/bomber battles. In this one you maybe two to four squadrons of fighter/bombers duking it out. Mind you, this is a planet/sized death star. If the original DS had a hundred fighters for support then the new DS would have thousands. Since there was no fleet presence, there would be an automatic CAP of over 100 fighters with immediate support for half the rest. This movie should of been longer or been made a two part series. The movie was cramped."
3754,3,dead storm trooper/ how did he die?,"No story, no heart therefore no thrill that looks like a ""team effort"" where you can see the separate parts struggling to weld together, with little or no success whatsoever... "
3755,2,Lucas did it way way better,"Had I gone to see this movie myself, I would have walked out and gotten my money back. As it was, I was there with a friend and I didn't want to upset his enjoyment. So I sat there and took the pain and endured."
3756,1,Communicate with your friends,"It was a train wreck. Do you people out there really want to see the same plot over and over? The Jedi are MIA. The Galaxy is ruled by an evil empire. They have a huge space station that can destroy planets. Droid with important info gets lost and is found by the heroes. Space station is attacked and destroyed by the rebels. Sound familiar? The dialog was boring and predictable and I didn't care about the characters. If this movie had been made in 1977 instead of the first movie it would have been a total dud. The only surprise was when they killed off Han Solo, the one character I liked. Star Wars is dead, PLEASE let it rest in peace! I will never go to another movie with J.J. Abrams name on it."
3757,1,J.J. Abrams ruins another franchise,"Commercially, the movie has been well planned: - For new timers, it is a quite enjoyable stand-alone movie. - For Star Wars fans (or just people who have seen all the previous movies), it has the stamp of Star Wars, so regardless of the content, they will watch it."
3758,4,"Decent movie for first timers, a reboot for the rest","The Force Awakens is a sad collage of scenes and bits that we have already seen - and much better - in Episodes IV, V and VI. "
3759,1,"Unimaginative, shallow regurgitation of things already seen",The title says it all. It is a lackluster movie that blatantly copies A New Hope yet manages to have none of the qualities of the original first movie. Considering I'd give it a 10/10 because it's a star wars movie I have to remove one point for each:
3760,1,Star Wars Episode VII: A False Hope,I would give it a score of 1 out of 10 if not for the old casts making appearances. First I'm not sure why the main characters don't seem to have any relevance to the story?? If not because of the massive marketing done by star wars had i base my perception on the trailer i wouldn't have spent a single cent to pay to watch this parody. 
3761,2,"Utterly Disappointed, I'm amazed it has a score of 8.0 on IMDb?!",Warning there may be the odd spoiler.
3762,1,Shameless rip off of New Hope,"I have never Been liked star wars, i never find some interesting, but this new One ir awfull, more reason to hate star wars."
3763,1,Well i hate star wars but this reboot is terrible,"This will contain spoilers... Thankfully I went to the theater before noon and only paid $6 too much to see the most anticipated movie of 2015. As I watched it, I felt that I had sort of seen this before...oh wait, I did see it back in 1977. Also, I spent much of the movie confused because key characters from the past weren't behaving in a manner consistent with their core beliefs/values and new characters were able to do magical things such as Rey's very capable command of the force without prior training. Another reason for my confusion was that I was unaware that Disney cast aside 40 years of Star Wars Expanded Universe canon, so I was anticipating a story from the Expanded Universe timeline. Add to this, Disney/Abrams apparently raided the EU treasure chest before heaving it overboard because they utilized names, character profiles and weaponry from the EU. Example: Ben is Luke Skywalker's son in EU, here he is Han and Leia's son. Rey exhibits the characteristics of all three of Han and Leia's EU children. Even though I managed to set my expectations and confusion aside, this movie was still a huge disappointment. All of the hype surrounding Captain Phasma was a joke since she had roughly 3 scenes, two of which portrayed her as a complete wimp. The new Empire's guidelines for promotions must be extremely lax for her to achieve the rank of Captain. She added nothing to the story line. CGI was average at best. Kylo Ren/Ben made Anakin seem happy,angelic and generally well adjusted. Plus, Kylo Ren was not feared as previous dark side users have been, essentially it seems the troops are somewhat embarrassed for him and his emotional outbursts. The scene in which General Hux channels Hilter and the troopers respond with a Nazi salute was in very poor taste. In reading other reviews here I realized I was not alone in feeling the need to watch it again simply to see if I had maybe imagined it was so horrible. It was poorly written,felt forced and was completely disrespectful to previous Star Wars story line,characters and fans. The Force Awakens sucks only slightly less than the Maw Black Hole Cluster in the Kessel Run."
3764,1,Star Wars VII: This Failed Abysmally,Where have all the good directors gone. Where have all the good casting directors gone? Where is the heart? They just didn't care. Everyone who has give this movie a poor review I applaud you! It's deserved!
3765,1,Why? They Literally have Given Up!,"Han Solo dominated too much of it, while the female lead was a born at birth master Jedi who requires no training. Han's son, the bad guy, looks like his outfit was made by a 2 year old though.. But we know nothing about why he would have ""turned"" to the dark side. Were Han/Leigha beating him? Come on folks."
3766,2,"been there, done that","In reality this movie deserves a 5.5-6 star rating. Due to it being ranked in the top 250 movies of all time being at a 8.1, I am forced to give it a 1."
3767,1,"Reboot/Rehash, Overacting & Not The Force","I'm a big Star Wars fans, I've seen all the movies, all the video games, toys, all the clone wars cartoons, books, comics. "
3768,1,Bad movie,"Truly a BAD Movie . . . No magic, no re-approach, pure regurgitation, scratch that! Regurgitation done badly."
3769,3,People are desperate for meaning . . . This was a bad movie with an old concept that once rang true,"After knowing that J.J. Abrams and Lawrence KAsdan were going to be on board the new project, I was expecting the movie anxiously. The Star Trek reboot done in 2009 was, in my opinion, an excellent movie. However, after getting out of the cinema, the magic (or ""the force"" in this case) were not with me."
3770,3,"Entertaining, but disappointing","The movie is so busy jerking to its own franchise EVERY FIVE MINUTES that it leaves absolutely no room for character development, plot, setting, story-telling, atmosphere or personal interactions until eventually it just resorts to shallow and cheap emotional manipulation to compensate for its complete lack of humanity and inability to get the audience to care about anything it has presented on the screen."
3771,3,A guide on how to make a movie entirely out of references without writing a plot or characters,"It shouldn't be called Star Wars! It is rubbish! It is disaster! The story is rubbish! The act is rubbish! The scene is rubbish! The music is rubbish! It completely violate the spirit of Star Wars! Lack of everything a Star Wars movie should have! Completely Disaster!!! I went to look this movie as some supplementary stories of Star Wars, but after the movie I felt like being shot and shot again to the heart!As George Lucas said, ""The issue was, ultimately, they looked at the stories and they said, 'We want to make something for the fans.' People don't actually realize it's actually a soap opera and it's all about family problems – it's not about spaceships. So they decided they didn't want to use those stories, they decided they were going to do their own thing so I decided, 'Fine.'""So they make a worst ever story out! If you are a true Star Wars fan, please be away from this rubbish movie. It is not a Star Wars movie, it is nothing.I don't want to see anymore true Star Wars fan cry out of movie theater because of betrayal made by J.J.Abrams! Remember! Don't look anymore J.J's Movie. No FORCE there! The FORCE is not with him!"
3772,1,It shouldn't be called Star Wars! It is rubbish! It is disaster!,"This is my first and only ever review. Big Fan of IMDb, but i wanted my say, because i thought finally we were going to get a movie befitting a continuation of the original story line."
3773,1,What a waste of Time & Money,"They blew up a bigger death star. They had an angrier Darth Vader impersonator. they had a bigger emperor palpatine with a more opaque hologram. unsurprising family ties for the villain were introduced poorly in the end. The Jedi had fewer places to seek refuge. One of the light sabres had an extra saber thing. A droid carries vital information that is critical to their success, but this time it rolls."
3774,4,"Lets do everything ""bigger"" but exactly the same as episode 3","Interesting but not exciting. New characters, sure. Older actors seen in their roles again, OK. Everything happens within a plot that seems derivative of every other Star Wars movie - so nothing really new there. One might ask -- so what can you expect, given the preceding movies? One thing would be a finale that is not just a rehash of the ""destruction of the death star by rebels in x-wing fighters flying down a tunnel"" scene from the first movie, right down to the ""final countdown""that results in destruction of the enemy world seconds before the evil weapon of mass destruction is operational. Send those screenwriters back to writers boot camp and come up with a better ending! The movie was mildly entertaining, but I expected more. The popcorn was fine,though."
3775,5,Interesting but disappointing,"OK, let me count the number of ripoff points from Star Wars original used in this latest film."
3776,4,rip off of original Star Wars,"Optically, the movie was great - hands down. But the mass of plot- and logic-holes are devastating."
3777,5,"Full of Plot- and Logicholes, but still nice popcorn-movie","This movie franchise is primarily watched by male viewers. I have no problem with female protagonists, but you don't replace Luke Skywalker with a Mary Sue/Karen...which exactly describes the character of Rey."
3778,1,Yet Another Fem Agenda Flick,"I was told by a friend that I went to The Force Awakens with my mind already made up. I am not in the habit of going to midnight screenings to waste my hard earned money. I was so looking forward to this, I can't firm this up any harder. "
3779,5,"I am NOT a hater, I just like good movies",Because Di$ney purchased the advertising Gold package...
3780,2,"This Web Site Started This Film At 10,000 10/10 Votes","This movie really did an injustice to the original legendary characters and their futures made no sense. Spoiler alert!!!Every one of the original characters ended up losers and failures. Han went back to smuggling, Leia's marriage ended in divorce, r2d2 is running on low power(depressed) and Luke is running from his problems and is still the last Jedi. How ridiculous! Anybody can use light saber with no training...really? The first scene in this movie was supposed to be glorious like back in 1978.Instead it sucked- Too many shadows and bad camera angles. Too much fire and blood for a star wars movie. Lasers not fire. Ben is supposed to be Lukes son, not Hans! This movie crapped all over the loyal Star Wars fans. I'm disappointed. I'm boycotting episode 8"
3781,3,Not for a real StarWars fan. Spoiler warning!!!,Massive Star Wars fan having watched the original trilogy at least a minimum of 300 times each.
3782,5,Nothing New to Hope,"While there were many problems with The Force Awakens such as it being a rehash of the original, the hurdle which I found the movie completely flops on was; - the characters"
3783,3,Wooden Characters with no Complexion.,"When I saw what the idiot Abrams did to Star Trek, I was furious. When I learned that he was going to direct the latest Star Wars movie, I knew exactly what would be the result; a total abortion of a great franchise, just as he did Star Trek."
3784,1,The Force Awakens - Review,"There's a lot to like in the seventh cinematic entry of Star Wars. There's also a lot to groan about. Coming from somebody who is more than a casual fan, having read over 60 novels and played a score of LucasArts games, some of this may feel a lot like treading familiar ground. For a more casual fan, this film may feel fresher. I think the latter is whom this film is meant to appeal."
3785,2,"Good Story, Dumb Film",So the haters of the prequel trilogy got their wish. George Lucas had nothing to do with this abomination. Nothing felt right about this piece of fanboy fiction we are now forced to call episode VII. It just didn't feel like a genuine star wars film. 
3786,2,your focus determines your reality,"I usually don't comment on movies I've seen, but with so many critics praising this movie, it makes me wonder if those people were on drugs while watching or were paid to say something good about this movie. If this movie is amongst the top 10 movies this year, then 2015 is a very poor movie year. This movie is NOT on the same level as IV, V and VI which I've seen statements about. In I, II and III there is a lot more character development but of course Jar Jar Binks kills those movies."
3787,2,Nowhere near the original ones. Thanks for killing Star Wars for me!,"When this movie finally came out, my hopes were incredibly high. I love Star Wars and since its universe had so much potential for great stories, I was hyped that new life action Star Wars will come to life."
3788,4,The beginning of a disappointing era,"I am a massive Star Wars fan. I loved the 1st trilogy, I did not like the prequels. As a standalone movie, this movie is a good movie: good actors, great effects (and it is good to see they did not use only CGI like in the terrible prequels), the actions scenes very very well filmed, and last but not least, it was awesome to see the old cast (Solo, Chewie, R2-D2, C-3PO...). However, this felt like a pure and simple remake of Episode IV (A New Hope). There is a big sentiment of ""deja vu"", and a big lack of creativity. Some examples: 1) In Episode IV, the plot starts in Tatooine, a desert/sand dune planet. In The Force Awakens, the plot starts in Jakku, also a desert/sand dune planet. 2) In Episode IV, Princess Leia leaves a message in a droid (R2-D2) for Obi-Wan and the Empire will try to find that droid. In The Force Awakens, Po Dameron leaves a message in a droid (BB-8) for the Resistance and the First Order will try to find that droid. 3) In Episode IV, the Empire has a Death Star that destroys planets. In The Force Awakens, the First Order has a Starkiller Base that also destroys planets. 4) In Episode IV, the Rebels meet up to make a plan to destroy the Death Star and you see a large map of the Death Star and its one weakness (destroy that specific one reactor). In The Force Awakens, the Resistance meet up to make a plan to destroy the Starkiller Base and you see a large map of the Starkiller Base and its one weakness (shoot in that one specific spot) 5) In Episode IV, there is someone in the background that pulls strings (the Emperor), you don't know much about him yet except that Darth Vader works for him and is his apprentice. In The Force Awakens, there is someone in the background that pulls strings (supreme leader Snoke), you don't know much about him yet except that Kylo Ren works for him and is his apprentice."
3789,1,It is just a remake of Episode IV (A New Hope),"Like any child of the 80's I grew up on many classics only to see them get ruined in the 2000's, and the latest entry is The Star Wars saga. Truth be told I'm not such a great fan of the series, I am more of a Lord of the Rings type, but I am an avid movie goer, and I am a sucker for the Big Screen. But Lately I've been beleaguered by a bizarre feeling every time i have watched a movie. I mean the feeling of a familiarity of being with that obnoxious relative whom you need to spend time with some every holiday or family get together, and not that of being with an old favorite couch which for unknown reasons you can't part with. That feeling of familiarity seems to be accompanying me with every themed movie or movie for a mattar of a fact that I watch lately. So just to name a few ; the Hobbit, Star Trek, Transformers(excluding the first), the new Spider-Man and Batman and Superman and just every comic book movie, The list of course spirals on and on and on. Sure each movie I see is different, but it is different only by name and settings."
3790,5,"If you've watched more than 20 movies in the past 10 years, don't bother with this one.","I saw the new Star Wars today. I'm probably going to be the odd ball here, but I'm not sure I liked it. The special effects and cinematography were bad ass, and the combat scenes were stellar (pun intended). But the plot was mostly rehashed, albeit with some new additions, like a turn coat imperial. There was also a tragic twist that I saw coming a mile away (and hoped I was going to be wrong but wasn't), that robs the story and saga of the lions share of it's personality. It reminds me of the new Star Trek 2, with the rehashing of the Wrath of Khan plot. I guess I would have liked to have seen some more originality in the new story rather than the same old plot, just done bigger. "
3791,5,My mostly no spoilers Star Wars The Force Awakens Review:,"Saw it last night and I must say that I was disappointed.. I never expected to be amazed, but this movie cannot deserve average score above 6 and it has 8.6 at this moment?! By my opinion it is too much for a movie that doesn't have that ""WOW"" effect.."
3792,4,Very good marketing over something not so good,Bring back George Lucas. All is forgiven!!!
3793,1,Star Wars is Dead!,This is my first public review in 8 years with IMDb and there is a reason for this.
3794,2,Awful. IMDb rating misleading !,"What made so good the previous episodes of the Star Wars movies were the good stories for each episode. BUT for this episode 7, the worst is the story!! If you have seen the previous Star Wars movies, you must remember that the original story is basically identical to the story of this episode 7!! It did make a lot of sense with the actors used the first time this story was used of hiding the plan of a death star in a droid but to go as far as reusing a similar story again for this episode 7 but this time to hide the location of Luke Skywalker, it does not make sense anymore!! Basically, we have a near repeat story for episode 7!! It is not great at all!! More, the way the events are presented, they do not feel genuine, really authentic at all!! "
3795,4,"Lack of a good story, a few actors that are out of place!!","First, please forgive me for my bad English. I have never written a review before but I felt so depressed after seeing this movie."
3796,3,So disappointed,...and SAD at the same time.
3797,5,These reviews are HILARIOUS...,"I think that's the first review I've written on IMDb. But this review needs writing. I have never been an avid fan of the series but I highly appreciate the first trilogy for the characters and the plot and the artistic aspects. Even the second trilogy has its merits. But this? Total lack of imagination in remaking the plot of the original Star Wars film, badly written dialogue, poor characters. The whole affair seemed more like a cameo event for old movie stars... No one deserves to watch this movie. It's so boring you may fall asleep. The sad part is that it could have been the opportunity to create something new and original, much as batman was reinvented by Christopher Nolan and James bond by Sam Mendez. Another sad result is that it blemishes the entire franchise."
3798,1,what a loss of time watching this,"I am a fan and I did like the prequels and the Clone Wars series, OK they had their issues like JarJar and they could be a bit slow at times but at least they had a new story to tell overall. I liked learning about Anakin and how Palpatine took over."
3799,1,Just plain bad...,"One if the worst movies I've ever seen! Predictable, flat and boring! It adds nothing new to the sci-fi genre, cinematography, the Star Wars saga (you've seen it all before) and maybe even takes it light years back (yes, pun intended). How this movie got so many good reviews is beyond me. A 6 year old would write a better plot. The special effects harken back to the 70s except they don't have to. The plot is like a Swiss cheese: it has that many holes and it stinks. A major, $1 billion disappointment for the world. All the positive reviews must be based on nostalgic memories of gen X-ers - I simply don't see how anyone could write a positive review of this drivel."
3800,1,Ridiculously terrible!,"What else can I write, it seems everything has been written already..."
3801,3,Really Bad,This is merely due to the fact this movie rides on the sentimental value of real fans. Without that it has done nothing new*death star 3.0 anyone?* Main character is the literal dictionary definition of a mary sue and has no character developement. Fin is next he has a little bit of developement but its uncovincing and boyega im sorry to say didnt do very well acting this role*neither did daisy tbh*. Its just the hole thing thing feels like its some fan made movie which can be good but never great. Id maybe put this above the prequels but thats merely for the special affects. I personally like the story line of the prequels much more than this. 
3802,5,Not an 8.0,I want my money back on this DVD and Sonic won't take the DVD back apparently too many buyers of the Star Wars (so-called) DVD have been asking for their money back after purchasing the DVD and Disney does not honor returns from the store. What a shame.
3803,2,Anticipating this the local store yanked its return policy,"OK, this is my first review on IMDb and I had to do this. Im a big fan of Star Wars (Episode I-VI), I love both the original and the newer trilogies. I have my own ranking of all 6 movies, but I enjoyed them all for one main reason - they were entertaining. The series was full of new and original ideas, interesting characters and scenes that lingered on your mind long after you left the movie hall. Episode VII fails as a movie first - there is no character development, no original plot or ideas, its just a poorly done mash-up of ideas and scenes that made Episodes IV-VI so successful. You will not for once find yourselves thinking 'wow that scene was awesome' or 'that character was so cool' or 'that was an interesting twist'. I watched 'Jurassic World' a few months ago, Yes it was yet another movie about dinosaurs wreaking havoc on a remote island resort - but I loved every minute of it because it was entertaining and engaging. JJ Abrams and Co have been so busy concentrating on getting the VFX, costumes and sets to match the original trilogy accurately in an attempt to please hardcore fans. But in doing that they've distracted themselves from the essential elements that make a movie - 'a movie'. Star Wars VII as a movie is boring and predictable at best."
3804,3,A boring and poorly done mash-up of ideas borrowed from the original trilogy,"Yes, I felt it"
3805,3,"There's been a Hype, have you felt it? Vader replies: ¡Nooooooooooo!","What else can I say, FabledGentleman said it best and there is nothing else to add. This movie was the biggest letdown and I am sad that I spent money to be disappointed. The story was terrible with little to no thought devoted to the script. The story line was the same old story, revived from episode 4. No indication as to what happened over the last 30 years. No background info on the characters or who they are. The whole movie seemed to be rushed to the big screen for the sole purpose of making money. I'm sorry, but this is the Star Wars story, it deserves to be one of the best story lines brought to the big screen. Anyone who is connected to this story, needs to bring they ""A"" game. I really hope the next attempt, encompasses all the Star Wars has become."
3806,1,"Sorry to say, but this was the worst of all the Star Wars movies.",I've waited my whole life for more Star Wars. Ever since Jedi it's all garbage and this one is just one more. I have 2 little boys that I wanted to share this movie with But they don't even like it. Disney isn't getting any more money from me with this series of films. I'm done. 
3807,2,I've given up,"Now I am by no means the biggest Star Wars fan but I enjoyed the original series for what it was and even the prequels because it still felt like Star Wars to me. This, however, did not. "
3808,1,Reasons why I didn't like it,"The Snore Awakens! This movie is a poorly done rehash of the original trilogy and conveniently ignores everything that everyone knows about what happens after Return of the Jedi. 30 years later and everyone is doing the exact same thing? Did time just stop while everyone was away? Throwing in mediocre acting and poor character development (learning everything you need to know about a character in 15 seconds flat! Well, in Poe's case, they even outright tell you what you need to know in writing before you see him for the first time. how efficient!) which detracts from the movie even more."
3809,1,Critical Failure,Lots of CGI and special effects can't make up for the lack of imagination in the story line. I knew how it would end before the film was half way through.
3810,1,Don't bother,"Many people seem to despise The Last Jedi, and rightly so, but to me The Force Awakens is the movie that put theatrical Star Wars into a downward spiral from which it's yet to recover. There are some good elements but in retrospect this soft reboot didn't deserve the critical and audience adulation it got when it was released."
3811,2,"A New Hope, But Much Worse",Warning spoilers
3812,1,TFA is awful,I think TFA was very funny. So funny that the whole film became a joke.
3813,1,Very funny,"I went and saw this movie on the premiere and i was super excited, i thought that we finally would get a Star Wars movie that could stand up to the original trilogy... but no, instead we get a remake, remaster, reboot ( i don't know what to call it really ) of the original star wars but with ten times the action and no characters..."
3814,5,Star Wars: A New Ho... i mean The Force Awakens,"I was really disappointed with the story. There is not a single piece of the story, which was not somehow ""stolen"" from the old films. "
3815,1,Its a disappointing remake :(,"Capitalism at its finest: remake someone else's work, sell it as something new, steal from people in their faces and make a billion."
3816,3,Capitalism At Its Most Arrogant,": Summary: Cynical CashGrab that will kill story telling for years, as it is so profitable"
3817,1,"Cynical CashGrab that will kill story telling for years, as it is so profitable",Watching this movie is like having the pathways in your brain responsible for the feeling of deja vu malfunction and get stuck on replay. For 138 minutes.
3818,1,"Star Wars, Episode VII: A New Reboot","I have never thought I would create a profile on IMDb in order to write a review, but nevertheless, it has just happened."
3819,1,A childhood defiled forever!,"I do not have a hard time placing this film. On one side it's so typically hollywoodish - it's a super-production with Star Wars-related content that would make it probably to many Fan film festivals. It's very conventional in its Sunday morning TV message and the morality tale that it tells is quite conventional, and of course, we know the end of the story, either because we have watched Star Wars or because we have seen enough films from Hollywood or for both reasons. On the other side it's a film by JJ Abrams, so there is a dose of mainstream story-telling and inexplicable plot developments in its characters. The special effects are 100% created for the movie and uninspired."
3820,1,Just A Tool To Make Money For Disney,"I can only preface that I am a huge Star Wars fan, but this film fell very flat. I felt there was very little dialogue and many periods in the film that were rather slow and boring, My friend and I nearly fell asleep!"
3821,5,Disappointed,"Firstly, I am not a hater. "
3822,1,Star Whores - The Farce Awakens by Jar Jar Abrams,"I was a little frustrated with the movie . I think the concept of "" force"" has been trivialized . The Rey vs Kylo fight did not have much sense, because it was not in the same level of knowledge of the force than him and she still beat him . Another Death Star was also something that left me disappointed. I think they should have innovated a bit in this regard . Well, I expected more . The film has special legal effects and participation of the classic characters is very good. But the widespread use of force bothered me . As if it was more necessary training to master their knowledge. My score is 6. It could have been better."
3823,4,disappointed,"While admittedly fun and entertaining, The Force Awakens was not worth destroying the resolution that had been reached in Return of the Jedi. Why any true fan would defend a film that is nothing more than a big budget money-grabbing knock-off, is beyond me. It steals the entire narrative plot structure of A New Hope and repackages it with quick paced action so you don't notice the lack of morals, character development, politics, artistic musical score, beautiful choreography, and even fundamental philosophical force teachings, of the Lucas Star Wars saga. ""When you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back"" -Yoda. If you continue to watch the upcoming mass produced Disney films they will only continue to manufacture these heartless films to fill their greedy pockets. They already plan to do spin off films to this trilogy as they continue to develop it. Star Wars is the last mainstream piece of art (sounds like an oxymoron in this day in age) that hasn't been completely tarnished by corporate greed. Boycott this film and boycott Disney. ""It is the only way""."
3824,1,Lacks the Lucas Heart,"So, in my opinion, the movie is utter crap, and is an insult to the previews Star Wars (IV V VI and I II III)."
3825,3,Terrible,Saw this film on day 3 of release. This must go down as one of the most awful movies of all time. You could tell Harrison Ford's heart wasn't in it and Carrie Fisher looked as if she had just left the Green Room.
3826,1,What is this film about?,"first of all, it is not a bad movie! how to explain; George Lucas star wars were original and consider them as Diamond. this is a fancy shaped shiny glass. but not a diamond. you can only understand the difference when you look at them closer. you can only know the difference when you know about what diamond is. i want to criticize George Lucas. why he let this movie happen. how come he approved this story. first of all, original star wars is a living universe. Jedi's are respected defenders of universe and being Jedi is not easy and requires a lot of training from younger age with a master teacher. also being Jedi never means that you will win against dark side. dark side won many times against unexperienced Jedi's. only by time and training you can face with a strong dark side. this new Jedi self discovered everything does not fit original story. it was like meaningless hero movies. she discovered everything with almost only 1 trial error. what a woman. maybe some feminist stuff turning around here. normally no man is given this easy and cheap way of being Jedi. Lightsaber is so dangerous to hold for a normal soldier. he can hurt himself. but int his movie that guy was fighting dark side even with no training. there is deep politics. this movie was too shallow. first of all if you destroy a dead planet from weak point, making another bigger death star (to be destroyed), is not smart, also it is easy copy of original story. Luke is sad or depressed and ran away. how come? so he left the dark side stronger. it doesn't fit any logical thinking. moreover he is a Jedi. last thing he can do is hiding. i haven't seen any development at characters. Han solo still makes easy jokes. anyway I didn't like this movie as Star Wars..."
3827,1,Shallow Universe makes easy Jedi,The film starts off with Max Von Sydow dying after 1 minute of screen time (he was probably paid 7 digits to appear).
3828,1,Worst Star Wars film.,What can be said for this movie...
3829,1,Bewildered.,"I have never reviewed a movie before but this abomination forced me to do it. I was staying away from anything Star Wars related for a while now so I wouldn't see any spoilers. I didn't realize that when Disney acquired Star Wars that they would throw out almost 40 years of official novels. These books had been approved by Lucas. Disney now just makes up whatever they want. So anyone that has been wanting to see something from the books... I'm afraid you are out of luck. Disney only recognizes the 6(7) movies and their cartoons/video games as official canon. Basically, Disney decided to infuriate Star Wars' biggest fans. I will not be spending any more of my money on Disney's Star Wars until they learn to respect the past. So disappointed."
3830,1,Disney rebooted Star Wars!,"Well JJ has as predicted with Disney in tow ruined a once great thing. He won with Star Trek because it is an ongoing story that changed every week / film. But Star Wars is different, it was all about the Skywalker family and their tales of woe, good and evil. Everything then spun a story woven carefully and lovingly around them. Together with the mystery of the force and the obvious clash of the dark and light. Without going into Spoilers the story just was threadbare. There are many, many things here that are wrong and just not Star Wars. OK so as a stand alone film it was good. If it was not part of a bigger entity it may be right to say it was not bad. But it is and that is the point. It was re-hash, cheesy and silly. I am sorry to say this but as a true fan from the age of 4 and for someone who has truly loved the magic of Star Wars it is a sorry state of affairs. I attribute Star Wars for my limitless imagination i love it still. Though the prequel films lost a lot of that magic it was still there. They still seemed epic and had good story lines. Sorry Disney you are as we all know flogging a dead horse. Continuing a dead story to line your already deep pockets. You have robbed us for greed!"
3831,1,Poor Poor Story Line and Silly overall,"If you want to sell merchandise for a target of 8 to 12 year old children, in my opinion, they too deserve a better story and dialogue. Not in a million years would I have imagined that well loved franchises and films in general could stoop so low for the purpose of profit."
3832,1,"Movie Goers Deserve Better From Hollywood: Complete Failure, what a shame","What a divisive film. First there was the pile-on to praise it as the greatest thing since ESB, then almost 24 hrs later a massive backlash (imdb, various comment threads) accusing it of overly stealing/honoring the original trilogy (""Darth Plagiarious"" - LOL!). I personally have been swinging back and forth, not sure if this is a Mad Max Max Fury Road or a Superman Returns. Perhaps on a 2nd viewing I will enjoy it more after adjusting expectations. Or I may start counting homage shots. The Screen Junkies people don't even need to make an Honest Trailer for this one, it just writes itself."
3833,5,Extremely well crafted but without vision.,if I could register a negative score I would.
3834,1,A long time ago in a bank account far far away......The Shareholders Awaken,"I had no expectation from this movie and still it managed to be a complete sucker of a movie. Compare it to the last three then this movie is absolutely crap. The last three has such a huge amount of focus put into it but this one had a similar format as before, the story line was from previous movie but just changed slightly. It just ruined the whole feel of star wars. People say that its very good but the truth is that this is a disappointment. No efforts put into graphics. They had a budget of $200 mil but tell you what an avenger movie was more entertaining to me. Harrison ford's acting was awful and so was our dear princess. If the budget was about 50 mil the i would say its probably worth it but $200 mil and this is just an insult."
3835,1,The experience according to the previous one was just horrible,"Watching this movie, I could just feel that its creators wanted so bad to just remake the original, but knew that the fans wouldn't go for that, so they gave us a remake in disguise. They just shuffled the scenes, and where they didn't fit together they interjected some convenient coincidences to force them to fit together. Han Solo just happens to be in this part of the galaxy at just the right time. We need a light sabre, oh yeah, there just happens to be one from the original movie right nearby."
3836,3,Just a nostalgia trip,"Disney already has a new one out and you can bet it will be weeeak.. very weak. Episode 8 was an embarrassing death knell for Star Wars. Disney is just about the most disgusting brand in the world next to Trump, AT&T and maybe all those weapons companies like McDonnel Douglas and Boeing. Aside from all the standard Disney boring and tedious clichés like one-liner non-funny jokes which came at the pace one every three minutes (which made Star Wars a new episode of Ice Age!!!!) and the non-clone clone storm troopers why one earth would they think we want to watch a movie about a third orphan on a third desert planet?? w-h-a-t-e-v-e-r byebye Disney and bye JJ you ripoffs"
3837,1,I am writing this review in time to warn people against watching the new Star crap movie,see those bad reviews? those are the real reviews. see those good reviews? they either never a new hope or were paid to give good ratings for this movie. 
3838,5,how is this movie rated above 8 ?? did someone pay people to rate on IMDb?,This movie is beyond bad and is full of goods...
3839,2,Beyond bad and full of goofs,"Story and plot made no sense, villain Kylo Ren acted like an 8 year old kid no one feared him like Darth Vader bad actor for role. Rey the hero to powerful and everything that she did was perfect. She did not understand the force but once touching Anakins weapon could do powers that took years to perfect.Overpowered Kylo Ren how had years of training, Snoke made no sense as replacement for Palpantine and did not add to story and size was ridiculous how can anyone fight a 26ft tall man also bad CGI which if he had been practical and correctly cast might be more feared.Luke Skywalker at end of film did not say a single line which is completely out of character.Rey story made no sense and made females better than males as she was better than solo in falcon, better than Luke in Lightsaber duel and also using blaster. Rey should have been as good as other people not leaps and bounds better even than Kylo Ren how has had training from Luke and Snoke.Finn was used badly from fearing killing people to killing everyone on site through the movie. Han Solo was like watching Indiana Jones in Space. Was completely out of character when using chew weapon and saying that it was a better weapon than my own.Harrison Ford could care less about Star Wars as he does not like it and I agree about this film as it was garbage and dumb down. Leia was badly acted and added nothing to the story.C3-PO was so dumb and was not funny at all. R2-D2 has depression a droid is not supposed to have this.Complete copy of New Hope but badly written.Second time waiting I through that it was terrible through the movie.Worst film ever made Jar Jar Abrams did not have a clue what he was doing and it showed.This is far worst than the prequels and has turn me off any of The dark Side Disney Star Wars film.This is worse than the prequels by far. Not happy with garbage Episode 7 Star Wars Fake Awakens."
3840,1,Star wars Fake Awakens,"I liked all the Star Wars movies and I hated this one. Rogue I was written and produced to answer questions/fill in some gaps, but this trashy remake is inexplicable. The map to Luke is hidden in a droid is a major subplot; Han leads another team to destroy a support position (told you it is a remake) that leads to the death of the Super Death Star; etc..."
3841,2,Remember the Hollywood motto: Keep making sequels until the gross disappears,"Star Wars The Force Awakens was disappointing. The actors were terrible. Rey and Finn do NOT do justice to thier roles. The stormtroopers' fighting was mediocre. Kylo Ren taking his mask off revealed his ""cute"" face, thus not making the first order seem evil. What was the directer thinking when he did this? Finally, this film copies Star Wars IV too much, making it lack creativity. I would not recommend this film to anyone, as it is a disaster. 0/10"
3842,1,A disappointing addition to the Star Wars universe,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I really REALLY wanted to love this movie. I was so excited for it, everyone said it was amazing, I was desperate to see it. Overall, I was rather disappointed. Though the film was very reminiscent of A New Hope, I personally didn't mind it. What I minded was the other part in this scene where we're introduced to one of our main characters, Fin, a storm trooper who doesn't agree with what the First Order does, and very suddenly just decides that he's good. Not exactly like that, but it still seems a little forced and out of nowhere, especially since we got literally no introduction to his character what so ever. Fin decides to help Poe, a captured rebel pilot, escape and they do so in a very '2015 comedy' fashion. I.E. whenever something cool happens because of the main characters, they have to stop and tell you just how cool it was. Why this doesn't work in Star Wars: Fin. Is. A. Storm Trooper. He should have had enough training in shooting and fighting for it to be second nature to him. Granted, the Storm Troopers could never hit the broad side of a barn door, (unless they're shooting at someone who's not a main character), but that's not supposed to be true within the story. Within the story they're supposed to be soldiers who are super cool and can hit anything.Then we're introduced to a young girl, Rey, who has been abandoned by her family. Now they never flat out say that Rey is Luke Skywalker's daughter, but it seems to be heavily inferred that she is. Rey's character is everything Fin's character is not. She is calm, collected, and doesn't have to constantly talk about how cool the things she's doing are. She lets the audience see and decide for themselves. Fin is clearly in the film to be a love interest and comic relief. He's basically Jar Jar 2.0, as his comic relief is clearly just there to appease the 2016 generation. Anyways, Rey and Finn escape from Storm Troopers who are trying to capture the droid BB8, the droid who has the final piece to a map leading directly to Luke Skywalker, and I swear BB8 is the epitome of being adorable. They fly away in the Millennium Falcon, escaping from the First Order in a flight battle where Rey shows off her pilot skills. As they start making repairs to the ship, they are captured and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca, whom have been looking for the ship for the past twenty years. As soon as Han Solo and Chewbacca enter the film, it instantly picks up. Harrison Ford you can tell is having a blast returning to the iconic character he once played, and he still brings life to it.Before going to rescue Rey, who gets captured by Kylo Ren, son of Han Solo and Princess Leia, who is supposed to be this film's version of Darth Vader. He even has the mask and voice and everything. The rebels find them, and we are once again introduced to Princess Leia. This once again brought the movie down, as Carrie Fischer does almost no acting throughout her entire plot in the film. Her dialogue is all said very slow and she brings no energy to the role whatsoever. Through expositional dialogue between her and Han, we find that Kylo he had been sent away to train with Luke Skywalker, but there was too much Vader in him, and he was seduced to the dark side. It seems almost as though Leia is trying to be hopeful that Kylo can once again be good, but there is no weight to anything she's saying. Even though they go into detail about what happened, it still feels almost passed over as though it's not that bad that their son has turned to the dark side and killed hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. Without giving out too much of the rest of the plot, the whole thing just felt so lukewarm. There were a lot of missed opportunities with characters, and too many characters to keep track of. Almost nothing that happened in the film had any weight to it at all. No matter how many people were killed, (They literally killed off five planets at once at one point) there was almost no reaction to the characters. They showed us the people reacting as their planets were being destroyed, but it didn't really seem like our main characters cared too much about it. I would have liked to have seen more from Rey, Poe, and Kylo, as I felt for their parts, they were really well acted. Kylo has an emotional struggle and there seems to be a lot of rage and pain behind his character that I would like to see in the next film. Rey I feel has a lot of potential to go places, as she seems to be off to a very good start. She's interesting and has a good backstory, and her part is well acted. Poe I wanted to see more from because his character was so lively and enjoyable in the few moments he was there. Overall the film was just rather lukewarm and not amazing or terrible, especially with the character of Fin, whom I like to refer to as Jar Jar 2.0, who's clearly only there as the comic relief for the younger generation."
3843,4,"Better than 1-3, but overall rather lukewarm.","This film is meant as an earnest homage, much like the Star Trek films from the same director. Just don't expect anything too creative or risky."
3844,4,Biggest cosplay ever,"If you've never seen star wars before, it's great...other than an extremely non scary villain."
3845,1,Dismal,"Movie was a boring remake of episode 4 with elements of episode 5 and 6 the new cast was terrible poor acting and lame character development. JJ Abrams is a terrible director and episode 7 is straight trash most of the praise thIs movie gets is ohhh it's got a strong female actor lead and a black dude as main characters, which does nothing to actually tellin a story. People complain that episode 1-3 used too much cgi, well the cgi in e7 looked terrible. I'm amazed how anyone thinks this garbage is good, crap with a starwars title is still crap that is what epsidoe 7 is.. ..... Shame on Lucas for sellin because Disney Star Wars sooo far is terrible."
3846,1,"Boring, remake made for people who enjoyed Star Trek","So it seems many studios including Disney like their ""reboots"" instead of investing in creativity these days. The plan seems to be:"
3847,1,Souless cashgrab,"Poor story with many holed plot. And most of all, it really lacks originality. It copied so many things from previous episodes (especially Episode IV) that almost feels like a remake, not sequel. And plus some lousy actings and time-to-time meaningless wanna-be-sentimental crappy scenes. I'm just so angry that it made a billion load of record-breaking cashes only because of the brand. Really unfair not only to its previous episodes, but also to all the other good films with so many potentials and desperately needed more attention and budgets out there. I know blockbusters are for common mass, but It really shows how movie making qualities are falling (in overall scale) along with audiences' level. *For those of you who are loyal fans of Star Wars series and being over-defensive, search your feelings - deep down you know this one's boring and predictable. peace out v(^_^)"
3848,4,lacks originality,"I saw this movie last night, went out of cinema utterly disappointed, and then I saw this DUMB movie has such high rating hereon IMDb?! I mean, common, how can such a dumb, at-best-average movie have such high rating??? Well, of course, there are paid bots to up vote any c.... coming out of Hollywood these days, and these are many, many, many... Actually, I can't remember when was the last time I watched an smart and inspired movie?! Well, that's how low, miserable and CGI/Fake the Hollywood has become! With that being clear, I'll jump onto the actual review of this DUMB movie."
3849,1,Dumb Movie For DUMB PEOPLE!,"Yes, this is clone. It's not a new movie, not a new story at the slightest. It's a retrospective of the old movies, carefully copied, refurbished and renamed. The worst of it - it does not have any backbone, and the story we are offered as a core one is simply a crazy quilt of episodes which do not display decent synergy. If it was an attempt to please old faithful fans - that's a win. If it was an attempt to make a movie - well, that's an obvious fail."
3850,5,Attack of the clone,"I have seen too much of this. All the 10 star reviews that go 'c'mon people, this is a great movie.' Sure, but why? Because it has all the Star Wars regalia? Like a Death Star 10 times the size of the original Death Star, but with the same weak spot? Anyhow, plenty others have written about that. It's just one of the major plot issues that plague this movie. Others were quite eloquent about that too, and no one can deny those. And what's with the Force? Is it some kind of Harry Potter phenomenon that just 'is', at some appropriate time? I always found that the weak spot in the Harry Potter franchise, you know, he didn't have to do anything to earn it. That's just bad. And that was what was good about Star Wars, you had to earn the Force. Now it's just something bestowed on you and there you go. Others have written eloquently about that, too. Heck, all these eloquent writers... I saw the film twice and the second time, people, was just so hard... it didn't get any better, I mean, it was predictable to begin with, but the second time was just unbearable, you knew what was coming and the really stupid spots were highlighted so much more; I mean, just how much WTF? can you take? Like, 'we're entering the planet at light speed', yeah sure, and then you fly at a couple 100 miles an hour, then what? And these moments happen time and time again, like with these alien creatures on board the smuggler's ships, what the heck's with that, and why do these creatures eat every one immediately but not Finn? And on and on. What's with the whole space/time configuration anyway? It doesn't make sense in any way and come on, there's only so much 'suspend disbelieve' going' round and this one didn't tick the boxes with me - I have to admit I hated what Abrams did to Star Trek, it was just so stupid, I mean, the scene on that planet where Kirk gets chased by one creature and then that creature gets eaten by a bigger creature and then he plunges into a cave and there's Spock? Wtf? And it's that same wtf? that's going on here and it just doesn't belong in Star Wars, because it's supposed to be sure about itself. Stupid, yeah, but sure, and self centered and round, because behind it all is the Star Wars Expanded Universe and we have nothing of that here, I mean nothing, it's just an abomination, intended or not (imagine if it's intended), either that or they just didn't get it. So, let's look forward to episode VIII, where Rey will be somebody's daughter (probably Luke's), and the Empire, or the Rebels, or ANYBODY, will build a new Super Weapon, which will be easily destroyed, and there'll be new people to not care about (I didn't give a f*k about Rey, really, or Finn, or Poe Dameron - now what kinda name is that, 'Poe Dameron', I guess the next hero will be queer, which is fine with me, just give him/her a decent name, like Errol Flynn or John Wayne or something like that, maybe Winston Churchill, but alright, Poe and Flynn are queer and they all love each other till the end of times, alright, alright - where was I?) It was a halfway decent movie and this is a halfway decent review, so five stars to each and every one, but boy was I bored with this movie... and to think that back in 1977 I watched the original with my dad... 13 years I was and I thought the Force was mine. Mistaken I was. Oh yeah. But I wasn't the only one..."
3851,5,Aw c'mon,SPOILERS: I'm not going to bother giving a blow by blow of how bad this film is. I'll stick to the most ridiculous aspects.
3852,2,Makes the prequels almost look good,"I have never before written a movie review, but after watching this abomination I felt compelled to spread the truth: THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES!"
3853,1,...and may the force rest in peace,"It is just sad to see a wonderful story like the one this franchise has, being ruined. I am really surprised by those that give good reviews in this movie. Has any of them seen the original trilogy???"
3854,1,Remake of Episode IV: A New Hope,"There are other reviews with spoilers who have commented exactly why this movie is quite average - I will only generalize and summarize in this review. I liked the previous movies including 1, 2 and 3 more than this. There are several problems with this movie as other reviewers have mentioned. The new characters are not properly introduced and you are not likened to anyone in particular. There may be a story build up going on, but there is no compelling self contained story like in previous parts. The story build up itself and the relationships between the characters look ""slapped together"". There are few original things going on in the movie as well as mentioned by other reviewers. They have mixed and matched sub-parts/sub-plots, but involving similar type characters of previous movies together. "
3855,5,Disappointed.,THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.
3856,5,Disappointed.,I tend to view the Star Wars saga as more than just a story; but as a culmination of concepts and ideas (drawn heavily from Eastern mythological and philosophical thought processes). By this I mean the following:
3857,1,The very concepts that Star Wars stands for have been pummeled into the dust with this movie,I've spent most of my working day reading people's reviews and now i decided to make my own first ever review. The fact that i am taking time to register and post this shows how utterly horrible this movie is.
3858,1,Lost 50 IQ points watching this.,Its pretty much ANH with half the stormtroopers turned into women.
3859,4,A New Hope with PC casting and Better special effects,"This is just Episode IV without character development, good dialogue and originality. Oh, and let's throw Anakin's lightsaber into this because why not? Kylo Ren has awful dueling abilities and can't even defeat Rey, who has never used a lightsaber before. Rey suddenly discovers her powers out of nowhere. Han Solo had the most predictable death in the history of film. This movie was merely an attempt to make money off of people who don't know anything about Star Wars. Even the prequels had a better plot and action sequences. When did TIE Fighters have room for a rear gunner anyways? Overall, it was boring and predictable and a pure waste of money."
3860,3,Tries too hard to be Episode IV and fails at it,"But he's not happy to be the laughing jock, tormenting you in the changing rooms and pushing you down stairs. He pretends he's your friend, one of the misfits. He quickly positions himself as the leader of the group, and then destroys all the things you have a love for. (see: Star Trek)"
3861,3,JJ Abrams hates nerds.,"This is no movie . Star Wars The Force Awakens is merely the main part in Disney's grand marketing machine . This is as inoffensive and generic as possible. Gone is all the wit and charm , the imagination and vision from Star Wars. What we have here is a sterile product created to appeal and appease the widest possible demographic while alienating the fans . The only thing I blame George Lucas is for selling the rights . Although technically well done everything else is pure rubbish. Even the music is absolutely forgettable . John Williams was on auto-pilot while composing the music for this.The plot is a rehash of A New Hope . The characters are bland and stereotypical. The callbacks are over the top. Plot holes galore and logic is thrown out the window . Star Wars is dead but we will always have 6 fantastic pieces of art . I miss you so much George . I'm sorry ."
3862,1,Crushed .,"When i first saw this movie, everyone around me liked it and i thought that the world gone mad. But after The Last Jedi i understood that some people just like Harrison Ford and don't care about the actual movie. Some people just like cool effects and Sci-FI movies in general. Some people like Star Wars so much that they are blind to all logic because they already decided that move was flawless before they even saw it. Thats why im so happy that Rian Johnson messed up The Last Jedi so hard that people kind of woke up from their coma and realized that both of this movies are so stupid, so poorly written and so not Star Wars. These movies have so many plotholes that it's impossible to save. Just drop this trilogy and make a new one when you know what your customers want."
3863,1,Just another Sci-fi movie,"STAR WARS VII is a glorious victory for Hollywood. This is the most widely appealing, inoffensive, fun-loving, and convenient Star Wars that could have possibly been made. It will quench the thirst of thousands of fanboys and fangirls, remind the children of the 70s of the first time they saw a lightsaber surge to life on the big screen, and unquestionably snag the biggest box office success in history. It's the most colorful, snazzy, and crowd pleasing movie of the year."
3864,1,Sad,"Bleebeedee bleebeedeeshtoingblip, I am a baseball with a soup bowl on it, clingbleepbleebeedukshtoomp. My master is a resourceful human female with a argumentative and poorly coordinated black sidekick. Kluk. She lives in a dangerous environment where everything is blown up to pieces all the time. I find myself being a target for villains of the First Order, so she is too. Didoodidoodidoowizzz."
3865,2,Bleebeedee Blup,Two Words: NO GRAVITAS
3866,1,NO.....just....NO!,"Loved the first 3 Star Wars movies that were released, the last 3 I barely remember and actually fell asleep in the theatre during one of them. Now I'm wondering what was in those last 3, as this latest installment didn't seem to have anything story-wise that I felt I had missed."
3867,5,Derivative of the 1st One...,"How come, when JJ Abrams and co. set out to continue the saga, they felt the best option was to simply remake A New Hope, which already was a re-imagining of Kurosawa's classic 'The Hidden Fortress'. Now we end up with three movies that are practically the same."
3868,1,A New Hidden Fortress Awakens feat. Voldemort and Professor Snape,I'm not an Abrams fan at all so have dodged this film until now fearing the worst.
3869,4,The Clone Wars,"Abrahams should have just told us we were getting a remake of A NEW HOPE. I don't hate the movie. The action scenes feel like Star War, much more so than the prequels. The bad thing about the movie is EVERYTHING about the movie feels like A NEW HOPE. Who didn't know HAN was going to die when he confronts Kylo Ren? It was a complete redo of the Darth Vader/Obie One scene at the end of A NEW HOPE. They really needed to add a wrench into the story line that wasn't expected. Making Luke the bad guy would have been a good start. Instead, Luke shows up at end playing the the role of Yoda the trainer. "
3870,5,completely average movie: Remake of NEW HOPE.,"I've never been a huge fan of the series, but I definitely remember enjoying the first three that came out back in the 70's. For what it was, it was amazing. This new one fails on so many levels."
3871,3,"Boring, Predictable, Disappointing","I have been a Star Wars fan all of my life. While I was not born before the original trilogy was released I have watched them countless times and have been around for the release of every prequel trilogy movie. I've connected with each character and the stories that are told are timeless. With hearing the release of the new Episode VII and with J.J. Abrams directing it, I was definitely skeptical about it from the start. However being the dedicated fan I have been I gave the movie a chance and went to see it opening night. Unfortunately my skepticism would be right and I would be left disappointed. The plot of this movie is nothing new. A basic remake of A New Hope with some character changes is all I felt throughout the entire movie. Nothing stood out and nothing was new. The characters as a whole had no depth to them and I could not connect with characters such as Rey so easily as I did with Luke and Anakin in the past. The movie as a whole felt too forced upon the audience (no pun intended). The filmmakers obviously tried too hard to bring back the grandeur and depth of the original trilogy and in my opinion failed miserably. Another point that also annoyed me was the fact of the many plot holes in the movie. How does Rey coincidentally find Luke's original lightsaber in the box even though it fell off of Cloud City in Episode V with Luke's hand? And the fact to not even explain how it ended up with Maz. It just seemed like an easy way out on the filmmakers part to introduce Luke's original (Anakin's old) lightsaber once again. Plus the fact that Rey can use the force so well by the end of the movie to even get the lightsaber out of Kylo Ren's grasp when Luke could not even do that until the end of Episode V when he was already an almost fully trained jedi. Rey just realized she can use the force and already is able to do this? Doesn't make any sense. For a long movie, plots such as these felt way too rushed. I wish more character development had been taken place as from this movie Kylo just seems like a whining ""wanna-be"" Darth Vader and Fin seems like just a clueless Han Solo. Speaking of character development, I wish Captain Phasma was elaborated on instead of being shown for only five minutes and half of it being easily taken down by Chewbacca. The antagonists do not seem as threatening as they did in previous movies. Scenes like this and making Kylo already struggling with Rey already make them seem weak. The only thing I will give credit to this movie are the dogfights in space and on Jakku. These were both visually appealing and the only scenes that brought me back to the original movies I know and love. I'm all for more sequels to Star Wars, but do it right at least. Making a movie such as Star Wars is a powerful thing. No matter if its good or bad people from all over the world are going to watch because of the sole fact its Star Wars. But for a dedicated fan like me who has seen the other 6 movies countless of times, make it worth while. Stop milking a successful and timeless story and instead make original yet nostalgic editions to it. I'm only hoping Episode VIII and IX are able to do this. Until then I'm stuck with this unoriginal sequel."
3872,3,A Disappointed Dieheart Star Wars Fan,"The Force Awakens has a huge score on IMDb, yet it also has some of the worst reviews. While I certainly don't think the film deserves a rating above a 5, I also am confused at people giving anything below."
3873,3,Nostagia fueled mess,"Whoah!!! Where to begin? Well I am not a fanboy crazy of the Star Wars universe but I was 9 years old in 1977 and saw the first (Episode IV) movie in a 70s fleapit cinema in the north of England and loved it, bought the excellent Marvel comic adaptation comics, bought the action figures and toys (Boy! were they a rip off) etc.... Didn't hate the prequels but was appropriately unimpressed with them. And now at the end of 2015 I get to watch ""the movie highlight of the year"", ""the film fans have been waiting for"", ""the resurrection of the Star Wars legacy"" and well..... 1: The Story. It's basically a remake of Episode IV. A droid has important data to help the rebel's cause and is discovered by a young romantic protagonist in a back end of nowhere part of the universe. The empire has a planet weapon of mass destruction and wants the data. and... if you've seen the first movie you'll know how the rest pans out. 2: The Acting: Harrison Ford may sadly be too old for this kind of role and he had a nasty accident during the filming and this I conclude is the reason for what can be euphemistically called a lacklustre effort by him in the role that gave him his career. John Boyega is way out of his depth in a role that requires him to show a guilt ridden stormtrooper who moves towards the lighter side of the force (To UK readers who are Ah emm of a certain age) he reminded me of a talented young actor plucked from the set of Grange Hill and dumped on the set of Hollywood's biggest movie in production and told to do your best unfortunately it isn't good enough. Daisy Ridley was fine and was for me one of the few highlights in this movie, she shows range, enthusiasm and brings a likability to her character Ren. I actually wish Oscar Isaac wasn't in this movie as he is one of the half a dozen or so actors in the last few years who are really worth keeping your eye on (checkout ""A Most Violent Year"") and I spent most of time when he wasn't on screen (which is a chunk of this film) waiting for him to show up. Adam Driver plays Kylo Ren (the new Darth Vader) and I'm sorry folks but it does not look good when even a trainee Lord of the Dark Side shows a bad case of Beverly Hills teenage angst. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are only in this movie for seconds (literally in Mark's case). 3: Direction and Story: Weak and derivative on both accounts especially the story which is IMHO the most egregious offence inflicted on Star Wars fans in this movie. I bet Kasdan is laughing his *** off all the way to the bank. To sum up: It's the equivalent of The Artic Monkeys rerecording The Who's Quadrophenia with Pete Townshend brought in to supply a few vocals and guitar licks and the rest is just respectful if plodding cover versions and 21st century digital remastering. A very weak 5 out of 10."
3874,5,10 out of 10 my ***!!!,"I am a huge Star Wars fan, but I hate this movie on first viewing. I need to share some of the reasons. First, without spoilers a few huge mistakes: 1. The lightsabers are terrible. Both the sound and the visuals are changed for the worse, they look like they are on fire, not laser swords."
3875,4,So angry at this movie,"Alright I guess. But I truly miss George Lucas now. He took the time to establish his different worlds. You could see a descent last for like 30 seconds. In this one? 5 seconds. Maybe less. Remember when the x-wings attacked the death star in A New Hope? It took those fighters a good minute before the attack really began? In this one? -- ""The Rebels are comin!""/Bang! No tension. "
3876,5,I miss George Lucas.,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Wow. Lot's of Great effects, some pretty decent acting out of newcomer Daisy Ridley. Excellent cinematography."
3877,5,"The more water you add, the more Diluted it becomes....","Some will try their best to deny it, but the truth is the truth. JJ Abrams made an(other) annoying JJ Abrams movie, not a Star Wars movie."
3878,1,NOT a Star Wars movie,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I couldn't have been more excited to watch this movie. The original trilogy was a masterpiece (other than the second half of Return of the Jedi, but that's a discussion for another time). Episodes 1-3 were a disappointment to say the least, but I was a kid when I saw them so they didn't seem all that bad at the time. Now, of course, I can see through the cracks, and the cracks in this new start, to the new trilogy, has some mighty big ones. Let's explore some of them. And in case you didn't see the ""contains spoilers warning"", I will warn you once again. This will contain a ton of spoilers. Let's begin. "
3879,5,The Force Sucks,"I just watched it and the first thing that's coming to my mind is : what the heck is this?This movie has too many plot holes, too many idiotic characters, too many stupid jokes, too many downhills..."
3880,2,I can't call this a Star Wars movie,"There is a poor orphan girl who scavenges and has no money, house or friends..."
3881,1,Flatulence In A Galaxy Far Far Away,WARNING spoilers below.
3882,1,Horrible letdown,It is incredible and takes a lot of talent. It is a case study. It is an example that will be discussed in film schools for years.
3883,3,This Is Incredible,"I don't understand all the reviews saying this was the best Star Wars movie. This movie was a major letdown. I was expecting a new and fresh storyline, not the Original Trilogy plot line (mostly episode 4) all crammed into one movie. The entire movie theater was quiet after the movie was over and it looked like a funeral. This movie was so predictable and there were plot holes everywhere. The character interactions felt inauthentic. It's weird how Finn and Poe became best friends instantly. I also didn't like that Rey's character learned how to use the force, ride the falcon, and fix random things like an expert out of nowhere with no training. I like strong female characters like Ashoka, but I don't like it when the male characters respond to everything cool she does as if it was unexpected; this happens many times throughout the movie. I also hated the villains. Snoke looked like Voldemort and looked like a giant troll at first with bad cgi. Ren starts off cool and turns into whiny b*** as the movie goes on. I see a lot of people who liked it or who have been paid to like it saying that if you didn't like this movie that it means you didn't like the original trilogy. Thats BS. I love star wars and enjoyed episodes 1-6. This movie is so bad that I miss the creativity of Episode 1. Episode 1 was weak, but at least it was original. This movie felt like Age of Ultron and the Transformers movies. George Lucas needs to come back. He at least cared about storytelling."
3884,1,So this is how Star Wars dies...with thunderous applause.,"before they embarrass themselves anymore. Just quit.. learn from the dude who played Anakin in the prequels and just disappear because you suck.. really really embarrassing. At least Jar Jar Abramstein makes lots of cash for the synagogue that is Disney but the lot of you want-to-be actors should just give it up. Although we have been flooded by women lead films lately, I must say that Star Wars Rogue One was the best of its kind. Photography and scenario are great and the end of the movie is ""as good as it gets""...especially right before the end credits."
3885,1,I advise all the actors to quit the profession right now en masse,** Warning don't read this review if you haven't seen the movie. I don't plan on spoiling anything but to be safe. ** This film is one reason why plagiarism is a bad idea.
3886,1,A Disney Success - At Selling Water To A Thirsty Man In Desert,"Do not make same mistake and actually buy a ticket for this. Remember that George Lucas made a perfect SF saga as an artist, and he knew the story of each sequel much before ""New Hope"" was screened first time. This is a proof that Disney company is all about (your) money and no art at all. This is NOT a Star Wars episode. Don't expect it is. It makes me sad that Harison Ford accepted the role in this parody. Almost bad as Terminator genesis (or whatever spelling it is). You can meet several recycled scenes from ""Empire strikes back"" and more from ""Return of a Jedi"" which implies to be a modern trend of non imaginative and creativity-free directing and writing. Even 3D is not a 3D at all. Hint: Download a Chinesse low quality screener version just to take a look. Only than decide if you gonna give Disney money for a ticket."
3887,1,"Shame on 8,5 IMDb score","Episode Seven failed to resonate in any way for me. The plot is a rehash of A New Hope, beyond the ""following common fantasy / sci-fi tropes"" justification and more into the ""stealth remake with new protagonists"" territory. To me this is like watching Gus Van Sant's Psycho: in itself it's an ok movie, but I'm already familiar with the superior original, so it's just pointless. And TFA is worse than pointless, in fact: if you nuke the New Republic and Luke Jedi Order in the title crawl, it's not exactly good service to the previous trilogy."
3888,4,Playing it safe,A parentless kid gets in contact with a droid containing files vital to the survival of the rebellion. A person who knows everything about the war between empire and rebels fills the kid in and they embark on an adventure. The group meets Han Solo and Chewbaca and uses the Milenium Falcon to meet up with the Rebellion. They go on to destroy a bigger version of the death star and an older mentor dies.
3889,1,Lack of anything and everything,"When I first viewed ""The Force Awakens"" theatrical trailers on television and YouTube, I was convinced that it would be the Star Wars movie that would bring the franchise back to its former glory. This, I thought, is where Disney will succeed over George Lucas: it will bring Star Wars fans back to the fun and discovery of the original trilogy."
3890,5,"""Here we go again"" - C3PO, Episode VI","Boring is too much of a compliment, this movie is almost annoying. Very disappointed as Star Wars fun, I've been looking at the watch impatiently waiting for the end of the movie. It's like a never ending introduction, you always wait for the real film to begin, but it never does. Absolutely no glamor, no imagination, no new star ships, shameless copying from previous episodes for an asphyxiating plot with no change of scenes/planets/stories to take a breath. And an unforgivable mistake: having taken it all far too seriously."
3891,1,Almost annoying,"I have given it a 2 star rating only because Han, Leia, and Luke who was in only one scene were in the film. Great too see the old gang again made me feel like I was watching it like a kid again. OK that's the only good news the rest was simply awful a few good laughs, Adam driver was terrible and weak but the worst was the fact that Rey can learn Jedi tricks in 5 seconds absolutely ridiculous. What a load of crap this was given the budget. Please come back George Lucas all is forgiven."
3892,2,The Farce Awakens,"I think i expected too much from this movie. Because of that, it turned out to be very bad in my opinion. From new, 3rd death star, just bigger, to copy previous episodes (especially new hope). Most i hate is honor to be a Jedi. Joda learned it 900 years to be best of the best, every other ""student"" learned years and years to even get a title of Jedi, and Ray gets light saber 1st time in her life and she is already better than many others, even from bad guy who wants to be Vader. She also knows how to use Jedi mind games without any learning. That's ridiculous. Also, ""future"" Darth Vader can't hold a saber in his hand and he is like biggest bad guy in the movie??Srsly??SW lost everything what made him the ""best"" title. Great good guys and bad guys, skill fight with light sabers and innovation. And at the end, they killed the best character, to complete catastrophe. If they didn't bring all cast and wake some nostalgic in viewers and me, it wouldn't deserve to be graded even with 2. It gets 3 because of that."
3893,3,Don't read if you haven't watched it yet,Signed up here today just to make my feelings known and to warn others who love the Star Wars universe of my experience with this truly terrible piece of story telling.
3894,1,I have become Abrams destroyer of Franchises,"This was surprisingly disappointing. There's hardly any new idea in this episode. Old characters appear, looking really old now. There's the Millennium Falcon again. There is a new Death Star, blowing up planets again. And again the Rebels blow it up by flying into its energy center and damaging it. There is a father and son story, just like the one between Darth Vader and Luke, only this time it's between Han Solo and his son. And like before they meet for a father-and-son-showdown on a bridge within the death star. There is the old hierarchic structure of the Empire, now called First Order with a virtually present ""imperator"" and his executive evil guy. There is the desert planet with funny alien races and garbage trading. There is the bar with sinister alien characters and an alien band playing alien music. There is all kinds of war battles and conveniently both the ""empire"" and the rebels still use their old ships and uniforms. They still aim and fire manually in the 23rd century, otherwise those battle scenes would be really short. There are all kinds of non-plausible things going on. Like, the top rebel prisoner of the First Order is brought to his prison cell by just one storm trooper, and out of thousands it happens to be the ""traitor"", who consequently helps the prisoner to escape. And so on. Maybe children dig this. As an adult, who has seen the other episodes of Star Wars, it is simply ridiculous."
3895,5,The new soup is cooked with all the old ingredients,"this movie broke my heart they changed things the main villain is a crybaby,he is not the best villain he is the worst,Han solo dies is bull crap and i'm not the only one who thinks this its a damn reboot its the story of a new hope just with more tits i will watch one two and three then this crap i hate JJ and ford for making solo die and for asking for him to die it does not do it for me and i will check out eight and nine just to see what else they do wrong George man why did you sell you did better then this i will not watch eight or nine i will wait for spoilers for them and if i don't like it i will not watch it i will not spend my money on this movie or the others"
3896,1,i will never watch this again,No SPOILERS*
3897,5,Majestic pastiche bordering on retrospective parody.,"As I watched Episode VII, I kept finding reasons to hope. Rey and of course Han Solo and Chewie were well-acted, the yellow golem seemed like a nice character (although she lacks a back story), and on a technical level, it was clear that the execution was more even than in the prequels."
3898,3,A void has opened up in the Force...,JJ Abraham showed that he is truly the copycat king of Hollywood! He has no creativity and simply took a New Hope and slapped new paint on it! However it lacks everything that made a New Hope amazing.
3899,3,A remake of a New Hope without the quality.,"Where to begin. It's supposedly cast 30 years after the end of Return of the Jedi, but that would make Kylo Ren in his late 20s?!!? Snoke (Kylo Rens master) looks like he is 100 years. Where was he during the return of the Jedi? Also how did the fallen Empire manage to be rebuilt as the First Order within that short time? Do they make these Death Stars in lightspeed? The movie is ridden with so many flaws and errors it's a mockery of everything done by Lucas. It also has so many similarities with A new Hope that it's basically the same movie redone. I found this whole movie to be a huge disappointment, perhaps the biggest in movie history. The CGI is OK but for the budget they had it's not impressive. I hope that people convey to Disney how much they messed up the Star Wars universe. It's a turkey of a movie. Perhaps the biggest ever."
3900,1,Old rehash of the original,"they ruined everything, and the actors are horrible. Instead of pushing the limits of Sci-fi, they made a liberal Nazi propaganda out of a legendary brand, congratulations, idiots."
3901,1,It was a OK movie if it wasn't the star wars..,"If my expectations for this film were too high, then that's the fault of the Disney marketing (hype) machine which has been relentless in recent months. They set the bar. But even without the hype, never would I would have predicted a 'Star Wars' meets 'Marvel Comics' meets 'Beverly Hills 90210' type of movie. What a let down."
3902,1,Episode VII - A New Hype,"Let me start by saying I have genuinely never felt more disappointed in my entire life. When the opening summary rolled I felt like the writers we're digging from the bottom of the barrel but I decided to go with it, it sounded new and unique. Oh how very very wrong I was. "
3903,4,Episode VII: A False Hope,Star Wars: A Force Awakens (Don't. Spoilers.)
3904,1,A homage that didn't quite hit home.,"i was there for the beginning back in 1977... stayed true thru all the years and the long await. however, i'm glad i waited and viewed this as a free library available DVD. what i saw was episodes 4,5,6 rolled up into one sode... should be renamed: ""star wars"" 35years later. ""the search for more money""... a line stolen from the movie ""space balls"" which is the better movie to watch in place of this one. maybe watch after it and see the similarities..."
3905,5,what a stinker...,"Released in early 2015, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" has J.J. Abrams replacing George Lucas at the helm as director/writer with the assistance of writers Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega star as the main protagonists, Rey and Finn, with Oscar Isaac on the side as a hotshot pilot. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill return, the latter in a glorified cameo, along with Chewbacca, C-3P0 and even R2D2. There's a cute new droid called BB-8 and Adam Driver is on hand as the Darth Vader-like villain, Kylo Ren."
3906,5,Decent Star Wars flick highlighted by the return of iconic characters,"I got thru about an hour of this until it became clear that the ""evil one"" with the face mask is the son of ""Han Solo""....that was enough......the 1st hour wasn't up to much with lots of explosions and unexplained murder of innocent people for a map!....Lucasfilms should have left it after the first 6...not worth the effort nor the money it took to make it"
3907,4,WHO writes this stuff??????,As taken from: http://www.beyondvalwood.com/#!A-review-of-the-movie- Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens/c218b/572157900cf26b6d6844ddbf
3908,3,Hazel says...2.5 stars,"The trend continues, Cinema declining towards the TV whilst TV rises towards the cinematic. JJ doesn't seem like a Director, no artistry or style. He just buys in teams who can do things, tells them to copy another product, and makes sure the boxes for the Disney Management have been ticked, he could be as easily working in Human Resources as in Cinema."
3909,2,Cobblers,"Select some great scenes from the prequels and do a remake. Really boring and irritating. Kind of plagiarism, and to me less than the originals. The 3 stars are earned almost entirely by Daisy Ridley (Rey), who played the only refreshing role. Harrison Ford can not do badly, but not at his best. Special effects did look like common for these times, and a lot was 'inspired' by the other movies. The storyline looked pretty simple, with many coincidences and such (boring and irritating). Someone in the audience said 'They could have made this 10 years ago also'. I saw the movie in 2D. So, no idea about the 3D value. All together, hopeless lack of fantasy. James Bond's always surprises you, with the advantage of using some humor though. This one does not."
3910,3,boring best-of remake with many irritating illogical scenes,"A complete copy and pasted story from A New Hope, except with Disney glitter, SJW characters, paper thin plot, gaping plot holes, tired clichés, an 100% unbelievable Mary Sue heroine, an emo joke of a villain and wooden acting thrown in. "
3911,1,Terrible and Infantile,"Just like plenty of other people will do in the next week, I created an account on IMDb just to share my opinion of a movie I desperately wanted to be so good... "
3912,2,This is not the droid we have been looking for...,*This review does not contain spoilers... There is nothing to spoil*
3913,1,Not Star Wars,We have all been deceived by the Sith Lords that are JJ Abrahams and Disney that have lead us to believe we are getting something fresh in a legendary franchise...
3914,1,Worst Starwars Film,"Bad acting, cliched directing, rip off cloned story, less than zero character development, plot holes ahoy and then you have the inexplicable elements that remind the viewer of Battlefield Earth and Ishtar of course.<br /><br />I rather get a job at Wal-Mart than watch anything from Disney or Jar Jar Abrams again."
3915,2,The Most Unneeded Reboot In The Galaxy,**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****
3916,4,The praise is truly unfounded.,"George, George... You needed the money that bad, huh?"
3917,4,"Star Wars is dead, long live Star Wars!",Never felt the need to review a movie before but thought i had to spread the word that this reboot is beyond terrible. I went in with an open mind and hoped jj Abrams would restore my faith in the franchise after the terrible prequels. 
3918,1,couldn't be more disappointed,"First time reviewing because I needed to, for my own mental relief."
3919,1,WTF just happened?,"what a vomit and a disgrace to the Star Wars movies .... total disaster! cheap and ugly actors with no acting skills, no action, stupid story: same as the first Star was movie 30 years ago. "
3920,1,pure vomit,It's been a over a year since I saw this movie and I'm still sad that they destroyed this franchise. The visuals were great. The beginning was good. Beyond that JJ created a bunch of character that I don't care about and I'm not interested to see where this story goes. What kills me is reading forums before this movie came out of possible plot lines and stories from fans that sounded ridiculously awesome. It actually hurts my soul know that Disney has turned Star Wars into galactic garbage.
3921,1,Time has not healed this wound,How may ways is TLJ awful? Let's count the ways:
3922,2,Who cares?!?!,"First time I have ever gone to the trouble of reviewing a movie. This movie was a significant disappointment for me. Like a lot of people I was less than exited about the prequels. I think Harry Plinkett dissected those perfectly. I rather naively supposed that the deficiencies of the prequels would lend some insight into what was needed for any further movies that might be made. The funny thing is it didn't work out that way. If anything TFA highlights some of the few things the prequels handled better, such as the score, the bigger sense of scale, Darth Maul and dare I say it greater imagination overall. The major flaw they share in common is bad execution of certain specifics.In prequels case pacing, shitty dialogue, character motivation and general lack of finesse during the key moments. In the case of TFA all its specific faults are in danger of coming of the rails because of the manic pace of the film. There needs to be moments of pause and slower pacing at key moments. I won't fault the actors in either set of films, any deficiencies were due in my opinion to characterization and dialogue. I have seen many of the actors in other roles which have been handled well. The openly cack-handed way in which the characters are presented so to appeal to childish sensibilities of the audience is a fault in both sets of movie. Rey is presented in order to appeal to the most vulgar caricature of the modern trope the strong woman. If you want to make a believable female lead then take a look at Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley, believable, fleshed out and yes STRONG. Finn was a wasted opportunity. The trailer hinted at more than comic relief. Perhaps Kylo could have been worked if a little more care was spent on making him work. The cheap coincidences I do not need to mention as others out there have eyes to see what is obvious.What does this mean for the future of the franchise? Judging by the high scores doled out by lazy and perhaps compliant collection of professional critics, along with a significant majority of the fanbase this could be a parting of the ways for people like me. I would hope that episode 8 redeems this mess because if it doesn't I won't bother again. I will give this movie a 4 because it would be ridiculous to go much lower than that as I have seen worse. I can understand the desire to give it 0 though, as so much was expected while so little emerged."
3923,4,"So this is how Star Wars dies, to the sound of thunderous applause","Ladies and Gents, "
3924,4,The Force Is Dead (JJ Abrams made a prequel film) No Spoiler,I did not expect to see excellence. This was supposed to be a solid Star Wars epic decent enough to be worth its ticket's price. It's a shame it turned out the way it did.
3925,3,A huge disappointment.,"StarWars is sure fiction and we all know it, but it always felt so real, not because of the technology used, but because the story always made sense, it was always like carefully crafted by the best artist, always surprising and creative. But Awakens is so synthetic like plastic, I had no real pleasure of something authentic."
3926,5,A total deception on the philosophy,"The screenplay is miserable - that is out of the question. But lets have a look at the bright sides. First of all - the Irish accents in the movie. This is all about finding Luke, and Luke appears to be on Ballyskelligs island, Co. Kerry. Why all these people risk their lives instead of simply asking Garda Siochana about Luke's location? But the better one - at some stage there comes to Han Solo a man with a strong Irish country accent and demands cash - this scene is not only worth the price of the movie ticket - it is just priceless. We need also to give credit to Harrison Ford for his mercy on the viewers, when he lets Han Solo to be killed and never seen again. We cannot say this about princess Leia who now looks like a lady from an accounting department."
3927,2,Lets have a look at the bright side,"If you are a Star Wars devotee, I anticipate that you will wish to skip this review."
3928,5,Hackneyed Plot Ruins Much Anticipated Movie,I'm sad...SW died tonight when i watched this joke of a movie.
3929,1,death of SW franchise,"Just be prepared for it to be predictable. I was disappointed and I hated that. But 1/3 of it was Star Wars as we want it- what we remember and what we want from it- so it is worth it from that standpoint. Extra and Important Note for Safety in the Theater- there are some crazy things and people out there, so keep an eye out. There was a guy who stood up in the middle of the movie, otherwise unmoving in one spot on the aisle, for a full 15 minutes, in one spot. It worried me but he was close enough to see me call for help and big enough to block my path out. I later tried to call the theater but to no answer. The police said if I could call they would send an officer over right away."
3930,3,Three (3) Stars Out Of Ten (10) Stars for Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"A terrible mess!!! That ain't Star Wars, 'tis a toy box containing everything that the fans expect for a Star Wars movie, no creativity, nothing original, Star Wars is dead with Han Solo!!!"
3931,1,The Force is Dead!,What's there to say that hasn't been said before? Probably nothing. A nearly beat-for-beat retread of A New Hope.
3932,2,Reverent To A Fault,"I was a boy when I first watched Star Wars episode IV in theater. And I loved it and I loved V and VI. I was a man (and still am, married, with two children); my son was a boy when we watched Episode I. My son loved Jar Jar, he is not so bad. And my son, my wife and I loved Episode II and III too. My daughter was a baby. Those are Star Wars movies."
3933,1,This is not Star Wars,"J.J. Abrams if this is your fault, you will burn in ****! How could you!?! Take this from a grown up guy who has grown up with Star Wars, who has seen the original movies I guess 30-40 times, who has lived the legend, who has unpacked Christmas presents loaded with Star Wars artifacts, who has been running through the woods as Luke and Solo more times then I can remember, who has cherished the amazing universe which is Star Wars, who can recite most if not all of the spine-chilling dialogues from the old movies... Oh forget it... HOW COULD YOU! NO!!! JUST...NO! This is not Game of ****** Thrones!!! You do NOT have to prove anything! Shock and denial... The Falcon is empty... Childhood ruined... World is empty..."
3934,1,Why? Just...Why!?!,Why don't you get your own ideas?
3935,1,Hi JJ And Kathleen,"""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" (2015), what a horrible excuse for a ""movie"" this is. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the ""Star Wars"" saga, including the prequels. Why do people hate the prequels? People should just take their heads out of their butts and enjoy them. But those movies are going to be reserved for different reviews for another time. Even to this day, I'm still a big ""Star Wars"" fan, except for the new sequels currently being made. When I originally found out that there were originally nine novels, and there were supposed to be nine movies, I got really excited! For the longest time I hoped they would make Episodes 7-9. Then after awhile, I thought: ""there's no need to make those three movies, the saga is perfect and it's a complete story. What could they possibly add to the franchise?"" Then when I heard Episode VII was being made, I got excited. I thought: ""okay, they have had plenty of time to write the script and put this movie together, it's going to be great! Right?"" Wrong! It all started going downhill for me when I found out that George Lucas had left the franchise. Then as I entered the theater, I thought: ""maybe it can still work, if they just follow the original novel!"" I have read all nine novels, and know how Episodes 7-9 are supposed to go. ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is literally a complete rip-off of Episode 4. Jakku is a carbon copy of Tattooine, Rey (I THINK THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HER NAME, IT'S SO FORGETTABLE) is like a discount Luke Skywalker, Han Solo is a discount Obi Wan Kenobi, Kylo Ren is an insult to Darth Vader, and..... You get the point! It's like they took the script for Episode 4, changed the characters names, and just altered their lines a little and that's it! The only good things I can salvage from this ""movie"" are the special effects and the soundtrack. I was looking forward to seeing the original trinity of Luke, Leia and Han together again. But no, and now Han Solo is dead, Carrie Fisher who played Leia has died, and Luke is no longer his real self. I was furious about that, it was such a wasted opportunity! ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is such a terrible disappointment! I give this ""movie"" only 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this ""movie"", just go and watch the real ""Star Wars"" movies (EPISODES 1-6) instead. You'll thank me later!"
3936,4,"""The Force Awakens""? Yeah, more like, ""The Force A-Weakens""!","I'm a bit torn about this movie. It certainly has managed to capture the original Star Wars feeling, but it ruins it over and over again by introducing one Jar Jar after another."
3937,4,"Better production than the prequels, worse script, equal character quality",I like space battles. I like death-defying stunts and acrobatic choreographed combat scenes. I like action. I like cgi.
3938,3,Pretty rehash,"I am sorry about the language, my English is not so good."
3939,4,no star wars movie,I am a bit ashamed to say this but I felt very bored to this dull narration of disconnected scenes. Not sure if anybody felt this way but I went to movie theater expected a lot but I was disappointed. But it looks like many kids are liking this including my son. He gave a rating of 7 out of 10. Probably this movie is made only for kids. 
3940,1,It is not like Star wars at all,"""Huh? That's it!? Really!?"" That was my first line walking out the cinema after watching TFA... Betrayed, cheated, hyped, brainwashed. Mixed feelings. Just like back in 1999... But this time worst... Much worst! Even TPM first scene wasn't in a desert planet or with a Star Destroyer in the background (A vulgar ""homage"" to the OT)... I really don't want to point out what others have already said: A rehash, A New Hope 2.0, Death Star 3.0 (Unbelieavle) Jar Jar Finn, awful and forgettable villain (Even Hayden Christanssen was even more charismatic than this guy), a non-existent John Williams score. Every point is a terrible truth. Hard to imagine but it is..."
3941,4,The real Dark Side of the Force...,"The pros: there were a handful of moments that rang true to the spirit of the originals (and when they worked, they worked relatively well). "
3942,3,One of the Worst of the Series,"I want to begin this by saying I'm not a massive fan of the franchise. I've watched all of the saga and really enjoyed them as a kid, and I was actually quite looking forward to this installment."
3943,4,Casual watchers will love it but die hard fans will be torn.,"Yoda tells Luke ""Pass on what you have learned."""
3944,2,Anti Yoda,TL;DR: Into plot was gay as fúck.
3945,4,Predictable. Teen Humour. Not Fun.,Pros: 
3946,4,Meh. Nothing new...,"What did I watch? The force awakens is dumbed down to the point it insults the viewers intelligence. Everything is impossibly convenient, it's kitsch and predictable far beyond nostalgia. It's plain boring. It's terribly directed and terribly written, by far the most unimaginative film I have seen this year. It's basically a far worse version of ""A New Hope"". It really felt like ""pop"" cinema, built from the ground up purely to please the masses and generate massive box office figures. It reminded me of one of those terrible soap opera Christmas specials where they invite cameo appearances from random celebrities and actors from other soaps and make cheesy jokes. It's quite remarkable they have made something so bad with the budget and cast they had access to, and of the back of such an appraised franchise. One to miss!"
3947,1,A terrible parody of Star Wars!,"The Force Awakens is unoriginal, superficial and dull. The characters have none of the life or independence of those in the original trilogy. They just pant and stare at each-other with intense emotions. I'm not surprised J. J. Abrams scolded Daisy Ridley for being too wooden because he seems to like overacting rather than natural performances."
3948,3,Worthless crap,"In a nutshell, if you want to know how this movie plays out, watch A New Hope."
3949,1,"Money Maker, Nothing More","Many people act like this is some kind of generation defining masterpiece for reasons I didn't even quite understand when I left the theater going 'meh'. But as each day went on, the rottenness of the Force Awakens stung my mind more and more until I completely despised it. Well, at least it only kept the status of 'movie of a lifetime' until the equally execrable Avengers Endgame came along. (And it also convinced me that the 1001 Movies to Watch Before You Die book is defective and I will have to make my own)."
3950,2,An insult to storytelling... original audiences were blinded by nostalgia and special effects,***********WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS***************
3951,3,Star Wars Episode VII...WAIT I've seen this before! Ah yes it's Episode IV!,"Disney must have payed a ton of fake reviews, otherwise how can this semi-crap movie get 8.8 rating. Almost 9!! Really? The movie is so bad I can only remember how the girl kicked the ass of one of the most powerful beings in the universe from nowhere. Like me going tomorrow and beating Federer after learning this morning how to play. Or my 12 year old brother jumping in a F1 car and winning the Monaco Grand Prix (that girl seems to be doing this quite easy). What's the deal with this movie? Who dared to rate it above 7? Were you thinking 'omg, all other people will mock me if I rate it less than 9?'? BAAHHAHA, movie for sheep!"
3952,1,Brainwash fantasy,"I'll give J.J. Abrams props that he has co-written and directed a decent movie. The acting was alright, though a bit wooden. The action scenes were OK, for what they were. Daisy Ridley actually seemed to be the only one in the entire cast who, at some point in her life may have actually SEEN a light-saber duel and attempted to make her performance fit that image."
3953,5,I'm very saddened to see this.,This Movie's writing team is Not creative and i doubt that they even watch all SW movies.This is a carbon copy of ANH and not good as a New hope. Finn like a interesting character but in the end of this Trilogy we know He is useless.Rey and Kylo fight scene is soooo bad i mean rey is a scavenger in beginning but in The end She won against Kylo..So lame and make no sense..Jokes are not funny.How can Rey become Jedi without education?
3954,5,A New Hope Remake,Disney has subverted Star Wars into one of its lame and boring childish films aimed at selling toys to preteens. I am sure McDonalds was poisoning more people than ever before by hawking Star Wars toys from Disney.<br /><br />Not a film for adults.
3955,3,Too Many Jokes,"The only reason that I gave this film a 2 out of 10 is because of JJ Abram's use of CGI in the film to make it look a bit cooler than the previous Star Wars Episodes. However, the overall quality of the movie was just horrible. It clearly lacked character development and the next film that JJ Abram's is creating isn't a sequel to what we just watched so we will have to wait that much longer to see what happens next. I saw a trend throughout the film that it was a rerun of A New Hope as JJ Abrams was attempting to best George Lucas at his own creation. This film also lacked the awesome Jedi vs sith fights that we all wanted to see and I am sure that almost all Star Wars fan boys were just desperate to see again. The Kylo Ren vs. Fin and Rey light saber fight scene made just absolutely no sense in that Ren was actually able to put up a good fight against Ren even though he was clearly older than them and had greater access to his force wielding abilities. They should have ended it with Rey and Fin barely making it out alive when they are about to get slaughtered by Ren by Chewy flying by on the millennium falcon throwing a gas bomb to get Kylo Ren distracted and quickly rescue the injured Rey and Fin."
3956,2,The force didn't awaken me through this film,"Too much promotion got me into expecting too much from this movie. Guys, when you pop up from the washing machine in the supermarket and the lids of my kids' yogurt, I expect that you actually have a story to tell. It was just a series of pop-up moments from the old Star Wars episodes. Where is the red line or am I missing it? I have wasted my time searching for it. This is a movie for adolescents. They can surely fill the gaps with their imagination and the pieces of information they can find placed on top of the yogurt lid or the T-shirt, or that notebook or the ... ups! I have to buy too many things in order to get the whole story in one place (you know, the washing machine...). It is ironic that the first episodes fueled my imagination also. They got me dreaming about science and technology ... But sucking a star to destroy a planet? What would a science person say about this bullshit? If you suck a star there comes that moment when the gun- planet orbiting around it will jump out of its orbit and collide with other planets from that system. You cannot take that much energy/a mass as big as a sun, make it disappear in your gun and expect land stability for your pitiful war preparations... I am not a science person. So, I might get it wrong. Anyway, following your pattern, I guess that you will suck a double-star or even a galaxy with the next Death Star in the following episode... What is that? I was expecting something new and when I say new I mean new special digital effects, new ways of seeing the technology. That was the trademark of this project. Every other episode offered something new, something that was so stunning that made other directors wanting to include that effect in their movies. You should be leading in this area. You are not. Just copy paste form here and there... some new robots/ cyber beings... a BB-8 unit that will look good as a teen rucksack (helping to deploy the plan for future education ... and... as everyone has a piece of the missing map and, you know, as the director really believes the you only need 6 other persons, not necessarily connected by LinkedIn, to overcome the adversity in the world ... finally we will bring eternal peace and restore the balance of power in the galaxy). Also, I am sick of too much religious like bullshit. It is too much of ""among from the most under_served/ hit we will have the Buddha of the new generation... or the Messiah (judging by the new type of sabers of the new type of knights of the new type of Order... and the mass killing of the innocents and so on)"" ... cut it off, pls! The new characters ... they are intentionally too shinny in comparison with the old ones. They have better angles of exposure and better make-up. They turn out to being very very strong in spite of adversities. The old ones are portrayed like a bunch of sissies with too much needs to attend for (ex. a new coat for the supposedly ""old fashioned Solo"" which desperately tries to dress up or dispose this coat to the nearest peg, the wookie). Come on! Peter O'Toole in ""Troy"" or Ian McKellen in ""Lord of the Rings"" were given better space to show off their characters. The director/s even managed to make the characters look very wrong - ex. Han Solo calling these new orphan (no ones/ coming from nowhere) heroes ""kids"" almost all of the time and finally giving them weapons... I would say the new ones are pretty resourceful adults in this movie. No need for that handing out of an old war to some child soldiers ... and old map... Remember, the map is not the territory. You are playing too much with imagery (even savage) at the expense of logic and construction. If you just wanted to confuse ""older audiences"" (meaning the fans and followers of Lucas' vision), I think you did a great job. I also believe that, intentionally or not, the makers of this film manage to push the sequel (what sequel?) of a cult film into the ridiculous.. It looks like a Xmas tree with a lot from the old decorations on it! Beware! The Supreme Ladder Snoke might take this from you also! Do not dare to write bad reviews! These people know nothing about joking... :)) PS: This is for other parents My kids are still small (4 and 7). I would recommend this movie only for 12+ years."
3957,1,The Star Wars yogurt tasted better...,"If you thought Jar Jar Binks was bad, then just wait until you see what Jar Jar Abrams has in store for you."
3958,1,A Jar Jar Abrams Sci-Fi Space Opera Spectacle,This movie was a huge disappointment for me.
3959,1,This movie has nothing to do with Star Wars universe. (Contains spoilers),"Awful awful awful beyond the boundaries of awful....yet a billion dollar movie. Hooray for Disney, they took a franchise that changed the cinematic landscape forever and made a ""movie"" that completely fails on every level possible, except that it made a lot of money which is all they (the Sith Lords) really care about."
3960,1,Disney and Jar Jar Abrams are the true Sith Lords,"It's painful to watch Rey on the screen. I do not understand why they picked an actress with one standard facial expression for the leading role of a big budget movie. The black kid wasn't a bad actor, but he wasn't anything to write home about. It also feels like they only made Harrison Ford join the movie for a nostalgia circlejerk, wookie and Han Solo seem out of place. Holy hell, it's like they didn't even try to find a good actress."
3961,5,Bad casting,"Where does one even begin. JJ Abrams YOU sir may have been known for great tv such as ""Lost"" ""Revolution"" Fringe"" Alias"" and had your mind and hands behind decent films such as ""Cloverfield"" Super 8"" and a host of others. This franchise you should have kept your hands off of."
3962,4,False promises of the galactic kind,"On Wednesday/Thursday night at 00:05 I, along with hundreds of other Star Wars fans, wandered happily into the cinema screen with a cautiously optimistic attitude to what I was about to see. Well, thanks J.J. Abrams for ruining my night; you owe me four hours sleep."
3963,5,Have you seen Episode IV? Then you've seen this film.,with virtually no imagination this is a terrible re-write of Episode IV but with rewriting the basic rules of star wars into meaningless drivel
3964,1,should have been titled the force fizzles out,THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! NOT THAT ANYTHING I SAY HERE CAN REALLY SPOIL IT ANYWAY!!!!
3965,1,More Plot Holes than holes in a Cheese Factory in Switzerland!!!,"I was an original fan of Star Wars from 1977 and every movie since made me say wow! I have always been excited for the next installment of this saga but after it was over The Force Awakens was very disappointing for those that enjoy a good story and forward looking sets and effects. The whole thing felt like a cheaply put together, rushed, formulaic mess. George Lucas innovated, JJ Abrams imitated. No space battles, plot holes by the dozens and 4 months later the questions about the story confusedly remain and not because of some nicely placed mystery but lazy writing and multiple rewrites. 15 minutes into this I knew it was off right after Han and Chewie showed up. Sorry but no."
3966,1,Not the way the Story goes.,"Starkiller orbits around a sun that is completely absorved by the machine. First: orbits must dissapear. Second: life on starkiller surface must dissapear. Third: targets of the rays are impossible to accurate because the planets are dramatically moving with no sun to orbit around. Fourth: how will starkiller move on space to the next star, probably situated light-years away? Fifth: There is not a sun anymore, so why the surface of the planets is plenty illuminated? Is that a double sun system or what? There's a lot of goofs in Star Wars movies (fire and sound in space and so) but this is the biggest stupid nonsense ever!"
3967,4,The biggest goof ever!,"My disappointment is real and valid. This was not a good movie. I was not expecting it to be better than the original but i was hoping it was at least a good story. Unfortunately it was the same story and not retold very well. As a longtime fan of the original trilogy i was always hoping someone would delve deeper into the star wars universe, expand on what little we know of the force - the light and the dark, show real commitment to the actual power of the story itself and respect its origin and artistic authenticity and not it's potential for profit and merchandising. The original trilogy was not a new story either, not really, good v. evil stories have been told and retold forever, but this one was told in a very new and innovative way and with a commitment to the viewer that most movies never achieve. Force Awakens fails to engage. I walked away feeling cheated and disgusted."
3968,3,"Clear your mind must be, if you are to find the villains behind this plot","This is my first review of a film. The film had such an impact on me, that I felt compelled to write this review and post it here."
3969,2,It Disappoints Me,"So let's take 2 types of fans , type 1 ( knows all about EU, New Republic, generally knows the events of Thrawn trilogy, likes prequels, accepts their flaws"
3970,5,On why FA fans fail to see it's flaws,The film is a disgrace to the Star Wars universe . The story is full of events with no connection whatsoever and somehow these events creates a story. I watched the trilogy at least 30 times and never got bored there but I do not think I could do the same with this film. The movie is full of clichés and always seems to defy common sense . The story is terrible and unfortunately the acting too. This is not a Star Wars movie.
3971,1,Disgrace,"This is the first complete Star Wars movie that I saw. I have seen before some small parts from the 80's movies (not sure which one) and I've enjoyed it at the time (I've seen it as a teenager). Of course, I have been in contact with the pop culture related to it and so it was quite a thrill for me to finally watch the acclaimed series. "
3972,4,Probably more enjoyable by Star Wars fans,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens brings us back to the captivating galaxy far, far away, however perhaps not in the best way. While the film is fine in total, the script should have perhaps been through a few more redrafts before being put to the big screen. The Force Awakens does manage to re-introduce us back to the world and it does that fairly well but I cannot ignore the blatant problems with the story, one being that the rise of the first order immediately takes away the victory of Return Of The Jedi. A decent addition to the franchise, and in no way as bad as the prequel trilogy, but still quite flawed."
3973,3,Needs to be rewritten,"JJ is at it again. I found The Force does not awake to be boring and pointless.<br /><br />It was a unoriginal remake of A New Hope, with unlikable new characters, like the idiot droid BB8 code name for the beach ball 8. Who has no class and will never beat C3PO and R2 D2.<br /><br />The classic characters are wasted. And my favorite character is murdered in the most obvious badly written way as a cop out.<br /><br />Snook is a looser and no where near as scary as Palpatine."
3974,1,pointless JJ remake,"Meeting up with a family friend over the weekend,I found out that he had recently picked up the latest Star Wars film.With having heard a lot about the movie,I decided that it was time to see ""The Force"" wake up."
3975,3,Awakening The Force.,If there is a movie to miss at all costs then this is got to be one of them. It disappoints on so many levels and the evil of the enemy is not even close to being the slightest intimidating.
3976,3,someone just had to make another movie about the same thing but hype would do over substance,"I will have to agree with Lucas. This film without him is like nothing: junk junk junk... Only character that was missing was a Mickey Mouse, and I would had given an extra star for cheering me up, as I was very disappointed ;(. And I cannot agree that this ""movie"" got almost 9 stars from IMDb. So ridiculous, all will tell all my friends about it. They didn't want to change the franchise, but they did by not letting Director Lucas to ""advise"" them, like they promised they will do. I guess it is a Funeral, they accidentally killed what I loved for many years. Well i guess it cannot be expected to be the best thing ... forever... very nostalgic...I don't understand what went wrong?"
3977,1,Not worth a penny,This movie was a poor attempt of remaking 'A New Hope' plain and simple. Disney decided to play it safe and just tell us the same story all over again with new characters and poor ones at that. 
3978,3,Disney and JJ couldn't deliver,It's essentially a remake of A New Hope. No originality at all.
3979,1,Yawn.,"I was expecting a lot more. Wasn't expecting something perfect, nor feeling the same way I felt with the original trilogy. But THIS has gone too far: if they only intended to sell lots of silly ball-robots, they could have warned us. The plot, childish and a total remake of the IV movie. The acting mediocre. Kylo Ren and Finn are maybe the two worst characters... although Leia is close enough. One point out of ten is maybe too low, I know: if this had been a completely different movie, the scoring would have been better, sure. But I have got two reasons for voting this low: first, my expectations, utterly betrayed. Secondly, with the characters coming from the old trilogy, the plot, all the feelings people had... it is difficult filming something this bad. And JJ... I have no words... no words: my first review ever in IMDb thanks to you. It's 3:50 a.m. and I go to bed in a very sad mood."
3980,1,Highly disappointed.,"I love this universe. It blows my mind every time I read the Book of Sith, The Bounty Hunter Code and I spend time on SW games."
3981,1,"Went for Star Wars, watched Disney cartoon with shiny characters..","I viewed this in 3-D at the cinema, which was some experience but as a movie it contained little surprise whatsoever. Although it's a harp back to the look and feel of the original star wars release (which was a nice idea) and contained two of the major stars, Ford and Fisher; the rest was pretty much routine. Perfect in every detail and manufactured for something to happen every 2.30 minutes, there is no room for mistakes and certainly no room to breath. Great films have depth and personality but star wars as a global brand and worth 100's of billions, has become just about as synthetic as R2D2."
3982,4,Truly shocked at the high rating on this one.,What gushing reviews we must read on the newest Star Wars release. Is it good? Yes. But not so good it warrants a place in the memory of a whole new generation of children as it did back in 1979. If you don't believe me ask them now and again in 5 years!
3983,4,Star Wars (again),"It's completely unexplainable how this sad excuse of a movie has such a high rating where if one would open the review section, they'd immediately see a swarm of 1's and 2's given. The majority of the Star Wars community including me is genuinely disappointed of the direction Kathleen Kennedy and co have decided to take by simply ignoring all the extremely well written sources from the Expanded Universe and Legends. Had they not done that, the revenues for the next 2 movies would have been significantly bigger than they are now. To ignore key figures such as Kyle Katarn, Desann, Jerec, Mara Jade and introduce flat and boring characters such as Rey aka Mary Sue, Finn who is a completely useless addition to the story as well as Captain Phasma (no comment about her) makes zero sense to me. Not only that but they copied and slightly altered most of New Hope. What's the point in that? Regardless, the one I am truly disappointed in is none other than George Lucas himself. To let Disney create this abomination out of your life's work is unforgivable... I'm sure he is definitely sorry. 4 billion is a lot of money, but he himself doesn't need that much. He was already a rich enough man. Why let the faith of your life's work lie in the hands of others? I simply don't understand it to this day..."
3984,1,How does this movie have a rating of almost 8?!?,I think this movie missed the mark entirely because it lacked the depth of quality characters and esp. leading characters. Harrison Ford's Han Solo was really the only refreshing character besides the robots in the film. 
3985,1,Worst Episode of Star Wars,"My husband, daughter and I went to see this over the weekend. We were very excited and so full of expectations. Especially my husband and I as the Star Wars trilogy was such a big thing in our childhood. We were feeling oh so very nostalgic plus we are both of the lot who actually enjoyed the prequels. We both LOVED what J J Abrams did for the Star Trek franchise, so we just knew this was going to knock our socks off. I waited all week long to see this movie in 3D as we did not want to battle the opening crowds. I actually counted down the days like a little kid. Finally, we go and see this film, this highly anticipated film! That's pretty much is where the excitement ended. I enjoyed the film, it was entertaining but I could have waited to see at home. We both left the theater with our socks still intact. My husband on the other hand was flat out MAD and proceeded to proclaim that Spaceballs was a better movie then The Force Awakens. He also dozed off 3 times during the movie. My main complaint was character development or the lack of thereof. So much action right off the bat that you do not get know the characters you are supposed to be cheering for. I was intrigued by the concept of a stormtrooper defecting but perplexed as to how he could just pick up a lightsaber and know how to use it so skillfully the same with Rey. It's obvious that Rey is a descendant of a Jedi but so was Luke and even he had to enduring training for at least 5 minutes in Episode IV before he mastered it. I did not hate the film, I was just disappointed. I guess maybe my expectations were set too high plus they killed off Han Solo who I was totally in love with in the 80s. At the end of the movie, the theater was dead quiet. There was no clapping or cheering or anything. Just dead silence! My daughter and I got up and left. My husband sat there in the theater for a good bit, in disbelief hoping that it would get better or perhaps waiting for some divine revelation that would justify what he just witnessed or at least erase it from his mind. It had its moments but it could have been so much better."
3986,5,It had its moments but it could have been so much better,"I love star Wars, the original trilogy just had that magic. Great characters you could get behind and a story arc that you could believe and follow. The prequel trilogy lacked wit however was still pretty grand although not as great as the originals and had its faults, and then there's the ""Force Awakens""."
3987,2,Star Wars........Is it really back? Or has George Lucas been vindicated?,SW7 is just a bit of SW4 + SW5 + SW6 (first trilogy) and that's it ..
3988,4,30 years later .. just the same ..,THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!
3989,3,"Getting old, nothing new, a lot is borrowed, fans go blue.","I just came back from watching this movie at IMAX theater. The special effects were awesome. Best in the series. 3D looks spectacular. Han Solo was great in this movie. BUT doesn't feel like Star Wars. Humor and dialogue doesn't feel authentic. I was disappointed with the story. I enjoyed the previous Star Wars more. JJ Abrams did excellent job for Star Trek but thumbs down for Star Wars. GEORGE LUCAS needs to come back and direct his movies, OR at least work along side with another director. This movie just doesn't feel like Star Wars. I watched IV, V, VI like crazy, I, II, III once in a while. But I don't see myself watching this movie over and over again like the previous ones... I felt like they rushed this movie. Previous movies took years to make, this movie took just one year which probably explain why it was a bit unpolished. I'd say ""Bring back George Lucas!!!"" not the same without him..."
3990,5,Great but doesn't have the authentic feel of Star Wars!!,"This film is stupid. Really. First of all because it is not the episode VII, but a remake of episode IV. So, wrong promise. Moreover, the cloned plot is inconsistent, banal, with teen-like dialogs and worst sith enemies ever: an hysteric boy not so good with light saber and a big Voldemort. The genius of JJ has also added a clone of the Hunger Games girl, just because it is a trend. This is my first review here, but I felt necessary to share the opinion of a fan. For sure, I will not watch the next movie, I simply do not care of this new reboot, of the story of these characters and I will not give my money to the ""New Order of Disney"" - this should the action that all the deluded fans have to take to deliver a clear message"
3991,1,A total delusion (light spoilers),From 2012 the dark side of the force is winning!<br /><br />Not worth a single star!
3992,1,Shame Disney!,"I want to start like that - If I knew what I was going to see, I would stay in front of the theater and not let people go in. This movie was a total disaster. The director is a guy without a drop of imagination. Just 0 imagination. The movie was shallow, absolutely no depth. I wonder who came with the retarded Idea that everything needs to be the same as before. Death Star destroying planets - really ?!? I thought that the good guys won in the last movie. The plot should have been totally different. It should have been the other way around. Bad people gaining power in this movie, owning the good people in the next one and balance in the last one with good guys winning slightly. "
3993,2,Do not give your money and time to those people,What a disappointment! The whole movie feels like a cheap ripoff of episode 4. Fans waited over thirty years for this...and we got a remake disguised as a sequel.
3994,2,What a disappointment!,Didn't think it could possibly be this bad! It was.
3995,1,Didn't think it could possibly be this bad!,Slight Spoilers ahead.
3996,4,Absolutely Gutted,"With all the hype and buzz surrounding this film, I was a little too excited about rekindling the joys I found in the original trilogy. My expectations were not to match the original films in terms of old characters or nostalgia, but in terms of a good solid story and new characters development. After the opening sequence had finished, you are met with the usual camera panning observation of a capital ship. Things looked good - straight into the action - storm troopers and the main villain land searching for a missing map leading to the elusive Luke Skywalker. This is where we are introduced to the first of our characters, Kylo Ren and Finn. After the battle is over, we find ourselves in the grips of yet another action sequence aboard the ship after Poe is captured. Having eluded the new ""First Order"" and returned to the planet to retrieve the BB droid, we find ourselves yet again 2 minutes later in another action sequence almost identical to the first. "
3997,1,The honest review,"Positive: Daisy Ridley is very good, energetic and an actress to watch."
3998,5,Since I'm not allowed to swear ;-),The Plot...
3999,1,spoilers inside: Please tell me i'm wrong for hating this.,"My disappointment is real and valid. This was not a good movie. I was not expecting it to be better than the original but i was hoping it was at least a good story. Unfortunately it was the same story and not retold very well at all. As a longtime fan of the original trilogy i was always hoping someone would delve deeper into the star wars universe, expand on what little we know of the force - the light and the dark, show real commitment to the actual power of the story itself and respect its origin and artistic authenticity and not it's potential for profit and merchandising. The original trilogy was not a new story either, not really, good v. evil stories have been told and retold forever, but it was told in a very new and innovative way and with a commitment to the viewer that most movies never achieve. Force Awakens is boring. I walked away feeling cheated."
4000,3,"Clear your mind must be, if you are to find the villains behind this plot","First of all I think most things which I thought are already written here by others. So I will try to be brief. And this is coming from a real Star Wars fan. I voted ""1"" simply because the score right now (8.9/10 as of this moment) is ridiculously too high for this movie. "
4001,1,Underwhelming. If you are expecting something what original trilogy offered you are bound to be disappointed.,**No Spoilers**
4002,1,Star Wars was better off without this,"This movie was a total build up from the start and it just did not delivery anything. I can only compare this movie to the feeling of purchasing something you can barely wait for on amazon and once the package arrives its an empty box. I'll give the good first. A lot of pew pew blaster action, good space dog fights, acting was very good (espically the villain Kylo Ren), graphics were great and the scenes did a decent job of making it feel star wars like. Now a few bad, horrible plot (bad story to the 10th power!), TONS of questions and no answers, very few light saber fights, and lightsaber fights were bad, slow action clearly showing the actors amateur skills handling a melee weapon. Okay minor plot spoilers coming up but nothing drastic since you find this out in classic opening crawl text. ""The First Order"" is an offspring of the Sith and is the new power, rebels are resisting The First Order lead by Leia, and Luke is nowhere to be found. Really Luke Skywalker the Jedi Master cannot be found? The explanation they give in the movie is total crap. This movie is set 30 years after Return Of The Jedi and after defeating the Empire in that movie the resistance have made no progress in restoring any type of order in the galaxy because The First Order is clearly in power. The movie starts off nearly identical to episode 4 A New Hope and seemed to xerox copy a few big plots from that movie and try to do it better (which they fail). Movie is a ""C"" however if you are looking for some blaster fights and space combat with no real star wars connection you might enjoy it however! Star Wars fans will be supremely disappointed!"
4003,5,A New Hope Copy That Got Stuck In The Copier,"Not enough healing force can help this movie!<br /><br />Bad edit, stupid storyline with out any logic or reality , actors trying to do their best over a dead scenario unfortunately with no luck!"
4004,3,Not enough healing force can help this movie!,". I think it's possibly the worst film I've seen. A complete carbon copy of the first film. How JJ Abrahms had the brass neck to accept a wage for that, I don't know. The storyline is scant at best. An effort to try and hide that it's a rehash of A New Hope, I suspect. The dialogue sparse. The characters are shallow and unappealing. And the effects ain't nothing to write home about either. What makes it a million times worse is that Disney/Lucas ignored brilliant stories from Star Wars Universe. Also to make sure they didn't eat into their profits they stifled the Star Wars Universe. Once they bought the name, they stripped the right for authors to write new books. I'm sorry. My 12 year old daughter writes better stories than this. I found myself shouting ""I saw this in 1978"". The film is an utter disgrace. If that is Disney, for the love of God get it back in the hands of toy seller Lucas. I'd even rather Jar Jar over that shower of vapid, shallow, no-character characters."
4005,1,Well I'm back from watching that travesty.,"This now tops Episode I as the worst Star Wars movie ever. Yes, it's that bad."
4006,4,"Decent Acting, Bad Script","Being episode 7, some would argue that Star wars The Force Awakens has a lot to live up to. I would argue no, the prequels did, and critics were not kind. Fans begged for things to be like the original trilogy again, relentless in their hate of episodes I-III, the ground was fertile for some throwbacks to the original star wars films. "
4007,3,Star Wars A New Hope: Disney 2015 Edition,"First let me say that this is my first review on IMDb because Star Wars for me in 2015 was the biggest hope... Now it is the biggest disappointment ! There was no greatness in this movie at all, no great music, no great light saber battles and at the end Luke Skywalker did not say even one word. Many people pointed out correctly that this was a remake of various parts from previous movies. The only part which was good was acting by Han Solo and a few good jokes but even then they killed him and how, by his son ! How could Kylo Ren take off his mask that fast in front of Rey without any mystery remaining for the next chapter ? J.J. Abrams did a great job in turning Star Trek from a boring movie into something close to Star Wars Clone Wars but he killed this one, he totally led himself by Disney CEO's - shame on you J.J. Abrams !!! Also how could a girl or a boy who never was trained in light saber duels face a Sith ( was he even a Sith-Apprentience ?)Yes the new droid was great and fun, a few good jokes here and then but the spirit of star wars is gone ..... even in the phantom menace and clone wars they at least showed / introduced a planet with its creatures combined with great music and have build up to every scene .... so gone is my love for star wars !!!"
4008,1,Thank you Disney and J.J. Abrams for ending the Star Wars for me,"First off I will say that I am a fan of the other movies in the series. Unfortunately this one was a disappointment from the beginning. i will not give details to spoil but the opening line in which they explain whats going on, like they always have done, are different. wrong color, font, and speed too fast. then within 5 minutes it show a character running great, simple scene but how do they mess it up? Its like they hit fast forward on the scene... really? Makes the movie unnatural. Then from there the rest of the movie went down hill. For the sake of spoiler i wont say exactly anything but the only thing that was original was the cross light saber (which is a needless and pointless design) as for fight scenes, and major events that happened it was as though they polled fans for favorite parts and used the other movies. all in all the movie has okay filming, okay story, and okay everything. As for the reasoning behind the 3 stars, i put 3 because the movie should have been better for such a good movie series, and the movies good rating are form over hipe and sell of the movie."
4009,3,Nice try Disney,"As a warning, this ""review"" will contain spoilers. However, I hope that whoever may read this piece will continue on so as to see this movie through a different lens, rather than the emotional one I witnessed so many viewing this movie through during my first viewing of this film. I am aware that this is an overall negative review, and that it may turn some people off who have this unwavering passion for anything that says STAR WARS on it. However, I believe it is important to point out just how unsatisfying this film is, and that it is absolutely unacceptable to not scrutinize this film appropriately. First and foremost, have we not all seen this movie already? In preparation for this film I watched, and re-watched the ""original trilogy"" several times due to the excitement that was building for The Force Awakens. With The Force Awakens, we see a major repeat in the major story lines, and even specific scenes. Essentially, an evil force (The First Order) is threatening peace and freedom in the galaxy which is to be combated by an opposing righteous group (The Resistance). The First Order is The Empire all over again, just as The Resistance is The Rebellion all over again nothing new here. We even have yet another Death Star, although, this one can destroy 4-5 planets at one time rather than just one. The Death Stars just seem to be getting bigger and bigger. Again, nothing new here. How can we say that we are satisfied with the same story that was told in IV and VI? Similarities to the original trilogy were rampant throughout this movie even down to how a major character dies, and is disposed of down a never ending steel shaft. Even destroying the Death Star was done in the same manner, by crippling a major power source. The similarities go on and on, and frankly are just disgusting to see rehashed. Seriously people, why can't we all see this??? The characters within this movie were just as awful as the story line. My biggest issue lies with Kylo Ren. This character is by far the most unimpressive person to wield the dark side of the force I have seen in all of the Star Wars films. What we have seen in past films through other characters who are of the dark side, is an unwavering allegiance to the powers that the dark side hold. We see characters that strike fear into our hearts, are domineering, and make us wonder how their evil can ever be conquered. With Kylo Ren, we get an unassured, weak boy who is seen on several occasions crying to the Supreme Leader about how he's just not sure about this whole dark side thing (terrible). And by the way, Han Solo dies at the hands of this fool HAN SOLO. It would be more fitting for the BEST character in the Star Wars universe to go down in a blaze of glory in the heat of battle, rather he dies at the hands of his weak and unimpressive son. Rae and Fin are terrible as well. First, Rae, a scrapper who is found on yet another desert planet peaks at the end of this film with a light saber battle between her and Ren. Mind you, Rae was a scrapper an hour and a half prior to this light saber battle. She is a person who just discovered that she has the powers of the force, and at the end of the film goes toe-to-toe with Kylo Ren, a character who has had at least five more days of training than she at wielding the force. I'm not sure if this speaks to how weak and unimpressive Kylo Ren is, or how Abrams and the rest just needed to put a light saber battle in the end and essentially just said: ""Rae discovered the force so she's got this, no training required."" Even Luke Skywalker had some sort of visible training, but apparently Rae could do just fine without. Fin was just as terrible, more so in the acting than anything else. He also fought Kylo Ren in a light saber battle, and did pretty well again this is a testament to how awful the characters/ story is developed. As I am running out of words, I need to rap this rant/ review/ opinion up. Many others who were not impressed with this movie touched on a lot of the same issues I have, as well as many more. I suggest going to read those reviews as well. The last topic I want to touch on was the one piece of hope that I was given during this movie. This film could have been an absolute monster if it had taken the stance that The Empire Strikes Back did. The one time I remembered sitting up in my chair was during the speech that the First Order general was giving to the storm troopers prior to activating the ""main weapon."" This scene had such an eerie feeling to it, one which felt similar to Hitler's Third Reich. If the main story followed how the First Order rose from the ashes of the Empire, and became this sinister threat within the galaxy rather than just telling me via text at the beginning of the movie, I would be biting my fingernails right now waiting to see them be destroyed by the Resistance in the following movies. This movie should have broken our spirits by showing us that a new, even more sinister power in the universe controls it so that we could all cheer at the end subsequent films when the impossible becomes possible, and good prevails. Instead we just got IV and VI all over again OH! AND WHY IS CHEWY LETTING RAE DRIVE THE FALCON AFTER HAN DIES? FIRST HE LOST HIS BEST FRIEND, THEN ABRAMS WON'T EVEN LET HIM DRIVE THE FALCON HOME? POOR CHEWY."
4010,4,"Am I taking crazy pills? Everyone needs to wake up, and smell what Abrams is cooking... it stinks.",STAR Wars: The Force Awakens is neither bad nor good. The film introduces a new cast of characters
4011,5,It's no shooting 'Star',"Disney sucks big, long and hard."
4012,2,"Disney sucks big, long and hard","****************THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ********************** The plot copies the original episode IV to the letter. There is even the same environment of the desert planet, literally the same ship and almost-the-same droid with secret but vital information. Which is actually alright - yes, it is reboot rather than a sequel. Yes, it was as unoriginal as possible. But that would alright.... if it wasn't for the main cast."
4013,4,You thought prequels were bad? That Star Wars cant get any worse? You. Were. WRONG!,"This must have been the most awaited movie of all times, and Disney managed to mess it up. When the first Star Wars movie came out it was an innovation both from a plot perspective and a visual effects one. This installment is just one of the many average movies out there. But this isn't the worst part about it. The main issue with it is that it managed to destroy the entire premise of the Star Wars universe, The Force. Throughout the other episodes the amount of effort and preparation involved in being able to wield the Force has been repeatedly brought up. The Force was strong with both Luke and Anakin, however neither have been able to control it without intense training. Yet, in a time where jedis are almost extinct and just a legend, Rey, who first learns that the Force is real two hours earlier, and has absolutely no training, is able to defeat a trained disciple of the dark side(even if the training was not complete, he was still trained by Luke and the supreme commander). Shame, Disney!"
4014,2,How to ruin the concept of the Force,"After watching the movie, I was surprised that initial reactions were positive. In my opinion, the backbone of the whole movie should have been an original and interesting story. Instead of that, it just turned out to be a A New Hope v2.0 with a Death Star v3.0 (doesn't matter what we wanna call it... Starkiller base, wow, whatever). We've got a cute droid carrying important information (teaming up with Rey - the new Luke Skywalker - on a desert planet), we've got the bad guys looking for it, the bad guys have a super weapon (Death Star v3.0),.. very predictable... and of course the good guys manage to blow up the new death star again, etc, etc... wow... Is it really supposed to be a sequel? It's rather a reboot. "
4015,1,"Unimaginative, lacking originality","I apparently don't live on the same planet as the other millions of people who enjoyed this movie because Star Wars 7 was bad as both a movie and as part of Star Wars. It's only realistic that fan expectations would at least be partially un-met, but I was not prepared for this irrational heartbreak. "
4016,3,An Insult to the Originals,Simply said... this is not only the worst star wars movie but one of the worst movies in general. Its a movie without a story. Without character.. All just nostalgia trip and bad fan service... Shouldnt be canon..
4017,1,A star wars movie without a story,"Probably last person in the United States to see it, but finally last night I enjoyed an empty theater to myself. To keep things short and fairly simple: it was entertaining, but underwhelming. Like others have written, this was more of a reboot than a sequel. Not must originality to the story at all. Droid with secret data hidden on desert planet, young girl with mysterious Jedi-like abilities, spooky masked man with Jedi blood going rogue, a mysterious hologram-projected ""supreme leader"" (that resembles a giant Gollum), and another Deathstar (now called a Starkiller) that needs to be taken out. Um...A New Hope anyone? YAWN."
4018,5,Underwhelming,"I wrote this short review to bring up an issue that I haven't yet seen anyone else mention, and that is: the UTTER STUPIDITY of Starkiller Base."
4019,5,Starkiller Base,"I tried to keep my expectations for the sequel in check, but I'm quite disappointed of how it turned out overall."
4020,5,The total is much less than the sum of the parts,"The basic plot of The Force Awakens is heavily borrowed from A New Hope. JJ Abrams introduced new characters that are not really new. Everything in this new world is familiar. Whatever worked with the old Star Wars was copied and rehashed into the greatest hits of The Force Awakens. Rey is essentially the new Luke; Rey is the new comic relief here in place of Chewbacca; Poe, a pilot, is the new Han Solo; BB-8 is a cuter R2-D2. In this new movie, the Death Star is gone, but it was replaced by a bigger one - ""The Star Killer"". In place of Darth Vader is Kylo Ren. Visually, it is as epic as any Star Wars, but story-wise it is moronic. It is no better than any Avengers movie."
4021,1,The Force Awakens: A New Hope Remixed,"watching this movie I realized for the first time what it feels like to watch your favorite franchise crash and burn in the pits. I am unsure how the actors when reading their lines didn't ask jj, ""Doesn't this sound like something these people have already done before"". The point in the movie when it collapsed for me was when the general or someone was describing to the audience how the new death star is larger than the previous death star. Oh god! If i was at the set I would have flung my blaster at the screen and walked out. I don't know if the director/producers etc actually heard why people hated the prequels. It was cause of the poor execution of dialogue and unnecessary amounts of CGI. They never complained about the expansion of the universe, hell the entire franchise is currently running on the expanded universe the video games and the clone wars series. I just hope they stop making more of these films. I am just gonna pirate these films from this point onwards cause hell Disney would not get a penny from me"
4022,1,There is no hope....,"This was a paint by numbers movie. Take the 1977 film and color it anyway you want, JJ Abrams. When the Star Wars name is slapped on a movie, you spend a lot of money, make a lot of money, that's how it works. Big hype, positive reviews, I got caught up in the excitement, wow, look at the special effects in the trailer, lots of things flying around and shooting! Paid my $9.00. Watched a totally uninspired piece of garbage. Should have let Jodorowsky do it. There is no Heart in this film. Geez louise, these characters were bland, no character development whatsoever. Just believe whatever it is this girl can do, she just can, OK. Yeah, I don't know why she was collecting garbage and eating weird add-water bread when she knows everything about everything and is the ultimate jedi. And Han Solo's kid, Kylo Ren? What a turd. If he was so badass he would have instantly sensed the weakness in Finn and killed him then and there. And what was up with that big holographic freak Snoke? Snoke? Stupid name. Was he supposed to be scary? Everything has to be taken for granted. Things just happen with no explanation or connection. Where was Poe? Oh yeah, I uh, was OK after all. Surprise, buddy! Captain Phasma? What is this, Mr. Roboto? No, domo arigato."
4023,1,"Go sit at the prequels table, Force Awakens","This movie certainly had some beautiful cinematography, epic space battles, great music, wonderfully nerdy nostalgia, and a good amount of humor, but I was very disappointed in the movie. For me, the original trilogy of Star Wars is as flawless and complete of a movie franchise as has ever existed. Everything is great, but what really makes these films for me is the character development. "
4024,4,"The hollow, nostalgic, shell of a once great franchise","I stopped watching after the scene with the Death Star...but bigger. Kylo Ren is a whiny Anakin Clone. I was really hoping for some original ideas but it was the exact same movie. I probably should of given it a 6/10 stars because it wasn't bad it was just really disappointing. I wanted to be surprised but I've already seen this movie. Go see it or don't just don't expect the be blown away. Oscar Isaacs did good job being the all American, Harrison Ford is a great actor but was right to of wanted Han killed off. Im sure a lot of work went into it but it just seems lazy. Avatar was amazing because it was a new concept and the new Star Trek is awesome because well I don't know why they work but they do. I'm really shocked more people don't feel this way."
4025,3,This should be considered a reboot,"A story about an untrained girl, who 'beats' a Dark Jedi (Sith, whatever...) who was trained by Luke Skywalker, and a Sith Lord. He also killed a bunch of other students (some who were very good), that were all trained by Luke Skywalker. "
4026,5,Makes a mockery out of the 'old' cast.,"I wanted to like this movie so much but I just couldn't credit it as a ""good"" movie. I waited in anticipation to see Starwars debut on the silver screen again but I was disappointed very much. The original Star Wars had such a significant cultural impact (having one of the most quoted lines ever) as well as a significant impact on the film industry with its unprecedented sound and visual effects. This one, however fell flat with no originality and average acting at best. "
4027,5,I wanted to like this movie so much.,"...I was missing Yoda singing a musical. I Hoped To Love This Movie, But No Chance At All."
4028,1,There was something missing...,"Disney only cares about money, they dont give a good god damn about anything or anyone... That being said, the ABSOLUTE WORST thing G lucas could have done was sell the rights to them.... That being said, Disney has butchered the last 3 movies but this one is the absolute worst of the 3.... hands down... The ignorant Fan Boys ( mostly comprised of stupid millennials) will say this is the best , but what the hell do they know..... this whole movie is one big rip off of a new hope... and disney has lured the mindless sheep to come watch this garbage.... i mean seriously... terrible writing, with more holes than the Iraqi Navy, bad character choices with no development, a sith lord wannabe that wears a mask from gi joe ( and does not need to wear one).... has a temper tantrum like a millennial fan boy, another death star ( like we have already seen before), another desert planet ( aka tatoine), and they kill off han solo for no reason.... give me a break !!!! People, WAKE THE HELL UP!!! And just run far away from this movie... run for the hills!!!"
4029,1,DISNEY DUMPSTER FIRE !!!!! Run for the hills..,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan...star wars, star trek, anything sci-fi."
4030,1,Really disappointed...second 1/2 of film was boring and predictable,so where Do I begin ?
4031,1,well..too much noise for..nothing!!!,"The rat awakens is just disney making money out of nostalgia, the worst part about it is that most people are so blind about it that it seems working for them"
4032,4,You're doing great Disney! Keep up the original material,"We've all been there, watching with glee as the mysteries contained within the rich spirit of Episode 4 A NEW HOPE masterfully emerged in our very first viewing. From that moment on, Star Wars became unique. Of course there was a huge amount of exciting action, bizarre characters and in some places - a rather thin plot. However, what the Star Wars films of old did possess was an integral sense of mystery and wonder, set up simply in a galaxy far, far away. Simply put, when setting out to view THE FORCE AWAKENS, I couldn't wait to experience a whole host of new mysteries, exciting action, bizarre new characters. I was expecting the thin plot points to be eradicated from the Star Wars universe. "
4033,4,Bombastic Blockbuster lacking in the Star Wars magic.,"The movie is simply not based on anything! How is it a sequel, when there's obviously, like, two movies worth of gap in there before it? What the hell is this new Empire-Lite and should i care? Throwing hissy fits is NOT super villain building. Where does the blood come from? Why is someone from laundry deployed as a commando? Why insert Max Von Sydow just to be killed? Why insert childhood family trauma events which you haven't already fleshed out to develop on in later installments? Why have any of the old staff around if you clearly don't want them around? Utter trash, made it impossible to care for 8 and 9. From this on i just watched with family, to laugh."
4034,1,If the soft reboot feel was its only problem...,"**I AM GOING TO REVEAL A LITTLE INFO THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SPOILERS, JUST SO THAT YOU'RE AWARE** "
4035,4,I was mostly disappointed,"Fool me once, shame on you Ep 1-3. Fool me twice, shame on me for getting sucked into the Ep VII hype."
4036,1,SW7: Cerebral Flatulence at its Finest,"'The Force Awakens' is essentially a fanboy's (J.J. Abrams') homage to the original Star Wars trilogy, full of old-time favorites (the Millennium Falcon! Han Solo's smuggler woes! A trash compactor joke!) and updated with PC casting choices (a woman jedi! Miles from 'Lost'! A black lead!). Unfortunately, while Abrams may have what it takes to get a movie as expensive as Star Wars made, he doesn't have what it takes to develop an interesting story. The film is full of convenient plot twists (Finn crashes in the desert of a planet he's not familiar with and nonetheless manages to find who he was looking for in a matter of minutes; Rey has no trouble utilizing her nascent jedi powers, even though Luke had to undergo significant training with Yoda to use his), as well as cliché dialogue (while their ship's under attack, Han Solo remarks, ""This is not how I imagined my day would go!""). "
4037,3,No One Will Watch this Years From Now,"Imagine you're in an alternate universe. You are watching The Lord of the Rings for the first time ever, having never read the books."
4038,4,Lazy blatant rehash with awful world building,"I've never left a review for a movie before, but this movie calls for it. Disney completely broke the trust of long-time fans, and unnecessarily made a movie that could have been a positive experience for many people into a very negative experience by killing Han Solo. Why? They do not provide any new real heroes (or villains) and instead make you watch the most iconic hero of the Star Wars universe die in front of you in front of a laughable villain. I think a lot of people are going to be saddened by this completely unnecessary act. Even the force itself was nothing that had ""soul"" anymore. Even that was flat. People weren't in love with Star Wars or lightsabers, they were in love with the heroes that dared to go against tyrants. But this movie was made by tyrants of the entertainment industry, what could we expect? Thanks for nothing, Disney."
4039,1,"No soul, No Heroes","The Force Awakens was a fun if uninspired movie, that fuses a cast of new quirky characters almost seamlessly with a number of old time favorites. And the onscreen chemistry is great. The adventure is exciting if already done and the pacing is very Star Wars. While Kylo Ren was a week and unconventional villain, that give him the potential the be a more interesting villain(Ante herow?) than usual. And the ominous supreme leader Snoke fills the niche of evil mastermind well enough. None of this however saved the movie form a number of unfortunate truths. The most obvious of which is that the movie is actually A New Hope but different and in a decisively worse way. Almost trope for trope the force awakens was a copy of A New Hope. Not to say there weren't some very different elements but the skeleton was still there. Orphan hero growing up on a desert planet, secret data carried by a droid that speaks in beeps, new heroes' meat old heroes, old hero sacrifices himself in front of new hero. And before it is all over a bar fight at a really sketchy bar. Retooling the old movies however was not as bad as what they had to do to the Star Wars Universe to do it. Taking the rebellion back to square one betrayed the entire first trilogy as a whole. Sending Han and Chewy back into the smuggling business undoes all the character evolution he underwent in the first 3 movies, and requires that we imagine Laya would just let him go. And there is a huge plot whole established with the introduction of Supreme Leader Snoke. All of the Sith were destroyed. Twice in fact, the first time before A Phantom Menace, the second time at the end of Return of the Jedi. So where did this new guy come from especially since he seems so old. I must say that although it was an enjoyable movie it's popcorn value dos not make up for the fact that they had to reboot the universe to retell us a story we liked but in a worse way. Say what you want about the screen writing of the prequels, but you must admit the story was fantastic. The Plot of The Force Awakens leaves much to be desired and that is as thoroughly un Star Wars as a movie can be."
4040,2,Star Wars did not need a reboot,"I hardly ever (never) 'rate' films and this probably deserves a little more than 5 from the standpoint of 'cinema'. It's just that I expected a lot more after such a long wait. The CGI was passable (given it was a wide berth); Carrie Fisher ""changed her hair"" (when she should have swapped out everything); I think Harrison Ford just wanted to be somewhere else (and finally got there); and where was the plot? I don't think I'm submitting a 'spoiler' if I say this is pretty much the first Star Wars with a bigger Death Star and even then there was something very familiar about its destruction. I know it's all supposed to be tongue-in-cheek but if I'm allowed to get really 'picky' why was Daisy Ridley given a wheel-less tractor as her run-about? If you're going to visit scrap-yards for cheap props why not crowbar and anti-grav. motor into a Lamborghini rather than an old clapped out Fergy. Not Sci-Fi's most notable achievement."
4041,5,This truly puts the hype into hyperspace,"I dont know how this movie is ranked this high? I mean we've seen this movie before. It was a new hope, and it was not trying to pander. This movie is horrible just like everything dianey acquires that they did not develop. They simply destroy"
4042,1,What a bad star wars,"I am not a film critic, just a film lover so I will just share my thoughts. No matter how many ""Star Wars"" movies are made, none will ever fare well next to the original trilogy. Back then the technical advances were astounding. I did not see this in 3D and since the original wasn't in 3D, I am comparing apples to apples. I am not an expert in film technology and I doubt that most people watching films are. However, after 40 years of advances, I was surprised that I didn't see any significant differences. In fact, I felt that the original was much more memorable. I will never forget the feeling I had when it started with the space ship going over our heads. Now that was noticeable advancement with the wow factor. This one fell flat in comparison."
4043,4,Not worth the hype,I was very much looking forward to seeing this new Stars Wars movie that was going to include the actors from the first 3 films.
4044,1,Star Wars: The Turkey Awakens,"Waste of time and money. The story is really cliché, unoriginal and predictable."
4045,3,"Terrible cliché storyline, some nice special effects",There are so many wrong things in this movie that it really makes me wonder if the writers have ever watched the previous 6 movies. I mean come on...In episode 6 the rebels won the war and destroyed the Empire. We saw the people happy in the whole galaxy. I can understand that sith could return somehow but on the other hand it makes no sense that Luke did nothing to protect the galaxy from a feature threat. He should have built a Jedi academy and first of all train his sister. It makes no sense that Ben Solo wasn't protected from turning to dark side by him and his parents. Not only that but Kylo Ren was pathetic and weak. Killing his dad didn't make sense and it wasn't the end the most beloved character in star wars saga deserved. And last I have to speak about Rey. Enough with the macho women for no reason in movies already. She was really boring as a character and felt like thrown to the movie from out of nowhere. Disney also keep a note. Lightsaber is not a toy anyone can hold. The only chance someone will like this movie is if he hasn't watched the previous star wars movies. Otherwise he will be mad about this disgrase. George Lucas how could you let this happen? :(
4046,1,Disney what have you done?," The story really moved, almost too fast at times, and resembled the Star Trek movies.  I thought there were way too many coincidences, which IMO was a pre-existing weak element of the other films. Force Awakens took it and ran.  Given the fact that the Empire and the Sith are still there really diminishes the ending to ROTJ and fully qualifies Episode VII thru IX as simply add-on sequels in my mind.  The middle of the film sagged quite a bit, similar to ROTJ. I'm referring to many of the scenes on Yavin and the plan to destroy the super weapon. I cringed during exposition dialogue between Han and Leia. Are they really going to sum up why they've been separated from each other after so many years in a sentence or two and now everything is just peachy? Wasn't buying it.  Speaking of dialogue, I suppose people prefer a healthy ""YEAH!"" and ""WOOO!"" to ""Yipee!"". I don't see a huge difference.  I thought the scene where Finn and Rey turned to the Falcon, revealing the ship (and direct link to the OT for the first time) was cool.  The person I attended with thought there was too much humor in the movie. I did enjoy some of it, but I think it may have been a bit much at times. I think this movie probably had more humor moments than any from the OT, which is probably too much.  I liked some of Han Solo's scene, and the exchanges with Finn were humorous. Other times he seemed like an old goof. I liken it to the way Kevin Anderson wrote the character versus Timothy Zahn in the post-ROTJ era novels. I prefer Zahn, and I didn't see much of that here.  Wasn't buying the sudden obsession that Finn had to save Rey. I could easily see this as a budding romance in the upcoming sequels. That's the only motivation I could reason.  I thought Daisy Ridley did a nice job, but I'm not sold on the central character and heir of this franchise being a woman in what's traditionally been a mostly male fanboy set of war movies set in space. I know some will think that's a sexist remark, however, I think those people are confusing art with social and political standards in our society. If Disney is trying to expand their target audience to include a large majority of women, then just come out and say so instead of pretending that Lucas did something wrong or times have changed. It's insulting to the original fans.  Adam Driver's character was interesting and complex. I welcomed the scenes where he took off the mask.  I liked Poe Dameron based on his limited screen time.  BB-8 was a likable character.  Captain Phasma - meh  Snoke struck me as a giant Gollum or something out of Harry Potter. Not much originality.  Rey and certainly Finn appeared to have acquired dueling techniques a little too quick for my taste, especially when matched against Kylo Ren, who obviously was dedicated to the task.  This movie marks the fourth out of seven where the climax revolves around a super weapon being destroyed. Do people think that's a requirement for a movie to ""feel"" like SW?  Not much fuss was kicked up around Han Solo's death after it happened. Nobody consoled Chewie and he seemed to bounce back rather quickly. At least Padme got a funeral.  R2-D2 on the other hand was completely distraught and shuts down for years after a bunch of padawans were killed. I would think R2 would bounce back much quicker than Chewie, especially considering we lost HAN SOLO instead of characters that never had any screen time.  Powerful ending with Rey offering the lightsaber to a much older Luke. Leaves you wondering what's he thinking? I'm not sure I want to see more. Some things are better left untold :)"
4047,1,The Farce Awakens,What a wasted opportunity.
4048,3,Terrible Reboot Puts the Final Nail in the Star Wars Coffin,And This Was The Only Movie Available On It Forever And Ever...
4049,2,If I Were On A Desert Island,"Don't worry-- no spoilers here. If you've never seen any Star Wars films, never read any of the expanded universe, or simply are looking for a fun evening I think you'll have a great time. However..."
4050,4,Battlefront: The Movie,"PS: A few spoilers here and there First of all, I have never seen the need to write a review till today. Disappointed isn't even the word for what I feel. This movie felt like a punishment from God for not going to church today."
4051,1,"JJ Abrams, you have a lot to answer for on judgment day!!!","Wow...I saw ""Star Wars"" in 1977....now I just saw it again, except it is renamed ""The Force Awakens."" A complete ripoff of the original masterpiece. Shameful."
4052,1,A Complete Disappointment,"When my father took me to see the first ever Star Wars movie, screened at Odeon Cinema in early 80's, i was a kid. I was thrilled by the graphics of the movie, which was great even to this day, as it was a immeasurable experiential leap for me from watching the movie Weera Saradiel. Since then I watched all Star Wars movies as a youth and also with my son, Mev, through generations, and played every movie-game on PC and every generation of Playstation. Today with Mev again I watched the latest. Of course I enjoyed the visual perspectives to the fullest. But at the same time I was a bit disappointed as much as I was as a child that day after seeing the first movie. Star Wars civilization is yet to figure-out a better way of video surveillance, remote sensing, spotting and hunting down enemies. Their sophisticated worlds still depend on the capacity of dumb, individual, lowly-sensitive robotic soldiers to hunt down enemies from door to door, corridor to corridor, wood to wood, behind rocks and walls, behind bushes, like a bunch of stupid idiots jay-walking into ambushes. This wasn't any better than our great grandfathers' time when the British hunted down Weera Saradiel in thick jungles. Not even a single CCTV camera is found in a corner. As in most popular Hollywood movies, the kind-hearted, strong n' protective, supportive, Black guy dies before the movie ends, leaving the ""stronger"" protagonist white guy (gal in this movie) taking the fight over. The black guy is usually an honest subservient, less intelligent, humble, army-worker serving the best interest of the white guy/gal. There is no cool science, no technological advancement, no romance, no kisses. But politically correct to have had a dominant female protagonist, not playing a role merely as a sex object, which men often fall in love with. Though I expected at least Obama could make a change to the dominant American white culture to have a black guy kissing a white woman on Hollywood screen or fall in love with each other. It never happened. In general the movie has no big story-line, a plot, other than few random dog fights, sword/saber fights, fist fights and occasional acts of robotic cutie. No excitement, no sensual appeals, no comedy nor tragedy or emotions to take-home in general. Fighting goes from man-to-man, robot-to-man, ship-to-ship as of today giving the meaning of life to fighting wars in sandy brown dry deserts. No one can still hit a target with a single gun shot, but needs a shower of smart bombs/plasma sprayed allover to destroy one as of today -one random shot occasionally hits where it was intended. Dead are mostly bystanders. It looks like a low-budgeted movie overall with no depth -meaning that it's a failure. But money they pump into advertising wont let this Star Wars one such. For $60 bucks it wasn't a bad outing on a Boxing Day for me and Mev. Because the snack was great."
4053,5,Waste of my time -felt like playing a video game,I can't say much more than all the justifiable criticisms leveled by other disappointed viewers...
4054,1,Just... no,Well.. 
4055,1,Disney Star Wars.,"""Fan"" service is the path to the dark side. JJ Abrams, being a ""fan"" himself, shows this with The Force Awakens by not only reusing the same plot points and set pieces of the original trilogy, but completely rehashing them and overlaying them with modern visual effects, adding nothing new or exciting, actually getting rid of the only thing that made the boat float and leaving nothing to look forward to. You can read all the dirty details in other negative reviews but I want to focus on something else."
4056,2,"""Fan"" service leads to nostalgia, nostalgia leads to money, money leads to suffering.","I feel like this movie was treated like a total reboot of the franchise instead of being a sequel. And it is a sequel. It's a direct continuation of the story, although it feels completely unnatural and not true to the original trilogy's ending what-so-ever. The new characters are cool at the start. I mean watching the first few scenes of the movie is almost orgasmic. As a Star Wars fan, that's everything I could have asked for. However, the movie changes during its course. It's one thing to be mysteriously powerful, but a whole another to just completely destroy anything in your path. There is no build-up of anticipation after a certain point is reached. You can just assume the main character is always going to prevail no matter what, and despite all odds, without even breaking a sweat. It would be fine if someone had to work for it, but the characters are just handed everything they need, and buffed to meet their opposition whenever it's required. No character arcs, just immediate power changes. It's almost funny. Still a great watch and much better than its sequel. Its effects are astonishingly well done, but the fight scenes need better choreography."
4057,3,This is not a reboot,"Just awful is all I can say. A sanitation storm trooper,, who was at a invasion? A sanitation storm trooper who knows how to sword fight? Just clueless. I did not like this at all, my children did not like this, my grandma did not like this, Time lines seem to not fit, we got a old princess lea, but the technology hasn't been improved, or the old craft has not been upgraded to new technology. The found the falcon on a junk planet, but yet it's fully operational after 40 years, do they have eternal power sources, i don't think so. The end of the show was even more worthless, Luke was on what appears to be earth? and on a island in the middle of the ocean with no food or water or shelter. lololmao. Things must be getting pretty desperate in Lollywood for them to be pumping out this garbage."
4058,1,JJ Abrams needs to quit,"No vision, no villain, no acting, no script, no imagination, no 'Star Wars' wisdom, no music. In a word - NO-Movie. There are movies that you watch and you forget about them on the next day. This is not the case. This movie you forget in the next hour and you never want to remember about it. And what is even worse I don't think that they can turn the game in the sequels with this casting. The only good things in the movie were BB-8 and that it finished. If they rename it to ""Teenage Star Wars"" than it could make scene. And let someone that really cares to make the Start Wars move that each generation deserve. Never, ever have seen such a misleading rating."
4059,1,"Oh, my god!","I knew from the trailer that this is a poor movie, but I had to see it for my self. Unfortunately for me, I had to witness the total destruction of the soul of the Star Wars. After that THING happened I had to walk out from the theater."
4060,1,you take a !@#$ and then you %^&* on it,"I've never done this before but I can't stand it anymore so I had to write something about SWVII. So for those who care to read it this is my take on the last Star Wars. Warning spoilers are included for those who haven't seen it yet. The only good thing about this film to me is the female lead. She's good and she has the right tough temper. Overall I'm very disappointed because of the lack of imagination. This film is mostly a copy/paste of the 1977 episode IV. Remember the droid sent with something hidden in it and found by Luke ? It's really disappointing that with a universe like that writers in Hollywood can't come up with something new, original and creative. But anyway that's what Disney does all the time (copy/paste good film recipes), so that's what they wanted and that's what they did. We even have to stand the same old « I disable the shields so that you can destroy the death star » which we've seen three times now ! It's so boring. The only surprise is that the death star is bigger ! Wow shocking ! The other weaknesses in the film are : - The Bad guy looks strong at the beginning which is promising but then gets his ass easily kicked by a girl who's not even a Jedi yet ! - The phony and unoriginal « last Jedi location map » and one piece of the puzzle map missing. - The Han Solo'son and reverse father/son relationship is predictable cheap and doesn't work for me. - It's nice to put Harrison Ford back in but he's there too much sorry. And now to compensate that he can't have the same action scenes as before they have added humour. Some are good but it's way too much. Sometimes it made me feel like I was watching a Star Wars parody. Also because Han Solo is an important character it creates an unbalance in the story since the true heroes are Finn and Rey. The light saber is a holly thing to me and that's what they want to show when Rey touches it for the first time and the all idea of going to this island to bring it back to Luke. But then why does the old woman proposes Rey to take it since she doesn't even know her much or it appears so ? Why also is it so simply passing to the hands of Finn so he can have fun with it a little ? It's nice coming up with the idea that Finn is a storm trooper who wants to break free but how do you make us buy that ? Why does he so easily escapes ? Why all the others don't do like he does ? Why is he the only one that thinks « oh my god I'm killing innocent people I have to stop » ? The beginning of the film up to the moment when Han Solo is coming back was promising then the Force put me asleep If you want to see good truly imaginative, and gripping Star Wars films watch episodes IV, V, VI."
4061,4,The Force put me asleep.,"I have mixed feelings about this film, on one hand, it has some of the best action and special effects that I have ever seen in a film. It blew me away with how amazing it looked, keeping true to the original films but with a modern twist."
4062,5,A slightly disappointing film.,"I just came back from a midnight screening and i have to tell you how it went. There are no spoilers in this piece because it's impossible to spoil this film. There are no words....sorry i have to rephrase...there is no language known to man to describe my shock and utter disgust upon watching this abomination. I'm a middle aged man in my forties and i have watched thousands of movies in my lifetime. This one is by far , by a million miles, the worst movie i had ever the discomfort to endure. It was a disgrace. I believe there is no original idea in the script, not a single one! If you have ever watched ""Star Wars: A new hope"" don't bother. Its indistinguishable from this one. Its a total rip-off. At one point i wanted to cut my right arm of and f*** myself with my detached limb to distribute the pain evenly. It was unbearable. If it wasn't for the mercy killing towards the end i would have left the theater. My eyes were burning from witnessing the greatest debacle of the film industry since...since...since when actually? Nothing comes to mind! For the first time in my life i heard an audience booing at the end mixed with sighs of relief. About half of the people left early. Oh, how i envy those lucky bastards. Anger and disbelief followed by growing numbness of the face. If you are suicidal watch this film! It gives hope to the the hopeless,cause you truly know what rock bottom is after watching it. There is no point in criticizing specific aspects of the film. Its a total failure across-the-board. Its an all- encompassing disaster of epic proportions. Decades from now people will stand in awe reading pages after pages of inconsistencies meticulously collected by former fans of the franchise. A last service rendered to one of the greatest stories ever told. Star Wars died today. And in the end, it was a relief. Years from now, when you look back on your life you will remember Star Wars as something best described by John and Paul: ""And in the end, the love you take Is equal to the love you make."""
4063,1,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - a eulogy,"Where do I begin? Where do I begin indeed After a while you begin to notice commonalities between movies, plots, characters, themes and other nuances of the theatrical type. In a multi-movie run as long as Star Wars has been around you are bound to notice some of these similarities - most of which are minor in scope and detail. Overall though we expect originality to build our belief in the world being shown to us on the silver screen. It is this originality that we go back for, it is this newness that keeps us expecting more and it is this fresh take that make us excited about a movie that defines our generation."
4064,1,"Star Wars VII ""I've Got A Bad Feeling About This""","Some appealing young actors are mixed in with some aged, mediocre actors in an incoherent story. And there are some mediocre young actors to balance the dramatic force. The movie put me to sleep twice watching it at home. My wife and I were asking each other ""Didn't that guy die? Does this mean that guy is dead?"" This movie makes Battlefield Earth look good! The writers and director should be consigned to the Spice Mines of Kessel on account of this abomination."
4065,1,Dreck,"1) Costumes are pretty bad... 2) light saber fights are extremely lame...unbelievably boring comparing to its predecessors... 3)CG scenes look cheap 4)choice of actors are even worse (besides Daisy Ridley who plays Rey seems good)...generally it's a movie of a funny black man, a girl, an expensive old white guy, an ugly white psychopath, a terrorist looking pilot, and the gem of the movie:BB8"
4066,4,Probably one of the worst scifi movies I have seen...,"Disney bought LucasFilm from George Lucas and immediately saw a cash grab with the Star Wars movies. They tried with one of their one franchises ""Tron"". But it didn't make as much money as they wanted it to, and Disney is all about MAKING MONEY!"
4067,2,Congratulations! Disney has stolen your money!,"I'm not a super fan of Star Wars, I watched the saga few times and enjoy them as well as the characters but I wouldn't consider myself as a huge fan like a lot of people out there, including my husband, I even liked the prequels :) But this movie was a huge disappointment even for me.. No original scenario, repeat of a lot of major scenes from episodes IV and VI. Dark side is not impressive at all, Snoke seams to get confused and came to the wrong set instead of the Lord of the Rings.. And those jokes.. they tried so hard to be funny, it's nice to have some funny moments now and then through out the movie as previous episodes but this is over kill.. Sorry but not curious about the rest of the story.."
4068,3,Disappointment ***may contain spoilers***,"I went into the theater expecting (judging from the hype and reviews) an exciting new chapter in the Star Wars saga. And in the early going it delivers. The visuals are fantastic and it has the feel of a Star Wars epic. The new characters are interesting and mostly well played. The camera particularly loves Daisy Ridley (in the role of Rey), and for good reason as she seems quite capable. I suspect we will be seeing much more of her. The action is fast paced and the film never bores. It does however begin to drift to the dark side."
4069,5,"""Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The futurethe past. Old friends long gone."" – Yoda","I remember when the long expected SW1 was released, many critics didn't enjoy some new elements (jarjar, a never-ending race, and many other aspects of the story...). I share their views and I was disappointed by the episode. It seems that the writers didn't want to take the risk to create anything new in the plot and therefore just took the SW4 scenario, slightly modified the characters (in worse) and delivered a no-risk blockbusters. What a pity when we learn during the movie all the interesting stories that happened in the ellipse between SW6 and SW7 and that could have been the potential scenario of a great SW7, like for example : - how the New Order rose from the ashes of the Empire - how Luke created a new generation of jedis - how Han and Leia's son betrayed him - where the new big bad guy comes from ... and my favourite : how to deal with the defeated side once you militarily won the final battle ? That's my favourite because it has a contemporary echo (what shall we do once we defeated Irak or Libya or Afghanistan...) exactly like all the good episodes of SW have (first trilogy=WW2 , prelogy=trade used as soft power weapon, weaknesses of democracies). SW1 was bad too. Let's hope that SW8 and 9 will improve as SW2 and 3 did."
4070,2,"Writers were afraid to create something new, I guess...","Before I begin my review, I would like to warn readers that there are spoilers."
4071,4,"A Good Movie, Just Not a Good Star Wars Movie","Where to start from? I do not even know how to explain this film. Let me first say that I am one of the BIGGEST fans of Star Wars. I even like Jar Jar... but this, this is not Jar jar, this is not even star wars. This is some space film with star wars characters in it... I cannot call it a remake, because a remake is something that duplicates the old one trying to make it look better. It would of been actually nice if they had made a remake. Ohhh Disney we would buy your toys anyway, no need for this type of rubbish. OK too much negativism... Let me actually do a proper review.. I am just too disappointed."
4072,2,This is a big let down but why are we surprised?,"If you're expecting to have your mind blown by new story lines, plots and special effects, be prepared to be disappointed. This movie is almost like a re-edited together cuts from Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi along with a few scenes from I, II and III. There is absolutely NOTHING novel in this movie, not even memorable quotes, that makes you excited if you've seen the previous six films. The story line and plot gets almost predictable - another Lightsaber fight, another space battle dog fight between TIE fighters and X-Wings and that ""Death Star Trench Scene"" looks all-too-familiar. Even worse, ""General"" Leia looks like she belongs in a rocking chair, Hans Solo looks like he can't run anymore (not without computer animation anyways) and Luke makes all but cameo appearance at the very end. Save your money and time standing in long lineups - you can wait for it to appear in the Sunday matinées a few years from now and just rent the DVDs. AND DEFINITELY DON'T SEE IT TWICE."
4073,3,Almost a re-edit of previous movies! Yawn.,A disclaimer: I don't like much cinema. 
4074,4,"Many will love it, but doesn't match the hype. In fact, even un-hyped, it would be a let-down","The best: Likely going to be the biggest earning film of all time, so if you judge success by numbers, this film is the best. The worst: All the negative comments about this film are true, regrettably true, such a shame."
4075,2,The best & the worst at the same time,"I am speechless, what a let down!"
4076,1,Don't waste your time..just watch the Star Wars IV,"How did we get here? In Episode 6, the rebels were winning. The Empire was breaking and the emperor was (temporarily) gone. (Note: If you read the books and the comics, you would understand what i mean by ""temporarily"")."
4077,2,An SJW push disguised as a Star Wars movie,"When I learned that JJ. Abrams was going to lead the new Star Wars project, I was rather pleased given the quality of some of his previous works (Lost TV-show in particular, even though most of the kudos should be credited to Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse)."
4078,1,Are critics and consumers that dumb ?,"Oh man, I wasn't expecting a giant narrsty computer generated Gollum as the Supreme Leader, (just found out he was played by the same guy!).. that Solo's son stuff was really weak, why was he following the dark side when granddad Vader had turned good? To be fair he was a really useless bad guy, smashing up computers in a childish tantrum with his retrograde sabre, he should never have taken the helmet off, or never put one on in the first place as it proved to be pointless. . Plus after all his training in the force, by Luke (?)!) (he even stopped a lazer beam with the force, them he got beat by Rey who had never used the force or a lightsaber before?! How would that happen? 'The force was strong' with Luke in the originals but Vader would've kicked his butt had he not had top training from Yoda. Luke needed years of training.. . The story felt far too rushed, yet another death star, 'but stronger coz it's a planet'? Like no none would notice the big gaping hole for a massive gun the size of Europe? Just as vulnerable to a xwing fighters as the first death star.. yaawwwnarama! . Why was Luke just chillin on an island whilst billions of innocents died & he was more than willing to lay down his life for the Rebellion before? . The neurotic yelling by the two lead actors did nothing to sooth the disjointed editing between scenes. It was akin to watching Keira Knightly having a fit whilst Eddie Murphy misfires jokes around her. . Ford looked like he should have been in bed, and Carrie.. talking out of her nose. . Heartbreakingly bad. . One of the weakest scenes in any star wars movie: Solo cornered between a Scottish band of bounty hunters and Asian bounty hunters, saved by giant rolling aliens, Indiana Jones in space? Like a scene edited out of the pilot episode for Red Dwarf, just a cheap idea. Did they survey children visiting Disneyland to get ideas for this? . 3 people at the end fighting with light sabres that chopped down trees, all 3 got clocked full on, and not even a finger was lost. + why didn't Leah become a Jedi? + why the heck wasn't there a war years ago with the Republic/ resistance to stop the rise of the 1st order? and couldn't they get better actors and script writers.. and .. why aren't the majority of reviews here registering on the overall rating - 8.6 at the moment, my maths isn't as bad as my grammar - I can see the average rating is 4."
4079,1,The Spoiler is.. it's awful.. Heart breakingly awful.,"If you want to see new, cool or even remotely interesting things stay far far away from this one. But if you do want to see another kid on a desertplanet for the third time, a deathstar for the third time or an exact replica of a certain scene from the episode 4 this should be just the thing for you. Also appearing jar jar-3po, the worst lightsaber design ever and much more stupid sh*t. "
4080,1,The original ones wasn't even that good to begin with,Take a look at the rating details for this movie and you'll see that the highest ratings are coming from the youngest age group (18 and younger) while the lowest ratings are from the highest age group (45+). This is really all you need to know about this movie.
4081,1,"I understand, but then again, I don't understand...","I went to the theater expecting to be let down, but it was still worse than I expected. If this was just a standalone movie the plot, character development and action would all be considered pretty weak. But this was supposed to be a Star Wars movie."
4082,1,A re-release of the Phantom Menace would have been better.,*** This review may contain spoilers ***
4083,1,Star Wars is dead....,"I am not someone who would normally post on a site such as this. If I don't like a movie/TV show/restaurant whatever I tend to vote with my feet next time. The Force Awakens is a special case. Many of the generation my wife and I grew up with were raised on these films. I believe the centre of their appeal is the strength of the storytelling. The special effects were important but secondary to the overall ""feel"". We went to the midnight screening. We did not display quite the same level of devotion as those who turned up on a hot Australian summer night in full Chewbacca suits, but the allure of continuing the ""feel"" of 1983 was enough to get us our well past our usual bedtimes. I think it fair to say the criticisms of this movie, in particular the weakness of the story, have been extensively explored on these pages and I don't need to repeat them here. I understand the need for Disney and its partners to make money from this The Force Awakens, be it through ticket sales and associated marketing, and that ultimately this drives the agenda. Disney is an extraordinarily successful company and has partnered with extraordinarily successful people in the making of this film. What perplexes me most is that anyone with even a passing interest in Star Wars can see the gaping flaws, and the obvious pitch at a teen market. Given that my generation are now likely to be the ones with the most disposable income to put towards this, it staggers me that such little thought appears to have been directed towards what I assumed would be its ""cash cow"". I suspect the guys in the Chewbacca suits needing IV rehydration would agree with me. We will be voting with our feet next time."
4084,2,You upset my wife,"Not the worst, not close to to best. I went to the theater hyped up as the trailer really gave me that old school Star Wars feeling. Little did I know this was to become my disappointment of the year by far."
4085,5,"Not the worst, not close to to best","this is the first time i have ever written a review on a movie, because i cannot believe that it has an 8.7 and 95% on rotten tomatoes"
4086,1,lack of originality and depth left me feeling no care for anyone on the screen,"Me as lot of other Star Wars fans had a neutral stance for this movie. I said to myself that I will go to the movie with an opened mind and at the end decide if I will still be a Star Wars fan or not. Disney managed to break it. The movie had awesome sound effects, this is the only positive thing I remember. The screen writing was poorly written, comparable to those written by children, the acting was just a little above amateurish, also to many nature shots. The story was not that well developed and, also it did not bring anything new. If you are afraid of cliff hangers and opened and not closed background stories don't be, there are so many that you will forget most of them."
4087,2,"Make it or Break it, it broke it",I for one am not a Star Wars fan but I've had to ride the hype train. This movie had a huge score on IMDb after all (~9.2). While seeing the movie in the cinema I was extremely disappointed. While waiting for this piece of garbage to finish I could only wonder how could they spend 200 mil $ on it. 1000$ on the script and the rest on trying to make something decent out of it?
4088,3,A mediocre movie with a story that makes no sense,"The Force Awakens is a well-executed movie, and is pretty likeable until you realize that it's just a dumbed bown version of the original Star Wars. I think fans liked the fan service in this movie because they hadn't been serviced in so long, but that's all this movie is - a nostalgic homage to Star Wars. I'm not saying that you need to crap all over te series's past like the Last Jedi did, but you do need to go into new territory every once in a while. This movie started this trend in Star Wars of projects ticking all of the nostalgia boxes, not matter how unnecessary."
4089,4,I hate everything this movie is,A big disappointment. 
4090,3,Wall-E meets Voldemort,"Try to compare the dynamics between Anakin Skywalker and Lord Sidious, with Kylo Ren. When Sidious tries to pull Anakin into the dark side using his love for Padme, the emotional breakup and destruction of Anakin himself into becoming a Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Compare that to this Kylo Rens act. This new Kylo Ren is something taken from the Harry Pothead movies. He wasn't a convincing Sith."
4091,5,Hardcore Star Wars fan.,"It's unbelievable, this movie is just a copy of episodes IV to VI. Nothing new, it felt like a ""deja-vu"". They just changed some character and picked the ideas in the previous movies. It's a new vador who leads an army to kill the republic but a few rebels are fighting back with the help of some x-wing to destroy a massive weapon which is just a bigger death star. A lot of scenes are similar too and the special effects are not that good, they're not better than in the 80's. This movie is nothing else than a cash machine. They spent most of their money in marketing not in the movie itself. I prefer watching again the previous episodes, this one really sucks and it adds nothing to the story."
4092,3,it's a deja-vu,"Is it me, or did anyone else sense that J.J. Abram's hands were tied in this movie, as compared to how good his reboot for Star Trek was? Everyone for the most part, complained that George Lucas was not able to create the Star Wars magic after episode IV and V (Episode VI is NOT included, as it was the beginning of the end for Lucas, which started when the first Ewok came on the scene...You could argue that Lucas brought back some of his charm into episode I (conspiracy element, and Jedi Lore, but it also came with impossible loose ends, and Jar Jar Binks, and even Ewan Mcgregor and Liam Nesson who did great, couldn't save this movie. It was like Titanic, all you want to do is watch some pod racing and go to the final battle. With Episode II, you have Queen Amidala getting mauled, I mean scratched by a giant cat, need I say more? Episode III, was Lucas final shot at getting it right, and he did many things really well, right up until how he showed how Anakin became Darth Vader, and it was a disaster of sorts from that point on. Trying to find the 'high ground' in this movie, that was remotely salvageable was possibly Yoda's light saber battle versus the Emperor, and Mcgregor's acting ability. These first three movies in my opinion were just a little too big for Lucas to handle, maybe it should have been broken up into other movies, as he had too many elements that needed to drive these movies several different directions that would eventually have led up to Episode IV, A New Hope. Episode III was by far a better plotted out movie then episode VI. However by the end of this Episode VII, the Force Awakens, I was trying to find a way to execute order 66, so that I could be able to make some sense of several things that took place in this movie. All the anticipation of looking forward to this move and it came off as a rip off of a former world with new players. It was still yet along the lines of episode I, and II and VI. With no Luke Skywalker in the movie, it became a drag to watch. They took everyone for a ride on this one, in essence lying to everyone, as there were high expectations on what should have happened in this movie to a point. I believe most thought that you were going to see the Luke in Jedi glory, with light saber scenes that should have rivaled Darth Maul. Instead you got less then expected, typical...The light saber battles are awkward because of the lack of experience on all sides, might as well have used a blaster, it would have made more sense then her suddenly becoming attuned to the force. I hate those type of loopholes, as it's like her whole life is a mystery, and then suddenly she has this keen sense to fly the Falcon and then knows how to understand the force, without any training whatsoever, it's like CMON MAN. The story of Han Solo going back to smuggler is about as stupefying as him becoming a General. Why would he go back to doing that garbage when he would have become rich, which was what he always wanted anyway! I didn't mind Solo's death, I actually was thinking this would happen, as Ford wanted out of this misery of Star Wars as it showed when he was out in public. Leia was very old and needed to be taken out of the movie entirely, I was hoping the planet might destroy her as her role was really weak, and she didn't even look her age, more like she was a wanta be young woman with lots of botox and dyed hair. There was moments where lack of emotion was present throughout the movie, and cgi graphic mumbo jumbo didn't help, sometimes you wish they would go back to episode IV and see how much more real it is just to put on makeup on a person, they still don't know how to get this right, Transformers did a good job, so perhaps they should go talk to those guys on how to do it properly. Kylo Ren didn't even look like Solo or Leia, and cracked me up as I thought he might be out of a rock band or something. The Evil commander on the planet, which was played by a dude out of harry potter? Seemed out of sorts for the role. He was much too young to be such a person, and a wanta be Grand Moff Tarkin. List goes on and on...In the end, 30 years has past, and the movie needs another 30 years to get it right! I'm wondering how much the Disney Board had influence on this movie, as I think that Abram had a chance to make a special movie here and failed. If this is your fault J.J. Abrams, then please stick with Star Trek instead, as you blew your chance on this one."
4093,5,"Another Episode I, II and VI, No Luke?! This movie deserved better...","J.J Abrams once promised us all of a majestic meal called the 'seven course Star Wars meal.' This included a bubbling white wine with a wedge of lemon on the rim of the glass. On the side was the delicious, steaming, roasted seven course gourmet meal. "
4094,1,It's a rehashed Star Wars movie. What more do you expect?,*** This review may contain spoilers. Yet if you have seen the other movies you have seen this one! ***
4095,1,A scavenged pile of crap,"As a huge Star Wars fan, I had looked forward to seeing this movie. The trailer looked amazing, and the new characters along with some of the old seemed like a good combination, so expectations were high. But after spending over two hours, at what most of all just seemed like a long summary of the old movies and an empty story without head and tail, the force failed with a big jaw dropping question mark ""WTF did i just watch""?. An evil villain who looks like a teenager, a female stormtrooper commander with a baby voice, a poorly animated overlord with a terrible name, and some embarrassing lightsaber battles, did that I had to leave the theater crying. The entire Star Wars universe has been totally destroyed by this embarrassing attempt to pursue one of the largest and best sagas ever."
4096,1,The Force Fails,-> May contain spoilers <-
4097,2,Disappointment,"If this was the first ever Star Wars movie I might have given it a pretty good score as a bit of fun, but the original movies do exist, this movie is a bizarrely rehashed sequel of those, and my life would have been better if it had never been made."
4098,1,Terrible: trying to be a reboot and sequel at the same time simply can't work,"How is it possible that all official film critics are raving about this film, while 'real' people think the opposite? Did JJ bribe them all? Are they afraid to have a aberrant opinion? Are there no StarWars fans among them? This is not a bad film, just a very mediocre film that you will not want to see more than once. It lacks the StarWars feeling, the suspense building is just not there, the plot is completely unrealistic (yes, even for a science fiction movie) and the storyline is an exact copy of episode IV. Even the much disliked (not by me) episodes I to III had more soul in it than this thing. Damn you JJ for screwing up this epic series and damn you George for selling out the rights to this non-fan (or non-understanding fan). The Force was definitely not with you. But, let us not be lead by fear and hope that Rian Johnson will set things right in episode VIII. At least he looks nerdy enough to be a real fan. The Dark Side will not prevail!"
4099,5,What is wrong with official film critics???,"It makes no sense that this film is so bad. This is the return of Star Wars after all, Disney. How can you screw it up so bad?<br /><br />Firstly, the story. What story? They ripped off the old episodes in order to reboot Star Wars for preteens.<br /><br />Secondly, the actors and actresses. Where did they find them? At Sith Agency Supplies? I am not angry that we were stuck with such bad casting. JJ Abrams taking Ridley whatshername off the market does all of us a favor. I am angry that I spent my time and anticipation thinking I will watch Star Wars when I watched Manhater Wars."
4100,2,Casting Couch?,Out of respect for Star Wars?
4101,2,Did Any Members Of The Cast And Crew Walk Out Of The Set,"I've had this in my tevo drive for nearly a year now and everytime I go to pick up where left off. I can only do five or ten mins before it bores the bum off me!! I don't understand the timeline and where this movie fits in relation to the others. And yes JJ ABRAMS is a total sell out, for one, he's a Jewish guy working for an anti Semitic company!!! Come on mate have some pride you greedy little man. Why can't this dross at least be 90 mins rather that five hrs long, it would make it faster and less of an ORDEAL. I did like the movies with Liam neeson and Hayden Christiansen. I just can't get on with this one. Forgive me sci fi fans."
4102,1,What's going on some one tell me please !!!!!,"I'm going extra hard on this Movie. Just after watching it I'm extra confused, I wish I could go through scenes and see if it's as bad as I feel."
4103,1,This was not worth ruining the ending for Return of The Jedi.,"I don't regret watching it, but I don't think I'll watch it again."
4104,4,A New Hope remake with a heavy Disney taste,JJ Abrams is actually Jah Jah Abrams.
4105,1,Big Pile of Bantha Fodder!,***SPOILER ALERT!!!***
4106,1,Star Wars in name only.,Leave it to Jar Jar Abrams to screw up yet another great franchise!
4107,2,Major Disappointment with Great Special Effects,"Disappointing really. First trilogy remake efforts, in an awful way..."
4108,1,First trilogy remade...,"How in the world is this movie getting such positive reviews? I really have no idea what people are talking about when they lavish so much praise on such a mediocre film. Since anyone reading this probably already knows what other people loved about the movie, I'm going to skip all of that and get right down to the nuts and bolts of why this is actually a bad film."
4109,1,Did we all watch the same movie?!,******MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS BELOW*******
4110,3,Disappointing rehash (spoiler review),"Complete waste of my money! 4.00 on promotion... Remake of the 1st movie! Seriously what was the director thinking???!!! What a pile of bad acting and poor, poor, poor story!! No wonder they didn't want people to talk about the story it was a disappointment for my whole household! Its safe to say No George Lucas No Star Wars... And saying this I stop being a fan from this money machine until Lucas comes back. Dark Vader was more a Dark joke. The storm trooper looked like he was carrying bricks on his feet; the jet pilot sucked at everything... the ship crashes and miraculously he shows up??? Ria was the only proper acting even so she had more to give... What a pile of rubbish!"
4111,5,Remake of the 1st movie!,"The film had all the right ingredients and could have been so much better. The lead female character was great. To see most of the old characters, droids and vehicles was also great. I had a brief tear when I saw the Millennium Falcon. "
4112,5,Absolutely gutted by the story,"Wow, I've never ever written a review of a movie in my life and feel compelled to write one at 2:14 am right after watching this sad excuse of a star wars film."
4113,1,the dark side is strong with this film...being Abrahm's creativity,"After all the hype, when I finally got to see it I was very disappointed. I felt the plot was just the same as from the earlier films with minor changes. The storm troopers still cannot shoot well, characters run around doing stupid things, until it's time to finish the film when lo and behold there are masters of the force."
4114,4,Nothing new to see here,"Saw it earlier in London, England."
4115,4,ONLY just above Phantom Menace. Big letdown overall.,What a dung heap.
4116,1,JJ Abrams Does To Star Wars What He Did To Star Trek: Destroy!,"With all the hype and paid pr(reviews) around most star wars fans thought there might be something in it.... at cnet they were saying as good as return of the jedi... lol we all know cnet is a pay for your ad kind of place... this wasn't horrible, as a movie by it self it entertaining enough but as star wars it was rubbish. the story was so poor, i mean couldn't they come up with something more than another death star?? ohh its way bigger this time...POOR the girl,poor girl had less lines in the movie than a side character in most movies. and trying to copy original star wars where ben got killed they waste one of the best characters there??? Just say this , if you haven't gone to the cinema to watch it, than don't, watch it online and save your self the time and money..... as for Luke... he had one line there lo, to what point??? JJ abrams started the destruction of star wars, Disney being Disney has no clue how to make a proper star wars movie, but Disney land movies, we can once for all say goodbye to the legend of star wars."
4117,1,Another franchise wrecked by Jj.abrams,"Or maybe I'm just not the wide-eyed teenager I was when saw Star Wars (I refuse to call it ""A New Hope"") in 1977. "
4118,4,"Upon Further reflection, an updated review","Overall this film was a disappointment, but I have to disagree with most of the one or two star reviews and people claiming that it's the ""worst"" film in the franchise."
4119,5,"Honest Review, Some Spoilers","This is, far and away, the weakest installment in the series and falls short even of TPM. That there are so many reviews on here where people have written about the negative aspects of the film then gone on to offer between eight and ten stars is baffling, as are the people who hail the movie's success as a reboot. This movie was sold as a follow on, not a remake! The script appears to have been written using a sheet of tracing paper and a copy of the script for A New Hope."
4120,3,Wait for the DVD. . . . . .,"Star Wars used to be good but now it is predictable, lazy writing and introduce all these new boring characters with no development. Han has the most screen time out of the 3 but then he gets killed off, Luke is in the movie for like 2 seconds and Leia doesn't come till like halfway through the movie and she is barely and Rey is just boring to watch and Kylo is just annoying and a repeat of Darth Vader but fails to actually be interesting. Shame on you Star Wars."
4121,1,What the hell happened,For me this movie was incredibly painful. There were constant flaws within the character's stories and within the overall plot itself. Everything felt forced and rushed along as JJ Abrams tired his best to smash in all the Easter eggs he could that would give old timers a sense of nostalgia and make them forget what a bad movie they're watching.
4122,1,Worst Star Wars movie so far,Move along...
4123,5,This isn't the movie you're looking for,".....A LITTLE SPOILERS REVIEW MAY CONTAINS, AVOID IT YOU MUST......"
4124,2,Star What: Disappointment Awakes,"Felt rushed, little plot, too many things crammed in. The villains felt extremely weak and underdeveloped/not inspired. "
4125,1,Little substance,As a long time fan of the original trilogy I was excited at the prospect of JJ Abrams bringing the Star Wars saga back to its roots of placing story before action. Unfortunately the new installment of the beloved series does nothing but disappoint.
4126,2,An Embarrassment to the Star Wars Series,I have to note first that my rating 4/10 means the movie is great and can be watched several times before getting bored.
4127,4,The Force Awakend,"Han Solo always had problems running his ship which was a good laugh in the old Star Wars but she comes along and tells him what to do and fixes it even tho she never been in a ship in her whole life! She totally emasculated the only alpha male characters and one of the most popular star wars characters of all time. In the east, you never tell an older person or someone highly respect, what to do, it's the most disrespectful thing you can EVER do! Taking on a Kylo Ren who has trained his whole life in both light/dark force, she doesn't even get a scratch and destroys him in a 1 on 1 life-saber battle. Luke got owned in his first fight against Dark Vader and loses his arm while Anakin and Obi Wan couldn't beat Count Dooku even when Yoda turned up. This movie screams Feminists bullshit!! "
4128,1,Feminist garbage!!,"I just watched The Force Awakens! (Not to spoil anything), generally I loved the film very much, but what I sensed at the end was that I do miss George Lucas's story telling! I think JJ tried to stay far too faithful to Episode IV. I was a bit surprised about this at the end."
4129,4,Unexpected Disappointment!,"How can this film have 8 stars on IMDB is beyond my understanding... Really sad. I had a Star Wars weekend and watched all six first films. Some I rated six and some nine. Especially I liked the Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). It connected the old trilogy with the new one perfectly, no plot holes!!! It was packed with action, emotion, meaning.. everything! This... I felt betrayed. The beginning wipes out any meaningful connection to the saga immediately. Just another action film with some super powers. We have a new one every day now.. SAD... And I thought I'm gonna enjoy it! I watched it till the end, hoping. When it was too boring I let it run on the background while writing some posts.. It didn't get better. 2/10 stars"
4130,2,Why?,"Edit - there's actually a good article, ""JJ Abrams is bad at making movies"". worth a read."
4131,5,"lots of ""moments"", mainly for the sake of having moments.","Perhaps countering the majority of the audience, I had very low expectations regarding this movie. I liked the two previous trilogies, but I was afraid that a re-launch would have as its main objective to raise a few million dollars from the studios. I did not feel cheated, the movie is good and worth it, but I must admit that anything is lacking to match the older ones."
4132,4,The weakest of all.,"Media tycoons seem too desperate to make money these days, and are using tools which lack the right kind of inspiration. People who make a lot more than they ""work"" for always become a shell of themselves. Harrison Ford lacks the desire to be in this movie as does Carrie Fisher. I can sense these things as the Schwarz is strong in my family. My father has it, I have it, and... my sis ter has it. The main characters just realize that this is all a silly attempt for Disney to suck money out of people's pockets using a title with a reputation that goes back to when movies first started breaking the boundaries of normal human reality. However, many stories have come out beautifully on the screen since then, and today, actors who get paid the dough of a thousand carpenters to appear before a screen just don't feel good about this role at all."
4133,5,"No spoiler, just some criticism","*** May contain spoilers for who has not seen the movie or not been interested in Star Wars extended universe, books, games, etc. ***"
4134,4,"The ""Farce"" awakens...","The movie is not Star Wars. It doesn't feel like Star Wars. It's a space movie with Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher as secondary characters. This franchise was about mythological characters and epic situations, now it has become a Hollywood super-production."
4135,3,It is a good blockbuster. But I don't like it at all.,"(sorry for my English) SPOILERS!!! I waited this movie way more than my last 5 Christmas combined, waited it more then any movie ever....wanted it to be the perfect Star Wars, the MASTERPIECE......just to be destroyed in my seat at the end."
4136,5,I enjoyed Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith more than this.,"This is not Star Wars, only a weak remake based on the previous episodes. No ""Star Wars"" feeling, only a weak movie for fans with a big brainwashing introduction, but there is nothing behind. I was interested in this movie, and I waited for the ""feeling"", but I got a superficial, sometimes ridiculous ""something"" instead of a great sci-fi movie. This is how the media can sell a crap to people with fake things. Very disappointing and it shows clearly how our world operates nowadays: no real values, only money in everything. Congratulations for destroying of Star Wars! The creators of this ""movies"" are the real death star!"
4137,1,weakest remake ever,-Some positives Visual effects were fine. No crop lines. deserves thanks for the effort
4138,5,Disappointment,I don' t want to write any spoiler cos i want people not to make my mistake and pay to see this movie. It's not worth one penny! Just below some points to sum up how they screw up with one of the most awaited movie of this year and not only...
4139,4,Why would you do that?? Ahh... yes for money!!,"Oh come on, please...how can anybody rate this one more than five stars? So much has been said about the flaws and plot holes of this movie. I don't want to repeat it all. But I have to figure out some of my opinions because I just can't bare these 10 stars ratings made especially by professional ""critics"" (are these blind and deaf?) anymore."
4140,3,"""I'm already on my way out."" Out of the cinema....","There is nothing more I can say that hasn't been said. The actors sucked, the plot sucked, the movie was boring as hell, and it didn't feel like star war, more like a fan film. I don't know what they were thinking, I really don't. I waited the entire movie for something interesting to happen, something that felt like star wars, unfortunately that moment never came. The prequels may have been bad for die-hard original trilogy fans, but at least Lucas came up with something original for those. In this one we have the whole nostalgia cash grab, x- wings, death star, scary bad guy in mask, check check check. I cant believe those actors were cast into their roles, the acting was simply terrible, not only the bad guy (when he took his mask off everyone in the cinema laughed out loud, in fact, we all laughed when he took of his mask a second time, it was almost as if the movie was a parody of star wars). I cant begin to go into details about how the movie made no sense, I cant be bothered to waste my breath. Just please, let this be a bad dream."
4141,1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I had high hopes for this, but I was severely disappointed. They took all the hallmark features of the Star Wars franchise and tried to cram it all into this movie. In doing so, JJ Abrams completely missed the mark on what made the series good. If you like corny action movies like Avengers, you'll love this. If you were expecting Star Wars, you're going to be disappointed. And the plot twists.... Ghastly. Wow! If there is one sure fire way to cheapen a movie it is with stupid plot twists, by explaining away a major part of the movie with a single line of dialogue, or having critical parts of the movie hinge on the flimsiest explanations or actions. A joke here or there is acceptable, the amount of bad jokes they crammed into this was stupid. They all fell flat and were on the level of a Disney children's show. They just didn't need to be there."
4142,2,"Episode IV rehashed with bad jokes, and horrific plot twists","Well JJ has yet again made of mockery of a great franchise. It's like they've spliced pieces of the OT and chucked it in a food processor. Kylo Ren is the most pathetic Sith Lord ever (and you thought dooku was bad) he comes across as a petulant child with a big stick and kills his dad (Harrison ford finally getting his wish to kill off Han since he first played him) the main cast were good (besides Mark Hamill's 2 min non speaking role right at the end in which he looked like the beegees) biggest beef was with the secondary cast, they all looked mid 30s and hardly stood up to the older more experienced looking commanders admirals etc in the OT. Most the action sequences were good because we all knew that's what jar jar Abrams was gonna do, some of the CGI characters looked woeful especially gollum the supreme leader (Andy Serkis) or Snoke the stupidest name since Sheev Palpatine. My other gripe was the pathetically obvious use of Nazi-ish visuals that are so over the top they might as well gave them all Hitler moustaches. So if you thought jar jar Abrams would be the saviour of Star Wars and return it to its former glory you're sorely mistaken. I never thought anyone could out ""Michael bay"" Michael bay then JJ is surely a contender."
4143,1,"Sigh, I've seen this movie before, 38 years ago.","Unimpressive and inexplicable characters, weird action turns, and little respect for the original Star Wars universe. Great visuals is not what makes a Star Wars movie. You might put a Van Damme into a Shrek story - he'll surely be fun, but he'll be pointless. And that is the problem here. Obviously the people who made this sory piece did not love or did not understand Star Wars."
4144,1,Disappointment in every respect,Almost a direct plagiarism of New Hope. 
4145,1,"Rip off of original New Hope, but nowhere near as good. Mostly a cash grab","Another Disney movie infested with mistimed jokes (had an Avengers 2feel to it)... Though, I'll admit, I did laugh. It was an enjoyable film if you just look at the comedic value and the nostalgia it offers. Let's get to the gist here now, the movie lacked consistency, seriousness, intensity, emotion, and originality. Pilot's friend dies and he busts out a joke after getting captured. Death of the best character in this episode was brushed off like it was nothing. Plot was essentially the 3 original films clumped into 1. Music was 0/10 compared to the other 6 films. Main characters were able to defeat the villain with 0 light saber and force training. ""That is not how the Force works!"" Well, Disney made it seem like that wasn't the case. Finally, we get the same prequel villain we've bashed for years, yet somehow and some way people LOVE this guy! Temper tantrums, no intimidation, and he looks like a mix of Nicolas Cage and Severus Snape. Honestly, the positive reviews are simply because the movie kisses the asses of blinded Star Wars fans."
4146,1,Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,"It doesn't feel like Star Wars,very little effects,poor acting,too much talking,it has 2,3 3D effects.I wanted to leave after about 20 minutes.Don't watch it,it doesn't deserve to be named Stars Wars.I was afraid that this might happen,because they could make a movie in two different ways.One(invest hundreds of millions dollars and make an EPIC movie),or spend as little as possible,and make BIG money on just the name and legacy of Star Wars franchise.In my opinion,they should have made the movie EPIC,and not just to make money from people who love Star Wars.I am ANGRY and DISAPPOINTED that i waisted my time and money to see this movie.This is the WORSTE movie that i have EVER SEEN.DON'T WATCH IT,IT DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE WATCHED.IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE FRANCHISE."
4147,1,Movie is a BIG BIG disappointment,"Let me begin by saying that I was introduced to Star Wars as a child by my parents and fell in love with the universe that Lucas created. As a fan, I had very mixed feelings regarding the sale to Disney but when I heard JJ Abrams was going to be directing I had a small amount of hope for a similar feat of brilliance due to his work on the new Star Trek films."
4148,4,"""Star Wars 80's Band Forty Year Reunion"" - The Movie","I am a huge star wars fan I love it, and I was really looking forward to this movie. It is a boring film and boring actors, there are far too many boring parts and a lot of the ideas for the film are copied from star wars a new hope so the film is very predictable and gets so tedious to watch."
4149,2,The Force Awakens - This is a Remake of Star wars A new Hope,"I am a huge fan of the original star wars movie and yes, even the prequels. I grew up with Star Wars, lego star wars, Spaceballs, Battlefront 2 you name it. I remember having anxiety when they mentioned making a 7th movie. I had a feeling they were going to blow it but I went into the movie with no expectations and still, I walked away severely disappointed. Many other people have pointed out the obvious flaws in this movie but for me the biggest one is that, it didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. Sure we had lightsabers, blasters, x-wings but I felt like I was watching a foreign movie. It was clear the entire movie was forced (forced haha) and that JJ Abrams did not have Star Wars fans intentions upon making this movie.If you are a die hard Star Wars fan this movie was a slap in the face. Not only because of the over-hyped garbage they tried to sell it as but the way they treated the force and old characters. I can go on and on but I regret seeing this movie, I will never think of it as a Star Wars movie. I promise I will not be seeing whatever trash they pump out in the coming years."
4150,1,Coming from a die hard Star Wars fan I wish I could give it a negative number,"Really terrible! I could not get myself to believe the story at all. All the previous series were philosophically simple yet deep. This one was just simple without the depth. Simple to a degree of being retarded and so awfully predictable. Felt bad afterward for wasting more than 2 hours of my life. The characters are OK, the props are actually good. Whoever wrote the script has a total lack of imagination. In this supper vast galactic universe there were endless possibilities to make this movie interesting. There is absolutely nothing new to the story. Its all just a repetition with new special effects. However, I must acknowledge the marketing plan behind this release. Incredible marketing achievement!"
4151,1,Script is retarded,For me this movie is just average.
4152,5,IMDb rating is a joke,"Let's be clear SW VII is a good movie from one point of view : The directing is pretty good, the actors except the ridiculous Kylo Ren are fresh and the air combats are just amazing specially in IMAX 3D. But there is a huge BUT : the scenario !! how is it possible 30 years after to just copy/paste the scenario of the epIV ?? And it's not some similarities...the Jedi (who doesn't know his powers) on a sand planet, the droid with a critical mission, the death star (again...), the X-wing destroying the core of the death star...and so on! I can understand Disney and JJ don't want to take any risks with this episode, so they don't want to innovate at all. Consequently if you are not a SW fan of the 1st trilogy you will surely love the movie, cause you won't see it's just a remake. My only hope for the epVIII is to see an original scenario and not another remake (oh my god Rey is just Luke's daughter...) Sorry for my English :-)"
4153,5,Big deception it's just another remake...,"Did you already read the other one and two star reviews? Well. It's true, all of it. After the later Marvel movies, the Hobbit and even the Bourne Legacy I feared that the present Hollywood view on movie making would affect this new Star Wars movie too. The fear proved right. So what is this contemporary Hollywood view on movie making? Basically I would say that it targets an adolescent audience that get thrilled by spectacular visuals and explosions and that loves unbelievable superheroes. These two focuses make story lines, believable characters and human interaction of less importance. This we find back in The Force Awakens. There are plenty of explosions with a giant one in the end and there are superheroes that are unbelievably heroic. Teenagers will love it. Those having reached mental maturity however will surely miss character in the personages, human interaction and most of all a sensible story line. All this is missing in The Force Awakens. The first series was incredibly strong in the interaction of true characters and had a thrilling story line. In the second series the characters and interaction was less well developed but still had a thrilling story line. The Force Awakens has nothing of this. It is just pure flat violence with laser guns and flat charactered heroes. I dislike this Hollywood move towards making such movies so much I almost get desperate. But it's what the teens want and what Hollywood delivers them. Flat charactered superheroes that go violently 'bang bang boom boom' for an hour or two. I presuppose it will be a sort of video-game - movie crossover trend. First we got video-games that looked like movies and now we have movies that look like video-games. I don't know where this trend will take us, but I fear not where matured minds want to be. Details of this movie have been explicated enough. I just wanted to express my own disappointment about this movie. I lost my affinity with Star Wars. This is so sad. Ford, Fisher and Hamilton could have been legendary until long after they'll be gone. The lost much of this with their cooperation with this terrible video-game-movie."
4154,1,"It's true, all of it...",This movie was painstakingly average. There are many reviewers on this board who compare this movie with the prequel trilogy and base their review on that. However the success or failure of other films should have no merit in this movie. The use of practical effects also has no merit. 
4155,1,"A New Hope, But Not","Good afternoon. Last night I watched a movie that is waiting for the most recent 10 years. And it's very sad and disappointing. Please forgive my ignorance of the English language perfectly. Google translator to help me is to express my thoughts. Disney destroyed everything that I expected. Flipped upside down all the canons. They will make a fairy tale. Again, the star's death only more. Adam is a horror. Lord Bane turned over in his grave, and curse all the Sith galaxy for what is allowed. A bunch of goofs. As the 10 fighters destroyed an entire planet? As adept Sith lost the first woman accepting light saber? What kind of computer Snoke villain? Where is the power of the dark side of the force?  What Luke did all these 30 years? Where recovered order Jedi? Troopers from birth taught to kill, but one of the millions decided against it and killing a bunch of mates escape..what the is going on?!?!? !!? You've had a lot of time. You have enormous resources.  You had 200+ books on the world of Star Wars. You did not understand that in a nice wrapper and recognizable. You can still write a lot of negativity. But that's not the point. The main thing that turned out to be 10 years of waiting in vain. And it's very sad and disappointing. I apologize again for my English."
4156,1,Lukas help,"I am sick of all of those uncritical reviews...this movie is good as avengers/guardians and any other late cheesy products. It is just popcorn flick with stupid script made in one afternoon, sophisticated as last remake of teenage mutant ninja turtles..."
4157,1,Spit to all sw fans for whom sw didn't stopped in 1983,The special effects were very good but plot was lacking. The Force Awakens seemed like a rehash of SW: A New Hope - without the substance. Even some of the same dialogue was used. The characters lacked depth. It was almost like they were filler in between the battle scenes.
4158,4,Bang flash rehash = disappointment,This movie felt like nothing more than something Disney made so they could take advantage of merchandising and licensing.
4159,3,I didn't think they could do worse than Phantom Menace...,"What were they thinking. I can't believe that I fell for all the hype and actually went to the theater to see this... alright I think that I wrote enough, I have a theory that people (or technically sheep) only look at the amount of stars, the summary which is in bold print and possibly the first line. then what they do is click 'helpful' yes or no without even taking the time to read the review and decide for themselves if it was helpful or not. why yes I will jump over this fence, all the other sheep have, it must be the thing to do. lemmings. First of all I really liked the movie, I give it an eight or nine out of ten, it was fun, exciting, suspenseful, dramatic, funny, nostalgic and above all star wars. I was on the edge of my seat in the theater back in December and a month ago when I bought the DVD/blue-ray/bonus I was on the edge of my couch. all the bonus footage is important, back in December I would have given it a five or six out of ten but only because I was expecting more, I was expecting a better, updated opening title and not one that looked like it was made back in the seventies, I was expecting a plot that I haven't already seen twice in the franchise, I was anticipating how much more I liked Chris pine over William shatner (which is really just a reference of how much more faith I had in Abrams over Lucas) and I was expecting to Not see, again,(the reason I checked the spoiler box) an evil masked villain kill it's father figure with a red light saber while others watched helplessly and screamed. yes I was disappointed in the theater but after watching all of the bonus features and then seeing it again at home I found myself liking it more each time that I watched it. Han Solo is better funnier wiser and more complex, Chewie is better and more human somehow, the Heroine is So much more charismatic in this than Luke was in four through six, the bad guy at first wasn't as scary as Darth Vader I realized at home that he is unpredictable and full of rage and that kind of person is more scary than someone who is just pure bad. So many great points; the lone storm trooper, bb8, Simon pegg, Daniel Craig, admiral ackbar, millennium falcon, Maz and even though I've already kind of mentioned her Daisy Ridley she did an awesome job, she lights up the screen and is a Hepburn kind of joy to watch."
4160,1,Terrible,I waited 32 years for this???!! I am thoroughly disgusted by this latest Star Wars film. Adding Jar Jar Binks to the line-up could only improve it – and that idiot was the worst thing that ever happened to the franchise! 
4161,2,Bring Back Jar Jar to Improve Star Wars,"Many months ago now, I decided that I would watch this film as soon as it became available, which meant going to the midnight showing of the film on the day of its release (17th December 2015). I was excited, optimistic, even beatific that not only was my beloved Star Wars returning for its seventh installment, but it was also doing so in the hands of a relatively competent director who seemed to understand just what made the prequels so unspeakably nauseating. From this I could enjoy reassurance that this franchise would be continuing in the same vein as the witty, exciting and genuinely clever original trilogy."
4162,5,An unambitious failure,"Same story and plot as movie 1, a mysterie will be killed after 1 second as it will be explained that fast. You know who everybody is before they are introduced. No exciting build up to a peek. I guess they want to move to the next episode as fast as possible. O and killing the only person who makes the film a bit OK is not very smart. This movie has no story lines at all. The new dark force can not even kill a Jedi who doesn't even know she is a jedi. The girl is OK but really needs a better story line. Movi maker just jumps from scene to scene there is no time for us to get in the feeling of the characters or the planets where they are. Dead characters are replaced by other but have the same role. Major disappointment!"
4163,1,Darth Vader will turn around in his grave knowing they made a rerun.,"This movie isn't so much a new movie as it is a remake of the first movie(fourth chronologically). But instead of using good actors they went with the ugliest people they could find that can't act. There is not one original idea within the film. This truly is a movie made for fans. Give the people who loved the first movie the exact same crap, and give the new kids better graphics so they'll like it. People who like this film can't get over their fandom and see it for what it truly is. Stop telling people this movie is good and tricking them into making this movie any more money than it already has. If my friend had not paid for my ticket I would have walked out, it was gut wrenchingly bad.I would have preferred having the stomach flu and vomiting non stop for 2 1/2 hours instead of seeing Star Wars."
4164,1,The worst remake to date.,"Watched the movie yesterday and i'm still in disbelieve to what i saw. The movie we all waited for, the movie they raised the prices for, the movie with the biggest merchandise ever... ...and it's just a remake. And on top of it it was for 12 year old one's."
4165,4,It's just a remake with great visuals.,"What a joke! J.J Abrams said in many interviews that he was going to focus on the story of StarWars by making it great. Yeah, sure J.J whatever. Instead the powers that be gave us a recycled and updated version of A New Hope! Another death star that was easily destroyable? Are they serious? Another Skywalker family member that is conflicted with the dark/light side of things? A father/son relationship? same locations as episode 4 & 5! What the heck are we watching here? "
4166,3,Star Wars Episode VII: A New Hope!,"So disappointed in the main bad character, a movie is as good as the bad character is, and Kylo was a joke. The only noticeable thing he did is killing solo (always as good). But then getting his ass kicked by Rey, who never had fought with a lighsaber and just discover she had the force few hours before , come-on!!!! Not to mention kylo even get hurt by Finn, who not only never fought with a lighsaber but also didn't have the ""force"" with him. They would not stand 2 seconds against Darth Maul (that was a great bad character as it was Darth Vader of course). Overall lack of originality with no great battles or fights. This was nothing more than a merchandise cash grab."
4167,4,Lack of originality .,"supposing I was 12 again seeing this movie for the first time maybe.. Even my children's (9and 13) felt bad about this movie. Not a sole original line in it. One of the worst remakes I ever saw. I was enchanted as I lived my life to reconnect time to time to this Odissey as new episodes appear. Each time the charm functioned for me, but not this time. Every scene it's copy/ paste from the old movies with no fun. Characters are not credible, there's no actor in this movie( apart Ford) no script either. NO STORY! Here in Romania we are big fans of Star Wars ( each of the movies have been seen at least 10-12 times), but we will ignore as not belonging this new episode."
4168,3,Really bitter for fan's,"It's not a bad movie, they did ""just enough"" to pack it, slap a label on it and sell it."
4169,4,Just another Hollywood blockbuster without a soul.,This movie is complete trash.
4170,4,It's a worse New hope,I watched the original trilogy on digitally remastered DVD's in preparation for seeing this film. I still have great memories of the original that I saw in the cinema back in 1977 as an 11 year old.
4171,4,Wasted Opportunity,"Well, where to begin. I must admit I didn't get on board the hype train about this film as the recent spat of remakes in 2015 have been let down after let down. I also wanted to go see this movie without getting too hyped up and reduce the excitement factor. This has been hard considering the massive marketing campaign stuffed down our mouths at every turn. "
4172,3,A massive opportunity missed,"Like many others, this is the first time I've felt compelled to leave a review here, but it is becoming all too common for garbage films to coast on artificially inflated percentile numbers - the only metric many people look at."
4173,1,"As a Film, Not Great by Any Measure",Rating this awful is being kind to this film. 
4174,1,I gave it 1 star and even want that 1 star back,"Sadly, when I saw all the positive reviews and people taking interviews with positive thoughts after seeing the movie I told to myself the world went crazy and maybe I'm among few people who still doesn't get the whole thing. I began saying sadly...yes, because that were my thoughts after seeing this mess named The Force Awakens. It's nowhere close to the first saga and even to the second saga (first 3 episodes). It's so childish, characters are full of emptiness, no feelings to the viewers, undeveloped and full of predictibility. Plus, the story is lacking big time, everything is rushed up and things are settling with lighspeed which is wrong, so wrong. Think about at least a few instances: a high commander agrees to lower the shields of an entire planet base without even questioning the motives and with a questionable ease, then the Dark Vader replacement is a fierceful young man that,with his helmet off, doesn't even inspire fear and this character is more than underdeveloped, we don't see enough of his motives and overall, his motivation for his behaviour. Plus, a young jedi wannabe, not even apprentice yet, manages to defeat with easy a well trained (I have my doubts as well on this) sith master which is way beyond Star Wars old times quality scripts in my humble opinion (think about Luke trained a lot in the swamps by Master Yoda before facing his father). Well, this reboot is not worth in my opinion, is a childish tell,it would have been more appropriate for a SW series but definatelly NOT for a SW big screen reboot. Shame on you G Lucas and Disney studios and JJ Abrams for delivering such a crap to the audience. I guess, high earnings are obvious because people wanted to see a ""reboot"" but, in this case, in my opinion, is just a follow-up to the new wave of young people with serious challenges in life, a maturity failed test."
4175,5,Divergent Insurgent Hunger Games Youth Underdeveloped line up,"There were parts of the movie I enjoyed, including some crazy x-wing action and C3PO's entrance, overall the movie was bad. Too much didn't make sense, the dialogue and even the plot itself were incredibly predictable, this is mostly because this movie was just a summary of the first series, with the original characters being too old to make up for the lame new ones, except the x-wing pilot dude. The biggest problem with the movie I will put in all caps so that it stands out to anyone with high hopes for the movie to lower their standards so that they are not a disappointed as I was. "
4176,3,"the more I think about it, the more I hate it.",This movie started off good but then took a turn to the other side and not the good side! Great actors but the story felt like a remake. The bad guy had daddy issues and wears a mask for no reason and when he take it off his hair was never messed up. And a girl who dose the Jedi mind trick without no training also she starts using the life saver like if she had years of training with it. A minimal amount of star-ships goes against thousands of fighter ships and they manage to destroy the new death star. Like I said it felt like a remake. I wished I had not spent so much money in tickets for my family and just waited for a boot leg one at a flea market.
4177,3,The force was not with this movie,I am a huge Star Wars fan. I have loved the Old Movies and the prequels (which I think WERE well made) but to me this movie fails everything and everyone who loves Star Wars. 
4178,3,Disney Please......,Just think about it.
4179,3,best of ST,"This movie has absolutely nothing new in it, everything was either taken from an episode 4 or from episode 6. I don't want to dwell into details because everything about that shameless copy has already been said in the previous comments. From droid with critical information, through a death star destroying planets and a small team of heroes bringing the shield from inside, paired with a lot of details and entire sentences taken from original trilogy, it feels like a bad teen star wars parody. I really can't believe Abrams was really given money for...this. Moment I've seen the plot summary I kind of knew something is wrong. How is victorious Republic reduced to resistance"" and how is Empire remnant again dominant force in the galaxy? Why they were allowed to build a gigantic planet size death star, what was Republic doing all this time? Nothing makes any sense at all. Characters......lead character is of course an empowered girl/woman"" so that necessity pretty much breaks the movie because everything has to bend in order to accommodate for her independence and power creating some laughable situations. I guess political correctness is more important than making your plot having sense. As for the lead villain (and I'm not talking about a bad cgi character with a carton name), he is just a teenager with dad problems and rage control issues making him smash his computers. Like most other characters, he failed to evoke any emotions. I was surprised by a lack of feedback from the audience in cinema, it was just a silence for the entire movie. Even the moments that were supposed to be heavy with emotions were met by silence. This movie just makes you feel nothing at all. I guess at this point, whatever you make under a Star Wars brand, it will be a success, right? Horrible. I am genuinely sorry I actually paid money to see this."
4180,1,Was JJ really paid for this? My money back please.,"They say copying is the highest form of flattery, but as a fan seeing this movie, all I felt was frustration. If A New Hope were a video game, The Force Awakens would be a new skin update for that video game. The story is beat for beat the exact same, even contriving a new empire out of nowhere. Even more frustrating than no explanation for this ""First Order"" is how it limits where this new trilogy can go. Instead of a new villain or new ideas we get a complete remake. Discount Palpatine, discount Vader even discount Tarkin. Did I mention another death star? Say what you will about the prequels, but at least they tried new things. I only give this 3 stars, because the acting, dialogue and special effects are all great. Oh and old Han Solo."
4181,3,Copy and paste,Going back to the roots doesn't mean remake it 
4182,1,"Nope false alarm , it's still sleep","I went into the cinema excited to watch a Star Wars SEQUEL, came out of the cinema angry wanting a refund."
4183,2,Useless remake of original trilogy - The Force won't be with you,"Trust me when I say, I WISH I could like this movie as much as it was hyped up for me to - I really, really don't."
4184,3,"Wish I could like it, I really do",... as JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy have integrity and class.
4185,2,This film has as much creativity...,Well they managed to make a character worse than jar jar binks. Kylo ren is to Star Wars what nickleback is to music. Absolute rubbish. Such a shame the final trilogy is ruined by a spoilt child Whose only place in the film is to get angry and upset because he doesn't get his own way. Kylo ren aka the worst thing to ever come from the Star Wars universe
4186,1,New age garbage,"I love Star Wars, especially Han Solo, and like many I walked into the theater full of hope and excitement."
4187,5,I want Darth Vadar back...,"I am a huge Star Wars fan. I've read the books, played the video games, so I am familiar with the Star Wars universe. Honestly, I had to pull a Force Mind Trick on myself to actually make myself like this movie. Admittedly, the actors are good, hence the five stars. However, The Force Awakens lacks originality, just like it lacks depth and content. With the resources these filmmakers had, I could have made a movie that's one thousand times better. At the end of the movie I found myself frowning and wondering what happened. Where are those beautiful details and moments that make a movie great? Where is the sophistication and the magic that made Star Wars legendary?"
4188,5,This movie wasn't great.,"I make it three fourths of the way through this film and cast away all doubts I had about it then they do something I'll never forgive,they kill Han Solo,best gunslinger and pilot in the galaxy. Han Solo has been my favorite character since I first watched the original Star Wars trilogy as a kid,I even had a toy of his blaster. I was hoping this would have been a better movie than the prequels,I'll admit I went in thinking it would be just as bad as the prequels,but I found myself changing my mind while watching it,that is until they took a wrong turn and Ren kill Han Solo. I never thought that would ever happen seeing as how Han Solo was just as much of a main character as Luke or Leia,but I should have known better I should have known that Disney would find some way to ruin Star Wars. They killed Star Wars for me,I will not buy tickets for the next Star Wars movies and I won't buy anymore Star Wars merchandise."
4189,1,They Killed Star Wars for ME,"Wow, I am in utter disbelief. I read multiple good reviews about this being 'back' and was actually optimistic about seeing this.. And we didn't even get an actual movie? What did I even just watch? I really don't even know, a bunch of blasters, a couple of random guys off the street with a lightsaber, a cgi demon leader, a bunch of explosions, and a bunch of flying."
4190,1,Harry potter meets twighlight meets a star wars parody. Was there a plot??..,If the prequels were bad (With Revenge of the Sith closing upon average) then this movie is slight above average for a big holiday blockbuster.
4191,5,"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back","1.Who is Rey ? Why ? 2.What is the First Order ? Why ? 3.Who is Supreme Leader Snoke ? Why ? What kind of name is that ? 4.What kind of title is that ? Why does he look like Smeagol ? 5.Why is Kylo Ren acting like a spoiled brat going through puberty ? 6.Why did they casually kill Han Solo and then never mentioned it again ? 7.Who taught Rey to fight with lightsabers and to use the force ? How can she just do stuff all of a sudden, when Luke Skywalker needed training, the same as Anakin/Darth Vader, or her enemy in this movie - Kylo Ren ? 8.When was the second Death Star built ? 9.If there is a New Republic, why doesn't it have an army ? 10.If the former Resistance is the New Republic's army, why is it called a Resistance instead of calling it Republic Army ? 11.Who taught Finn to fight with a lightsaber ? Since when can non- jedi and non-sith fight with lightsabers ? 12.If Kylo Ren can stop blaster fire, how come he is not using his power to stop... Finn or Rey, when they fight him ? 13.What is the point of bringing back the old cast just to kill one of them and to have the others doing nothing ? 14.Why did you rip off Star Wars Episode IV and stole the idea of the functioning principle for the new Death Star from Star Trek ? 15.Why is everything so rushed and soulless in this movie ? 16.Why does it have nothing to do with the former 6 Star Wars ? Episodes 1-3 were bad, but they WERE Star Wars, while this one isn't, except in name only. Why do I have this idea that you made the movie for people who don't think, but just want to join the HYPE of Star Wars 'cause it seems like something cool to do ?... like... yeah, the old generation had 6 Star Wars... now it's our turn to have one, yeah... My younger friends said it sucked, 'cause it's illogical, so I don't really think you'll fool the next generation with it. I am sorry for the main actors, they're good, but you didn't give them anything to work with. The death stare Luke has at the end of the movie is probably towards what you've done with this movie."
4192,2,Lots of things wrong with it,"'Contains spoiler' I grew up with star wars. I dreamed of Jedi and stormtroopers and every single one of my dreams,and there was a whole bunch of them, had a better story. I mean what the ****. The New Republic which was literally formed by the Rebel Alliance after the Galactic Civil War and the fall of The Emperor. So automatically The New Republic is in war with Empire's remnants right? So why the **** is there a Resistance, i mean i don't get it, and it's led by Leia who is ,i don't know how ,not a politician, which was obviously her job before she was taken by Vader in ANH but rather a general of this Resistance?!?! OK, now stop right there a black clone that was my first thought but then you get an explanation that because the Empire was unable to make clones any longer so they kept the remaining clones as the Elite and started taking babies like the Jedi did but they would teach them to obey orders and kill,brainwashing them. So how does this black stormtrooper finds disgust towards their actions and decides to betray he's former ideals and brothers killing them without hesitation. OK,now who the **** is that grandpa who has a piece of map?! Nvm him he dies anyways and takes his secret to the grave with him. Now the girl, she's obviously a Skywalker by blood and since we later find out that Han and Leia had only one child she musts be Luke's daughter. But let's focus on the part when she pilots the Falcon and turns out to be a better pilot then Anakin, Luke and Han together even though she was piloting a spaceship for the first time. OK now let us get back to a detail that rearly would anyone notice. Anakin and Luke's lightsaber. In episode 5 when Vader tells Luke that he is his father he cuts his hand and falls alongside with THE LIGHTSABER in to the abyss,and later he gets his green lightsaber. Now how does the blue one gets in to the hands of an alien who is by some miracle older then Yoda?!!?! And knows more of the force than him clearly because she learns Rey all Jedi powers by telling her to close her eyes. Now one more contradiction, in Star Wars a Jedi makes he's own sword and the sword doesn't i repeat DOES NOT choose him. So how can i lightsaber talk to Rey and get her hallucinations like she is high?! And then she knows the mind control trick which takes time to train and learn to use in a couple of seconds and blocks Kylo Ren out. She shoots a pistol for the first time and she is more accurate then stormtroopers. But the best thing was when she defeated Ren in lightsaber duel though he is a trained sith knight and she wields a lightsaber that shouldn't exist for the first time *gasp**gasp* lightsaber combat is an martial art in Star Wars universe learned over years of training and the force doesn't have s*** to do with it besides better reflexes and if it mattered how much the Force is strong in you General Grievous wouldn't kill all those Jedi. So Rey i must tell you even if you were Yoda and you aren't you wouldn't be able to defeat Ren. I could go on for much longer with what's bad in the movie but honestly i don't have nerves to do it anymore and i just hope that Disney will bankrupt before it releases more of this s***. All in one this was a very predictable movie with awful characters and kind of a reboot sequel to the original trilogy. If you hadn't watch any Star Wars before thus would be an average movie with good visual effects and many explosions."
4193,1,What the ****?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"First off, Oh! George Lucas, how did you sit through this movie and not realize it's a boat load of bullshit? How could you put your fans through so much disappointment? This is a tragic remake of the original Star Wars episodes (IV and V) with no thought whatsoever to any of these amazing aspects of the Star Wars prequels and sequels we have seen thus far:"
4194,1,Biggest disappointment for the most awaited movie of the year,"I am writing this review as an enormous fan of the Star Wars films ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith."" And not in a ""guilty pleasure"" kind of way. I genuinely find them to be some of the greatest and most underrated films of all time, and actually superior to both ""A New Hope"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" I understand that my opinion on both films is somewhat controversial. I do not ask you to share that opinion or even understand it, but I do ask you to respect it. If you are not mature enough to do so, please stop reading here. With that out of the way, ""Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" is about as unnecessary as sequels get. A direct continuation of the Skywalker Story despite Luke's character arc already being complete, ""Episode VII"" is about as about as necessary a sequel as ""Toy Story 4"" will be. (Yes, there is a ""Toy Story 4"" in production. I'm dead serious.) And, as predicted, it's also the worst Star Wars movie. But does that mean it's a ""bad"" movie? I don't think so. However, it's not exactly a ""good"" one either."
4195,5,"The Worst Star Wars Movie, But Not ""Bad""",I thought it will be better movie. It is predictable and shallow. I believe Rey will be Luke's daughter in next episode. Its starting to look like Spanish series. 
4196,5,Spanish Series,"I have rated this a 1, for 1 reason: Fans deserve better! I have read many comments, detailing in a far more literate way, and at far greater length the issues with this film. I waited at midnight to see and whilst it could have been worse, with the support and budget this movie had it should have been WAY better."
4197,1,"Speechless: Fears Confirmed, fans deserve better!","Like most Hollywood blockbuster movies these days, only MONEY was on the producers minds. Sad that another American icon was givin the bitter British for greed... $$$ http://the-British-suck.blogspot.com --- Thirty years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, the galaxy faces a new threat from the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order. When a defector named Finn crash-lands on a desert planet, he meets Rey (Daisy Ridley), a tough scavenger whose droid contains a top-secret map. Together, the young duo joins forces with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to make sure the Resistance receives the intelligence concerning the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last of the Jedi Knights."
4198,1,Walked out after the first 30 minutes,"I am not a huge Starwars fan. I do own the Trilogy 4,5, and 6 on DVD but I have never ever brought a toy or a souvenir. Let's just say I'm an average fan but had high hopes this episode would be something special and spectacular. After finished watching this movie, I was certain now that J.J. Abrams was chosen wrong by Disney for this project. You need a commander with an original idea and a fresh take on STARWARS. Also someone with a grand vision, a bigger idea of the universe."
4199,5,It is What It Is People.,"I don't have to get into all the brutally poor aspects of this film (redundant, as there are already some good slams of this movie already posted) and the positives are far out-weighed by the negatives so I won't go into them either."
4200,1,"So awful it reminded me of the disappointing ""Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull""","just a little background: the franchise is now owned by Disney. That means, everything 'Star wars' from now on, is intended to make money trough emotional manipulation, and will be expected to be milked till somebody is willing to spend a dime in something Star Wars related."
4201,5,great!.. just as it was the first time,"I should start by mentioning that based on past experience; I came to this film with absolutely no expectations. That being said, deep down inside -and I'm sure as any other original trilogy fan- I also really wanted to like it, in fact the first 15 minutes were quite enjoyable, and then everything started to look familiara little too familiar. "
4202,1,Revenge of the remake,"Absolutely the worst Star Wars Saga continuation imaginable. Neither J.J. Abrams or Disney consulted the already extensive continuation ideas published by the Star Wars community that was given then nod by George Lucas. They flat out slapped all of that down to came up with their own idea of how the story should continue which was oddly enough like watching the original Star Wars A New Hope though a set of 3-D 4K glasses. The character development was sloppy and quick and the storyline was poorly imagined and lazily written. The movie direction was half witted attempting to air on the side of cheap, lame humor rather than the deep underlying emotion and moral/ethical conflicts portrayed throughout the original movies. I would have expected more from J.J. Abrams who claims himself a fan of the original movies. "
4203,1,Truly Sad,"Where can I begin? I am a huge Star Wars fan, and perhaps I was a little too hopeful that once again we might catch a glimpse of something from our childhood. How wrong I was! It's a remake of EP IV, and a bad attempt at that. Instead of a nefarious Sith Lord, we get Kylo Ren. Grandson of Vader. Whiny kid who throws tantrums and YES, HACKS APART HIS OWN SHIP WITH A LIGHTSABER when things don't go his way. We have no complex bad guys, and that's a shame. A real shame. Tarkin, Motti, Veers, Piett, Needa, Ozzel, Vader, Palpatine...all characters with purpose. There are no memorable villains in VII. Also, we have these crazy abilities...the Falcon can now jump to hyperspace without even taking off. Anyone can use a lightsaber. And while many dispute an untrained adept's ability to best a Force user in a duel? I actually bought it. Kylo Ren whines. He doesn't train. Han Solo is the highlight of the movie, and what they do to him and how they choose to do it is unforgivable. Obviously, if you're a fan, you have to see it. I did. I didn't walk out either. But I went out and bought Phantom Menace just to prove to myself that the prequels were actually better. To my horror, I was right. They are. May the Force be with you as you watch this film, because YOU ARE GONNA NEED IT. Pros: The sets evoke the feeling that you're in the Original Trilogy. The harsh reality is that you're not."
4204,1,The Force just died...and so did my childhood,How pray tell me is this no-talent cloner still working?<br /><br />He can so easily be replaced with a common desktop computer with copy/paste and excel spreadsheet (to tally what the computer reports is needed in a 'blockbuster') capability.<br /><br />They asked Jar Jar about the word 'creativity' and he looked at the person who posed the question and said 'a city in Siberia?'
4205,2,Yet.Another.Jar.Jar.Abrams.Shipwreck,"Lawrence Kasdan, the co-writer of The Force Awakens also wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). That movie is perfectly paced to be exciting. It's not just non-stop action. There are peaks and valleys to it. There are scenes in between the action that set up what's going on and explain why its important. The Force Awakens has none of that. It's just action scene after action scene after action scene with no context, set-up or meaning. There is a point in the movie where"
4206,3,Incoherent and Badly Paced,JJ Abrams is the Michael Bay for nerds.
4207,4,A reboot in disguise. Unoriginal and derivative.,A droid purring?<br /><br />Different clones?<br /><br />Some confusing parts<br /><br />Why the new enemy has to be bad looking with random scars?<br /><br />A non-dead man (how he survived?)<br /><br />Just 4 cats to destroy a planet-weapon?<br /><br />A galaxy puzzle.
4208,1,Seriously?,"Everything bad that's been said about this movie has already been said, everything from bad writing, bad plot, bad character development and the blatant plagiaizing of Episode IV and even though I do agree with all these points I wanted to talk about how shamelessly Disney has treated the Star Wars franchise. They have turned the precious spiritual message of Star Wars into nothing more than a Coca-Cola commercial that's all hype, with zero substance or originality. To the Disney Corporation, Star Wars is nothing more than a Happy Meal--just a throwaway product, nothing else. What a complete smiling shame. ""They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot""-Joni Mitchell."
4209,2,"They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot.","One of the main themes of this saga should be the conflict between Light and Darkness and their role in the universe, the call of good and the seduction of evil. In an ideal world, we would see 'Evil' characters whose inner life reflects this duality.<br /><br />Instead we had Kylo Ren (lmaooo), Hux (potentially interesting if not for the tired space nazi thing) and Snoke (lmaoooox2).<br /><br />These people devoted their life to the Dark Side (in one way or another) but they are cartoonishly incapable to work together cohesively because they are too evil. While the good guys can cooperate flawlessly because they are inherently good. There's no conflict anywhere (except in Ren's badly portrayed mind)."
4210,2,Annoyingly stupid approach to evil,This is not my original post but it says just about everything I felt about this movie:
4211,2,A Total Let Down,This thread contains crucial spoilers please proceed with caution.
4212,4,Hey! lets put up a bigger death star this time or a planet maybe,"...And it was everything that I expected. It was a Star Wars film that fit almost to well into the mold of the original film: now called A New Hope,<br /><br />1. Droid containing sensitive information hides from an evil force on a desert planet, which coincidently has a force sensitive youth vital to the plot nearby. 2. The bad guys search for the droid leads to the formation of ragtag team escaping the planet in the Millennium Falcon; all the while evil forces are using their new super weapon to destroy planets aligned with their enemies. 3. The girl is then captured and taken aboard said super weapon where the good guys stage a daring partially unplanned rescue of her which results in the ultimately pointless heroic death of a geriatric. 4. The good guys then all fly towards Starkiller Station (Death Star III) to destroy it in a mission involving flying through a trench with one good pilot essentially doing everything while a team on the ground disables the shields. 5. The good guys win. Everybody hugs. <br /><br />If anything I think the movie is formulaic on purpose. I think this film is an attempt to not upset the hardcore fans whilst bringing in the new fans with bright lights and pretty laser fights. This is a good thing; Star Wars needed a reset after such a long hiatus, and in recycling old set pieces and plot lines from the original films it makes it incredibly difficult for old fans to complain, because in effect this is what we asked for. Nothing better illustrated this than the opening shot of a silhouetted Star Destroyer flying overhead. These slight alterations to a tried-and-true formula were sporadic and well received by everyone I've spoken to. Of course there were what I would call inconsistencies and ""cons"" within the film: The Millennium Falcon seems to have turned into a bumper car, Stormtroopers still can't hit anything and Carrie Fishers performance within the film can only be described as awkward. But all in all, the movie was fun and has the potential to act as a fantastic foundation for future projects.<br /><br />This film was made to reintroduce the Star Wars universe, to introduce new characters and to sell toys. It is my hope that the next film is where the creative people that be branch out and tell a new story, something compelling and original that in hindsight makes this film a clever reset for the next generation of Star Wars fans rather than a generic rehash as it currently stands."
4213,5,Remarkably generic...,"ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY!!!! Do you not understand why they kept this piece of crap so secret? Because they didn't want all us nerds to learn how they have once again destroyed this Empire, Why are we just seeing clips of the movie for all the Trailers? Why did every Star Wars Trailer Turn into a commercial for a Car, or Food, or yes even MakeUP??? Really, because if they showed any of the scenes in this movie know body would go see it. Yes People will still flock to the movie, and why because they make you see star Wars everywhere you turn. Its not about Plots, Characters, Emotion, Sorrow, Happieness, Excitement, Thrills, and the Chills anymore, its about how can we make the most money possible. Disney is a business and do you think they really care if this movie will move us like the original one did to me 20 years ago????? NO they just want you to buy the paraphernalia and click that movie ticket. Do NOT buy into the hype and try to have them pull another Jedi mind trick and make you think Abrams has done something new and original. He didn't he took something and copied it, just like he did in SUPER 8 from Spielberg and ET. He is a fraud. And he should be ashamed that he has once again destroyed the Black Star of this Empire that seems to fail us all once again. Do not go see this movie, wait until its out on TV for Free, Trust me you will be disappointed Just like you were for the past 15 years. JJ Abrams is a Fraud."
4214,1,"The Force Awoke, But the Entire Theater Was ASLEEP!!!","F*ck this Force Awakens ! I really-really love Star Wars universe, whatever many hardcore fans said or criticized about the original or the expanded universe. Although many said that the prequels are bad, they still have a lot of fantastic and magical scenes that enjoyable to watch for me. It feels like George Lucas is still the right person to direct the universe he's made in my opinion, not because he's failed with the prequels or brings the annoying character Jar-Jar Binks to live and Hayden's terrible acting, but if you can see how Abrams repeat the first movie of all, change Luke with Rey, Death Star with Starkiller Base and Yoda with Maz Kanata, Why? to play save and not take risk with this biggest lovable franchise or something about his career or anything else? Main characters building (Rey, Finn and Poe)are bad,especially for Finn, he seems not important at all. Most of the action sequences are not amazed me. The scores are weak, where is John Williams we've known for his memorable scores? I like the memorable imperial march or forbidden love between Padme and Anakin score ""across the stars"", this movie has generic scores, nothing memorable or ear-catchy. The main villain character is far below Darth Vader. To describes Kylo Ren is "" an Emo grown up boy with all of his shits to be a Vader wannabe "". Supreme Leader Snoke (giving it ""snoke"" name always give me a vision of a snake like Sith lord)looks like an Orc or a mixed creature from Tolkien world with a scar on his face, I always thought he was a superior ancient sith lord that will impressed me in shape and character, but when he appears in holographic big form all I can think is ""meh"". So much awkward important moments like when Han met his emotionally labile son just to stabbed by him and fall, same feel like when he met Leia, the dialogue or emotion seems cliché, like there were no deep connection between them before. For me the only characters made this movies works are Han Solo, Chewie and adorable new female droid BB-8. I know the plot seems ridiculous from the background story after title when the iconic main theme played. J.J. Abrams has done to Star Wars what he did to Star Trek, He ruined it. Maybe to many people this is a good starting for a new trilogy , but for me he had destroyed the first opening of the latest and biggest sci-fi franchise of all time, Abrams and Disney should never made this 30 years after sequel."
4215,1,The 30 years after trilogy sequels that should never had been made,"This movie isn't a continuation to StarWars, it is a tribute to StarWars, a glorified featurette created for the wide fan base to appreciate a brief return to the good old times when the movie was valued as a whole. It is a sentimental stretch on what once was."
4216,5,Sentimental fodder for the fans,"I was so excited to see The Force Awakens since the last three films bore me to death. I grew up with the first three and adore each of those films; Star Wars, Empire, and Jedi. The characters and story lines from the original films were compelling in every way shape and form. The last three films had exceptional special effects but I just never cared for any of the characters or story lines. "
4217,4,The first is still the best,Its a Shame that this franchise even exist this far far away. Let alone Billions of dollar its making.
4218,2,OVERRATED FAR FAR AWAY GALAXY CRAP,The good...
4219,1,Had high hopes but was very disappointed. would not recommend.,(no plot revealed)
4220,4,The icy dead heart of big business just mocked you with this off the shelf evanescent crowd-pleaser,This is a franchise with a lot of tradition and viewer warmth. Disney has disneyfied it and ruined the franchise.
4221,1,"As Luke says ""What a hunk of junk""",A lot of fans complained about various aspects of VII and unfortunately I agree with most of them.
4222,5,Why NO Star Wars Music & Themes???,"I enjoyed it now with 2 of 4 planned viewings this weekend under the belt. But it has some glaring problems for the hard core fans. SPOILERS - Especially fans of the excellent novels that now officially have been trashed. First inexcusable foible, that both the new characters were able to go more than one second in a saber battle with an experienced force user, and second, that the Skywalker sister is a mundane general instead of a force-skilled warrior herself, which is unbelievable. That latter especially as we see how stunningly quickly Rey adopts advanced force skills as a complete 'force newbie' - yet somehow Leia has remained a mundane for decades (of course in the books she sharpened her force skills as one would expect of someone so packed with the Skywalker bloodline, even after maintaining public office and duties outside the Order.) Or that the rebels surrounding an active Republic and decades of time to capitalize on their defeat of the emperor could only mount a few squadrons when military was needed. Oh, and a super weapon apparently destroys the entirety of the Republic with one blow all in relegated to one solar system? That the empire-ish faction would even waste all those resources on another even larger superweapon given how well those worked out in the past - they could have built what... a million fleets instead? That Luke abandoned his duty because of one bad seed (not in the books, where similarly one of Han/Leia's kids go bad.) Wow, they should have stuck to the 'credible and esteemed authored' novel material, because story-wise, it didn't hold up to any credibility. Suspension of disbelief among fans has to suffer tremendously upon reflection. I'm afraid the story just doesn't work for this long-time fan. The story blocks crumble. They may have delivered a quality ""fun"" movie experience, but as a component of vary rare Star Wars canon, they really failed."
4223,2,SW Fans have to Hate this upon Reflection,"The Movie is the updated version of A NEW HOPE. There is very little focus on adding elements that would set the movie apart from the original trilogy, and in my opinion, even the prequel trilogy displayed more thought into the originality."
4224,4,The Force Woke out of a nap,"Hey, it would have been fine on it's own as a fan edit. I would say that 75% of the story and lines, you already know. Even if you've never seen the 4,5 and 6, you will still know most of the movie because it because it's ingrained in our pop culture. I also feel like it was made in the 80's. Only a few visuals are worth talking about and those few are in the trailer. Which brings me to my next thought... i thought the trailer was great and didn't give anything away, but now i know that they put the new stuff in the trailer and everything else is a rehash of previous movies. I really wish i could have seen Lucas' vision of it instead."
4225,3,Fan Edit,"I am not a biggest Star Wars fan who blindly defends original trilogy all the time. I've just decided to start watching the movies in chronological order and it's the 9th movie for me so far since Phase 1.<br /><br />However, this movie was a real disappointment for me because of bad acting, copy paste scenario, full of cliché and meaningless characters with no profundity whatsoever. I would rather prefer seeing more character development and an original scenario which captures what happened after the victory at Phase 6, the story of Han Solo and his family or Luke Skywalker. Instead, there was another meaningless Death Star and an inferior Darth Vader imitation who can barely defeats an ex storm trooper and a girl in a basic fight.<br /><br />Also, death of the Han Solo legend was such a big deal but they made it so predictable and ruined all the drama for me.<br /><br />In short, I think that there was a huge potential and it was wasted in that movie."
4226,4,Disappointment,I'm writing this review just so all of you know what you're getting into before watching this film. 
4227,1,Just Know What You're Getting Into,"A Stars Wars child who grew up watching the films as I did, but please do not let the director or these kindergarten actors touch anymore Star Wars films they suck."
4228,2,I hated this film,"This movie was a disappointment. It felt more like a Disney movie than a Star Wars movie. The plot is the same as A New Hope, the acting was poor, the new music sucked, there was so many inconsistencies in the plot, and it was was boring. I will give it another shoot and watch it again. Hopefully, I will finally see what these critics are raving about."
4229,1,Disappointment,"It's been a long time awaited movie, expectations were high but the result was (at least for me) a disappointment."
4230,4,Expected a sequel but got a remake,Reason For Existence
4231,2,A Few Things This Reboot Lacks,"Wife and I went to the theater 2 weeks after the premier. Paid $6ea, glad we did."
4232,5,Same old story - re-done,"I wish I'd never seen any of the Star Wars movies, so that I could have watched The Force Awakens with a fresh eye and no Star Wars expectations. Alas, that wasn't the case. Given the director (I'm a big fan of Lost and Star Trek), as well as the hype and glowing reviews appearing everywhere, I could not help but expect something decent, despite my better judgment. "
4233,4,Not a J J Abrams movie.,"A friend of mine described this movie as ""a good Star Wars movie, but not a good movie as such."" He meant that Ep VII works if you've seen Star Wars before, but it can't really stand on its own legs otherwise as a masterpiece of its own. I'm grateful he told me this spoiler- less bit of opinion before seeing the movie, because otherwise I might have been a tad disappointed."
4234,5,Mediocre Movie,"The Force Awakens isn't a new movie of the Star Wars saga, is a recycling, and by moments, an awful recycling."
4235,2,Recycling Saga,"Can anyone tell me why these ships miss each other with lasers? These space ships and inter-galactic stuff is super high tech. Why aren't their guns / lasers computerized? why wouldn't computers auto target ships? why is it, that with this super high technology that you couldn't target enemies that are like 1-5 AU away with near light-speed lasers? Just shoot, wait 8-40 minutes and boom, opponent is dead, it's over. God star wars is stupid. it always was...even the first one. their stupid lasers on their high tech yet somehow primitive space ships miss only to heighten the moment and make you think the heroes are cool cause they can dodge lasers. even today with our garbage human technology on earth we have computerized targeting systems...star wars doesn't make sense. let it go. drop it. star wars sucks and you all know it."
4236,1,Can we stop with the remakes...please,"before seeing it, I had all my expectation low, to not be badly surprised. Even with them being at such a low level, the movie was much worse than I could imagine. I blame it on the script and on the fact that it wants to be bigger than itself. It couldn't do that."
4237,1,plain awful,"I really really really wanted to this movie to be good. I loved the Star Wars franchise, but this was the last straw. "
4238,1,Pointless Waist,... I will be able to forget this
4239,3,With Some Therapy...,"I'm surprised by the absolute lack of objectivity for the review of this movie. What I see here with many other Star Wars fans in these days is some sort of ''Episode I's Syndrome'', when everyone was trying to convincing themselves that the movie was good, even better than the originals! Maybe when the euphoria wears off, and you watch this movie a couple years down the road, you will see it for what actually is, a completely forgettable film with poor storytelling and horrible pacing."
4240,3,EPISODE I Syndrome - A Spoilers Full Review,Waiting so much time didn't reach expectations.
4241,4,Scenario reached the dark side,"This is Star Wars not Mickey Mouse Disney's so-called Star Wars is easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it or got paid for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. There is no doubt all the 9 to 16 year old virgin fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble nonsense. But those guys are just pretending to like this because they want to appear hip to Star Wars to get a girl or their parents are accountants. At no time to you feel anything for any characters maybe because they forced a girl as a leading character and of course she is the jedi of all jedi, etc."
4242,2,Cut out with all the stupid jokes and one liners Disney,"Honestly it is beyond me why this movie scores close to 9 stars on IMDb. Plot and story is close to non existent in this movie and 5 stars review comes mostly from being action packed. Main characters were rather bland comparing to the bunch in the original trilogy. I dig more BB-8 than any new character in the movie. And main reason for that is when JJ have money he will blow most of it on CGI and VFX instead of the story. Story is re-booted from Episode IV (droid that holds some important data, sand planet with some peasant doing hard labor instead of being a Jedi, ultra-mega-huge death star masked inside the planet, tho I am not quite sure that it would be possible to build that thing in ~30 years since I doubt that after destruction of second one and death of Emperor, next day Empire recuperated and started building new and improved one). Yeah action sequences are decent, tho I really have issues with Finn and Ray fighting Sith without any training (I though wielding light saber is not, or hard at least, for non Force users) is rather pathetic. 30 years passed, we have Luke Skywalker went AOL, one fallen Jedi that he trained him, and yet we don't get slight flashback how, why or when it happened. Overall 5 stars is VERY generous for this movie, and honestly I would be perfectly OK if no other Star Wars movie is ever created. But since re-boots and milking is the thing Disney do, we are looking at at least 2 more with possibility of making them as long as they feel fit."
4243,5,Can't figure out how come this movie is close to 9 stars on IMDb,"Okay, before I start my rant I am just going to mention this is the seventh movie of the franchise if you watching in chronological order."
4244,3,What have they done to Star Wars?,Imagine if the following plot was released/leaked before the movie came out and how people would react:
4245,3,We've been snookered,"Disney, JJ Abrams and Bad Robot are lying. There is no force here. It is all the sound of a vacuum cleaner sucking the cash of miscellaneous losers.<br /><br />Would it kill you to have a story, character development, a slim girl in a microskirt with long hair and maybe some integrity?"
4246,2,Lying Is A Sin,"Hard to find anything positive to say about this garbage pile of a movie that was lit on fire and fed healthy amount of garbage to keep it burning for its entire duration. I actually thought it wasnt that bad for the first 50 minutes, but whatever little hope i had was completely crushed and soiled by the time this disgraceful piece of filth was over. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The only thing you can think is how much i wish Lucas had made the movie with the advances in technology up to this point. The acting, the writing, the story, the characters, every aspect of this film is so horrible that its actually disturbing. It leaves you haunted by how bad it was and looking for revenge against all the criminals that made it happen. "
4247,1,The worst piece of flaming garbage ever made,"Everything coming out of Disney's greedy studio is crap.<br /><br />They made a joke out of the superhero genre, they made their endless princesses ugly and now they destroyed Star Wars.<br /><br />Sadness.<br /><br />Imagine a so-called Star Wars film episode 7 that totally ignores what happened in episode 6. Now imagine no more. It is called The Farce Awakens.<br /><br />There was an article on the net a year ago about JJ Abrams last wife. At least she must be happy."
4248,1,Disband Disney,"I think every scene and plot piece can be put together from the previous movies. I don't want to write any spoilers, but if you've watched the previous episodes, you're already spoiled. The only thing that I liked about this movie was watching the old characters played by its original actors, nothing else. I might have liked a new scene... I doesn't have one. I'm I being repetitive? does that annoy you? well, guess what? IT ANNOYS ME TOO!!!. It actually got me thinking... Where do I get my money back?!!! and the two hours of my life that I've lost?!!! who'll give it back to me? Whoever you are, you can keep it, only if you repair the damage that you have made to my beloved Star Wars."
4249,1,Is it a Christmas special made of flashbacks?,Too many bad actors reacting to the poor script.<br /><br />Look gender switches ave gone overboard already of not sequels and remakes and reboots.<br /><br />This is not Star Wars. This is cashing in wars and a copy of the original (Episode 4)
4250,3,Too Many Jokes,"J.J. Abrams loves recycling. He has done it many times before: Alias (Nikita TV Series), Fringe (X Files), Super 8 (Spielberg), Cloverfield (Godzilla) and of course Star Trek. So it is no surprise that the new Star Wars film was handled to him, for recycling purposes only."
4251,2,Finding an old box of toys in the closet,"You might think the bad guys in Star Wars would learn from their former mistakes, but unfortunately they don't. "
4252,2,Where has the story gone?,"Really I find it awful , after 30 min I thought that space-balls was far much better than this. The bad guys are not so bad they are just funny, what is more scarier the name ""the sith"" or ""the new order"" ? Kylo face is really something, is just missing some teen pimples...probably even Mel Brooks will never thought of that! With all the star wars expanded universe stories they could have invented a better story. Rei learn how to use the force in minutes (put a force stone or something like that at list). Finn branding a lighsaber and know how to use it ? It take years to master it even to the best...I was waiting for him to cut his arm or a feet. And what is those tiny tingies caming from kylo Ren sword, OK I got it is not a light-saber is a light-longsword, really i slap my face when i saw it. But hey they have amiral""it's a trap""akbar, and maybe an orange kind of yoda, princes ""grandma"" leyla and Han solo(no comment) as revival. A new kind of drone(probably Disney made)and all is politically correct now, so not much fun after all. Well they will make the spin off and the next one with Luke teaching to the girl with lot of flashback, the story of Luke teaching to funnyface/kylo probably and the new Kylo ready now, as bad guy, at list they could have make his face a bit gray or looked deformed by the dark force. My opinion? Save your money and watch it on DVD..."
4253,1,space-balls was more funny,"Let me just say that this is not a good movie. At all. This was more of a really bad remake with washed up characters that should have had cameos instead of pivotal roles. It is a fan service that relied too heavily on the familiar and brought basically nothing new to the franchise. People tell us not to compare to the OT, but that's exactly what they did with the PT and that's exactly what I'm going to do here. Why should the TFA come under less scrutiny just because George Lucas is not at the helm?"
4254,3,Don't follow the blind nostalgia,"No one has a clue and everyone is bringing in a woman to retread what a man has done. Yes, it is institutional misandry and misogyny.<br /><br />Instead of film makers and talented folks we have accountants, bean counters of corporate hackery like JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy. So they order a gender switch and make a billion.<br /><br />Whose fault is it that this gender switch made money and Star Wars is no longer?"
4255,3,The Year Is 2015,The Bad
4256,3,Plot holes galore lack of originality and anemic character building,"I, like most here, have been a lifelong fan of star wars. I was prepared for change. But I expected depth!! ""If only you knew the power of the dark side"" there were no memorable lines with depth like those that seared star wars onto our collective conscious!!!"
4257,1,A dying franchise,All this movie does is bash white males.
4258,1,"Racist, rubbish of a movie","Now that Di$ney and Jar Jar Abrams made a billion on this the lesson they learned is that copying older films is the way to go. How many more remakes do you think Di4ney will push now?? A hundred, two hundred? A million?<br /><br />Di$ney was already the master of money stealing, sucker trapping remakes with all the Hunchbacks and Robin Hoods they have released. Now that this remake worked JJ Abrams will be hired to hide another ten plans in ten robots and introduce so many death stars with the exact same flaw!!! <br /><br />PS: Next time get a hot girl in a microskirt. At least, that is something to look forward to if we have to put up with the gender switch"
4259,2,Thanks Guys,"Imagine Luke Skywalker receiving his Fathers lightsaber from Ben Kenobi and then immediately rushing to a pawnshop to sell it, while screaming"" so long Sucker!"" at Ben. That's how disrespectful the makers of this for profit only toy commercial are. Rogert Ebert review that fittingly applies ""A terrible film, paralysingly dull, simple minded, overlong and not even 'manipulative,' because it is too clumsy to manipulate anyone but a true believer."" Disney spent $ 4 billion to get their hands on Star Wars and $ 10 on the script. Just imagine what Christopher Nolan a true artist could of done with Star Wars or a bunch of other people I could name. I'm disappointed in the original cast putting money ahead of art, isn't that why we had to wait so long for a new Indiana Jones movie? Until a script came along every one was happy with? George Lucas and James Cameron waited years till technology caught up with their imagination before filming, sign of true artists more interested in Story than profit. Star Wars 1977-2005 R.I.P﻿"
4260,1,"""You want fries with that?""",Spoilers ahead.
4261,1,GREATEST RIPOFF IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA,It will be as silly and spoofy and boring as this. The force Awakens is the most ironic title for a movie since White Chicks. Please do not walk into a cinema to be voluntarily pick-pocketed. I want to revert back to my childhood when there were only 3 Star Wars films and they were all beyond great.
4262,1,Boycott Episode 8,CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!
4263,3,Such a waste! Such a disappointment!,The treasury department awakens.
4264,1,What hollywood Shareholders Needed,"We need to talk about the gap between Episode VI and this one. It's like they have any connections. I mean, why are they still rebels, if they won at the last one??<br /><br />It's also not original, looks like a recycling of the original story. Same rebels, same empire, same jedi that gives up because one padawan gives up to the dark side of the force. There's nothing new here."
4265,5,Not Star Wars,"Repetitive, dull, and overly reliant on special effects, this film is an unashamed rehash of the previous movies. It did not even have the respect for its audience to take itself seriously, epitomized by the fact that Jaja Binx is back, only this time he's black. Possibly the most self-indulgent movie ever made, it is only partly redeemed by the wonderful performances given by Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. Sadly these acting gems were scattered so sparsely they were hardly worth waiting for."
4266,4,A howling disappointment,"This movie received so much hype. I was so excited to go see this. I bought my tickets for opening night I get to the theatre with my popcorn and coke. I get a great seat and... This movie is just terrible. There are continuity errors everywhere, and the plot is the exact same as Episode IV. The only real difference is you have a ball robot instead of an R2-D2 its just upsetting. Its true that I'm writing this movie review out of spite right now but I am legitimately upset about this. It is not a sequel at all, it is a remake. I had faith in JJ but he has let me down once again and its sad to see. I hope no one else wastes their time seeing this in theatres."
4267,2,It makes me so sad...,"As others stated the story complexity does not happen. To be honest i did not expect that, so that cant be the reason why this movie is so disappointing. It feels somehow like i try to fit a jigsaw together that is made out of the previous six movies. Every part is no doubt star wars but the frustration grows if you try to build a new picture that wont fit. The production quality is high, the use of cgi is balanced and the love of detail in the sets shows. But to make this feel fresh and as surprising as the original star wars you need to take risks and thats why this movie is so disappointing: i watched a product that maximizes the mass compatibility. Shows like Breaking Bad, Fargo or True Detective with unpredictable story lines and beautiful detailed character development make movies like Star Wars VII look and feel flat like old popcorn. I cant pretend i didn't see these shows so Star Wars VIII, IX and all the Han Solo Orgins Movies will not be on my watch list. As Mark Hamill said: Star Wars is just a movie. Every new part makes this statement a bit more true."
4268,3,Why did it disappoint me?,"I can complain about everything that's wrong with Episode 7, but it won't do any good -- what's done is done. Here's what needs to be done in the next episode to get Star Wars back on track:"
4269,5,Episode 8,Watching the original movies as a child I have always imagined what happened to the rebellion and the remaining empire fleet after the destruction of the emperor and Lord Vader. 
4270,3,Star Wars I guess.,"This movie is so awful that i will not waste too much time or electricity on this review. The characters are awful and there are so many stupid plot holes which only a low IQ audience can withstand without developing a brain tumor mid-movie. It was for this reason i could not bear to finish the entire movie, after forwarding a lot of bits in the first 40 min, at the 1 hour mark, me and my wife simply turned off the TV and went out to the garden go detoxify. The entire time we were genuinely cursing at the movie."
4271,1,Unbelievably Boring,Sadly an horrendous movie that should have promised potential but ruined by fraudulent parties cashing in on a legendary franchise. The film is a direct rip off of everything that came before it and offered nothing new or original. Perhaps we should all start reading books again.
4272,1,Utter garbage,Adam Driver - totally mistake Oscar Issac - Totally right
4273,1,I thought I was watching Star Balls,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens... I'm so disappointed. Although it is same as the old ones, the sad thing is it is literally the same nothing else. New ideas? Just a few good ones. Actually it is a remake of the New Hope."
4274,5,Only just a remake,"One of the success factors of Star Wars was the simple story, somewhat naive, and each episode in this amazing story is dealing with another subject / issue / idea "
4275,3,Very Disappointing Episode,"Without spoiling it for the people who haven't seen the film, I won't go into detail about what the story line is, but I will say there isn't much originality at all in this film. In fact, it's almost like watching a previous Star Wars movie , I won't say which one, but with worse writing and worse actors. The true star of this movie is Harrison Ford. Without him this movie would have been really boring. Some of the ""Dark"" people really needed to be ""Darker"" and less wimpy or giving in too easily. If you think about it, when did you ever see Darth Vader ever take any crap from anyone? Even from the Sith Lord? Films based on villainy need villainous characters that give you that feeling of darkness. Sure there were dark deeds done in the movie but when they were done, it just didn't give you that feel of an evil deed. Part of that has to do with the almost total lack of character building, which was done hastily. Even at the end of the movie, you have no idea who some of the new characters are. To be honest, the only thing that kept me from leaving the theater early was wanting to see the original star wars members cast in their roles again. The rest of the movie just didn't pull me in."
4276,5,Not that good...,"It doesn't make point five past light speed and was a complete let down. Not sure who bribed all the critics who raved about the movie after the premier, because they must have watched a completely different movie to the one I saw."
4277,3,What a heap of junk!!!,"As a movie, this wasn't bad. As a Star Wars, it needs work."
4278,5,"IV, V, VI is still better.","They could have done anything... What's cooler than a universe with warp drives, lights sabers and blasters??? The Star Wars universe should be just ripe with new stories and exploration. Instead we're given a near exact remake of ""A New Hope"". Hans is Obi Wan, his son is Vader, Ray is Luke, Luke is Yoda... While we're still completely out of ideas, why not bring the Deathstar back??? Heck, let's even do scene for scene remakes with the cantina, Vader slaughtering Obi Wan and the entire movie boiling down to the Rebels bombing a weak point of Deathstar 3.0. "
4279,3,Zero creativity,"I'm nineteen years old and a movie like this is one of the reasons everyone hates on my generation. This is mainly because the role of the mentor, so cherished in the Star Wars universe, was made to look entirely unnecessary. I mean, it took Luke failure after failure before he could deflect those training lasers with his father's lightsaber; a new weapon clumsy in his hands. And if it wasn't for old Ben Kenobi in his head would he have switched off his targeting computer and known that the force would be with him, always? Or what about those painful days training on Dagobah, which wouldn't inaugurate Luke as a Jedi until frustration and failure at a critical moment? Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi was one ridden with struggle and redemption. Not so, it seems, for our new protagonist, Rey. It appears as though she doesn't need a mentor when she can apparently call upon the force at random to mind-trick storm troopers and win a lightsaber duel. She defeats an antagonist whom from what I can tell has trained with the force for years, even though just a few days ago she was scrounging Star Destroyer debris. In the words of Han Solo: ""That's not how the force works."" The movie seems to forget who Luke's character was when modeling Rey after him. Sitting in the theater I felt myself sarcastically thinking that Luke wasn't so great after all while watching Rey slash through Kylo's armor and Poe Dameron miraculously blow up a space station a hundred times the size of the death star. I guess we're just trying to show all you old farts out there that we the millenials don't need a teacher or a wise one in our lives to be the best. Anybody can pick up Anakin's lightsaber and be a winner. At least, that's what it felt like watching this movie."
4280,2,Star Wars Episode VII: A Painful Generational Gap,I went into the movie expecting it to be better or as good as the original Star Wars movies after seeing that it had a score of more than 80 at meta-critic. 
4281,4,"Not bad, but spoils the original Star Wars' experience","Star Wars The Force Awakens 3/10 I was, unfortunately, very disappointed with the new JJ Abrams directed Star Wars."
4282,3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to the new Star Wars - not only do I love the universe it describes, it is directed by JJ Abrams, can you ask for more ? "
4283,4,Trying too hard and wants too much,"A lot of people have pointed out the similarities between this movie and Ep. IV, so I won't go into those. What really robbed me of the enjoyment of this film was the terrible pacing. There was no time to get to know the characters (although they were quite likable), to feel pleasure at seeing all the old icons return or take in the significance of certain scenes. Scenes which followed each other without much connecting logic or build-up. One moment, Rey is trying to talk Finn out of leaving, then all at once she is hearing voices and going to investigate, finds Luke's light saber and has a confusing vision. One action scene follows another without a breather. Say what you want about Lucas, but he knows how to build to a climax. Here, every scene has the same sense of urgency."
4284,2,"Just awful. How awful, I'll tell you -","Forty years ago a man named George Lucas launched a saga of fantasy, hope and adventure. It was inspired, but new, different and still original."
4285,5,Zips by at light speed.,What can I say?<br /><br />Incompetent idiots running the show do not know what Star Wars is all about. Hollywood is going downhill with its lazy writing and over-dependence of technical digital movie stunts.<br /><br />The critics who give this Sequel 10/10 are either paid by Disney or are plain stupid.
4286,2,Something Very Wrong In Hollywood And The American Movie System,+++This review contains spoilers!+++
4287,2,Now thar we got TLJ and TROS coming out...TFA was the beginning of the end of Star Wars,Whoever gives that movie a 10/10 has either never seen the first parts or wasn't in the same movie I was.... Most of it is just a remake of the first part...
4288,3,My thoughts about The Force Awakens,"I watched The Force Awakens just after having watched the previous six right before this one came out. I actually didn't want to go see this one at first, thinking it would probably be just a commercial movie more than an interesting continuation of the saga. It definitely impressed me to see that it got so highly rated on IMDb, and that general comments said it had been a good movie. "
4289,2,Episode IV remake?,"So...the movie is bad but in a good way. It finally destroys the pagan fan-boy cult that was built up with such effort once & for all,no turning back the clock now (SPOILER ALERT) Han Solo murdered by his own son Gas Mask...even Darth Vader & Luke never seriously considered family fratricide, always pulling back into the comfort zone of the 1970's ... Now it's so here & now and its just mirroring the mind numbing cruel banality of today. "
4290,5,"Definitely not as good as 8,7","Probably the most anticipated film of all time, The Force Awakens starts off well enough, but swiftly goes downhill from there. People are (somewhat justifiably) worried about spoilers, but in the end, there is nothing to spoil. Every plot element, every twist, every action scene feels ripped from other Star Wars movies."
4291,5,LEGO Narvana....(SPOILER ALERT),"Just been to see Star Wars the force awakens. I am a huge star wars fan, grew up in the late 70s and 80s so I was a true star wars child. What can I say tremendous special effects and action sequences as you would expect from Hollywood these days. However as a true fan I am dreadfully disappointed. I think that George Lucas has made a huge error in selling the franchise to Disney. Don't get me wrong I am a big fan of a good children's animation, love finding nemo, toy story and all that but they have tried to kiddify star wars and in doing so taken all of the bite out of it. The plot is basically the original star wars with a few bits added on around it. In parts the plot it is paper thin and feels rushed, after a 1 minute meeting they all agree to send three people to knock out the shield of the new Death Star, sure three people is enough to blast your way through legions of troops. Star wars introduced one of cinemas most enduring villains in Darth Vader, big, imposing, mysterious and uncompromising, not a baddie to be messed with. In empire strikes back he makes short work of the half trained Luke and the mask doesn't come off until the end of the third film. In the phantom menace we got Darth maul, lean, mean, menacing and athletic, a sith who happily took on two Jedi knights with the intention of killing them both. Not a man to be trifled with. Kilo Ren is not big but skinny, not imposing or uncompromising, indeed at the end a girl who has never picked up a light saber in her life and has just started to figure out how to use the force bests him and he is lucky to get away with his life. He takes his mask off within an hour, so no mystery there then. No doubt this was at the behest of Disney executives who concerned with the fee they were paying the actor underneath demanded to see his face. He is not at all big and menacing like Darth Vader, or skillful and athletic like Darth Maul. He simply doesn't have the on-screen presence of either of them. So your thinking, well Darth Vader had a boss, the emperor, he was a bad dud, scheming, calculating and manipulative, brilliantly played by Ian McDiarmid. Well now we have the supreme leader who seems to be a copy of Voldemort. Again you can read the Disney execs like a book, the kids liked Harry Potter so we can get away with a Voldemort lookalike. Again don't get me wrong love JJ Abrams and what he did with Star Trek. I have no doubt that the Disney executives have hand-cuffed him here. They are experts in their market which is children and they have made sure that this film can be pitched to children. However that is not Star Wars. If you are a true fan going to see this and hoping to see stunning light saber fight with a truly menacing bad guy then you are going to be let down. The reason the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit were such a success is that Peter Jackson did not shy away from the fights, there were orc heads lopped off aplenty, yes there were humorous moments but the battles were full on and everyone loved it. To be fair to George Lucas he didn't shy away from it either, the revenge of the sith was really quite dark. George Lucas may not be the best director in the world and I think everyone agrees that Jar-Jar binks is best forgotten but as its creator he knew what star wars is and what it should be. Disney should stick to what they do best and hand the biggest film franchise in the world over to a company who is happy and willing to make a grown up film."
4292,4,Barely a movie,"Had high hopes for this film , but sadly let down from the start. It's basically a remake of original Star Wars and a poor version at best. The script was probably wrote in 2 weeks in between watching neighbors. I don't blame the actors but Mr JJ is rapidly going down in my books. I loved Cloverfield and Star Trek but lost some faith with Into Darkness , now Force Awakens is also poor this guy better take a long look at himself, if selected to do the other 2 Star Wars."
4293,3,Disappointing,This was nothing but a high-budget fan fiction.
4294,4,Remake of New Hope,"15 mins into this movie & I began worrying it was just an inferior attempt at recreating the original. 2 hours later I realised that, whilst it wasn't as awful as Eps 1-3, I was justified in having that concern."
4295,2,Soulless Counterfeit,"Just back from the theater; WORST Star Wars movie to date (bravo JJ), I can't believe it how they managed to do it, the Star Wars magic is gone (thanks Disney). No substance, joke villains (not believable by a mile), forgettable music score (JJ Abrahams even drags John Williams with him on this one), no climax, ripoff of episode IV to the letter, no character buildup, bad casting, didn't care for the new characters, lame writing, was terrible, no story at all, boring all the way; it didn't feel like a SW movie, more like a Saturday cartoon whit the ending cliffhanger for the next week, just terrible. With this new low, Attack of the Clones looks like the Godfather. At least in the prequels we get to know new worlds, very convincing and menacing villains and climax scenes with the music score been remembered and helping to establish those moments (I miss George Lucas). Sure, they'll make the box office records with this one, but only from the nostalgia of the fans for viewing the old cast. Next time a Star Wars movie comes out the box office gross will be far less because of this one. I'm very angry, they destroy was left of SW; and my expectations where low, just image that!!"
4296,3,"A carbon copy of ""A New Hope""",This film was assuredly critic proof and having seen it that was certainly an advantage that it needed.
4297,1,Worst Star Wars Movie to date !!!,"I so wanted to enjoy the new film Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I did in some ways, but not so much in others. Like many others I had high hopes for the film. It was not the expected epic at all with rehashed plot ideas from previous Star Wars movies and themes from the ""LEGENDS"" expanded universe set of novels. "
4298,2,Awkwardly forced,"My first review. I am a big Star Wars fan, well of the original 3 films anyway. I was taken in by all the hype, and the trailers that were released really got me hooked. I was expecting so much from this film! ............ The film never captured my imagination and I really felt the full running time, I was bored during some parts of the film. The rest was just OK, nothing special. The story line was bland and I found nothing that grabbed my attention and the supposed big scenes that were supposed to surprise or shock neither surprised me or shocked me, in fact I could see them coming a mile away. Characters were average and I never really felt anything for any of them. Special effects were good but nothing I've not seen before and certainly did not give me that 'wow' factor. I still think the opening scenes in A New Hope and The Empire Srikes Back are far more powerful and look more realistic and impressive. ............... My main issue is that, to me this did not feel like a Star Wars Film. I left disappointed and a bit sad for being sucked in by all the hype. My 9 year old son, whilst not saying anything bad about the film seemed somewhat underwhelmed by it and on the hour drive back home he didn't mention it at all. The next day he asked me to rate all the Star Wars Films in order of favourite to worst, obviously Empire was my favourite his being Return of the Jedi. I honestly didn't know where to put The Force Awakens and still haven't decided, my son hasn't either! Bottom line, Disney and Abrams and all the money you could ever want to make a blockbuster failed to impress a 9 year old Star Wars fan. Says it all really. I really hope they get it together for the next film....please!"
4299,5,Spoilers from A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW,"Enjoyed it but not overwhelmingly so. It felt a little like a warm old blanket being thrown over a raddled soul hankering after their past. The two new, British leads were very good; they are going to have a good career. At times it felt like a sticker book of nods to the first three movies, there's even a Yoda replacement who looks like a dried up satsuma, but then I realised, it's not just a bunch of nods or even a sequel or a re- boot; it's a full blown re-make of the original trilogy."
4300,4,Disappointing,"Oh my god, I just paid to go see episode IV in a parallel universe! "
4301,5,Shocking lack of imagination.,"Recycled, boring content that in a lot of places makes absolutely no sense. Full of plot holes and stuff we are expected to take for granted although there is no reason to do it. Except for Solo, characters are bland and uninteresting. Pair that with loads of political correctness which is showed down your throat in usual forced manner and you will want to escape after first 15 minutes. It is even worse than Star Trek Into Darkness, which is quite a feat. I suspect this movie has that much PC in it so possible critics will auto-censor themselves in fear someone might brand them ""racists"". Perfect deteriorated movie for degenerated times."
4302,4,"After this. . . .the prequels don't seem to bad, and they were rotten!",It is so bad that it is unbelievable.
4303,1,Perfect sign of our times,"Currently this is a better movie in IMDb top 250 than Green Mile, T2, Apocalypse Now, The Departed and even Alien. I usually don't spread negativity, but word must get out."
4304,2,"A Sea Of Vomit Upon People Who Financed This, Played A Hand in It And Went To Watch It In Theater","Very disappointing. I was leading the charge for Lucas to go away but it's clear he's sorely needed. This film is more a remake of 1977 movie than a new story line. Being 40yrs old and living StarWars as a kid, I had high hopes for Force Awakens, but it just felt forced and stale. "
4305,1,This movie is like a counterfeit copy of Ep. 4,Utter rubbish. Terrible acting by a bunch of unknowns. Disappointing as I thought with JJ Abrams directing it would be better.
4306,1,Ugh...all this wait for this?,"It's like they just took the story of Episode IV, tweaked it in places, moved a couple of bits around and stuck in bits from the rest of the Original and Prequel series, then thought 'they'll never know'<br /><br />Well, we did."
4307,2,Waste of money.,"Instead of using the comic books or the Legends universe, they decided to do a completely new story that makes zero sense by itself and with the past films. I still don't understand how suddenly, after the Rebels win against the Empire, there is suddenly a new empire. They don't explain what happened to transition from a victory to being back to an empire. The First Order makes no sense, Rey's ""natural"" knowledge with a lightsaber makes no sense, Luke's disappearance makes no sense, nothing makes sense. I love the casting choice, and I think that the actors did what they could with the material they were given. Not their fault that the writing of their characters sucks."
4308,1,"one word sums it up, plagiarism","SPOILER ALERT! The plot is EXACTLY the same as the fourth movie!! They're basically making a ton of money by redoing the 4th movie with different humor and better effects. Think about it, it's about an orphan in the dessert who runs into a droid with all this classified information about the Jedi. (Luke & r2 vs Ray & bb 8) Then they even both run into Han Solo and the millennium falcon! They both happen to have the force and is looking for someone to teach them how to use it. I mean come on, clearly they took Star Wars away from George Lucas and had no original content. They wanted to create more movies without screwing it up so they just copied the fourth movie. I'm so disappointed!!! I was actually really looking forward to this!!"
4309,3,Nothing makes sense,Strong points:
4310,1,Not at all original!!,Warning contains spoilers.
4311,5,Huge logical and and artistic flaws - SAD,"As a long-term fan of the series back when it first hit the screens in the late 70's, I wasn't too sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this but as The Force Awakens unfolded I couldn't help feeling that I was just watching an amalgam of episodes 4, 5 & 6. "
4312,5,"It captures the spectacle of Star Wars, but the writing is just poor.",I went in to the cinema with low expectations. I came out disappointed.
4313,5,Good but disappointing,"I agree with the many posters here who gave this a low rating! As one who saw the original Star Wars in 1977, I am truly disappointed with this remake. And lets be honest it is a remake any way you look at it. Nothing original in this movie - same plot as episode IV. Couldn't they have come up with something better? The bad guy is another Darth Vader look alike with an evil looking mask who happens to be Luke's nephew (spoiler alert). But does he really need that mask? Why does he wear a mask anyways because in part of the movie he takes it off and breathes just fine without it? "
4314,2,It's so terrible in all aspects that I actually miss Jarjar now,Right.....from where should I start....I want to really keep it short on this movie...I thought it was just a normal movie for me and it's doesn't deserve all that pre-release advertising and the after release merchandising adverts and campaign. we went to see the movie as a family group and trust me we felt bored after the first 50 minutes and to be honest from total length of the movie I have only watched a maximum 40 minutes action. It felt like the movie kept in repeating it self in a long story simple battle.......then there you go they finally found the great '' Sky Walker '' then finally The End...and well done for spending your money on a movie that is not worth it and not worth all that media campaign.........we were really disappointed.
4315,2,Awful - Just Plain Awful ( Contains Spoilers ),"Just watched this movie, and I was just blown away with disappointment! Don't know that was worst..the complete and utter sizzyness of Kylo Ren or the fact that the force is now something you learn yourself when it might come in handy?"
4316,2,All in All it's a very OK movie and not worth all of that media Campaign,"To start off I expected more jj. I have a difficult time saying this cause I love star wars even when they went way too crazy with the CGI. First off I don't really like that the baddest dude in the film looks like the guy from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Secondly the vibe I get from the movie is any body can be a Jedi. Guy takes off his storm trooper uniform and starts swinging around a light saber. Its very terrible when a franchise takes bits and pieces of the old movies and crams it together. This movie needed a lot more story and a lot less garbage scenes. I don't think there is any dialogue from the movie that was entertaining. I never got engulfed in this movie so the nostalgic stuff was what kept me awake. I am not about spoilers but this movie was terrible I'm sure the same people who love this movie also love avatar. This movie was screwed up, screenplay was probably imagined by an 8 year old James Cameron like that ties loose ends of a story together with tear drops. Very upset I preordered it on Xbox one"
4317,2,So disappointed it hurts..,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens sees young Rey (Ridley) meeting former stormtrooper Finn (Boyega), they find the Millennium Falcon and flee while pursued by the First Order. They find Han Solo (Ford) and join the Rebels in an effort to thwart the Order."
4318,1,Sad attempt (spoiler),"The Force should have gotten much more sleep before waking up, as I was in near coma be with me state due to the unfresh/stale story. It's a rehash of all other episodes prior to it, especially the original one. New story is something like a Deathstar is bigger & meaner than ever kind of thing, which must be destroyed. Done it & seen it. Scavanger Rey is the new gal that tracks Luke. I have a nagging suspicion that she is really Luke's long lost daughter. (I can almost hear 'Len I am ur father' line coming up. She has follows near same sand dog that meets the resistance, blows up Deathplanet and be the force. General Reia looks & talks like a grandmother across the street, who will bake u cookies & give you milk. If Po character sounds like the Kungfu Panda, then you got his character. Kylo Ren, a Darth Vader wanna be but he really becomes just a joke near the end. This movie was could have been improved by Ewoks & Jaja Binks as the Jedi masters (I am being really cynical!). Where is the deep spiritual & the cultural values exchanged? God, gods, faith, etc...? Someone painted over the Van Gogh with a Micky Mouse. Excitement & dare is replaced with placid unoffensive utter blandness. Even the very first scene looks like Ninja turtle, and the last scene is like Donkey Kong saves princess (actually other way around). Luke pls stop going to gym & dinner parties afterward with Jabba the hutt."
4319,1,A weak attempt to reboot Star Wars,Its definitely not the best star wars movie ever. So i don't really get the rating.
4320,1,"The Force might be Awakened, but puts the Audiences to Sleep!","Attention, spoilers!"
4321,4,mediocre movie,"While I didn't have high hopes I expected, at least, a new story. Only found utterly weak dialogues, bad script, awful camera-work (actual twitching, jittery camera movement), uninteresting photography, pretty bad score, and a forgettable, copy.pasted plot. The ""villain"" isn't that much of a villain, while the ""good"" characters are pretty good at doing their stuff. So you're left with a universe without a real threat. It's not an awful movie, it's pretty, but that's it's only grace. Right off the start the scenes are not properly cut and edited for proper effect, looking pretty amateur. Lots of homages to the first trilogy end up mimicking the worst parts of it. Oh, and we have a new Disney princess. That's not actually a princess, but oh well, she sure looks and feels like one!"
4322,1,The weakest villain in the history of cinema,"First off, I really want to say that I liked this movie. It's Star Wars, what's not to like? However, after sitting through 2 hours and 16 minutes of a ""new"" Star Wars film, I was disappointed with the originality of it. Or should I say, the lack of originality."
4323,4,"Weak, reiterative entry","If you hope this is going to be like the first 3 SW movies, just don't. I liked the movie, is fun to watch because it has excellent special effects, action and some drama. But it doesn't have that Star Wars feel, where everything looks kind of serious/important. It's more like that movies that we see, we like... and we forget on the very next day."
4324,4,The force needs to go back to sleep,I went to see the original version of Star Wars VII with my son last night. We both were very disappointed: 
4325,5,It's fun to watch like a Sunday movie on TV,"This movie is a remake of ""Plan 9 From Outerspace"" ! Seriously, people literally died and they had to make up stuff and fill stuff in. If you've seen Plan 9 then you know exactly how this movie ends, horribly! More questions than answers. No closure is offered! Save your money."
4326,1,"Simply: save you money, do not go to see this film.","SPOILERS The bad: 1. Formulaic: Abrams took familiar characters/plots/and scenes and repurposed them into a new Star Wars TM product. (and another Death Star, really?) 2. Feminist Vapidism: The new female lead is perplexingly better than every male in the film, whether it's teaching herself the force (Luke took 2 movies worth of training), beating a Sith Lord in a light saber battle on her first day as a Jedi, being a better star pilot than Han Solo, or more knowledgeable engineer than Chewbacca; all skills that she somehow acquired as a scavenger on the desert planet Tatooine? Huh? 3. Civilization is Blown Up, No One Cares: the new ""First Order"" starkiller blows up no less than 5 planets representing the Republic (apparently they learned nothing from Alderan), and the characters barely care. Meanwhile, the Republic doesn't have an army? 4. Nothing says originality like the Nazis: the ""First Order"" is based on the Nazis. Yawn."
4327,1,Plan 9 remake,"This is unimpressive. Most unimpressive. Scraping the bottom of the barrel. There was so much the director, writer and studio could do because there is a wealth of good material out there in Disney fiction, books and comics, but because they wanted to insert a Disney princess who is a Mary Sue they couldn't do that so instead we get this. Why remake a film that you know you cannot match and is readily available on DVD??"
4328,5,"Surprisingly Bad, but Fun","To anyone who loves the original trilogy, think very hard before you watch this film, do you want to watch a rehash of 4 with bits of 5 & 6's story line thrown in for good measure? There are only 3 good films in the saga, this isn't one."
4329,2,Hollywood Needs To Get A Grip,I felt good about this movie up until the last fourth. That's when it turned out to be repetitive and ridiculous. 
4330,5,A poor rehash of the original trilogy,"The only reason I gave it a 2 is because I liked the very first Star Wars and this was the same movie only just a little more grandiose. I will see a movie and suspend belief to a certain point but every minute I had to believe someone running around a corner could be miles away in a second. If a village gets attacked by several ships and dozens of storm troopers, then after planning at the highest level to find the most important droid in the universe, should deserve more than two troopers landing in a town. Of all the star ships in the universe to grab the millennium falcon out of thin space after out running the empire, it is the one with Hans Solo and Chewwy on it and of course the people were on the falcon to begin with somehow. On and on and on every minute. I was furious and even though the ending is obviously a cliff hanger to get you to see the next one there is no way even the force could make me go again. Go see The Martian or Spectre."
4331,3,Repetitive & ridiculous,"All cashing in, no soul."
4332,2,Went because of J.J. Abrams,I started watching the sequel trilogy again so I could go watch rise of Skywalker with good knowledge of the story. So onto my thoughts about the movie.
4333,1,I Rather Watch the Dotard's home video boinking Ivanka than this,"This was a remake of Star Wars 4. Another Death Star, another person from a deserted planet, becoming a Jedi. Plot: Droid has a secret map. It escapes to a desert-planet where the hero finds it by chance. Another Death Star. The villain wants to look like and speak like Darth Vader. But he has no physical problem! Lame talk between Han Solo and his son. Lack of drama development. No depth of story, character and no message to the everyday person. The First Order is not scary. Stromtroopers look like Donald Duck. Captain Phasma is not scary nor interesting. I feel cheated by seeing once again by another Death Star blown up by a few detonators. And no excitement. Ahh...what an opportunity wasted. I used to be hard core STar Wars fan. I wanted to learn more about the Force. I wanted to relate to it. I can't/ Hollywood took my money and two hours of my life. Star Wars 4-6 is ow on the shelf as a nice memory. The rest is sheer disappointment. Too bad for Daisy Ridley, she deserves 10/10 but no acting can make it up for lack of a story or lack of message and depth."
4334,4,Revisited the movie for Rise of Skywalker,"So we have a Mary Sue with zero training who can hold her own in light saber combat, a ""villain"" who is nothing more than a petulant teenager, another hollow shell of a ""villain"" who looks like a giant Gollum, and no lore or much of a story at all. The ""first order""? Where did they spring up from? Did everyone in the New Republic fall asleep immediately after the second death star was destroyed? And can't anyone think of anything else besides yet another death star?"
4335,3,"Warning: has spoiler. Delete the movie, all of it and try it once again. Please!","After waiting many years before seeing a sequel to the Star Wars episode VI, I was very disappointed."
4336,3,Better than no Star Wars at all?,"Started watching it because well its been out a few years and I haven't seen it, half way through I realize I have seen it, but surely I was interrupted before finish, right? And when I get to the end I must admit I have seen all of it before, it was just so utterly unmemorable I completely forgot about it. ""Force Awakens"" is a sad, sad attempt at recreating ""A New Hope"", Disney must have figured they can just take the New Hope storyline change some characters, throw out all the meat and hey presto, a new episode. Prequel trilogy will live in infamy for daring to break from the model of original trilogy, but episodes 7 and probably 8 and 9 will just be forgotten in trashbox of movie history with all the other crap."
4337,4,What a disappointment,"This movie is a re-make of the original Star Wars (Episode IV). Minor differences, yet the plot and story line remains EXACTLY the same. Droid with secret information ends up on desert planet where young character finds it. Young character escapes planet with droid to be guided by a higher wisdom to embrace the force, oh and be given the ""family light saber"", just before embarking on a dangerous mission to destroy a Death Star. How seriously did Disney and Abrams take this? I mean, I really want to know exactly what kind of arrogance takes the script from 40 years ago, and re-types it with some new character names, and then audaciously claims its a ""new movie."" I cannot express my very deep sorrow for what just happened."
4338,1,"How come i've never seen this before, oh wait...","I'll try to be honest and plain. I really like how this movie is directed,visuals are stunning,music score is joy for ears,the cast is fantastic. Two new characters are very charismatic young people who blended perfectly into SW saga and generally the whole movie has that SW atmosphere. This is where I stop praising the movie and look upon where it fails. In few occasions I almost went out of the movie theater. The movie is set 30 years after the events in episode VI. We all wanted to know what happened next and this is why I hated the scenario. We find out that from the remnants of the empire a new force has risen and its called ""First Order"".We also find out that there is a New Republic and also a gang of freedom fighters - The Resistance. The Rebels in episode IV were fighting against the Empire so that a New Republic could be founded and democracy restored. Why does the Resistance exists if there is already a New Republic? And why New Republic is not helping the Resistance? Not a single ship or a soldier is sent to help in their fight against New Order. By the way,the Resistance is trying to destroy New Order's new weapon:you can surely guess that it is a new Death Star,only this time it is three times larger and it sucks energy from a star and later fires that energy into guided projectiles which can destroy entire planets?!? And what is also familiar? The Resistance must first destroy its shields and then attack with a dozen of X- wings,fly through a narrow space,and then destroy it?!? Also nothing is said about who has the upper hand in this war? Who is holding Corrusant? What area of galaxy is under control of New Republic and what area is controlled by New Order? What happened to the Jedi? Is Luke still the only surviving Jedi? I imagined that this movie would be about a Luke's efforts to restore Jedi order. Instead,Luke is gone to some place which he chose to be his exile. On the other side of the force we have Supreme Leader Snoke in a role similar to Emperor Palpatine and Kylo Ren,a Han and Leia's son who turned to the dark side. Are they following the teachings of the Sith or are they simply dark side users? Nothing is explained in the movie. In fact,the whole movie is deprived of terms such as Jedi,Sith,Force etc.My biggest disappointment is that at the end of the movie,Fynn(former storm trooper)who takes a light saber for the first time in his life fights a fully trained and very powerful Kylo Ren like Obi Wan or Mace Windu would do.Still,Kylo somehow defeats Fynn,but is then confronted with Rey,who just found out about a existence of the Force and had no training,in a light saber duel in which she has the upper hand and also manages to out power Kylo in the force?!? I cannot describe how disappointed I was because of the things like this. I hope that the Force will eventually awake,but we will have to wait for the next episode for that. Please,for everybody's sake,you have two more shots to make things right. Use them wisely."
4339,2,You have got to be kidding me!,"Most of the movie seemed almost to follow episode IV point for point. Much like the new Jurassic World did to Jurassic Park. Sure there were a few different twists but in both of them the wise mentor dies. The killing of the mentor in this movie however kills any chance of writing movies about any of the book series because that character is central in almost all of them. Plus the name of Han and Leia's son in the movie is the name of Luke and Mara's kid in the books. Han and Leia's son who goes bad in the books must make sacrifices, which the son in the movie does as well. But that is as close to the books as it gets. the new Luke discovering their twin by ""accident"" happens much sooner than Luke discovered Leia in the original series."
4340,4,The force is still asleep,"As I was born in mid-90s, the first movie from Star Wars franchise I've seen was ""Phantom Menace"". Alright, it wasn't the best film, but still I quite enjoyed it: space, cool cg, amazing lightsaber fight, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. Then I watched 2 and 3 movies and my reactions was: ""Um... what?"". Seriously, nobody can say that prequels were great. "
4341,3,Reminded me too much of Lukes journey in the original star wars (There are spoilers),"Once upon a time there was the force: an ideal notion of goodness, hope and integrity in the galaxy. Now it is a tool for an untrained shorthaired angry chick with a chip on her shoulders to somehow destroy death stars."
4342,5,Deja vu,I first saw Star Wars when I was 12 in early 1990 in Germany. For a Soviet schoolboy it was something incredible. It was a world you instantly fall in love with. And this feeling has stayed with me over all these years. And in 1999-2005 the universe of the movie obtained the proper detailing the original Trilogy lacked due to technological constraints. We may dispute about artistic merits and demerits of the second Trilogy but it was undoubtedly made with love. And it was basically met with love.
4343,1,Ironic title for this film given how it subverts the force,"As a woman I am embarrassed that every time they want to insert a woman hero into a movie it has to be so forced and so bogus. It's like we cannot have a woman who can act, can look good or be evolved. The acting in this movie is terrible and amateurish, but actually looks good compared to the greedy slithering money hunger of JJ Abrams and Disney. This would be the worst movie of the decade if someone had not already produced Noah and Ghostbusters 2016."
4344,1,If you are a fan just keep out of this!,"Too bad, nothing like the original series.<br /><br />imdb rating is paid."
4345,2,Two Hours Of My Life I Shall Not Get Back,OMG they killed Han! They lost me..i have to watch Empire Strikes back to even recuperate from this movie! 
4346,1,why why why,This film has a lot of good things: 
4347,1,Warning Spoilers! Don't waste your money going to the theaters to watch this!,"Okay, it has the touchstones of Luke and Chewbacca, the Falcon, a few glimpses of Leia, but the story is a rehash of every trope that this franchise has covered multiple times before; nothing fresh. And the sets? That red room battle? I was waiting for Nanette Fabray to wheel out in a wagon singing ""Louisiana Hoedown""."
4348,5,One trick pony wars,"Just another rehash movie. Abrams has yet to come up with an original idea. I gave this a 4 only because of the special effects people. Jar Jar Abrams has ruined every thing he touches. Star Wars, Star Trek. I'm sick of light flares and characters, aside from the original cast, I just don't care for. Even the original cast seemed to have been brought on simply to sell tickets."
4349,3,Set pieces designed by Vincente Minnelli,"The movie is a partial success, as the true lovers of the Star Wars saga were disappointed, while made an incredible amount of applause from crowds. Cons: Personally, I was greatly disoriented with the film, as I expected a true continuance of the great story, with its remarkable atmosphere and its soul, that I could not find in the new work. There were a lot of ridiculous moments that made me ironically laugh while shedding tears saying goodbye to the real Star Wars. The first part of the movie, I reckon, was majorly OK, though I just wanted to get out of the theater when I saw the main antagonists face (I do not want to show disrespect or offend anybody anyhow), the dark side couldn't choose somebody more convincing? Then again, their general seems to be a teenager with no authority. They didn't make me afraid of them, more likely they made me sorry for them. How was Ray supposed to beat a trained sith lord not even wielding a lightsaber before that, I mean, EVER, not saying anything about Finn, who managed to give Kylo Ren an injury? The lightsaber of Ren was violated into something terrible. The new ""Emperor"" - no comment, absolutely. The plot is weak. A new death star weapon? Well, just a bit more bigger. What can we expect in the 8th episode? A new super-mega- weapon that will be even bigger than the last one? In terms of the plot, excluding the first half, The VII is a copy of the previous classics. There are a lot of week spots in the storyline, great many of them, too much to speak of, making the movie a violation of the original series. What about the pros of the film? Wonderful graphics, interesting scenery and great effects. My favorite part of the movie, though the movie not being a favorite, is the scene where a star destroyer buried in sand is shown full-scale. That is probably the only positive experience i can extract from a vast majority of cons. General resume - week plot, good effects, ridiculous characters, a death of one of the main heroes of time in vain, and 2 more episodes. Star Wars fans revolt!"
4350,4,Stupid and Lazy!,"I won't see the next two SW movies. This one was a galloping disappointment that had me squirming with boredom. With very little variation, it is a scene-by-scene, plot point by plot point retelling of ""A New Hope"" and a little bit of ""Empire"". (SPOILERS????) The movie opens with the image of a Star Destroyer crossing the sky. A masked villain at the head of an army of storm troopers is looking for a messenger. The messenger is caught, but the message is hidden in a droid which lands on a desert planet. It is found by a poor hero, who rescues it from a small, unintelligible scavenger. Meanwhile, the messenger is rescued from the enemy ship by an unexpected party. The unexpected party and the hero meet and escape on the Millennium Falcon after having a shootout against tie fighters. They meet Han and Chewie. Han is confronted by bounty hunters to whom he owes money. They have to blast their way out. Han, the Mentor, introduces the Hero to the ways of the Force. The masked villain seeks counsel from his dark master. The heroes join the rebellion. Their immediate threat is from a spherical doomsday device which can destroy entire planets, but it has a single weakness which can be used to blow it up. There is a ticking clock as the doomsday weapon has to charge from the sun. Han, the hero's mentor figure, is slain by the masked villain while the hero looks on. Han, like Obi Wan, is also the former mentor of the masked figure. The hero has an inconclusive fight with the masked villain, and is then sent on a quest to find the only living Jedi master, Luke/Yoda. Ho hum. It was also insulting how easily the female protagonist taps into the Force. She stands her ground against the masked villain in a light-saber fight even though she has never touched one. She also uses the Jedi mind-control trick successfully the very first time she attempts it. But that's to be expected since girls have to be superior to boys in every way in Hollywood films. The three prequels were ALL superior to this one. At least they were original. Watching this felt like George Lucas and J. J. Abrams mooning us and flipping us off shouting, ""Lap it up, you drooling dogs! We know you'll watch anything with the Star Wars name on it!"" This movie wasn't produced. It was excreted!"
4351,5,Losing Star Wars soul,"It's that stormtrooper that shouts ""Traitor!!"", challenges Finn with his bat and knocks him down only to sadly die to the Bowcaster."
4352,2,Seen in all before,"This movie is one of the most hyped movies in the cinema history. But why? Because of this marketing policy ""Nostalgia"". This movie should have told the story of Luke, Leia and Han but instead Disney used them just to market these new characters. No one cares about Rey. We wanted to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia. This movie is just a remade A New Hope. Why? Because of lazy writing and nostalgia marketting. There is zero character development. Rey is just perfect at everything. She can fly the Millenium Falcon and even repair it. The ending of the movie is just so ridiculous. They introduce the character Kylo Ren as the son of two legends, Han Solo and Princess Leia, he is also trained in the ways of the force by Luke Skywalker and then the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke. But somehow Rey who is just a force sensetive girl and she is also untrained, she haven't even held a lightsaber in her life defeats Kylo Ren. Where is the logic? Even the chosen one Anakin Skywalker had to be trained to become a jedi. Whatever at least the film had these mystery boxes for us to be hyped for the upcoming movie."
4353,2,"Complete Garbage,","Creating movie like Star Wars is a hard job. With the huge collections like Star Wars its harder. But it wasn't even successful as separate movie. There isn't a real plot. I said myself rapidly its happens because darks side powerful and force help them to keep balance. But i have to say, if all that positive coincidences going to be happen force can shape in to some monstrous form and fight itself already... "
4354,3,A Disney Lie: Nostalgia,"JJ, Put down the Planet Killing Planet and step away from the tired, old, over used, broken plot line!"
4355,1,"If we decide we like 4,5,6 did you consider didn't shoot 8,9 ?",I saw this flick days ago and it's taken me a while to write the review because I had to work out how I really felt the Force Awakens. Now I know.
4356,5,"JJ, put down the Planet Killing Planet...","SPOILER ALERT !! Other people already Explained how this is a star wars 4 in reality, , so I will not repeat their review , here is my comment and expectations :"
4357,4,"Star Wars is back, minus it's heart.","It's just a lazy rip-off of A New Hope, with boring characters and no originality, please don't waste your time."
4358,1,Totally Predictable Plot,"As someone who loves the original 70s original to this day, I was of course skeptical of the reboot. I am happy to be right and then some."
4359,1,This movie is awful,Star Wars has always been something that I have enjoyed but seems like its not actually as great as everyone says it is. Episode VII definitely confirmed this for me and reinforced the fact that this whole franchise could be way better. The originals are obviously awesome and the foundation blocks. But every movie following proceeds to tear it all down rather than take it further than before.
4360,1,Why don't you just burn your cash at home?? It is faster and you even save money on gas money not driving to the cinema,"Im a Star Wars fan that has watched the classics since I was a kid and still enjoy watching the same old films over a 1000 times (not the prequels). So I know its DNA, and consider myself as a Star Wars Forensic Fan."
4361,5,A missed opportunity!,It looked nice but this movie will bore your socks off if you're not a hardcore Star Wars fan who went to the 3am screening on release day.
4362,3,Ruined a Classic Myth! Instead a sad attempt and a great wannabe!,"I was 11 when episode 4 came out. I rate the movies from best to worst IV, V, III, VI, I, II. Where does this one fit in? Id say maybe better than episode I. The whole time is just to set up the characters for a hopefully better episode 8. There is not much meat on the bone, but enough to give hope. What it needs is development of a theme - there is a fantastic father/son/good/evil vibe about the first movies which George Lucas invented (by cobbling together bits from other movies he'd experienced), and something further needs to be developed and not just rehashed with slight twists on the theme. There needs to be real character arcs and genuine thematic progression. "
4363,1,Boring rehash,"* Review contains minor spoilers * There are many things wrong with this movie. I was really surprised to see this movie had such a high rating on IMDb but on the other hand, if you see the reviews marked as ""best"" you will only find bad reviews (which probably means something)."
4364,4,Hopefully 8 will be better,"The Force Awakens was a long time coming, at least in terms of having a post Return of the Jedi film which millions of fans were wanting in the 1990's but then got the prequels instead. While I don't hate the prequels and like having Anakin's journey to become Darth Vader, I always wanted to see Luke in his prime which is why I was pumped when ep 7: The Force Awakens was announced."
4365,5,As bad as Phantom Manace,It's just a rehash of Star Wars IV with lame modern troupes
4366,3,Washes Away What Came Before It,"My uncle asked me what I though of this movie a week after I had seen it. Not wanting to spoil the movie, though I was eager to get into detail, and in order not to influence his opinion too strongly before he saw it, I said it felt like ""Harry Potter in space."" Now, depending on one's opinion of the Harry Potter films, this comment could either be praise or criticism. I don't particularly like the Harry Potter films, so it's criticism from me, but he didn't know that and my comment was neutral. "
4367,4,This movie is lame,"Forgettable story,forgettable characters,forgettable scenes,this movie is a total waste to society. Don't waste your time"
4368,5,"Derivative, 2010s young adult movie with the trappings of a Star Wars film",Spoilers
4369,1,Is the writer of this abomination a Sith lord,"Wanted to watch this again before (maybe seeing) the last jedi.<br /><br />Regarding this film: it is as if the Whole Star Wars saga never happened. <br /><br />Same plots, same basic roles, and a few new bad guys (one a very emotional and out of control main character, think Anakin on a very bad day)<br /><br />Another, larger Death Star. <br /><br />And no one in the Entire universe seems the least bit worried about the New Order building a planet size death star aimed right at them, or it consuming a sun.<br /><br />Really??? The old one blew up Alderan and had hyperspace abilities. But nope, only ""a handful of rebels"" are worried. The rest of the galaxy just sits facing down the barrel of a huge gun, apparently surprised at their own deaths. <br /><br />The New Order is the Empire, which of course is not very bright either. <br /><br />Solo is back to smuggling and lost track of the only thing he seems to value more then Chewy. <br /><br />Again, as if none of the previous movies ever happened, from Death Stars to overcoming the Empire, to Luke himself (who apparently has locked himself away).<br /><br />And the new heroine, Rey, wow. Not sure what she is, but she is a woman who can do absolutely everything and anything, mechanical, Force based, saber fighting. <br /><br />Of course, how she does this all is a huge question a she seems to be a scavenger on a lonely, dusty planet. No training, education, just surviving. But she know it all. <br /><br />As for Jedi and training, she does not need any of it. Perhaps she is ""all force""."
4370,4,Bitterly disappointing,"This movie introduces an extremely OP character who can do anything and beat anyone like kylo who was trained by someone<br /><br />who is meant to be the greatest jedi to ever live (Luke) without being taught it resulting in every: jedi, sith, force, pilot, engineer, marksman, ever in star wars being useless as they all learned and trained in their fields. The Sith and Empire masked as ""the first order"" come back and the new republic fails after only 30 years rendering Luke, Anakin, Leia, Han, Lando and the rest of the true rebel alliances struggles irrelevant. Luke, Han, Leia and Chewbacca dont get a reunion"
4371,5,In a universe where the previous movies never happened...,"There was very little new that you haven't seen before. The main characters running around a lot - a lot of the same old sky battles. I did appreciate Harrison Ford. I did not appreciate how unattractive they made Carrie Fisher look. The new stars were okay. JJ Abrams has ruined the Star Trek franchise making the previously noble characters and story lines silly and immature. He did okay with the Star Wars franchise because its intent is for a younger audience. I don't understand all the excitement over this. I actually struggled to stay awake at times, but I watched it in our newly refurbished local AMC Theatre with those fully reclining seats. To each his own."
4372,1,Trash,The Han Solo character arc made no sense. Totally lame. He was growing as a character. all they did was bring him back to his old self like some very sad midlife crisis gone terribly wrong. 
4373,5,"It was okay, but that's all...","Everyone notices that it is a copy of the previous, and as a human I personally do care, the presentation of a Mary Sue as the love interest is a joke, in addition to Finn a joke character who looks nothing like his original and cannot shoot and is even unaware how an empire aircraft works and I want to know nothing else of him. The emo Keylo is hormonal ... I dislike it because it is a middle finger to all of us who expected a great villain opting for one who clones Darth Vader and lives in his shadow and we are presented a mediocre villain almost reminds me of what any Disney preteen film in this remake."
4374,5,"Not bad, not good","Same stuff once again. Also, kills off one of the best characters in the franchise like nothing. Full of annoying new characters. Also, Rey is powerful out of nowhere while others had to train to become powerful."
4375,1,Bad,Characters & Cast: 8/10.
4376,1,Abysmal.,Go watch A New Hope instead it's basically the same movie.
4377,4,Wouldn't it be better to try again with a new Ep7 - same cast new story? You'd sell more tickets that way.,"List ten things you remember about Episode IV. At least nine of them are in Episode VII, but done here with far less depth and energy. So of course anyone who has seen the original will be disappointed by this movie, but even judged alone on its own merits, The Force Awakens is a poor effort. The visual effects are the only element done with any degree of competence, but when the plot is predictable and unbelievable (even relative to science fiction in general) and the characters are one-dimensional caricatures with little to no arc, good visuals aren't enough to make a movie worth watching. And finally, the closing set-up for Episode VIII flushes any and all vitality that was present, down the drain (another way in which this remake falls short of the original)."
4378,1,Horrible and unoriginal,Star Wars Episode 7 The Force Awakens this one was a bit boring I really did not enjoy it the acting was ok the story was awful some of the action was good.
4379,5,shallow and boring remake of Episode IV,**Could possible contain spoilers - going to try to be careful** 
4380,4,Every generation has a story,"Star Wars: The Farce Awakens is easily the worst movie of the ""franchise"". It fits in just below Ishtar and Battlefield Earth, and it is definitely worse than any of the other films of this century. The acting is is lame (unlike the originals), and it offers a stupid mix of gags and Mary Sue acting. This film is bereft of merit, and does not continue the story in a compelling way. It reboots it and clones it very badly (Mr Rip Off Abrams at work) that feels like a offensive continuation of the saga. I would happily fast for a month for Disney to stop feeding us this vomit inclusive of its ugly and angry Disney Princess. Someone give Jar Jar Rip off Abrams a job he is good at (car wash?)."
4381,5,The Force Awakened - And I Did Not,"The anticipation in the years leading up to the 2015 release of the Force Awakens was something else. The original cast was to return, John Williams would do the score, new welcome additions to the cast like Max von Sydow and Oscar Isaac, JJ Abrams to direct, whose previous Star Trek films may have been bad Star Trek films but amazingly entertaining Space Adventure films in the vein of the original Star Wars. A return back to the roots after the mixed reception of the Prequel trilogy who many felt eschewed emotional connections in favor of too clean-looking Special Effects."
4382,1,"Easily the worst movie of the ""franchise""*",This will be a spoiler-free review regarding anything not in the trailers or posters!!!
4383,5,a misfire from the getgo,"Very, very well put together movie...oh, apart from the excruciating laziness of the plot. Luke trains Jedis and one goes bad! Shock. Death star/planet thing which travels the universe with it's own atmosphere! Han brings down the shield generators. Leia is woeful, and woefully underused. You can't give away the plot because the whole thing has been done a few times.....by Star Wars!!!!"
4384,5,No Originality (Sans one plot point),"It also doesn't acknowledge any of the prequels, and the story line is literally A New Hope."
4385,4,"In a cinema far, far away I watched recycled Star Wars",No creativity. Doesn't push the story of Star Wars forward. Just copies previous movies for a cash in. A waste of time
4386,3,rehash of A New Hope,"(spoiler alert!!!!!!!!) if you expect this movie to be something new to star wars be ready to have a horrible night because all this movie was to me was a re-hash of episode 1 and 4 sad orphan child lives in the desert and suddenly they are thrown into some major conflict oh wow the one person they she looks up to dies what a shocker (obi one, and Qui Gon) oh and guess what they have to go on a journey to find a master of the force like Luke did in the old movies a giant death star.... that they just call the weapon.... somehow can drain a sun without a black hole appearing just cause oh one other thing get ready to watch the darth vader wanna be throw a lot of temper tantrums because that seems to happen a lot in this movie.... if I had never seen a starwars movie in my life I'd like this but I've seen the old ones and this is just a great disappointment"
4387,1,Just a cash in,"This is the beginning installment in Disney Corporation trolling Star Wars fans, stealing from the deluded and pickpocketing the weak-minded."
4388,1,i love star wars but.....,This film takes the Star Wars saga and just throws it out the window. And a worse movie is The Force Awakens. It gets one star. And worse than both of these films are the three prequels. They are the absolute worst Star Wars films ever made.
4389,1,Disney Begins.... Trolling Star Wars' Fans,Start wars The Force Awakens
4390,2,A mediocre movie.,"I watched this film a day after all of my friends who were extremely happy with what they saw. I was not over-hyped but after hearing my friends' opinions and being told that the film had high scores on both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb I confess that I was expecting something good. Unfortunately I did not get a good movie, instead I got a poor remake of episode IV."
4391,2,Star wars gone bad,"Suffering from the beginning to the end, the story is full of Disney's stupid jokes we all know, they reused all elements that made the first trilogy a legend and they failed terribly. When I saw the movie an image came to my mind, the one of George Lucas f***ing a storm trooper in a SouthPark episode, now is Disney's turn and the are doing it well. After the first 10 minutes I was asking myself 'when is this garbage going to end?'. If the producers wanted to screw this new trilogy, they should have contract Michael Bay as a director, at least he knows how to make 'big explosions'. Disney's attitude is like the politicians on campaign, they promise a lot of good things and they lie without shame but they get what they want; the money. Master Yoda must be cursing from his grave. May the force be with us in this time of darkness."
4392,5,"Bad film, poor remake of episode IV","Summary: If you are truly a Star Wars fan and you have seen the other Greatest 6 movies of the millennia (and not just someone following the hype who's seen the newest one as the only one ever seen before) then how can you not say that The Force Awakens was absolute utter spoonfuls of Bullshit. I admit at the beginning I was skeptical but I thought to myself that there's is no possible way that this movie could be bad because after all who would want to ruin Star Wars!? JJ Abrams has done exactly that. He took something that could be absolutely amazing and missed every single opportunity to make a great film. As I hung in there through the movie hoping it would somehow surprise me and give me that on edge childhood excitement, it did exactly the opposite and began to bore me to death after seeing basically nothing original. Acting was dull, plot holes everywhere, if I had to describe what I saw at the end of the movie it was like a child had watched the original Star Wars movies and decided to attempt to draw the entire movie in crayola crayons. With that said I now say the only disturbance in the force I feel today is this movie."
4393,1,This movie is the same Disney's garbage that we are all used to,"First and foremost, the film was more of a reboot then a sequel. There was absolutely no new ideas added that we have not seen in previous movies. The whole plot line was literally a copy and paste of episode IV except far worse. Furthermore there was no character development for any one in the movie. Fans had to rely on previous attachments to characters like Han Solo and Princes Leia. Also can someone explain to me how Mark Hamill is part of the top billed cast when he was in one scene of the movie and didn't say a single line the whole time. Further more there was no value in any of the battles including the final battle due to the complete lack of build in any character or any elaboration on the dire straits. 3/4th's of the movie was exposition but Abrams decided to spend a total of ten seconds to hatch a complete full scale plan against the new order. Further more why did they even need fin to give them any information about the star destroyer when everyone around him seemed to know more about it than him."
4394,1,Why all the Hype,Hot off the news bulletin board:
4395,3,Jar Jar Abrams - Kills off any character that adds to the plot at all,"The Force Awakens is the latest victim of what I call Nostalgia baiting. Other movies of same genre are Star Trek Into Darkness, Terminator Genesis, Spectre, etc. It's a rushed poorly constructed movie filled with iconography from the past to make you forget about how bad it is. "
4396,2,STOP PRESSES!!! STOP PRESSES!!!,"The cheap knockoff in this case is A New Hope. Looking back, there are many similarities to the prequels compared to the sequels. Both started off with a movie many consider the best in both series - The Phantom Menace/A New Hope. Both have a middle film many consider to be the worst in both series - Attack of the Clones/The Last Jedi. However, the main difference between the sequels and prequels is that at least George Lucas tried to do something different. Yes, the prequels are a failure. Yes, the CGI has not aged well and the acting is very wooden. But I can respect his vision and what he was trying to accomplish. By comparison, the sequels are pure Disney garbage, with zero redeemable qualities and a movie (Rise of Skywalker) which is the worst thing ever made."
4397,4,A complete waste,"There are countless novels, comic books, and video games that all describe and collaborate on the future of the Star Wars universe after Return of the Jedi. J.J. Abrams and Disney said ""screw them"" and tossed them all out of the window. As a 20 year old who grew up reading these and playing the games, whose childhood revolved around re-watching the films, reading the books, and playing the games; it is extremely frustrating to watch this movie and watch your childhood become invalidated and essentially told that none of that really happened."
4398,1,JJ Abram's Cheap Knockoff Of A Better Movie,"I believe that I was a bit disappointed of this new follow up of Star Wars, not because it's that bad, compared to the latest (I, II, III), but because of the great response to the movie especially in here (imdb.com), which I'm using quite a lot, before choosing which movies to see in the cinema."
4399,3,"Good as a movie, bad as a part of Star Wars","OK, here is the deal. I am kind of tired of seeing all these biased reviews in IMDb only consisting of 10/10 or 1/10 ratings so it's my time to give it a go. Having said that, I try to be as objective as I can, yet I am not. Because I- like many others- am a big Star Wars fan (IV-VI)."
4400,5,A little bit of a small disappointment,-THIS WAS HARRISON FORD'S MOVIE AND NO ONE ELSE'S 
4401,5,Not quite there...,"Spoilers x 100 There are just so many things that I didn't like about this movie. Maybe I am wrong, I would just ask the questions and let you to decide: 1. Why is Poe making a stupid joke after witnessing the dead of a friend/ally? In one moment he is mad about it and gets captured because of it and just seconds later he is like uncle Charlie... 2. How Poe was planning to find the droid in the desert ? 3. Why Poe, Finn and Rey act like besties, hugging and all that love? Every scene between them seems forced!!! 4. Why every major character needs to have a short name - Hann, Luke, Leia, Kylo, Ray, Poe .... 5. How Finn has never before shown signs of insubordination and yet this is his first mission? 6. Where did the blood from the stormtrooper came? He is wearing a full armor and blaster shots should close the wound immediately. 7. How Finn being an unimportant stormtrooper knows so much about the First order. 8. Why is Rey laughing here ass of when first speaks to Finn. 9. How convenient is that: the secret meeting is at the same planet as Rey, the droid finds here, Finn crashes just near enough to find here, Hann and Chewie find them just after leaving the planet and so on and so on...... 10. To be a good sword fighter you need years of practice. Why Finn and Rey can suddenly challenge Kylo in a fight? What are the chances that untrained subject won't cut his arm with a lightsaber? 11. Why stormtroopers can't shoot anyone after years of training and yet Rey is killing tons of them never shooting before? 12. Why is Luke leaving a map about his whereabouts if he goes into hiding? The whole plot is centered around this stupid idea!!! 13. Why this movie is such a cheap 100% copy of New Hope? The resistance, the father-son thing, the droid with secret information, the young protagonist."
4402,5,Why It Didn't Quite Work For Me,"Complete garbage. J. J. Abrams has created cancer incarnate. Kathleen Kennedy helped him. She is cancer in its physical form. Together they killed more people than any virus ever could. Laughably bad acting, cinematography, sets, lighting, and just about everything else. The only good part was John Williams' score, and even that is lackluster as he had nothing to inspire him."
4403,1,I want to cry really bad,"Disney got rid of almost all the rich lore surrounding the Star Wars universe by removing all the books, games and comics from canon. Worst of all, they did us old fans dirty by erasing the stories of the main characters after movie 6."
4404,1,Terrible Garbage,"***Again, there is possible a spoiler in here. I was trying to be as vague as I could. So in case there are spoilers, I apologize.***"
4405,1,"Insult to old Star Wars fans; weakened the personality, abilities and legacy of Luke Skywalker; erased excellent stories from canon",This episode is basically the same as IV. It's A New Hope re-hashed from the viewpoint of some triggered leftist liberal who changed minor details in order to to cater to the mob.
4406,1,Character line/history was not followed. (Possibly has a spoiler. But I tried to keep it as vague as I could).,"I will always use the first, (or is it the fourth) Star Wars as a reference point. It was a long, long time ago, on a screen far, far away...(like them three dots over to the left?). Eh, not like that hasn't been done before...kind of like this movie's story (remake - yes). Anyways, I digress. Way back then, PC was just making itself known, embraced by studios as a much needed guide, and not yet adopted as lock-step enforcement-rules, backed by intimidation tactics. Without all those present-day crippling eggshells, freedom in filmmaking was still possible in Hollyweird. This movie earns PC kudos in its following of this convention and successfully re-launching the original - earning lots of money and 'feel-good' points. I do have a quandary though (Spoiler Alert - Spoiler Alert) - why weren't all the old characters eliminated and replaced with PC replacements? That would be the right thing to do...right? It doesn't matter anyways since today's special effects always crashes it's way to center-stage, easily overwhelming poor acting, weak story lines and horrible scripts. On that same line, normally I would relentlessly criticize CGI-saturation (because it squashes good acting as well) - but the way this movie was headed...it was in dire need of more special effects. Of course special effects departments back in the old days were heavily challenged, placing viewer interests back onto quality acting skills. Either the video trickery turned out looking fake or it was very expensive to create. That's probably one reason celluloid-products of the mid to late seventies were silly truck-driver adventures; irritating melodramas - which are really irritating now-a-days; Dirty Harry getting dirtier; forgettable Oscar winning dark (?) comedies (yes - some things never change) and, of course, porn. The very first Star Wars was the movie-entertainment's ""Beatles""...groundbreaking and fresh. Sadly this episode misses the mark. This is a good stopping point. I have no interest in anything that happens after this. That earliest of movies had little Carrie Fisher yelling at everyone. Mark Hamill being the intended hero and cowboy, Harrison Ford, ending up being the saga hero. The first 'Star Wars', the one I can watch again and again...the others...nah. ""The Force Awakens"", is a mediocre remake, at best and is way too long. This movie's original plan seemed to muddle through a thicket of knee-jerk reactions. I guess I am too ""Old School"" and I really cannot appreciate choppy stories. In my opinion, cash the huge check and put this saga to rest. I wish Mr Lucas had pumped the sequels closer together, but, I can also understand his desire to maximize his bottom line. Anyways, it's an OK movie...I would rent it if you haven't seen it yet. I know with the next two, I will watch them from my house and not bother with the over-pricing of the theater."
4407,1,"An insult to the original series (episodes IV, V, and VI)",This is just a poor copy with a short-haired girl with a a chip on her shoulders.<br /><br />Star Wars is just another 'franchise' and 'property' for Disney to sell more tickets to suckers.
4408,3,No More...Please...I am Done,"There are some fairly cool action sequences, but overall the movie pays no honor to the originals. A good percentage of the film is comprised of boring scene after boring scene, with horrendously poor acting."
4409,3,Who hires actors and actresses like that?,"This is a creepy and unfunny movie. The Mary Sue has it easy and is wonderfully (cough cough) magical. This is Hollywood at its hammy worst. The joke of a cast barely bothers to make facial expressions. Harrison Ford is game, but has nothing to work with and the robot does what it can. But mostly I spent the movie cringing at the horrible script and Jar Jar's repulsive obeying Kathleen Kennedy's orders."
4410,4,"Not Star Wars, not even close...","When the X- wings attacked Star killer, where is the Star destroyers ? Why there are no vessel to defend an ultimate weapon ? "
4411,1,Jar Jar Abrams Shows up For Yet Another Gender Switch... How Original,"I'm a huge fan of Star wars but let be honest here, this movie have basically the same scenario than episode 4."
4412,4,I have some questions.,"Well, it was OK. Not bad, but not amazing either. Definitely better than any of the prequels, but it doesn't really say much. It's good to see the series getting back to the ""roots"", with more actual sets and puppets and less green screens. The movie feels like a continuation of the original trilogy, for good and for bad. And there are lots of nods and characters from the original movie, so fanboys would have a blast."
4413,1,As close as you can be to do a remake,Someone stop Star Wars. PLEASE!! 
4414,4,Enjoyable,"The only reason this film is okay is because it ripped off another film, deliberate or not it doesn't matter, you take that pillar away and this films plummets to the ground."
4415,2,Someone stop Disney please,"First off this is my first time writing a review here, but long time lurker. The fact that JJ's take of Star Wars has forced me to go ahead and create a forum account should be your first indicator. Now normally I go see movies and either I liked them a lot and I'll come here and rate it a 10. If it was OK, a 5. And if it is complete crap a 1. Star Wars is a weak 5 and I'll tell you why."
4416,5,It's solid... but it's only because it's a rip off of the original film,the Society is too over hype with this movie.
4417,4,It's a 'meh' movie with some cool moments,"Have you heard of that concept called 'character development'? Don't expect to see it in this movie, because it isn't there. And neither is 'sense of humour', 'story plot', or 'acceptable acting'. Whoever cast Daisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn must have been drunk at the time because they are both horrendous actors. Also, does anyone know what Finn's role was during the entire movie? I don't. The only thing you can expect from this movie is that the characters will express emotions that just don't feel natural in the slightest because not at one point does the script say, ""Character is feeling emotion X because of event Y,"" - no, no, they just go: ""Character is feeling emotion X. That's the end of it. Oh look, and now Character is onto another emotion. Why? We're not telling you."" It quite literally is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen - it's like the writers just went, ""Throw some random crap together, the fans will watch any old rubbish."""
4418,1,Please don't get over hype with this one,I've never asked for my money back for any movie in my life until know!
4419,1,Catastrophically bad.,"Before starting to criticize this movie FIRST we need to criticize IMDb,Metacritic,Rottentomatoes and the critics.Disney obviously bribed them all.Even if a person doesn't know anything about Star Wars can understand that this is a bad movie.A lame copycat scenario,very bad actings with goofy scripts and too many unlogical things.But Hollywood understaned that it is easy to fool kids and ""movie ignorant"" people with fancy special effects.Besides critics need to make money and decent audiences cant pay them.No!Companies like Disney can pay them so they need to become an as*licker.This is the most important obstacle for the film art."
4420,1,Boycott the new Star Wars movie!,"It is such a quasi-cinematic cliche with its rip off script, convenient ignoring of previous episodes and standard issue 2015 gender switch that is forced."
4421,1,The Masterpiece of American Idiocracy,"I'm not a Star Wars, Star Trek or Star Search super-fan. I'm old school, and I tend to gravitate towards more complex indie films over Hollywood blockbusters. But I had to see this film because I did enjoy a few of the early SW films in the 70s and early 80s. So here's my take:"
4422,2,Anymore cliche and they would ship this film on a conveyor belt,"The pitiful king of Hollywood remakes, reboots and sequels first ripped off and cloned Spielberg, then rebooted Star Trek (and made it a brats movie) and now here rips off George Lucas."
4423,5,"Okay, but over-rated by most – Report card review with spoilers","Mostly painful to sit through - it did get a little better in the second half - but really sucks - no heart or soul like the first one. Bad character development, relies too heavily on Han Solo. Just lots of action for action sake without developing the characters. I went with a black friend and he hated how they made that black guy such a wimpy character with a low-class job. It imagines the future from the perspective of the 70's without any update to our current reality. This could have come out in the 70's and been just as bad. Problem with sequels in they don't have the original inspiration and then Hollywood tries to impose their formula bull all over it and it ends up contrived, boring and torturous."
4424,1,JJ Abrams Is Nothing Without Other People's IDeas,Awful awful rip off of the original series.
4425,3,This movie pretty much sucks,SPOILERS INCLUDED! 
4426,1,Ctrl C ctrl V... ??? PROFIT,So I was very hopefully that JJ Abrahms would do something great!
4427,2,The Force Atrocity,"As you see with many of the other reviews this movi has a poorly written plot with a cheesy nostalgic tone stolen from Episode 4. The comedy was misplaced and the Star Wars tone was completely missed. This fan boy creation was a wreck-less and careless abandonment of what makes Star Wars great with the unfortunate fact that it will still do well based on the fact that it is Star Wars. They also put a damper on the older characters.. Han Solo had way to many cheesy lines ""I like this guy"" ""I like this gun"" and Chewbacca was made to look like Han Solos less intelligent companion. "
4428,5,Decent but not Good Enough!,"There is no doubt that the movie is a disaster from any point of view . It made me feel like it's some kind of joke from the producers to destroy the love of fans for original Star Wars episodes and George Lucas . It's like JJ Abrams wanted to prove something , that he is maybe better than Lucas, otherwise I cannot explain why it's such a bad movie . Of course , for the younger generation who did not grow up with Star Wars it's hard to understand the shock most of the fans had ..."
4429,5,Made me like the prequels so much more. The Space Balls of Star Wars,"The biggest problem obviously is that it's such a similar story. While the storyline is a bit different the main ideas and plot are like exactly the same. Some random person finds out they have the force, there's a deathstar, the resistance and the evil guys are looking for an object, the object was delivered by a droid, the evil guy and the hero are related, they have to destroy this one bit of the deathstar to destroy it etc. Like sure they can make it so like history repeats itself a little bit for one movie but not this much. I feel like the deathstar was uneeded, it didn't feel like it related to the map, unlike the first movie. That's like three deathstar movies. It also makes zero sense to just make it so that the empire essentially comes back and theres another resistance, what was the point of the previous movies? I suppose having dark side vs light side is pretty central to the movies, but come up with a different way to create the conflict rather than Darth Vader vs Luke 2.0. And they also removed important parts I think, like Rey learning how to use and connect with the light side of the force, it just takes her a few seconds when she's strapped in and when she's fighting."
4430,2,A horrible bad movie that made me feel good,"I had many expectations from this movie, it has been fun.. sure. To see Han and the others back in Star Wars, great, a deeply emotion. I would say that Rey, BB-8 and Finn are excellent new characters, well."
4431,5,"Unoriginal, but an ok movie, and stop complaining about Rey being female, like what? 👀","In context of the star wars universe, this movie is absolute garbage. There are too many plot holes that easily could have been plugged with epic and memorable lore-friendly explanations. This could also have built characters in a better manner."
4432,3,Deeply disappointed,"There is a time when movies franchise sticks to the origins and moral message. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen with the Force Awaken. Let's forget that I become a die-hard fans Star Wars, Yes, even the prequels. This one doesn't bring us a consistent plot to the origins. in fact, many of actions and dialogues nakedly make me wonder if this movie ever surpasses Lucas's arts and values. When the preview came out and depicting mask of burnt lord Vader, I noticed and we all noticed that Kylo-Ren ask the Vader's guidance to continue to build a new empire from ashes. This is so confusing time since we know that lord Vader already turn back to be a Jedi again. Even Vader's spirit now is the good one. It doesn't make sense at all if someone form the Sith leagues ask for a guidance. It clearly shows the ignorance of battle between goods and evils from the movie maker. It seems that JJ Abrams pushes so hard to one step ahead lucas in terms of story-telling and depicting the movie as real as possible. He surely achieves by making the special effect better from the origins 30-35 years-ago. A film is merely an art. It should focus mainly first in a script, a story. The FX is only bonus. And the JJ's Force Awaken has violated all of it. George Lucas states ""People who alter or destroys work of art and our culture for profit as an exercise are Barbarians"" I am sorry but JJ Abrams seems to be for on the dark side now becoming the new lord of Sith and Disney is the imperial."
4433,5,The force ignored,I am sick of Disney gender switch propaganda and this film is just that plus JJ Abrams doing his usual commercial offal. I hope that one day someone will make a movie about JJ Abrams destroying the world of film and producing 'return on investment.'
4434,1,Star Wars: The Force disappointed,"That is one idiot faced villain and a true imbecile, as bad as it gets..."
4435,1,Disney propaganda,They do a better job of explaining this ogre than I could.<br /><br />Seriously. Bad. Reboot. Gender flip.
4436,2,The force is very weak with this one ...,"Honestly, I envy those people who could give 10 stars to this movie. I was raised on Star Wars, read all the books I could find, and was a big fan of the SW universe, and wanted to enjoy it as much as possible, but I just couldn't."
4437,2,Honestly just look at the keywords for this Disney film,"This is getting old. Nothing matches the quality of Episodes IV, V, and VI. My expectations are shot to heck at this point."
4438,1,"A nice movie, but didn't really feel like watching StarWars","My first review here and probably the only one, but i think i owe it to the public. First what is positive: - Great special effects and sound, no question here! - It brings back the original 3 episodes atmosphere and soundtrack, one cannot look at it without a pleasant nostalgic feeling. unfortunately that is all that is positive.. - horrible acting! sad to say but even Harrison Ford plays bad, he runs clumsy and funny, his dialogs are awkward. And still he is probably the best from them all - John Boyega is bad and Adam Driver is simply atrocious! I was quite frankly embarrassed to watch him speak and do that thing with his arm ... bad, bad, bad! The chick ""Ray"" kinda pulls it thru but at best average acting - Plot is pretty bad too - basically same as the first film, with a poorly justified goal that the main characters are trying to achieve - The so called ""Finn"", a defected storm trooper, out of nowhere becomes so good and almost defeats a Jedi with a saber, what the heck?!? - It took the whole first 2 movies for Luke to master the force and start attracting the saber, while in this one ""Ray"" manages to master it within a few days and defeats the complete Jedi master! The writing is just bad and proves my point that the movie is nothing more than a commercial money making trick, using the popularity of the first 3 movies and playing with people's nostalgia. I do not even understand why would they put Mark Hamill on the list of actors?!? his part was 10 seconds at the end with no lines at all.. Nothiong but marketing trick, again Bottom line - if one is looking to go to a crowded theater for a si-fi flick with no expectations at all, that is what one should see.."
4439,4,Tired,"I know this, among a thousand other reviews, shall simply find itself as one among plethora of negative reviews. But that wont stop me from adding my voice to how simply boring this movie was. It was truly a Chop job movie. To have more than enough boring material meshed with so little embarrassment into the old stuff everyone loves is truly an act of amazing nerve."
4440,1,"Horrible writing, bad acting, embarrassment",Just watched the movie in IMAX. It seemed like a giant repeat of the previous story already told in the Star Wars saga. The hype surrounding this movie built up so many expectations that I was surprised to see it wasn't anything unique. 
4441,1,A Wanna-Be 'Star Wars' Film,"Yes, you. The viewer. The reader. Shame on all of you."
4442,1,"Had potential to be great, but underdeveloped story destroys that.",SPOILER ALERT.
4443,3,Shame on You,"Let's do a copy of ""A New Hope"" and Star Wars fans will be so happy to see the Millenium Falcon back on the screen they'll forget about our lazy storyline and horrible new characters! HORRIBLE. Beyond bad. I love Star Wars, this is trash."
4444,3,Rehash of the original movie.,"Unfortunately, this episode did not fulfilled my expectations at all. It is just recycled movie which took some of the parts from original trilogy and have tried to combine it in a new movie 30 years later. Main villain for this part is also very inconclusive, looks more like frustrated teenager who wants to prove everyone he is bad ass at any cost, and there are some minor mistakes in the story. Too bad that after so many years they could not make a movie to be a fine successor in plot and to be memorable. Deserves 6 out of 10 not a star more and this is real, even i am a fan of this serial since i was a kid, and it hurts me more than average fan"
4445,1,Beyond Lazy,"The production value is great, sets, costumes, lighting, CG, etc. The writing, directing.... absolutely amateurishly terrible. It's basically a case of ""distract everyone from the terrible movie by giving them a spectacular light and sound show,"" and this is what you have with this movie. I wish I listened to everyone who told me not to watch it because it was so bad, but it's like driving by an terrible car accident, you can't help but turn and look even though after you look you wish you hadn't because the images are burnt into your mind for the rest of your life. This movie it plain terrible."
4446,3,Recycle movie based upon original trilogy,"I went to the cinema with an absolute open mind, after hearing/seeing all the hype around the SW7 release on the other hand seen how Abrams kind of ruined star trek. "
4447,2,What A Terrilble Terrible Terrible Movie,"Once again, the spoiler in front of us !! Yes, it's a big comeback. And maybe double pride and I think a big crash although slow. The first few minutes, the film was very entertaining, and as always, I was pulled in straight into the action, and that were something to look at. Small details, action and camera work, including visual effects are absolutely great. I love many various jokes and allusions to previous 4th episode. The plot follows a total briskly until the arrival of Han and Chewie. This moment is a little questionable where they came from but fortunately coincidences happen. Bit pointless search for another vessel, the falcon is too much known? but the fastest and they do not fly to first order but to revolt. Of course not everything one can understand but I find it strange to lightsaber chose owner like the wand from Harry Potter. Mysterious Republic has to presume military. protects a section of the galaxy. and all the power is in one place? The similarity with the 4th episode of the story is obvious. unteachable villains build the Death Star 3 (the name is not important), and instead of a small hole as the first death star (which was probably the best protected in the end :), too much confidence in the protective shield and omissions incompleteness DS II with exposed reactor for single-machine (even MF will fit :) first order to try to trump their naivety (we disregard how they got through the shield because it was very risky) as highly important subject is not protected against infiltration of guerrilla teams and is on the surface. Devotees imperial officer under threat of death betrayal and deactivated shield? (she did not have much space, but it happens. that even significant figures do not have room recalls the Emperor's Guard) The main villain is very interesting riven character, rather it is a spoiled rabid child than a hatred full Sith...necessity to have a duel with lightsabers and perform some revenge the death of some character was somewhat expected and sad for funs. The destruction of the DS3 has just finished a full copy of the 4th episode. Personally, I would welcome a little more varied and original denouement...type we did not manage to destroy the DS3, Rebel base was destroyed, find Luke at all costs (true problem with the death of R2-D2 and C 3PO (and Leia)) or more demonstrations ambivalence of villain, where Kylo Ren (Ben) go home with Han. Only then could be DS 3 destroyed and that great threat from Kylo Ren in the rebel base in future movies. As a Trojan horse.. I know after battle is everybody general..We will see what future will bring :)"
4448,4,JJ Abrams ruined it... again,"I can't believe I'm going to say this because I heard so many great things about Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but I actually liked Rogue One, which I just saw a few weeks ago better. "
4449,5,Review so Spoiler of plot ahead!!,Don't any hope to see a meaningful star wars movie again.<br /><br />Bye Bye.. Disney and Starwars... We Are not ready to give you our money to watch craps stories about how we think or talk.<br /><br />Take your woke agenda from my pockets.
4450,5,"Nope. Totally Overrated. Rogue One Was Better, and This Was in Some Ways a Disservice to the Franchise. Big Miss.",On a few occasions I nearly fell asleep. You know how star wars fans hate jar jar well I think they should hate kylo ren. Kylo ren is annoying and is like a spoiled annoying brat. I hate kylo ren! The last jedi and rise of skywalker are better. Don't even waste your time watching this.
4451,1,It is Disney Woke Wars!!,"OK, this review will contain HEAVY SPOILERS. You have been warned."
4452,1,Worst Star wars movie ever,Just terrible in every possible way. Do not watch if you watched the original ones or like films in general.
4453,3,"Great characters, most disappointing story","I just want to start off by saying that I enjoyed the film. I thought that the writing was good, and the acting was some of the best in the series. However, after walking out from The Force Awakens, I just couldn't help but feel disappointed. Please note that I won't be able to include everything I liked/didn't like, due to the word limit. Also, Spoilers!"
4454,1,Another Poopy JJ Abrams Crap,Why are they rebels again here??
4455,4,"A good, yet disappointing film","So you make three movies and a billion dollars or so re-telling the classic Hero Journey, then you make three prequels that were apparently scripted by channel-flipping between Ring of Honor Wrestling and CSpan. So you're out of ideas and sell the franchise to Disney for more billions. What do they do, the great Dream Factory of the world?"
4456,2,Didn't The Rebels Win At The End Of Episode VI?,"I wanted to like this movie. Star Wars has always been my favourite film franchise and this was my first time seeing a new one in the theatre. It was such a disappointment, especially considering what it could have been. If your nostalgia for the original trilogy outweighs any other opinions you would have, I have no doubt you would like this movie because that's what it is: a feature-length ""tribute"" to the original three movies. But that's where its biggest problem lies."
4457,4,"Star Wars, by Philip Glass","I can hardly describe how disappointed I am about this Film....J.J. Abrahams made by far the worst Star Wars movie in the history and he should be ashamed for destroying such a great saga! Not only was the ""story"" ( if by definition you can even call it that way) so boring, uninspired and flat but also the new characters were poorly played and did not fit in the overall saga! Moreover, there were a lot of mistakes both in logic and from the perspective of the Star Wars universe combined with jokes for 10-year-old people which made it really really hard to enjoy this film although I tried my best to give it a chance! Even though the effects were well done it is like with a lot of films today that it is not sufficient to just add explosives and a few 3D effects to make a good film! A lot of ideas in the films could have worked out much much better if someone with a bit of intelligence, interest and knowledge about Star Wars had worked them out but here they were just thrown into the film without any real plan....just to gain some profit out of the name of Star Wars! Overall an awful experience and it is a shame that so many people liked this film!"
4458,5,Such a disappointment,"i am big fan of Star Wars series myself - have watched them umpteen times, i saw the premier show in Bangkok and was super excited. I had lot more expectations from the movie - it was a re-launch - and thought it needed a proper and new plot - i was under impression the Star Wars have a proper line up of stories up-till episode 9 - guess i was wrong ! Even a simple plot would have done rather than a redundant one - personally i felt this movie was a re-imagined episode 4...minus the Jedi bit (it was missing badly - the Darth Vader role was weak)."
4459,1,"""I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.""","Saw this on release and was excited but boy was I disappointed. When everyone was pretending it was good I felt like a lone voice saying it was terrible. Glad more people joined me on that. It's such a poor remake of episode 4, Ray gets power from no where and is the best Jedi ever when she didn't even know they existed. Joke of a movie, avoid"
4460,3,re-imagined episode 4!,"Guess there is no need to mention all that has been said before my review. I completely agree. If this was just another movie and the other parts did not exist I would have loved it, but this is not just another movie, it's a copy paste fest. "
4461,1,Have you seen episode 4? Then you've seen this,This is an EXACT copy of episode IV with some names changed and better graphics. Same movie.
4462,5,Future spoiler alert,"That was the laziest movie I've ever seen, why is there another Death Star? Why? It wasn't the greatest decision to bring it back in Return of the Jedi, but at least we saw the emperor defeated and Vader redeemed. This is like that but MUCH WORSE, overall the movie seems very lazy. I did like a couple of scenes, such as when Kylo killed Han, that was the most emotional I've got in a theater. Also the scene when Kylo tries to rip info from Rays mind and she shakes it off was really cool, also when she reverse read his mind. That made sense, that's instinctively protecting yourself. But what doesn't make sense is how she somehow beats a trained dark force user when she has no training whatsoever!! Luke trained for weeks under the wisest and one of the most powerful Jedi ever, and he was toyed with by Vader.﻿ Obviously Vader is more powerful than Kylo, but Luke is and will always be the most powerful force user ever (canon) but many parts of the movie don't make sense. Another problem I have is the lack of emotion with Hans death. Yeah we see Chewie go Rambo on a few storm troopers, and Leia has a nice long hug. But there really isn't much in the death. Hell I was more emotional than the characters. There is almost no tension in the Huge Death Star thing. They brush it off like its nothing! A modified planet that consumes stars and you're taking it like a big star destroyer??!!! AND OMG C-3PO WAS CRINGE!!!! Didn't sound anything like he did in the originals and when he did talk it was the most unnecessary and cringe dialogue I've heard in a Star Wars movie. My last of the main things I very much dislike about this movie is how Kylo is too much of the winy teen/young adult anakin we saw in the prequels, he has huge temper tantrums and seems kind of fragile at some points. Sorry for the rant tone of this review but I'm very passionate about star wars!"
4463,4,Episode IV with better graphics,"When George Lucas sold the rights of Star Wars to disney, everyone was met with optimism and excitements. The prequels were largely and unfairly chastised (Which I admit I was wrong about) but thats when audiences actually respected movie critics. The hype of the movie was amazing, and I think the best part. We saw glimpses of Han Solo, Luke's hand and the Mysterious Kylo Ren. There was a review embargo the day of the premiere and the hype machine was in full force (get it?). Yet after seeing it the Nostalgia took place and after the freshness wore off I realized how mediocre the movie was. The story was a rehash of a New Hope, with new characters of Finn, Rey and the evil Kylo Ren, and yet they added nothing of value. In fact if not for Han Solo and Chewbaccas intro in the movie it would be a total bore. The movie was mediocre at best and elevated by Harrison Ford."
4464,4,"A bad New Hope, but with nice explosions.","I hope this review will inspire future film producers, directors and story tellers, your creations should most importantly entertain us and move us. Either to experience the dark side of life or good side of life. OK now to the film. I know how good a film is when the characters emotionally touch me and i connect with them. Then i live the emotional and physical ride they go through in a film. I need to believe them and the situation they are in. Once this connection is made a film character becomes immortal, a scene becomes timeless and you will watch that film again and again for many years to relive that character, the scene and their story. For me i watched the original Star Wars at the cinema all those years ago and was inspired and moved inside. I believed in Luke Skywalker, the Jedi Knights and the mystical spiritual concept known as the force. George Lucas's storytelling was second to none and the character building was brilliant. Luke's early youth background, how he has a dream to go places, yet was held back by the adopted father. This then moved to him rediscovering his roots, his father, the force and the Jedi concepts. He had to grow up mentally, physically and confront his demons. This is just one example of the character building that went on throughout star wars episodes 4,5,6. But what people forget is that along side this was the development of the music scores that created the atmosphere. The tension, surprise, the joy and sorrow the characters went through, that the director's and production team brought to the scene. What i'm trying to say was there was weight in the dialogue, the way the characters carried the scene. You could almost feel the environment the characters were in and worry with them and for them. For me Obi Wan's presence as a Jedi was WOW. Once you understood the concept of the force, you know this person was on a higher plane then everyone else. They demanded respect and your attention on screen. Likewise Darth Vader put fear into me. I believed in his strength. Not just physical, dark and tall and the power of the force he commanded. I recently watched all three of the original star wars films to prepare myself for this new film. And even now after watching them i was emotionally overcome by the Jedi knight. Their mystical presence, their presence on screen. I wanted to know more about them and their origins, their training methods. not just physical but mental and their connection with the force. I gave Darth Vader so much respect. I remember when in the episode 4 on the death star. A commander or officer talks down and insults this old mystical art. Dark Vader reprimanded him and expressed his high respect for the Jedi ways. This concept touched so many people around the world who believed in this ancient and mystical way of life a religion known as the Jedi was formed. Amazing. Amazing. Another heavy weight to the originals was the special effects, their design and placement. The technology was worn, dirty, believable. There was a believable scientific logic to the way the ships worked, the technology was deployed and the way the characters interacted with them. for example Hans Solo and Chewbacca knew the falcon. But when Luke tried to touch the controls he was put in his place. The characters had their boundaries and each one respected the other for their knowledge and skill. You could not be the jack of all trades. In real life this is how it is. Takes months years or training to learn something. speaking as an engineer myself. Time lines had to and must be respected. Otherwise the story falls apart. For me this brings me back to the last 3 star wars films and the force awakens. And the disappointment i have personally in George Lucas and the teams involved with the last four star wars films. If George Lucas had the story to the 9 films already detailed down to crossing the t's and dotting the i's. All he had to do was replicate the feelings and emotions we the audience went through with episodes 4,5,6. But my feelings are when i recently watched old films of the making of the original star wars 4,5,6. The ideas were in his head and very few people understood him and believed in him. But he had enough control to produce the classics 4,5,6. Therefore i can only conclude that George Lucas is a genius in story telling,character building and setting scenes with weight, presence and depth. But he lost this control in episodes 1,2,3 and now the force awakens. So to end this review i would like to say if you wanted action, special effects and small talk. You got it and will enjoy this film. But if like myself you were after deep storytelling, depth in character and their development on screen then you will be disappointed. For me i don't understand. They have three films 7,8,9 in which to development the plots, story, character depth and connection with the audience. Yet i felt they rushed it through production, commercialized the star wars universe and made it for money. I left the cinema heart broken, sad and confused. I did not even feel the presence of the force and its power in any character, except right at the end when Luke Skywalker made an appearance. But by this time it was too late. Sadly this is the path Hollywood and Disney are taking. So i for one will not be watching any more star wars films on the big screen. Remember folks they will keep producing this kind of stuff if we keep going to watch it. What does this then say about the intelligence level of the cinema goer. Finally to the critics. please be honest about a film."
4465,4,Nostalgia takes Precedent over a Good Story,"First of all, the new cast were good. But, this film I found to be horrible! And I am a big fan of the original trilogy."
4466,5,Star Wars sold out its character depth and storytelling,"I know when I like a movie immediately, but I only know when is really good or superb when I enjoy seeing it again. Moreover, in some cases, I have to control myself in order not to ruin it due to too much repetition in a short period. Rewatchability is something extraordinary. And even if the pleasure won't last forever, since everything changes so much, some films can endure quite a lot. I think that Star Wars original movies are completly rewatchable. Lots of people have seen them dozens and dozens of times. And even now, when one cannot see them afresh, and you have to deal with the the old-fashioned special effects and with logical aging related problems and limitations, even in that scenario, I would prefer to see again any of them than this film. Really, this film has nothing. Perhaps just the esthetics and aura of Snoke and some other scene, but at most I will find myself seeing a 4 minute video on youtube about it.<br /><br />Let alone the two movies of the trilogy that follow this film. One can hardly imagine how they came to fruition, it is plainly unbelivable unless the authors were in complete isolation and losed track there, besides some evident kind of masochistic sabotage to themselves and sadism with the fans. Just imagine the fact that Luke, Han and Leia being killed in front of your eyes and then resurrecting Palpatine to be the grandfather of the main new character to show blatanly the whole mess they are drowning into. As said, beyond unbelievable.<br /><br />At the end, this new trilogy is even dangerous, so the originals movies can be spoiled to the bone. So, do protect yourself, forget them all if you can.<br /><br />I would only mention Rogue one as a good film in this new series, with some rewatchability and with any dangers to the original story."
4467,2,What could have been,"I can't remember a time I've disagreed with a consensus more than this. It actually stinks of critic payoffs to me, though IMDb user reviews are strangely good as well. The movie literally has the exact same plot as episode IV, with a more politically correct cast. Replace Luke with Rey, and young Han Solo with Finn, and the story is almost exactly the same, down to tiny little details. The story is completely unoriginal, it almost seems like the goal is the replace the original with this rather than add to it. "
4468,1,Do Protect yourself! Forget this crap!,"The Ewok celebration on Endor in 'Return of the Jedi' should have been the end to the Skywalker saga, however here we are with episode VII: The Force Awakens. Walking out of the cinema for the first time, I thought this movie was amazing. However, It took me a couple re-watches to allow me to realise that this is not as good of a movie as I thought it was upon its release. This movie just pays no respect to the original movies. Han Solo is now back to square one, being a smuggler and only caring about himself, tossing aside the heroic and selfless general that we all loved. Oh yeah, they also killed him. I don't even know what Chewbacca does in this movie, same with leia. Both had so much potential to have more of an impact in the story, but no they were pushed into the shadow of the new characters. Sure, Rey, Finn, Poe all have their moments, but they just feel like characters we have already seen in Star Wars. The hero who dreams of a new life, the hotshot pilot, the soldier. I just feel like we could have all used with something original. And then there's kylo ren, who is just a remasked Darth Vader who has daddy issues. However despite this movie having its flaws, it does actually have some good scenes. The falcon chase on Jakku was exciting and well crafted, as some decent millennium falcon action was well overdue after not seeing it for decades. I thought the takodana sequence was action-packed and proved to have a couple of memorable moments. Overall I just think that this movie is mediocre. It had potential, but was rushed into cinemas to get Disney back the money lost when buying Star Wars from George Lucas. It's just disappointing because with a little more time and planning, I do believe this could have been the starting point of an enjoyable trilogy."
4469,3,Politically correct version of A New Hope,"Watched it on 3D, Some good scenes specially the space ones. The movie was not as advertised. The music is not wow, I remember the Duel of Fates in the Phantom Menace.. it was something Epic, sw7 doesn't delivers that.. The script.. well, they did it again.. EP4 had a DeathStar and they blow it.. then Ep6 had another bigger death Star and.. they blow it.. again Ep7 has a even bigger DeathStar thing, this time.. its an Hybrid between planet and super base.. and guess what? they blow it! They recycled the EP4&6 story! They deactivate the shield of the base, infiltrate the base, rescue someone inside the base, then blow it with x-wings. Even in the desert of Jakku you will feel the Sarlacc Pit reference with the Tie Fighter. Strormtroopers still have the worst aim capabilities in the galaxy.. The real title of the movie is The Return of the Awaken Hope. The bad guy kill the old one. Same script.. it feels like the 3rd Version of EP4. Apart from Solo and Chewy, Original Cast is barely used. Luke Skywalker is mentioned more than 50 times but you will see him only 10 seconds in the end, he will not speak or do anything. The movie its more an introduction of the new characters, but they will not be introduced, you will not know nothing about them.. The movie almost ended with a To be continued, the script feels from the beginning that something super cool its gonna happen but.. no.. it didn't happen. You will not see a decent Lightsaber battle.. not a Jedi or Sith.. Emptiness. The bad guy can be easily killed by anyone in the movie.. Jar Jar Abrahams stole my money."
4470,5,A mediocre addition to the Skywalker saga that pays little respect to its predecessors,"The Force Awakens is without a doubt the Star Wars movie that has aged the worst, not from a visual standpoint but it did not stand the test of time. I loved this movie when I first watched it. It was a 9/10 for me, everything I wanted in a Star Wars sequel with great characters, action, pacing and a good sense of nostalgia. Just an excellent time. Then, as time went on, I actually paid attention to the story..."
4471,4,Not as advertised. Super Spoilers.,"Now, imagine you have a great candy bar. Now, your dog takes a piss on 1/3 of it. That's the new Star Wars trilogy. Bad acting, boring story, and fights I wouldn't dare call lightsaber fight. More like what you and the kid next door would do in the pool. Now, the only reason I am not giving this 4 stars is because it has some funny moments (I don't know if they are purposely funny or not) and they brought back Ford. Oh wait, you thought he would be a character in all three, nope, they kill him almost right away. Jar Jar Abrams, you've made another classic. Classic disaster that is."
4472,5,Entertaining and well-directed but is overall an inferior remake,"What happened here is pretty simple. George Lucas had finished his work and was sad on bad critics about his prequel and remaster, so he decided to never do anymore work on Star Wars. Being he finished with it, he had a top valued franchise on his hands and sold it to anybody willing to pay. Disney executives had much more money than they could handle and decided to take the chance."
4473,2,Bad movie,But not as ugly as the rest of the reboot film.
4474,2,Disney didn't know what to do with Star Wars,Completely brainless remake. Terrible acting. Painful in every way. Absolutely shocked at the rating here. This movie is the greatest sin of star wars. I would rather watch 8 and 9 on and endless loop than see this monstrosity of a film ever again.
4475,1,A Disney princess that is 2015 ugly,"If you are a real Star Wars fan, be ready for a rough ride. While I did enjoy the show, when the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I sat there wondering where this new Star Wars franchise is going. I have a bad feeling about this!"
4476,1,"An Insult, and the Worst Star Wars Movie Ever",If there had not been any other episode I would rate 10 because the special effects are very good and the action is there.... problem....there has been 6 épisodes before and I definitely felt for many sequences I was seeing an elaborate remake especially of episode 6 a new hope...albeit the feeling of cut and paste from other issues apply to many scenes.... it is really entertaining.go and see it but do not expect a new universe.Luke Leia organa and Hans solo the concept is nevertheless slowly ageing...without renewing itself. Fans Will not be deceived but Abrams is doing to star Ward what he did to star trek. I do not think one can repeat indefinitely.
4477,5,"A very entertaining movie, but if you are a Star Wars fan...","Perfect competent exercise in Lucas aproximation minus all the endearing quirks. Even the outright bad entries in the series (Jedi, Manace) had personality this lacks. The cast shows the good of Abrams background in genre TV, he has a good eye for actors and can both direct and trust them to carry the weaker spots (things Lucas has always been pretty bad at). The extent that this follows the original templete is hilarious silly (the new death star is particularly a bad unnecessary idea in an already overt busy film). It is also very restrictive, the big dramatic third act event falls flat, part because it is so heavy telegraphed and part because it is staged as just another echo in a series of them. The whole film does make me think a lot of some well received comic book runs that boils down to little more than a series of well-crafted nostalgia callbacks (Joss Whedon work on X-Men comes specially to mind) and those always age terrible. Driver's helmet, the one out right bad design in the film, works when it becomes clear he is a wannabe third rate Darth Vader and that is sort of a good analogue to the whole film. The Force Awakens is not without its pleasures: the action is solid if a bit blend, the cast is game, Ford is a pleasure, the designs and world building are fine whatever the needs of nostalgia pandering allows it to breathe and I enjoy how the film keeps telling you how awesome Isaac suposedly is while he keep been useless in practice. And well, it is competent, everyone keeps telling everyone else it is competent and I guess that is supposed to be enough."
4478,5,a remake...,"I'm a real Star Wars Hardcore fan was there at movie theater for 4,5,6 in 1977 to disappointed and destroyed with this movie waiting for 32 years for a set of sequels with the original cast not newbies."
4479,5,Mediocre,"When I first heard that Disney would be buying Star Wars, and releasing the first in a new trilogy of movies in 2 1/2 years, I was a bit concerned. ""How can they get it done so quickly?"" I thought. George Lucas had spent three years on each prequel movie, and he already had the stories written! He never wrote scripts for a 7,8,9, just had some rough ideas. Then I learned that Michael Arndt, one of the writers for Toy Story 3(a great movie), was hired to write the script, and my fears were eased a bit. Besides, I was beyond excited about the fact that I was going to get three more sequels to my favourite series of movies ever! "
4480,3,40yr-90's Points of View as Movie goers of 4.5.6 No Spoilers,"i would give it a 7 if it wasn't star wars. the problem is, it is star wars. this movie started pretty good and went downhill really fast. and why in the freakin hell did they animate that sith lord? this is the worst cgi decision since the animation of neo flying through the sky in the 2nd matrix movie. I'll hand out a 1 star rating because of the ridiculously corrupt 8,3 here on IMDb. i never imagined watching a star wars movie as boring as the phantom menace. ep7 had some nostalgic moments and pretty solid cgi (besides that awful sith lord) but the phantom menace had darth maul. ep 7 had no depth in screen writing and annoying casting while the phantom menace had jar jar binks. so which one is worst? u decide young padawan..."
4481,3,This is what happens when you have unreasonable deadlines,"Overall, a letdown. Rehashes far too many ideas from A New Hope to a much lesser effect. "
4482,1,lets be honest. this is NOT a bad movie at all,"Minor spoilers at the end of review! being a 34 ys old guy who grew up with Star Wars, I so wanted to add this film up there with my favourites. Unfortunalety about halfway through this film it suddenly dawned on myself and my pals that this film is not a sequel, it is in fact practically a frame for frame duplicate of A new Hope.. and we found ourselves instead of being inrigued by what might happen next, we already knew how this story goes."
4483,2,It's official - the magic of the original trilogy can't be recreated,"what i just watch wright now, what they done with trilogy, someone make it or start to make it by missing part one, and mix part two and three together and make this movie story without one movie without one, what was the story where are we, we finished episode 6 with victory of resistance and begin episode 7 with war, and who the f.. characters are they come from air, master of dark side was always there and everything is like nothing happens in past 6 movies any connection is characters, much more to say, how Leia become lieder of resistance......and i stop here, and you think you will make money with this no you are destroying something where you can get money in years to come, watch Lukas movies and maybe you will learn something how to stay in businesses with this one."
4484,5,A New Hope with a paint job - A re-make and not a sequel,"The movie was not terrible. It was decent and actually not boring so that is good. It was not, however, a Star Wars movie. It was a fan film and a remake with no actual storytelling. At least the prequels told a complex story of how a good man turns evil and how a democratic republic turns into an evil empire. (It happens in the real world. Good Science Fiction usually mirrors reality.) Casual viewers may like it a lot, but it contains none of the elements that made the six other movies so memorable (and many real fans love all six.) There was no state of the art special effects scene like the Coruscant speeder chase or the AT-AT attack, no amazing new score like attacking the 2nd death star or staring at the twin suns, no awesome villain like Darth Vader or General Grevious, no emotional scenes like the order 66 deaths or Vader being Luke's father, and no epic light saber battle like Darth Maul or Count Dooku. The only thing it had going for it was nostalgia...Same old fighting spaceships, same old music, same old actors. The reason I rate this movie as awful is because this movie shows us that without George Lucas, we will never get to see the real sequel trilogy. Instead we are getting reboots and homages which may be watchable, but they are not Star Wars."
4485,2,wtf,"As with most things jj abrams has been a part of, this film is visually stunning. From that perspective, this film lives up to the Star Wars name in all respects. In virtually all other categories, it is a truly bad film."
4486,1,Lifelong Star Wars fan review,A cheesy and not that good reboot of the originals.<br /><br />Even in the worst of the prequels there was a strong story with scenes that you could watch again and again. Not so in this one.
4487,5,A complete rehashing of previously used ideas,Is a poor cheesy reboot of the originals.<br /><br />Even the worst of the prequels had a strong story with scenes you could enjoy again and again. Not so with this.
4488,4,Rehash,I must have watch the star wars movies few hundred times. JJ stayed in a safe zone in the story line. it seems like copy cut paste of the episode 4 - 5 - 6 ı was hoping some original scenes and new vision to the franchise. What he did in star trek was great. but for star wars its to weak.
4489,4,Rehash,"I have just seen it and it was a true disappointment. Technically, it's mediocre with a very heavy handed and disjointed plot and bland cinematography."
4490,5,nostalgic feeling,"It sucked and I really have no idea where everyone else is getting off saying otherwise. Overall I thought the first time were introduced to Rey was incredibly boring and just made her seem flawless. I also thought Poes and Finns relationship was rushed. Kylo Ren was an underwhelming villain who seemed more like a butthurt kid rather than having the organizational skills of Darth Vader. The other remaining characters - Maz Kanata, Snoke, Hux, and Phasma were all somewhat cool but didn't get enough screen time. Overall the coolest aspects of the film were seeing the old characters and Starkiller base, I also loved the comedy but that's small stuff. Overall this should have been more of a J. J. Abrams movie than a Disney movie and to me it wasn't. It should have been more similar in tone to Star Trek or The Lord of the Rings."
4491,3,Terribly Disappointing,"Copies scene for scene A New Hope, while simultaneously forcefeeding boring new characters and killing off the established fan favorites.<br /><br />Beautiful and terrible."
4492,1,Disappointing,"When I first watched this movie in the cinema it exceeded my expectations, but only because they were very low to begin with. After all director J. J. Abrams, had recently butchered Star Trek so I was was afraid, I wouldn't even recognize my beloved Star Wars anymore."
4493,1,Walmart brand A New Hope,"First of all, The movie looks great. Now a days tecnique really add's his value and you'll get a good feeling how colossal man made machines can be. The acting is great and we will all be glad to see some familiar faces from the first movies. Although, there is this ""disney magic"" That doesn't belong in the Star Wars Universe. If you are really into Star Wars, and familiar with the untold story, you might wanna re- think watching this one. The movie is different from the old ones. The action in the movie is great, and if you're new too Star Wars this might be a great movie to watch First. Things go fast, and you'll forget you just watch a over 2 hour movie. There will be moments when you'll forget your popcorn like Star Wars should. But somewhere in the movie you IF notice some difference, and when you do, it might leave you with a sick feeling."
4494,5,When a lukewarm fanfiction gets a billion dollar budget...,"So after many years I finally decided to watch this movie and when it was over I just had to breath. What the ... did I just watch? It's one of those movies that just makes me want to write a review just to share my pain and warn others who haven't watched the movie yet to just keep ignoring it. At the end I made a list of dumb moments because unlike others I'm not someone who forgets what just happened 5 minutes ago, a.k.a. the average fan Disney feeds this schlock to.<br /><br />So to keep this review ""short"" (turned out not to be so short in the end) I will just point things out that I have noticed in a list:"
4495,5,"Great looking movie, but with some issue's","Was going to was star wars. I didn't know it was changed to Cuck wars oh well. Not watching it now. JJ Abhrams Berg ruined this movie, and all of star wars for that matter. Was going to was star wars. I didn't know it was changed to Cuck wars oh well. Not watching it now.

JJ Abhrams Berg ruined this movie, and all of star wars for that matter."
4496,2,Apparently the fourth highest-grossing film of all time... Why?,"Really !!! the same jet ! ? same old pilot helmet ? same old laser sound !? technology go so fast , so I was expecting that will be new great and designed jet ! new designed pilot helmet ! and even a new laser sound, just something that could be inventive, a logic new way that weapon should sound. Only the famous Jedi weapon should keep the same sound, at least the one from Luke ..etc....it don't make sens..Actors and story it's OK ! but if Hans Solo it get old of 30 years more jet should be also improve ! Why also same kind of jet battle inside a way to get the core of the planet ! Really same again ! The beginning of the movie it's not spectacular at all ! For the same reason I wrote before, weapon 30 years a go sound new, but now it's sound like an old computer game ..I think that can only be great for those fan who only live in the past, not for movie lovers as me.."
4497,1,Cuckwars,Does The Force Awakens indicate the decline of humanity?
4498,1,"Why still the same Jet, the same laser sound ? even same very old pilot helmet !?",Well obviously the good reviews are spam. No more comment needed.
4499,1,Mary Sue-ish Snoozefest,"What were they thinking, I got bored in the first ten minutes of this film no plot no story and why were the original characters even featured in this film come on the only highlight of the film was seeing a female Jedi."
4500,2,Both The Good And The bad Reviews Are Wrong,"The new Star Wars film finally hit the theaters. Today I found some time to catch a late evening viewing, securing a ticket in a theatre that was 66% full. After those damn commercials were done, the experience finally began. "
4501,2,The force has a nap,"Are members of the Battlefield Earth fan club. Yeah, I am taking about him. That one guy. He would enjoy this JJ Abrams abomination. My apologies to abomination."
4502,3,"This is what happens when the Original Trilogy, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings have a baby","In the credits for Star Wars The Force Awakens it calls JJ Abrams the director. it should be corrected. He is the 'bean counter.' What a dross. JJ Really Needs To Be Shunned He is an embarrassment to film, art and a tribute to the bubble of making money from someone else's art and vision."
4503,2,The Only People Who Will Enjoy This,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens only put the franchise to sleep for me. It was a shortcoming on Disney's behalf that lacked character development, with a plot that alienated older fans from the old story and forced us into accepting the new far too abruptly. It was on par, or maybe slightly worse that the prequels. "
4504,1,Correction for IMDb editors,"Somehow made the prequels look good. Terrible. I will not be seeing the next 2 in theater. The Cameo's were great and nestolgic, but as soon as the sith spoke, it just lost me. The entire movie was a spoof after that point and not even the great Harrison Ford and his exceptional acting could save this Harry Potterisc Star Wars. The script was weak and lacking true Star Wars immersiveness (same as the prequels). The acting was as poor as the original prequels outside of the great Harrison Ford and it was painfully obvious since his only competition came from a wookie. The sith was more like a spoiled brat who's digruntled at his parents. In all the graphics were amazing as is expected, but very lacking even when compared to the low tech sets and props used in the original 1970's films. I was very disappointed with the overall Directing of the film and the comedic aperture used to fill very dull scenes. The feeling of the script was very shallow with overlays of Star Wars undertones making it feel more like a remake than a continued story. The plot was good and could have made for a much better movie than the garbage that was produced."
4505,5,Star Flaws,"After letting it sit in my mind for a while, The Force Awakens seems to get worse and worse. I enjoyed the movie the first time, but the more I think of the story, characters, and plot devices, the more bad it becomes. In my opinion, Return of the Jedi wrapped up the Star Wars saga perfectly, and to be brutally honest, The Force Awakens feels like just another way for Disney to make money by bringing the legendary franchise back. The new antagonists don't seems to have any meaningful motivation and follow the original villains WAY to closely, with a pure evil character overseeing the whole plan, and a younger villain struggling between the light and dark side. And just like before, there is a resistance fighting against a bigger empire trying to take over the galaxy. For the most part the movie felt like an unoriginal cash grab trying to start another saga from the ashes of an old franchise."
4506,1,Terrible,"People have been arguing about how this movie is PC and simply chose characters, not for the sake of the story and character development, but for PC purposes. I agree with those people for several reasons. First, Disney seems to be following the trend to ""fix"" the inferiority complexes of women today by throwing a bunch of useless, undeveloped ""strong"" females out there. Tauriel from The Hobbit movies is one example (a ""strong"" female character who was moody, indecisive and running around crying after a man the whole time). Rey is not exactly the same way, but she is pandering (yes I am using the ""P"" word) to females with an inferiority complex and the PC audience of course."
4507,5,Trying to keep a well ended story going.,"like the title says, i'm not one to be writing reviews of movies on web pages but this time i was so disappointed and annoyed by all those c*ck suckers doing publicity about star wars giving the movie a perfect 10 and 5 stars, when in reality this movie is a compilation of all other 6. The scenarios are all the same, old desert with poor people, very weird looking guy buying junk stuff, a wanna bee death star blowing up, the same horrible guys playing jazz on a bar. This was a remake of all older versions of star wars put into one, not a new star wars movie. Very disappointed because i thought Disney was going to take this movie to a different direction but they didn't. if you've never seen a star wars movie before i guess its an OK movie. but if you've seen all of them before it is annoying and disappointing how they made me see the same crap with different actors."
4508,2,A PC movie that lacks any real character development,"At first, I thought this was the worst movie ever. Of all time. And then I finally got around to watching the Last Jedi. Which makes this one actually seem okay in comparison. It's still the second worst movie I have ever seen. Why is it so bad? It takes everything you love about Star Wars and cheapens it. Also, I can't help compare it to the original EU storyline set in the same time frame. On top of actually making sense, the Legacy of the Force series has one of the most fantastic villains ever devised. Despite this film's main villain having a certain connection to that villain, the main villain of the Force Awakens is a cheap knockoff, reminiscent of everything I hated about Anakin Skywalker in Attack of the Clones, only without the good stuff. We introduce a lot of new characters, but the only one I remotely care about is the new droid that, as he should, hero worships R2-D2. In short, only watch this if you want to destroy your childhood. As for its sequel, that will tear apart whatever remaining shreds of it you have left."
4509,5,"Just made an account to say movie sucks, very disappointed","That is all it was a remake of the original trilogy, Not only this movie but all the so called sequel trilogy , but it isn't an actual remake so they undo everything from the original to do it again in these sequels , but hey they have a good CGI oooohhh."
4510,1,I thought it was bad at first...,"This is not even a good comedy with everlasting jokes, but a simple, cash grab with no twist other than a trendy gender switch, with bad acting and just a few Star wars-related scenes. I disliked it for the lying that it is a sequel and not a gender switch remake."
4511,4,A review of the trilogy,"There might be some moments of awesomeness but it's of the calculated type, designed by Disney executives who know you can't win two billion dollars with art-house stuff."
4512,2,Not worth your time,"I do not like Star Wars at all. There was nothing interesting about it. It was awful. It was really terrible. I will never watch it again. I could not even watch all of it, that is how boring and uninteresting it was. It was pointless. And I do not know if it was because of Star Wars but when I was watching it, my eyes were hurting. I would have preferred to watch it while sat alongside the writer or director of Star Wars so that they could have explained it to me because I do not understand it at all. Even though I do not like it at all. Although I would say very well done to the actors because they worked hard on this. I am a Whovian. I prefer Doctor Who. It is infinity times better. There is no comparison. I would rather watch Power Rangers than Star Wars and I do not watch Power Rangers anymore because they are boring so it should be understandable that I do not like Star Wars at all. The only possible thing that I just about like about it, would be the idea of it being based in space. Of course I would not advise you to not watch it just because of what I think about it."
4513,5,"You know the difference between Lucas and Abrams? One had a super vision, and the other a supervision...",A must see in 3D amazing scenes worth the 2+ hour movie time. 
4514,2,I dislike Star Wars so much,"I'm giving episode VII three stars only so I can give episodes VIII and IX fewer. However, this one was actually the best of the three sequels. If you love the original Star Wars trilogy and were able to tolerate the three prequels (less Jar-Jar), then you will absolutely despise the three sequels. Bad writing, bad storyline, mostly bad acting, woke, agenda-driven casting, very good cinematography/special effects. Many parts of the storyline seem to be rehashed and divergent, reimagined storylines from the original movies. With the exception of Carrie Fisher, the original cast that make appearances, steal all the scenes. The original casting really was magic in a bottle that could never be duplicated. With that said, it's a shame that Carrie Fisher led such a rough life and didn't take better care of herself. It was clear in her scenes that it had taken a toll on her. I often found myself distracted by her appearance, voice and mannerisms during her scenes. I could go on and on about all the issues I have with these movies but what's the point? Bottom line, they stink."
4515,5,Great graphics but bad acting and story-line.,"I am unsure of the pedigree of the actors and actresses, but they are quite one-dimensional.<br /><br />I am not a fan of remakes at all (gender switch or not), but surely Disney has the budget to hire better players."
4516,3,Worse than the Prequels? YOU BET!,"Most of the top IMDB movies are violent, serious and depressing. There are barely any genuinely happy films in the IMDB top 300. That's ok, that's just what humanity tends to enjoy. That's why Star Wars always stuck out to me as a saga because it ends with peace in the Galaxy. It stood for hope, the triumph of peace in the end over war, good over evil. Han Solo was the ultimate hero. A likeable rogue, a vagabond, who never seemed to want to do the right thing, but reluctantly did it anyway, saved the Galaxy, married a bloody princess."
4517,2,Bad acting in this remake,"The prequels were ok but this one is just bad.In A New Hope we see how luke struggles to becone a jedi and use the force but here someone just closes their eyes and voila,they are the greatest jedi to ever exist."
4518,2,How many droids did Disney use to get this to 7.9,"So many flaws it's hard to believe this movie actually got made, but I can't believe that some people actually like it when compared to George Lucas' work. This film gets so many thing wrongs when it comes to Star Wars. Star Wars has a certain feel, that this film just doesn't have, and everything that makes the series unique, and fun, this film emulates poorly or just turns a blind eye. They've made a mockery of a great film series, and they know fans will support it because of their love for the series, but Disney just doesn't have the direction to do it right. Instead they're thinking about what they can do that they can emulate and add rides to their dumb theme parks."
4519,5,"How 7.9 rating,just how!","Lacks the Star Wars ""magic"" and tries to mechanically rehash A New Hope. This movie should be thrown away and forgotten."
4520,1,Makes a mockery out of the franchise...,"This movie is awful they had all these years to create a new SW movie and instead we get a recasting of A New Hope lead by Mary Sue . Lucas must be banging his head against a wall for selling out. Abrams totally sold out to Disney there is NOTHING original in this movie it's just a redo of ANH lead by a boring Mary Sue and a hapless antagonist that's a JOKE Kylo ""cry baby"" Ren ."
4521,1,Gutless,"They just gender switched it (so 2015 hip) and pushed out a 'product' to 'distribution' in consultation with 'Chinese supply chain' and 'entertainment and parks division.'<br /><br />Of course, anyone who was a fan of Star Wars would let it be and not remake and re-tread and re-defecate, but we not talking about admiration. We are talking about mere familiarity."
4522,3,TFA is A New Hope + Mary Sue,"Any one that grew up with the original series or even cared to watch it before seeing this movie will understand that the plot in this movie is a New Hope.JJ Abrams is known for just rebooting old movies in a flashy way that is quiet forgettable. Such as the Star Trek movies. I was bored by the 2nd one. All JJ Abrams managed to do was revisit the same plot from the original Star Wars with a bunch of fancy graphics, a cast of very boring and unfitting actors and obviously the stupid Disney humor that is just over kill and no one actually likes. They could have pulled it off with a cool villain and an intense light saber fight but not even that was given. Kylo Ren has become a joke of a villain with some of the biggest and most crooked teeth I've ever seen on an actor.Not fitting the role well at all I feel he is better fitted with the Harry Potter cast. The end lightsaber fight was so bad it seems like they didn't even try. I felt like I was watching 2 kids play with toy swords. The only part of this movie that is keeping me from leaving a 1 star review is that they brought back the original cast and I actually really like Rey as a Jedi instead of Finn. Always wanted a female Jedi, we already have had a black one. The bases of this is it was upsetting and disappointing. Nice try JJ Abrams and Disney but you messed up. I will not be revisiting the series after this."
4523,2,My Bet Is That No One Involved In This Had A Clue About Star Wars,Absolutely untalented scenario! The most pathetic movie for making the money that I've ever seen in my entire life. Shame on you Mr. Harrison Ford!
4524,4,"Generic reboot of 'A New Hope', very disappointing.","This movie is an exact copy of episode 4, a new hope... but much, much worst. i really can't understand how people rate this movie so high... it's so patetic!"
4525,1,Solo's dead! You've got to be kidding me!,"As a huge Star Wars fan I was looking forward to this movie for years. And I had high expectations for this film after it was announced that J.J Abrams was going to direct this film. The entire movie was not so bad. It showed resemblance to the original trilogy and the actors were pretty good. However, when Kylo Ren killed Han Solo it ruined the movie. I was very disappointed. Han Solo is one of the main characters. This isn't Game of Thrones its Star Wars. I couldn't believe the fact that Disney approved this. You can't just kill Han Solo, you can't! Overall the visual effects of the film and the actors' performances were pretty good but the storyline was a bomb."
4526,1,this movie is a joke,"The usual gender switch movie but also a reboot and a remake, very dismal, trash remake with a girl power ugly wench with poor directing, lots of scenes cloned and shots for effect not story. Bad acting and magical characters. Stupid with the usual Disney humor to attract the pre-teen crowd."
4527,4,Disappointed....,"The story was ripped off from Episode 3, the jokes didn't belong, the girl cannot act (at least she is thin!) and this director has been discredited several times before.<br /><br />What were they thinking? I mean, what is their goal here? Could someone enlighten me?"
4528,2,Take Note,"I do not spoiler the story, because i could not tell much about it. :D"
4529,3,I do not get it,"The first of Disney SW seemingly starts strong with an intense village assault scene and introduces who I thought was our two main characters. Poe and Finn. SW has started movies with supporting characters before like in a New Hope with Leia, C3PO and R2D2. But you always knew who the main character was when he showed up on screen, Luke. It was so obviously Luke."
4530,4,Commerce Filler,Utterly rubbish. The old ones were MUCH MUCH better.
4531,3,The Best of The New Trilogy Is Still Terrible.,Terrible. like the other 2. disney has ruined Star Wars
4532,1,"Just Di$ney cashing in. Watch Tom & Jerry instead, you'll feel much better.","Critics have almost universally praised the seventh entry in the Star Wars saga. Most negative critiques of the film have been shrugged off as fanboys being fanboys, to which I respectfully disagree. The Force Awakens should be considered both on its merits as it a) stands alone, in which regard it is an average at best, by the numbers Marvel-style money churner; and b) as the seventh film in a nine-part narrative in which regard it outright fails - shamelessly copying most of its narrative points from the originals whilst simultaneously working to undo what came before and offering no logical consistency in the series as a whole."
4533,1,terrible,Ever have someone tell you to write a list of pros and cons before making your final judgment?. Well here it..
4534,4,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens - A Soulless, Unnecessary Continuation of the Star Wars Saga",Unfortunately disney learned too late with the tv series's.
4535,4,"Good Points Vs. Bad... ""Kylo Ren looks like Professor Snape""","A Jedi who can stop a blaster bolt, cause Luke skywalkers self exile but barely defeat a first time lightsaber user who isn't a jedi. F grade villain"
4536,4,Disney spends money wants instant gratification,"This episode 7 ignores what happened in episode 6, has a shorthaired misandrist running around being angry and.... they want us to believe it and pay for it!!"
4537,1,After drinking from the well of happabore backwash that is Star Wars VII Phantom Menace's Bantha Fodder appears quite appetizing.,I could only tolerate 10 15 minutes of this reboot. Clearly Disney decided to reboot and retread the whole thing so they can make Star Wars for their pre-teen target market.
4538,2,Insultingly bad,"I'm 15 and love Star Wars. But this movie, it's a disappointment...and it's sad to see such a blatantly mediocre film get such praise. Mind you I went into this movie with lowered expectations just to make sure my expectations weren't to high...."
4539,2,I lasted 10-15 minutes,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the most anticipated movie of the year. When I went to the cinema and waited for the movie to start my heart pounded rapidly in excitement. This was going to be the next generation of Star Wars. The one we all feared was going to be terrible because of Disney and with the lack of George Lucas. (I know the prequels was terrible in the way of dialogue and script, but he is still the master mind behind this incredible universe and I respect him for that.) The task of creating the new Star Wars to come, was given to J.J. Abrams who previously directed the new Star Trek movies. I was hyped from all the behind the scenes footage and the trailers and all. The movie started and the opening sequence begun and the tone for the movie was set."
4540,5,Star Wars Episode VII : Mediocrity Awakens(Commences?),"I did't much like the 'good' Star Warses, but this one was not unwatchable."
4541,4,The new Star Wars generation? (Some spoilers),"I, like many people, saw the original in the theater. Also, like many people, I waited in line for an unmentionable amount of hours to see Episode I, and then trudged through two more. So, I went into this movie in a fairly familiar state for a lot of fans. Also, I'd like to point out that I did like this movie. However, most everything in my review is going to be negative. The rating score is being inflated by nostalgia, which originally had me ranking this movie as a 9 or a 10. But, in conversations with other fans, and on re-viewings, I have since adjusted the score. "
4542,3,It was OK,"When Lucas first announced that Disney was going to acquire the Star Wars franchise I had a sinking feeling that Disney were going to screw it up and I was right Disney did screw it up very badly. I saw the Premiere of this movie suffice to say I was not impressed and I still am not impressed this movie was not needed there is no point to this movie. It is a cash grab by Disney and so are the other two films that followed after this. As I sat there in the theatre an awful feeling came up in my stomach and my thoughts said ""this is not good"" ""This is not a good movie"" when it ended I simply stated ""I did not like that"" A perfectly good franchise completely ruined by some stupid Hollywood cash grab. Only reason I rate 5 is due to the special effects. Apart from that it stinks."
4543,4,The Force is still asleep,Here are my thoughts upon watching:
4544,5,"Nothing Redeeming, Not Good, Not Needed","and ignore this movie. Terrible. I went into this film with an open mind hoping that it would not be as commercial as the reviews suggest. It was. I really wanted this film to rock me, to make me worried to make me care for the freedom fighters defending themselves against the resurrected empire and have some class in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that by a mile. What I watched was a two-hour mess of a film written, produced and directed by whores of accounting. An cloned, poorly filmed, poorly edited, sad cash-in on a beloved science fiction classic is now enslaved to Disney the pushers of clichéd domesticated and predictable cartoons with as much risk and creativity as the fiftieth version of Beauty And The Beast. Horrible insult to viewers and Star Wars from the producers and director. Disney you are busted."
4545,4,I say a remake and a bit more,"As of today, this movie has a rating of 8.0. How?!"
4546,1,Ignore the trolls this reboot sucks,"Very disappointing ! The last episode of the saga was called RETURN OF THE JEDI and as I recall at the end everybody celebrated ! Where are the JEDI and what happened with the galaxy ? We do not want to see another major REPEAT of the story ! We know it already too well, and even if we need to watch it again we would play some of the previous episodes ! I want to ask the creators only one question : if you can not think of ANYTHING new to add to this movie why not ask the fans to give you some fresh ideas ?? This way you could compensate for your obvious LACK OF IMAGINATION !! I never thought I would say this but here you go : I will not watch the next part !"
4547,1,How in Earth Does this have a 8.0 Rating?!?,A insulting retread of previous star wars movies by a man who's main claim to fame is coming up with appalling TV shows and getting his check before people figure out they are terrible.
4548,1,Very disappointing,"first of all new charters are very weak ,starting new bad boy :),girl and new boy is also looks like coming from cheap TV show series second, movie start very good first hour was good then suddenly you start to get bored and telling your self what is going on :) i really get very excited when i first hear new star wars movie coming and ,when i was watching the movie i pray the god to make me blind ."
4549,1,far beyond awful,This movie just went down hill for me and its a disgrace to star wars and the star wars fans i feel bad for the cast and crew especially the main ones like mark hamill carrie fisher and anthony daniels and harrison ford its just a disgrace its not worth the watch just dont touch this movie at all its horrible.
4550,1,awful star wars movie ever,"This is a calamity,a disaster, a car wreck that disrespects Star Wars, logic, cinema and art and forgets that the rebels won and defeated the empire."
4551,1,AWFUL MOVIE,So today i returned from the cinema having watched the force awakens.
4552,2,Only Watched By Rubberneckers,"As I write this a few days after the film opened, it has broken all sorts of records and made huge sums of money. As a business project, this has been a success."
4553,3,Pure Disappointment,"I will offer my thoughts about the new Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer. This new trailer, by the way, again got me to think about how bad of a film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) is. I began watching videos and reading articles that criticize and pick apart this film, and I'll later post some of these videos on my blog. I've known from the beginning that it's not a good film, but I now realize that The Force Awakens is truly the worst Star Wars film so far. I really enjoyed watching and reading the negative things that people have to say about it. Here are a few reasons why it's so bad:"
4554,5,An Average Movie,"0/10<br /><br />Now THIS is RUBBISH!<br /><br />This movie is rubbish, childish, and well crafted to make money only.<br /><br />The film is incredibly stupid with joke after lame joke, Mary Sue, rip off and a horribly lazy plot."
4555,1,Easily the worst Star Wars film yet. A real insult to intelligence.,This movie makes no sense as a sequel.<br /><br />They tried to extend on a chapter that is already closed and making things worse in the progress.
4556,1,Disney Sucks,"I don't even know where to start with this. It was obvious JJ Abrams had never bothered watching any of the previous movies or there wouldn't have been so many mistakes such as, when the f**k has anyone ever seen a 2 man TIE Fighter. Then you get some random sand junkie who has never piloted before but manages to fly the Millennium Falcon as if she was a Battle of Britain vet. The acting between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher was wooden, especially since they had kids together. As much as I hated the Phantom Menace for all its flaws and Ja Ja Binkses, It towers above this movie as the plot makes absolutely no sense what so ever as a carry on from episode VI. I had been looking forward to this film for a long time, but it looks like Disney is just trying to cash in on a well loved franchise with cheap un-humorous jokes without taking in any of the previous films that it is supposed to supersede."
4557,1,Bad,"I hope it was now that Disney has taken your art and legacy and completely destroyed it. Star Wars used to stand for something good. It is now a flag bearer for shame, greed and stupidity."
4558,1,Disappointing,"Bare in mind this is coming from someone who was really never much of a Star Wars fan and has found at least 2/3 of films in the series extremely ""meh"", but I thought 90% of this film was a completely unnecessary and uninspired retread of previous Star Wars material. "
4559,2,Was $4 billion worth it Lucas?,#notmycanon<br /><br />I am not going to say why this is bad. Anyone who is a true fan(also of extended universe) knows it is.
4560,1,How to Sell a Film with its Name,"I was looking forward to it coming out, and despite JJ ruining Star Trek I had hope that maybe, just maybe, he'd do a better job with Star Wars. There were a few standout moments but other than that, to me it felt like just a rehash with nothing new."
4561,1,Fans will know...,Im no mad starwars fan but i appreciated the 6 first episodes. and was looking forward to continue watching them. but i got the feeling now that i might look at them via streaming/download etc long after they were released. just doesn't worth it anymore... divorce for me.
4562,3,Failed to live up to the promise,Warning: this review might contain some forum of spoilers. 
4563,1,"Not as a starwars movie, but simply as a movie? I just didn't like it.",As a lifelong SW fan I was really looking forward to seeing this. The idea of moving back to utilising practical effects and also the news that some of the OT cast were returning sounded great. I didn't rate episodes 1-3 very highly and thought nothing could be worse....I was wrong! Firstly the positives. 1. Daisy Ridley was very good and the opening scenes on Jakku were well filmed. 2. BB-8 was very entertaining in a similar way to Artoo. 3. Han and Chewbacca were amazing as usual. It was great to see the Falcon again. 4. The costumes and effects were great as expected.
4564,3,Visually appealing but that is all,"A little after minute 5 a begin to feel uncomfortable. Towards the end of minute 8 nausea is just around the corner. Minute 10, I begin to vomit. A minute later, again. By minute 16, the bucket is filled and I decide that my guts are more valuable than the crap J.J. Abrams and Disney did. You guys suck!<br /><br />I'm still a fan of Star Wars ... yeah, ... of the old episodes!<br /><br />Hollywood! It's time to start thinking about putting an end to the saga. Don't be so greedy. Do it while you're still at the top. After that, it won't be worth a plugged nickel."
4565,2,Could have been a lot better if it was original!,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS (But if you've seen Episode IV it's OK, this is basically a remake)"
4566,1,Absolute garbage. Wish I could rate it 0.,I had a bad feeling about this...
4567,5,Could have been so much better.,"If you have favorable reflections on Stars Wars as a kid, don't ruin them by wasting your time watching this. "
4568,3,"""Original trilogy"" with superior special effects","Yes, it's better than the prequels. But this film is still not what Star Wars fans have been waiting 30+ years for. Did we really wait 3 decades to see a remake of A New Hope? Because make no mistake, that is what this movie is. Episode VII? Hardly. It's Episode IV 2.0. There's barely a single original plot line in this movie."
4569,2,"Wow, what a disappointment","It got us back into the mood of Star Wars, but wasn't actually original...It's so lazily copied from a New Hope. Probably to blame for some of TLJ's...inconveniences...But The Last Jedi was a good movie, just not a Star Wars movie. This isn't either one, at least not to the fullest."
4570,4,Disappointing,It's actually a 1.5 out of 10...
4571,4,De Ja Vu.,"Nothing is same anymore, instead of making this a ""cream"" on cake, this is a dump on a street! Please stop making movies that you don't understand! I suggest you to watch the movie and see for your self, and learn what is marketing doing to your brain. They made you think that something bad is best!"
4572,1,You will probably be very disappointed.,"Indeed the beginning of the end was when Lucas cashed in and sold to the perennial no-talents and cloners of Disney and because of casting couch Kathleen Kennedy the former secretary got her clutches on the tale of hope and integrity, but this film is the result of the evil that is cash/money/dough."
4573,1,They have destroyed my childhood,"Okay so.. I enjoy Star Wars and lets be honest. Jar Jar is annoying in 1-3 for sure. And yes a young Anakin is cringe in dating for sure. But hey, Muppet Yoda is awful in the original too. I despise this movie because its basically Star Wars a New Hope. The main character is on a desert planet and they bring back all your hero's from the original to make you hate them. Who is the First Order?? I mean Star Killer Base?? Its just another Death Star, but not even cool. The hero just stumbles from one thing to a next winning everything without needing to try. I mean a hero with zero flaws is boring. Even the bad guy Snape Jr should run. I mean what's the point of training and a hero who just picked up the force and a lightsaber 10 minutes ago will beat ya. I just didn't like it. The acting is fine, the script just sucked. Dumpster fire."
4574,2,The Beginning of The End For Star Wars,"The amount of one star reviews on here are baffling, though not surprising. Of course, this film was never going to live up to everyone's impossible standards and ridiculous expectations, especially considering that not everyone was pleased with Disney buying out Star Wars or J.J. Abrams's involvement to begin with; however, what we got was a marvelously entertaining and emotional, if a little too safe, film."
4575,2,Still waiting for the Force to Awaken...,"Even though please seem to like this one, I really don't. The picture quality is good (and it should be for a modern star wars film) but the story isn't the best, (mostly) fulled with predictable and cliche twists or storyline added with not very good acting (even though the cast has people that had been in the previous quality Star Wars films). While I liked the last 30 minutes or so, the first 1 hour and an half were a pain for me to get through. I gave this an 1 month break and continued for the sake of watching every Star Wars film."
4576,5,"Has character and a sense of fun, but needs its own voice","Taken on its own this is a visually spectacular, entertaining blockbuster. The pace never lets up and the two hours I was in the theatre went by quickly. Kudos to JJ Abrams for recapturing the gritty look of the Star Wars universe, and sparing us Lucas's green-screen abominations."
4577,5,Not good as people say it is,"Let me start out by saying I love Star Wars, I love what JJ Abrams did with the new Star Trek. I had very high hopes for this film. I also would have forgiven pretty much anything if it was just a decent movie (logical script, decent acting). But JJ you broke my heart. The prequels were better, and I hated the prequels. Phantom Menace was yes (cringe, I really hate saying this) better than this film. Here is why the prequels were better 1. Prequels had more respect for what a Jedi is, to a be Jedi you had to be gifted in the force and most importantly train for years to be one. In Star Wars the Force Awakens this is thrown out the window, if you all of a sudden find out you have the force you can a) resist a Sith Lords interrogation b) you know and can use Jedi mind tricks on storm troopers c) defeat a Sith who was previously a Jedi trained by Luke Skywalker. 2. As much as it pains me to say this, the prequels had better plots and better acting. The prequels had original plots that were not completely obvious. Liam Neeson had a presence that nobody in this new film had. Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid were much better villains and even worse Hayden Christensen was better than Adam Driver (I think I am going to cry now, I didn't think there could be a worse performance in a Star Wars film and I like Adam Driver). Adam Drivers Kylo Ren started out really good, that first scene was good, but then he proceeds to have temper tantrums where he slashes computers. As bad as Adam Drivers Kylo Ren was the worst was Domhall Gleeson, who I also have loved in other films (ex machina), his General Hux was so bad it was hard to watch. When he screamed out as the Starkiller sent out the killer beams it was reminiscent of a high school senior giving a graduation speech. He was really poorly cast, the general of the first order should have been cast with someone with more gravitas. Just think if they had used someone like Ian McKellen, or Ian McShane or anyone older than 50. That part really needed an older actor. 3. The prequels had much better lightsaber battles. As much as I loved the new red lightsaber that Kylo Ren had and my god the lightsabers looked so cool, but no one knew how to use them. The lightsaber battles were reminiscent of watching the fake battles at a medieval fair. The last lightsaber battle scene had such potential, a lightsaber battle in the snow, think of the possibilities (snow flakes sizzling off of a lightsaber). What is worse is that they could have been better, sooo much better (Genndy Tartakovsky's ""The Clone Wars"" but live action)."
4578,5,Entertaining - but could and should have been so much more.,"I don't think I can add to this something that has not already been said, but I'm going to try..."
4579,4,I thought there was a new hope but my hope has been destroyed,"Just a remade version of star wars 4, with boring leads, and ruined the hole star wars charm"
4580,1,The prequels seem like all-time classics compared to this... (R.I.P the force),***************THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ********************** 
4581,1,Just so boring,"The truth is I do not like J.J. Abrams. He is a director who does not call me and when I knew he was going to direct, I was disappointed, but when I saw the film, I had a pleasant surprise. Yes, it has the magic of the first three. And not just the magic, it is also well made. Obviously it is not a movie of actors, but still, they are not bad at all. While Oscar Isaac, John Boyega and Adam Driver for me, do not give the casting good."
4582,4,Gearge Lucas please kill J.J Abraham,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I went to see the new movie last night and I was loving it right up until the end, an X-Wing trench run to a vulnerable spot on the death sorry sunkiller base as soon as this happened I was instantly snapped out of the movie and right away it made me look at the movie and yeah JJ has does in Star Wars exactly what he did in Star Trek and rebooted it telling the same story. Don't get me wrong I Love the Trek reboots but I was expecting more from Star Wars. Think I'm wrong? Lets take a look OK starts with Rey left alone on a desert planet (Luke on Tatooine) then BB2 stranded on the same planet (R2D2) with sagely advise being given out by Max von Sydow's character (Obi-Wan), with the secret plans being hidden inside BB8 who has to get back to Lea and this just the beginning we even jam in a new cantina scene the movie carries on like this throughout and that for me just makes foe lazy lazy storytelling by JJ. The new Han Solo role seems to have been divided between Fin and Po I could go on for the whole movie (totally untrained Rey can do Jedi mind control THESE AREN'T THE DROIDS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. A few more things the music and sound effects weren't up to the mark either the Star Wars music is a classic as soon as you hear it you heart speeds up but in the new movie they have a softened down version which is weak and doesn't have the same effect I found it very underwhelming and lack lust even with the Falcon flying around. Kylo-Ren also is about as menacing as two day old semolina pudding the scene where he kills Han to push himself away from the light should of been dark and menacing instead it was totally underwhelming for such a significant event it was just badly acted tbh KR throughout the who movie was weak reminding me CH in ep's 2 & 3. Oh and another waist of space Captain Phasma what a non-sense waist of time character she is. I think once fans get over the hype of a new Star Wars film this one will slot in as the 4th or 5th best yes even for my money the Phantom Menace wasn't bad."
4583,5,What a pleasant surprise,This movie was likely written by trained apes for an audience of 7 year olds. They really sold out the franchise with this one. Where did this empire come from?
4584,4,It's a NEW HOPE again!!!! (Contains Spoilers),"This is just another movie which is suffering from ""Fast and Furious"" syndrome. You don't really need a plot or a story of any kind. As long as you have mindless action for no reason and lots of flashy bits then the masses will be entertained like mindless children. I am a life long Star Wars fan and I when I saw this movie, it made me hate the original movies. Hell, even John Williams knew the movie sucked which is reflected in the soundtrack. Everything that the Rebels accomplished in the original trilogy was wasted. It meant absolutely nothing because in J.J. Abrams movie, nothing is different. Nothing has changed. Luke should have rebuilt the Jedi order by now but after one failure he apparently says ""Screw it! I'm done!"" The only reason this garbage pile of a film got so many good ratings on sites like Rotten Tomatoes is due to the fact that Disney hyped it up as much as they could, precisely to do that - to have all the casuals and Pro-Disney fanboy drones sit there drooling while they ""oohed and aahed!"" at all the new & shiny CGI with the SW logo lazily slapped on it. Many casuals and Pro-Disney fanboys like to say, ""B-b-but it got good ratings on RT so, it's a good movie!"" yet they ignore the fact that public opinion of this film has changed from ""all-positive"" to mostly mixed or bad opinions now. They conveniently like to pretend that everyone still feels the same about this film when in reality, most people have woken up from their hype-induced coma and are now seeing this film for what it really is - a poor man's, watered down rehash of 'A New Hope' with scattered bits of the other OT films scattered in there and bits and pieces from the EU novels sprinkled on top to fool all the casuals and fanboys into believing that it was ""new & original"" material.﻿ There are too many ""fans"" for a Star Wars sequel to fail. Fans will blindly defend their brands, and like Stockholm Syndrome will continue defending them when exposed to the truth. Disney knew this going into the deal. And worst of all the ""geeks"" will compulsively buy anything licensed with their brand. So you can either have a new movie without a geek fan base to reap money off, or buy a huge fan base to exploit, and that's what Disney did. They saw The Hunger Games female action chick trend, and used Star Wars as their Hunger Games clone.﻿ Massive plot holes large enough to hide an aircraft carrier, poor script writing, painfully repetitive plot, unfunny comedic moments... The list goes on and on. The difference between me and other people who've said the same thing is I won't be watching Episodes 8, 9,10 where the majority of you will still give Disney your money.﻿ To be honest, I would rather watch a Jar Jar Binks movie directed by George Lucas than to see another J.J.Abrams monstrosity.﻿"
4585,1,Not a single original idea,"Clearly, Lucas wasn't thinking at all except with the immature mind of a 6 year old boy who cant see outside the box. It was bad enough that he pulled a Ripley Scott type of Formulaic copy of his previous movies. Instead of progress in the story line to a better Republic with our original actors all happy and doing well, Lucas goes right back to another Death Star, another Emperor, another ridiculous Darth generation, the same old ""hide secrets in the robot"" while the clones chase them down and the same old resistance fighting them. As if they never defeated the Empire in episode VI. Not to mention the same old Shield power source ploy and a weakness in the death star for the fighters to shoot at. It is like watching a condensed reboot of episodes IV-VI all over again."
4586,4,Darth Disney strikes again!,"Woke film no content, cliche feast, don't bother, its just cliche woke film"
4587,4,What was Lucas Thinking?,"This boring pastiche was a weak attempt at rebooting Star Wars in order to suck money out of the franchise for decades. Unfortunately, they do not make sense and it created dissonance with the previous 6 episodes.<br /><br />Star Wars RIP"
4588,1,Woke media,All this film is a fart in the wind
4589,2,no no no and NO,"To begin, the CGI and practical effects are what USUALLY nauseate me in the failures of epic film making (e.g. The Hobbit). Surprisingly, Star Wars: The Force Awakens did quite well in this respect in both their use of CGI and practical effects. This makes the whole setting of the star wars universe much easier to accept and digest."
4590,2,Fart In The Wind,"What do producers think.. that viewers are idiots. Straight from the start this movie was upsetting.. Things like stepping outside in the wind and holding up a drink bottle in the air, tapping on it for thirst.. HELLO! There are better ways to play that part or was Rey just plain silly. StarWars is all about being a Jedi and earning a light-saber.. In this movie, you put a light-saber in anyone's hand and they automatically become Jedi trained.. On the good side, it was good to see some of the original characters back. Would have like to see more acting from Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Princess Leia, C-3PO and my favorite little R2-D2. I can go on and on but other reviews have already covered it.. If your a StarWars fan then you will be disappointed. StarWars has been destroyed.."
4591,5,A mixed opinion,I own all the movies including the new Rogue One. However with episode 7 I got it as an unwanted gift and returned it the next day. I have three different versions of the original series the prequels on bluray and bought rogue one on release day. I own all the clone wars and Rebels. I got rid of this movie as soon as I possibly could. There is nothing good about this.
4592,3,Disappionted,"I didn't know exactly what to expect but when ""Star Wars"" is in the title, you would expect it to be at least half-ways decent."
4593,4,I own all stars wars movies except this one. This one does not exist to me,This is my first ever review on any movie on IMDb. So this means it's serious. So without spoiling it much here it goes:
4594,3,Star Wars for the politically correct generation,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens, REVIEW. Yesterday I saw the 3D version. The 3D effects, sound, music, action were great. BUT there were just too many, seen that done that scenes. The so called darkside characters are NOT frightening at all and appear as a weak shadow of Darth Vader. Several scenes with British actors and their thick accent makes it impossible to understand what they are saying. The basic story line appears to be the same as the first Star Wars. The Bad guys have a NEW advanced weapon, The Death Star. The resistance are attacked and they counter attack the Death Star. Better CGI, but very familiar flight path. Then you have the same, my father, my sister, my brother, connections. When I saw this I said ""UGH""! Carrie Fisher was in the movie but her spirit was not there! As interesting to watch and listen to as paint drying. Where is Luke SKYWALKER? His total time on screen, maybe 30 seconds! Otherwise an exciting adventure film if you enjoy explosions, chase scenes, spacecraft and have no interest in a NEW story."
4595,4,Guess the episode,The art of taking the world's most imaginative story and universe to the galaxy's crappiest drab dump a.k.a. Disney's gender switch fart (with a diarrhea because they keep pushing these out) with a short haired 'girl' no one can feel hot for.
4596,5,Same story different actors,"In the dark days of the late 1970's, when the original 'Star Wars' was cast and released, a different wind blew in the area of robot casting. C-3PO was played by a typical blonde-colored cyborg, whereas R2-D2's role went to the Oscar the Grouch's trash can wearing 'droid-face.' In these more enlightened times, J.J. Abrams flips the tables and continues his long trend of strong casting. Much like when he brought in a frat boy to play the camera holder Hud in 2008's 'Cloverfield,' Abrams's does the entire movie industry credit here by casting a Round Droid in the main role."
4597,2,Terrible,"For the first 20 minutes or so, I was intrigued. I liked up through the point where they escaped in the tie fighter. Everything past that point was pretty much awful."
4598,4,"Bold casting, Round Droids *Do* Matter!","So The Force Awakens is basically a reworking of the original A New Hope with a role reversal, and some nostalgic hints of The Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi. "
4599,1,Very unoriginal and extremely disappointing,"10 years after ""The Revenge of the Sith"", which in my opinion was the best. Star Wars ""The Force Awakens"" is back with JJ Abrams as director, which uses a lot of humor in his films. After the best trailer I have ever seen, and the tears that come when the Star Wars letters appear on the screen, I had a big disappointment with this ""remake"" of the original trilogy, where there is a hero, Rey (Luke Skywalker) A villain, Kylo Ren (Darth Vader), a very important character whose future will not be happy, Han Solo (Obi-Wan), and a father and son on a platform, I think we have seen this in other films of the saga. This movie needed to have more George Lucas. The young actors had a very poor performance, and the part we expected, light sabers, turned out to be a disaster, how two ""kids"" who did not even know what a light saber was, lasted for more than 1 minute battle with Kylo Ren, and almost killed him. Even prequels had it better because they were between characters who could use a light saber and had been trained. In conclusion it was not bad at all, because the end can demonstrate a continuation for the next film. I hope Rian Johnson does not follow the example of JJ Abrams"
4600,5,Great Remake Of A Classic Original,"Continuing with the Lucas tradition of ruining Star Wars by nerfing violence and suspense with cartoonishness, this film is extremely CGI heavy, while ignoring the art, magic and realism of puppetry that first defined the essential exoticism of the Star Wars universe."
4601,1,"Star Wars ""The Force Awakens"" was a big disappointment for me, J,J Abrams played safe, and made a ""remake"" of the original trilogy.","This movie was stupid, boring, rehashed, a truly nothing new waste of time. Same old reheated crap done worse and stupid. We watched it on BR, thinking it was going be good as Star Wars should be. We walked out to the kitchen several times in one hour in and got food and snacks so we do something. My wife was texting and my dad was on Pinterest instead of watching the film most of the time. Wow it was just a rip off. Rent something better instead....."
4602,1,"Under-written, overproduced, and derivative","Some awful casting, bad acting especially by John Boyega, weak character development, and it relied on Star Wars cliches rather than a good original story."
4603,2,Disney inserts a million childish and lame jokes and one-liners into so-called 'Star Wars',At least they cast many of the original actors from the first trilogy. Not just Han and Leah but
4604,2,"Even for a Star Wars Movie, It was Bad",They ruined the lightsaber. This is beyond stupid. All emotions with actors with 0 talent for action and martial arts. Rouge One is better by multiple dimensions. What a waste of money and time.
4605,3,The best part is....,And take your pimp Kathleen with you.
4606,1,The worst star wars movie,"The movie looks good visually and is well acted. That is the extent of its saving grace. This movie is almost entirely a remake of A New Hope. Instead of the Rebels vs the Empire, you have the Resistance vs the First Order. Instead of the Death Star, you have Starkiller. The names aren't even original. You have the newbie to the force standing up to the seasoned villain. The only difference is that Rey is exceptionally good at the force and fighting with a lightsaber right off the bat. What? It took Luke, the greatest Jedi of all time, 3 movies to develop the amount of skill she has. This is explained, albeit poorly, in Rise of Skywalker. Her first use of the force is a freaking Jedi mind trick? Talk about ridiculous."
4607,2,JJ Abrams BUZZ OFF,"Very boring and bland characters. The protagonist is a Mary Sue, perfect at everything except capturing the audience's interest."
4608,5,The Trilogy that Never Should Have Happened,"The Force Awakens is definitely an entertaining movie, with an entertaining hero, villain, and storyline. The problem is that it is all too familiar."
4609,3,Fell Asleep,But It Is A Fake One<br /><br />It is filmed by a hack<br /><br />All talent and dignity is gone<br /><br />Save us from ugly shorthaired women<br /><br />We want feminine beauty<br /><br />Only ones who disagree are gay men<br /><br />After watching we felt kinda silly.
4610,5,A satisfying addition to the franchise in a format that has already been perfected,"32 years have passed since Return of the Jedi! 32 years without a decent StarWars movie, in depth and fidelity (like many, I didn't appreciate much the three prequels for the same reasons many didn't), something that with Episode VII and all the rant reviews it's was getting, had ended, thinking to myself ""StarWars has returned apparently. Hurra!"". So there I go, excited and spirited, with my two friends to see the great comeback of StarWars. Do note, my review is a bit of a rant against StarWars lore treason committed in Ep VII. Not enough space for all the other not so nasty things! The film starts of well for the first 10 minutes or so. I even discard Max von Sydow line that ""without Jedi there can be no balance to the Force"". Who is this character (we never find out) and what does he know of the Force!!! Moving along, comes the villain, entering Vader's fashion in the movie, asking Sydow about #item, just like Vader to the captain of the ship in Ep IV. Too many memories I guess. Then someone fires a blaster shot to the villain and something happen that I never had seen before in many movies and StarWars games. The villain freezes in suspended animation (I guess) the blaster shot in mid-air, Matrix style! It's in this moment I sense a great disturbance in the Force, telling me something terrible wrong is about to happen in the next two hours! 20 min or so after, the two new heroes escape a First Order incursion (and a Star Destroyer by the way) aboard the Millennium Falcon, but they failed to the same against a transport/smuggling vessel command by non-other than Han Solo and Chewie, who RANDOMLY picks them on. What a small galaxy hey?! The main objective of our new heroes is to contact the ""Resistance""! I asked o myself ""just to whom is this ""Resistance"" resisting?"" Because, it is said in the movie that the Republic has a massive fleet and that they support the ""Resistance"" against the First Order. Political context is not at all explained. Apparently the last 32 years have been quite a drag so no need to mention anything. Han helps them contacting the ""Resistance"", by taking them to another character who knows loads of the Force, yet is no Force user! Remember, in the original trilogy, the Force was something very few people believe or eared about. Remember Solo saying, I had never seen or eared anything in is travels about a mystical force the rules everything and everyone, and nothing like a blaster shot?! Or the officer aboard the Death Star who questions Vader's efficiency, ""Spare us of your sorceries Lord Vader! Your sad devotion to that ancient religion "". Why does everyone suddenly is an expert on the Force! Hate it! Moving along, passing the obvious symmetries with Episode IV mentioned by everyone, we stand fighting another super-uber-weapon! This time is a massive cannon installed on a planet that uses it's very core as a catalyst (I think). Oh and also harness the light/energy of the sun nearby COMPLETELY! It fires a shot and hits 5 planets at once, utterly destroying them, all this from another corner OF THE GALAXY! Has you see, it's a great improvement over the Death Star I and II, with their fire and range limitations. Also, it could provide a great fireworks spectacle to every inhabitant of the galaxy, from Coruscant to Takodana (wherever it is). Yeap, it's that bad. I think screen writers and directors don't understand the concept of ""creative license"". The confuse it with ""impossible fantasy""! At this moment I hate the film, I am weeping inside thinking to myself, ""StarWars has I thought it was doesn't exist anymore"", and still I have 45 min of movie to go ! Returning to the Force, on the enemy's planet the new prodigy/chosen is held captive. It escapes using mind trick techniques. This individual didn't even new she was sensitive to the Force, and yet here she is using it as proficiently as Obi-Wan! The pound of tears under my seat grows thick! Then the final fight, a guy who can stop a laser blast in mid-air and freeze completely an opponent, among other things, can't hold against a deserter Stormtrooper (non-force sensitive), and a girl whom until few hours didn't knew she was a force sensitive at all. The villain had displayed formidable powers already, so why not use them in this fight? Because he was wounded? Doesn't a Jedi's (or sith) strength flows from the Force like Yoda taught us? Sad, truly sad! The bad guy eventually defeats the ST, but this is tag fight, and now it's the prodigy's turn. Oh yes, she ""summons"" Luke's lightsaber (that apparently has will of it's own, just like the one ring), and prepare for battle. Firstly she is at odds but then get's the upper hand of the match, giving the bad guy a nasty face cut, and possibly cutting is hand or leg (couldn't quite see)! All this without any training whatsoever!!! I hate you Disney! Deeply sadden after realizing that StarWars loyal to the original will never be again, I get ""blessed"" with a last candy. Finding Luke's location, the prodigy sets on the Millennium Falcon to go to him. They set lightspeed and take approximately 5 seconds to cross what seems to be half the galaxy or more. Just which road Han Solo took in Ep IV to reach Aldeeran, I would like to know, because it took him hours to do that with the Millennium Falcon. These are just glimpses and so much more is untold in this review, and I could wright a book about what's wrong with StarWars today, but I am tired, mostly from waiting for anything true and faithful to it's origins, and done. Ep VII has my last hope! StarWars as I knew it it's gone for good."
4611,2,Star Wars Is Back,"I've familiarized myself with JJ.Abrams' style of directing in the previous years and wasn't thrilled when I heard he'll be directing this movie. I also wasn't thrilled when I heard the rights for Star wars were sold to Disney. Still it's better than nothing, right? Right...anyway, the lack of George Lucas is very obvious. Say what you want about him, but that man is special, he brought something unique that was even in the prequels. That special ingredient is missing in this movie. It feels...generic. It feels exactly like a copy made by students, made with great love, but who would never reach the greatness of the master. Is it a bad movie? Certainly no. It has more than enough to keep you entertained. But I kept waiting for the moment when the real fun will begin. That moment didn't happen. Perhaps it's going to happen in the next movies. But I wanted so much more from this."
4612,4,A last hope... Gone forever!,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad plot and worst of all, it started the worst trend ever in the film industry---destroying Star Wars!!! Please stop pretending anything called Star Wars is good anymore."
4613,1,Pretty much what I expected,"My one expectation going into this movie was that it would be better than the prequels, which were abysmal. It failed even in that regard."
4614,2,JJ Abrams = hack,"When I first found out JJ Abrams was helming this ship I set my sights a little lower. And I'm disappointed to say I was not disappointed. As a moviegoer I don't mind Abrams, he's especially good at making entertaining and well-crafted movies that make money. But as a fan of an existing ""movie universe"" I knew the end-product would be unoriginal. If there were such things as a conveyor belt / assembly line that could manufacture movies Abrams' model would surely be the very top of its class."
4615,1,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Return on the Investment,"Who cares about film, story, acting or character development?"
4616,5,Completely unoriginal albeit entertaining enough,"I was disappointed because I heard that Star Wars is back, but I wasn't impressed with most of the actor and actress choices. Also it was pretty cheesy in some areas. The story lacked in many areas and was copied from the previous material. It just was a bit disappointing. I didn't hate it but didn't love it."
4617,2,Buy Made In China Merchandise!,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This is zero-talent hackey trash that Disney threw together with duct tape and bubble gum at the last minute. The story is contradictory to the original content, the acting is embarrassingly bad, and the cinematography is literally just copying old scenes from the original trilogy. I want the two hours of my life I spent watching this dumpster fire back."
4618,3,They rebooted it so they can sell us the same thing all over again,"This film is a cover act with no originality or soul.<br /><br />Star Wars was a classic of film and cinema,"
4619,1,Trash movie from a trash company,"Without doubt the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. There is no way that anyone looked at this films script and thought anything other than the amount of money they would make on a terrible film. How it has such high reviews I have no idea. I'm half expecting some sort of protest or parliamentary legislation to come through giving everyone a full refund out of the dirt bag money grabbing creators own pockets. So much expectation and ignorance from me and any other disappointed fans on release day but to anyone who considers buying the DVD after the general view of the film has come out, it's your own fault. If my own mother was on her last legs and had only 2 hours and 15 minutes left to live and wanted me to sit and watch it with her while she slowly passed, I would let her die on her own rather than watching this film again. Very very annoyed, countless inconsistencies, rushed story and very poor acting. Ruined star wars"
4620,1,Do you like original bands or cover version tribute cloners?,"Derided Hollywood ho J. J. Abrams directs and co-writes this remake installment. I remember watching the original with my best friend years ago and fell in love. We agreed that film was a masterpiece. What an exciting movie. Although not being a faithful follower, my perspective on The Force Awakens is that it is The farce Awakens and makes money for Disney. It leaves a lot to be desired."
4621,1,utter money making bull,I was so looking forward to this Sequel The story was weak and no real depth mostly relying on the originals to take the film forward. Rey's character was way to much she seemed to jump straight to master jedi with no training. Then we had Finn a sopposedly programmed stormtrooper with feelings escaping with ease At this point the film seemed to be reaching and desperate. This star wars is a watch once unfortunately Star wars has become nothing more than a money maker now.
4622,2,This Is Not Star Wars,"The whole sequel is a nightmare, Disney took away the meaning of universal foundations, No meaning for lightsabersm, light travel, Luke, this is a nightmare."
4623,4,Poor Sequel - Great Money Maker,"Almost 3 years ago.... seems like yesterday when I was watching the trailers and thinking... ""that looks good... is it possible that Disney gets this right?"" WRONG! Little did I realise what a hack and copycat JJ Abrams is, what a PC full of arrogance and BS corporation Disney is.... I was of course worried when I roamed the Disney stores and I saw Chewie dolls and cute stormtroopers. Yet they displayed constantly the trailers and they kept on increasing my hype and I found myself thinking ""this could be REALLY good!"""
4624,1,Disney has no idea,** REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS **
4625,1,"The first NOT Star Wars of the ""new era""","The Force Awakens is a decent movie. Nothing more nothing less. It sticks close to the expected formula, and rarely deviates. It is enjoyable to watch and often times quite breathtaking."
4626,2,First Time Star Wars Has Made Me Angry,"Lets start with the fact that surprisingly, the movie is not ""a total disaster"" as Donald Trump would say. It manages to entertain and in some minor ways surprise. But lets face it, if anyone says this is the episode seven they were hoping for, you can probably bet they are employed in some degree by the Walt Disney Corporation. Even George Lucas isn't a fan of this flick, but he has room to complain after selling out Star Wars to Disney, and making the prequel trilogy (ie Jar Jar Binks and Darth Vader's classic ""NOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo""."
4627,5,A Review of Episode 7,"I will not leave spoilers and I do encourage people to see it but don't expect much. The film is not original as it mainly copy/pasted the plot from episode 4, added a lot of human characters and minimized the alien population by a fourth or what we were used to."
4628,5,"Episode VII: Just good enough to continue the financial exploitation, AKA we're going to build a yuuuge Death Star and the fans are going to pay for it bigly","Stop feeding Disney, Mr Rip Off and all these weak and stupid remakes and reboots and sequels. They suck. Really."
4629,5,mhe! Was expecting more,Did I just get scammed? I work hard for my money and YOU KNEW we would go see it day 1. The most anticipated sequel in HISTORY AND YOU GIVE US THIS
4630,2,"What is wrong with you, people?","Movie is good entertainment, but in terms of story line its copy of Episode IV. "
4631,1,"I paid for a new SW movie, got A New Hope re-skinned","When this movie came out in 2015 I enjoyed it. I didn't know anything really about the story of Star Wars and how rich the history and storytelling is. However the Mandalorian changed all of that. Once season 2 came out, I knew I had to rewatch all of the prequels, OG trilogy, and watch the Clone Wars and Rebels - all in chronological order. What a masterpiece of a story George Lucas and Dave Filoni have told, with the help of John Favreau. The characters are well written, and the only really downfall is maybe the dialogue of the prequels. But the acting is great, the new characters of the clone wars, rebels, and Mando are tasteful and add to the story."
4632,5,Episode IV Awaken again,"Visually pleasing and more story than in some episodes, but still a star wars film. In other words: war, battles, fights, sabre duels, etc. Fun for 5 minutes, but not for the main part of a 2 hour movie. Good follow up for Darth Vader though"
4633,2,People who don't watch Star Wars love this movie. I did until I watched the Mandalorian and animated shows,"Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves and return any profit to the poor suckers that paid to see this mess. Would have given a 1, but they did land Chewie."
4634,5,War war war and a little story.,"Deja vu<br /><br />I've just been in this place before<br /><br />Higher on the street<br /><br />And I know it's my time to go<br /><br />Calling you, and the search is a mystery<br /><br />Standing on my feet<br /><br />It's so hard when I try to be me, woah"
4635,3,No Thanks to remakes,"I remember being very disappointed with this movie. The trailers definitely had everyone amped. But then watching this, it was really clear, we were watching a re-hash of earlier Star Wars films. JJ Abrams with his trademark lens flares didn't even try to create anything new or special, just another Death Star story.<br /><br />The worse part was Rey. No character arc at all. She just magically becomes a pilot capable of flying the Millenium Falcon, AND a jedi fighter on par with Kylo, who supposedly had a lot of training under Skywalker. No build up, no learning. She was instant hero. A sign of our times. Even Luke didn't become an expert fighter after 3 films, and Rey was able to fend off someone trained as a Jedi. And why does Kylo need to wear a mask? Is it because he so damn ugly? Because that doesn't make sense either. Just another Darth Vader rip-off character, but without rhyme or reason."
4636,5,Deja vu,This is just a copycat of a new hope with different characters. The same plot twist and the same desire to kill a main character at about the same time as a new hope did. A poor start to a very poor trilogy.
4637,3,"Disappointing (Not As Disappointing As Phantom Menace, Though)","No script no movie, it's unbelievable how they came out with such a bad and childish script, they had so many choices and choose this one,i can't understand... this movie has at metascore 80???? 80 ??? Really?? And after that we should consider the metascore a serious site?"
4638,5,Copycat,Trashy remake
4639,1,Has no soul,Disney/Bad Robot/Jar Jar Abrams suck.
4640,2,Disney's attempt to shove more Made in China Merch,I won't bore IMDb users with the plot as it's been mentioned enough times. All I will add is the seventh installment in the Star Wars saga features one of the funniest moments I've ever seen in a motion picture: Rey battling the evil Kylo Ren.
4641,2,This is why I WIll not watch Episode 9,"Typical modern blockbuster, full of lame jokes, no surprises and invincible characters hurtling towards an ending that only services sequels. "
4642,4,The Force Awakens has one of the funniest scenes of all time,"The whole movie was like watching Jar jar Binks for 2.25h.. Everything looked like garbage, just look at Chewbacca what happened there? And Chewbacca did not fire a single shoot until the last min of the movie, thanks for the support Chewbacca! I thought that Episode 1 was bad.. But this movie took the price! If you are one of the soulless piece of ""garbage"" that liked this movie, I will be happy to tell you that you will all burn in hell. $11 Millions in budget for episode 4. $200 Millions in budget for this ""garbage"". How? HOW?!!!! I love star wars! Sure episode 1,2,3 was bad.. but they were OK. This was just so bad. The only good thing I can tell you about the movie was the opening screen was the same and it gave me chills, the rest of the movie I had chills.. chills of regret and disappointment."
4643,2,Dull,I'm ashamed of being a Star Wars fan after seeing this movie now.
4644,1,"This movie was ... a piece of ""garbage""",Spoiler Alert in my review.
4645,1,Disney took the whole Star Wars franchise and flushed it down the toilet!,But I did not. I am not sure what this JJ Abrams guy has that makes people hire him again and again. I was bored and wanted to get up and leave.
4646,1,Slight more watchable than Episode 3.,"The movie is entertaining, it has great visual effects and a lot of action. But it lacks the most important thing... a plot."
4647,3,Obviously many people liked it,Enough remakes and sequels Disney. It is too much. Enough is enough already.<br /><br />Also the main actress (it is a gender switch film) is poor.
4648,4,"Great visual effects, lacks the plot, lot of racism","I just discovered the star wars legends lore. It seems to be way better than what came out of disney's pure economical move, and I can't see the reason they didn't use at least parts of it."
4649,2,Enough remaking Disney,Complete and utter lack of dignity for all involved. No integrity. No respect. No self-awareness.
4650,1,Trash story,"Well, the first part of the movie is about ... the main protagonists meeting and then separating and meeting again. It really has this Harry Potter taste to it. It makes you want to feel that these characters are connected, but if they are it doesn't happen in this movie. The other part consists of pretty shots of dead spaceships in da desert and some terribly plastic epic moments of returning actors. "
4651,2,Dis-gus-ting,"I'm a big fan of Star Wars but this? Is just pure trash, I can't believe they agreed over the screenplay, I'll not blame the actors, maybe they did their best but the story was very chaotic and tedious. I'll not watch the other movies, I don't have faith in J. J. Abrams anymore."
4652,5,mediocre,"""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but also the clearest expression of mediocrity"". Yep someone said that somewhere...can't remember who or where, but they do deserve credit, because in a way it perfectly encompasses the case of Jar Jar Abrams and ""Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens"" and his overlords at Darth Disney."
4653,1,Very Bad Story with Bland Characters,"It's no secret that most of Lucas's Star Wars films stank. It's easy to criticize so I'll reveal what I think made ""A New Hope"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Phantom Menace"" so great: Great characters and stories were allowed to be themselves. There wasn't a big concern with forcing a story to ""fit"" into a fan universe. It's fiction. It doesn't have to make perfect sense. "
4654,4,The Force Awakens...A New Hope?!,"Otherwise,this film killed my appetite and interest in Star Wars. This film is genuinely bad. It is unoriginal, boring, and the actors and actresses make high school dramas look professional in comparison.<br /><br />Forgive me Chinese manufacturers of Disney toys, forgive me, but I cannot support this film, this stupid trilogy, JJ Abrams who is a complete money hungry tool or Disney. It is game over."
4655,2,Not as bad as Lucas would have done it,"This movie was literally a remake of A New Hope. The story was technically the same but different characters which are not convincing at all. And to think people hated the prequels oh they were wrong!!! The movie could be entertaining but for being the first movie of the new trilogy it definitely let so much to be desired. The other huge mistake was that the 3 main stars (Han, Solo, Leia) did not interact with each other being that this was going to be the last chance for them to be together in a film."
4656,1,I WIll Watch Episode 9 if I happen to stumble on it on TV,"After all the hype, I left underwhelmed. I'm not sure how we got from Return of the Jedi to where Episode VII takes up, it doesn't make a lot of sense and it's not explained. "
4657,4,A New Hope 2.0,"Think of all the directions they could have taken this film in, all the possibilities, and what did they do? Reset all timelines and wiped the achievements of the previous 6 films."
4658,5,Meh,"Action scenes is a fundamental part of all starwars movies, but making a sith loose a fight against a stormtrooper(who fights bad enough to loose a fight another stormtrooper proving no force whatsoever) is just making the movie like a gma tomato"
4659,1,It all started here,But read my review first!<br /><br />I mean yes it sucks and it is a cloned borefest et cetra but frankly it could be worse. The girl could be tattooed and pierced be 2015 jumbo. So at least there is that. It is not like she is pretty or anything but they spared us from a Last Jedi type disaster. So 2 out of 10 instead of 1 out of 10 because it pretty much blows.
4660,1,disgrace,Not a very compelling or consistent storyline. Despite good will I just couldn't get on board with it.
4661,2,It Is Not As Bad As Everyone Says,But when will Chewbacca be given the credit he deserves for being a hero
4662,5,Don't Believe the Hype!!,"This episode seems to have used the same storybooks from previous episodes. Only some minor modifications and even worse - a civilization capable to build a high tech weapon is not able to secure it with the simplest methods. Being a little unrealistic is of course a privilege of Science Fiction but this ... a single person could switch off all protection shields. Oh no. Hopefully for the next episodes they may invest some budget for a clever story. Here , it tastes like the third boiling of a tea bag. All in all - boring. However, the special effects are cool, worth 4 stars"
4663,1,Best of a bad bunch,"Boycott the so-called director, the producer and the cast.<br /><br />Definitely boycott Disney+"
4664,4,Just another death star - boring,"1)<br /><br />Jar Jar Abrams is now and forever anathema.<br /><br />I shall never watch anything of his again, and downvote everything he makes without watching it."
4665,2,BOYCOT!!!!!!!,"There are few movies that I had to take a break from for how ridiculous and absurd they are. There are too many plot holes to count, the action is mediocre and is the rehash of episode 4 but with everything bigger and shinier."
4666,1,Unforgivable. Nothing makes sense. It doesn't even try to. There is no storytelling. No buildups to anything. No twists. No nothing.,"At least cast a pretty woman that is pretty, is wearing a short skirt, heels and has long hair at least."
4667,2,Horrible,Well it's a bad movie anyway but John Boyega continues to ruin Star Wars.<br /><br />His wooden personality and role adds nothing to the story. He should stick to his London gang movie roles where he just walks like a ruuudeboy and suck his lips alot acting bad.
4668,2,"Look if You Have No Story, no characterd evelopment and are rebooting","Shallow cliché rehashed scenes from the original trilogy intended to just get you off - leaves you feeling unsatisfied and a little dirty. John Williams music serves the appropriate backdrop of bow chicka bow bow. Does a Death Star turn you on? How bout a really big Super Death Star? Just destroy me baby. Are you there yet? Almost... there? Don't worry, we have Han Solo playing the pool boy saying all the right lines that you like. Yeah, someone even has daddy issues. Oh, and there's plenty of pointless light saber smacking. Thank you sir may I have another. I can't wait for the next Star Wars installment: Deep Space - Rey Does Dagobah. You know you want to watch."
4669,1,John Boyega's acting ruins the movie.,"Droid carrying vital information for the good guys being hunted by the bad guys on a desert planet falls into the hands of a force sensitive wannabe Jedi. Bad guys have a huge spherical planet killing super weapon. Wannabe Jedi comes into contact with friendly older mentor figure, older mentor figure gets killed by sith bad guy near the end, planet killing super weapon destroyed using X wings. Like a dodgey, black and white photocopy of the original, very disappointing."
4670,1,Star Wars Porn - Rey Does Dagobah,On this universe and put Star Wars out of its misery (or are they calling Star killer base nowadays??)?
4671,1,"Lazily written, poorly directed and shameless rip off of the first and original Star Wars",Terrible shallow crap from a known remaker/rebooter!
4672,2,Could somebody Unleash a Galaxy Killing Death Star (Galaxy Star?),Am I the only one who sees the resemblance from A new hope?
4673,2,You See Mr Rip Off Abrams' name on a movie... run!,"The disappointment is relative to expectations based on following the initial pre-disney movies. One would expect at least a fresh, new story exactly because it was bought over by a separate entity, they should then have taken this awesome concept and tapped into its almost infinite potential. In addition to the movie, so much literature has come out of the whole Star Wars phenomenon, and so much more. But did Disney do the smart thing and risk themselves on a ""new"" road? NO. THIS IS A REBOOT OF EPISODE 4 and an extremely poor one at that. Its really sad seeing how many people let that fly miles over their heads, but you can draw an almost exact parallel between both, from start till end, except that now instead of one white male protagonist, its one woman and a black person, which I think is both racist and sexist because it seems to insinuate an equality, that it takes a woman and a black person to compensate for one white male, ticking off two elements on their list of ""must haves"" to make the right people happy.<br /><br />Where in previous non-Disney Star Wars movies one couldn't help but realize the massive and epic size of George Lucas's universe, Disney brought that scale down to a more ""local"" feeling, now it just feels like some vague sci-fi action movie with non-stop CGI, where the overall focus is more on a planet by planet perspective instead of being much more in the background with a more general stellar overview.<br /><br />An absolute waste of time, just watch the last digitally mastered version of Episode 4, much better."
4674,3,Deja vu - A new Hope?,But he left a map of where he is behind. In r2d2...
4675,1,Biggest disappointment ever!,"This movie is just the same script of Episode IV, but told in a different way, really. There's nothing new, nothing impressive, no cool vehicles like AT-ST'S at least, nothing. It has made me ask my self if I am a still a Star Wars fan. Ten years we waited, just to see no Jedi's, no land battles, no space battles with big ships, not even a sith because Kylo Ren has not completed his training. It's just a start from scratch for the light side, after 6 movies, and we have never seen the Jedi in all their glory. But it gives a lot of unanswered facts. specially the origin of this new dark side lord, or even the origin of the new heroin. For the first time in many years, I'm not eager to see the next Star Wars movie, I feel disappointed, maybe it would have been better to leave it in six movies. Frack Disney, frack J.J. Abrams, and frack that cheap and lame script."
4676,2,He does not want to be found,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a completely average sci-fi film. It's not a waste of money to see at the theater since it has huge action scenes made for the big screen but all these folks who are saying this is anything higher than a 6 out of 10 are just fooling themselves. Anytime a film does two things it is almost always over hyped. 1. over- saturate the market; toys, commercials, food branding etc. 2. bring back previous characters to help carry the story; the story isn't strong enough to survive on it's own so they need cameo's and nostalgic character plots to help bring the story along. The new Stars Wars is actually just like a new hope which tells me it only exists to maximize profit without any respect for the franchise. George Lucas must be trying to buy an island because this movie carries the same ""meh"" feeling the second trilogy accomplished. At this point the over-saturation of the new Star Wars is just becoming annoying and these stellar reviews will surely decrease as the weeks pass. The film is average and the hype is off the charts. With the market over- saturated with super heroes and reboots this star wars will fall somewhere in the oblivion of making a fast buck flick."
4677,5,"The Force ""Aweakens"".","That is what this clone film is about. Star Wars fans, movie buffs and people with self-respect should stay away. Fans of girls who are not attractive should consider this film though. In fact, this whole galaxy does not have a single sexy woman. At least, the girl was not 'diverse' i.e. fat."
4678,5,Completely Average Sci-Fi,"J.J. Abrams was confused about which space movie he was creating. Star Wars is about the inner conflict of the characters. These inner conflicts interact to either bring out the best in each other or the worse. The is always the struggle against darkness. This struggle for the light is the most challenging. Each saga doesn't require a happy ending, but an honest ending reflecting this conflict. In Star Trek the conflict is with society and communal responsibility to the whole.<br /><br />The only movie that captured the heart of Star Wars is recent years under a Disney is 'Rogue One'. The recent Star Wars are not even loyal to the Disney classics which deal with loss pain and redemption. J.J. Should have watched movies from the Disney Vault Such as 'Bambi' and 'Lion King' which dealt with themes found in classic Star Wars."
4679,3,Return On Investment metric,Makes You Hate DISNEY
4680,1,I finally figured out what went wrong,"So, I should have stayed and watched the film to the end. Ill say that upfront because I don't think this review will carry as much weight as I didn't get the whole story. However, I found the film a tad difficult to follow, which for some is good because it keeps you thinking. Going in and expecting the old characters to come back and seeing them was nostalgic and refreshing, BUT I really didn't like the fact they killed off Han Solo so quickly. If it going to be a trilogy (as most films are nowadays) I think that was done a tad prematurely. It felt like you got comfortable again with the franchise and then poop- another one bites the dust."
4681,2,Down With Di$$$ney,Thought it was good the first time i watched it but the more i watched it the more i realized its trash
4682,5,Star Wars- The Force Awakens not a lot with me.,"OK for the Star Wars New Hope remake oops, I meen the Force Awakens it was good but not the original Star Wars but better than the prequels. All it was was exchanging characters for the old ones and making a remake of A New Hope. So they exchange Luke for the new girl Rey, Han for Obi-Wan and yes he meets the same fate as Obi, Luke is now Yoda, and Fin as the new Han Solo. Ren as Vadar who does not have the screen presence as Vadar has had with no darkness as Vadar or the Emperor have put on screen and put them in place of our beloved characters from A New Hope and you have the force awakens. The acting was so-so at best except for the old crew excellent as always. Yes there was practical effects but not as much as JJ promised with cgi all over the place including a character that made them look out of place in the universe. Do not get me wrong it is a good possibly great movie for those not familiar of the original trilogy but to those that grew up with this it is Deja Vu and nothing more than a glorified remake. It is good but still love the originals through and through. This is to warn those like me that believed the advertisements of something new and original and only received a remake."
4683,1,Trash,"I'm really conflicted about this movie. There are some really nice parts of this movie from the cinematography to a few of the action scenes. However, I have to say that overall, I was really disappointed. I think the film hit a double when it could have hit a home run. "
4684,4,The New hope remake slight spoiler,"Terrible story line. Can't believe they have this incredible opportunity to have Luke, Leia and Han reunited and completely throw it away. To have Han murdered by his own son with characters watching on who didn't even know him and Leia reacted as if she did not really care. Would have preferred no star wars remake to the awful story lines they have come up with for the new films."
4685,5,Missing Some Emotional Beats,Or Daisy on JJ's casting couch? Was it a love triangle?
4686,1,Awful,"""The Force Awakens,"" is better than some of the Star Wars movies (""Solo"" for instance) and worse than many others. The story is well written. The acting is good for the most part. I like Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn). They both play strong characters and are fun to watch. Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) on the other hand, is excruciating to watch in anything. Driver delivers all of his lines in a flat, monotone, expressionless way. One could say that is the character he is playing, Kylo Ren. However, I have seen Driver in other movies and everything is the same: expressionless and emotionless. It is quite painful to watch."
4687,1,Was JJ on Kathleen's casting couch?,Cloned Scam Wars maybe!
4688,5,"Better than some, worse than others","Don't believe the hype. Disney's secret agents are probably busy buying positive reviews to counter the genuine opinions of actual viewers, and 2 billion dollars says they are doing something right - and killing SW in the process.<br /><br />The problem is not that they ""disrespect"" the SW universe. The SW universe could withstand a lot of new ideas/characters/plot twists, and still stand. New ideas. Creative ideas. But not the idiocy and/or neglicence of writers and directors who know nothing about storytelling or simply don't care enough to come up with a plot that doesn't fall apart in a nanosecond.<br /><br />It's the fact that they disrespect the intelligence of viewers on a whole new level. Everyone in this movie behaves irrationally, and every ""new"" idea is a rip-off based on old ideas, only executed in an illogical and idiotic fashion, with the single goal of reproducing some supposedly ""great"" moments from the old movies and give the disneyfied audience a reason to cheer in the theater... and forget that movies should actually make some sense.<br /><br />To be honest, the movie has its moments. Like when it ended, I was quite grateful."
4689,2,How Dare They Call This Star Wars??,Say NO to this and other gender switches
4690,1,"Idiot plot. Unoriginal. Hype, hype, hype.","No one would have cared that star wars had a female protagonist (I love Daisey Ridley, I am a fan boy and will tolerate zero disrespect for her). The objections to Rey were not because she was female, it was because the 1st movie was rehashed a new hope and Rey had no journey, she started off the strongest jedi ever and was too perfect, needing no mentor, never failed could do everything instantly. Daisey deserved better."
4691,2,7.9??? Look At The Reviews it should be 1.9!,"After disney took over Star wars from George Lucas, and starter to do this sequels since 2015, i truly try to convince myself this sequel never happened. The movies are so bad, im sorry but the script CANT be defended. It is so bad... like no words."
4692,2,the best of the sequels,"I've never been a fan of Star Wars. In my teens, watching the initial trilogy, I found it uncreative and childish. But it had an interesting ambiance and it recycled very well the themes that were already explored by the cinema of heroes for decades. And have great caracters. A solid 6 for entertainment.<br /><br />In perspective, now comparing with this absolute idiocy with great CGI, the first trilogy seems one of the great moments of the space opera cinema. No character is minimally interesting here, except for Harrison Ford's and perhaps Carrie Fischer's.<br /><br />It's high time to think why Holywood produces such mediocrity fest and abysmal production with no original ideas."
4693,2,I presens this sequel never happened,I was initially hopeful for this movie when I read that it had a strong female lead. But the female character was about the only positive thing which stuck with me. Too much stuff from previous movies are repeated in lower quality ways. And too much was an excessive stretch of both Star Wars and sci-fi.
4694,2,Space opera at its worst. Do you need to graduate in Cinema to make such a bad movie?,"What about Kennedy the producer?? I know they are part of Disney's investor relations team but seriously don't they have feelings, conscience, parents who taught them morals??"
4695,2,Go for Star Wars Legends instead,"J.J. Abraham just made a tribute for ""Star Wars: A New Hope (1977)"" and ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)"", and with reminiscence included. Maybe blame it the script but some important things are missing: -¿Jedi does not need training now? -¿Is the Dark Side weakness now? -¿Only one droid has new technology? -¿A Death Star is only a bigger gun? (for example pull out planet's orbit into the sun is thrilling for hours) -¿Is there another way to destroy a Death Star I, II ,etc? -¿C3P has not job now, everyone is multilingual or the public just learned read subtitles? -Not all is criticize: the storm-troopers now are slaves indoctrinated, just a old empire's would do it, but the First Order discovered it. But, come on!, we expect innovations, ¡the tribute is for dream's protagonist at movie! Just my opinion."
4696,2,How can this JJ guy live with himself?,I have watched all star wars movies many times. When I'm posting this episode IX is already out.<br /><br />There are many many things off about this film that makes me angry. If you want to build a star wars movie at least sit and watch 6 movies before. For example the light sabre of luke skywalker is not the same as the one anikan used. That sabre got lost and luke made a new one. It is just one example of many and it is clear in previous films.<br /><br />I think it was a mockery to the franchise and the creators went to destroy star wars.
4697,5,Making a Tribute.,"I love Star Wars. I've watched every movie and played many of the games. I love it's universe. I didn't like that Disney was behind it, but I coped with it.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining and I won't get in details about performances, effects or things like that. I think there's plenty of critics that talk about it so I won't be original.<br /><br />However, I'm writing this because one thing that I really can't help keeping for myself. The main antagonist is pure garbage. Not Kylo Ren itself, but the First Order.<br /><br />They don't make any sense. How it is possible that the New Republic didn't know what was happening? Come on! They literally just have won a ver hard rebellion with everything against them. Where is the senate? Where is the political part that play a big part in previous movies? Did they just vanished in thin air? Where is the republican army? Seriously, when the republic was at war against the Federation of Commerce and the separatist there were very big battles, many plots at play.<br /><br />In this movie the story is just lazy and formulaic. ""OK, now, OUT OF NOWHERE, we are going to have a powerful but absolutely secretive empire in the darkness with no real reason to exist whatsoever and that strikes so efficiently that put in danger the New Republic in one minute"".<br /><br />With that massive amount of money I believe they can think up something better."
4698,1,Have they even watched the previous ones?,"Jar Jar Abrams plays it safe by abusing the endless well of star wars knowledge that many people still have in their life today.<br /><br />not the worst star wars movie, but probably close to it.<br /><br />The main complaint is how everyone is just supposed to believe that stuff like the clones are just not a thing anymore and that happens off screen (its not cannon anymore). As well how everything the rebellion did during the originals is just casted away and was all for nothing.<br /><br />Leia mourns with REY!!! instead of chewy?<br /><br />This movie is just not enjoyable after watching the entire series again. It feels more disconnected from the other movies, and lacks the bond that the prequels (best movies) and originals had.<br /><br />At best its mediocre as rey is just unfollowble<br /><br />At worst its a pathetic entry into the star wars universe"
4699,5,Lacks of imagination,"​i was so bored in the action scenes. in this creative world with unlimited ideas, i'm kinda tired of Jurassic Park and now Star Wars repeats. even some of the scenes ""felt"" replicated shot for shot. nostalgia is great, and so are re-boots, but re-creating original movies all over again is kinda boring. Solo should been in there for 5 mins instead of 30 mins, and Leia, 1 minute instead of 5.... ZZZZzzzz."
4700,3,nostalgia bait,"This movie is heavily borrowed from Star Wars IV: A New Hope, but with a woman character instead of a man. Tatooine is too overused maybe, so they created a new dessert planet for this character. After the success of the Rebels, they have to create a new Empire. After Vader's death, there is Kylo Ren (so badly written, so cringe-worthy with a 30 years old character). After 2 Death Star being blown, somebody still have a nerve to create Starkiller.<br /><br />I mean, why?"
4701,5,booooorrrrrrre...ing,You can no longer trust IMDB ratings. They are bought and paid for by the studios. Movie after movie is rated 8 and above and are complete disasters. This movie is like a remake by a 10 year old. Just disgusting.
4702,1,A Wannabe New Hope.,This is the beginning of the worst trilogy in the star wars legacy! None of these films should have been made. The actors and actresses were terrible in their performance.
4703,1,One of the worst,"This film is effectively just A New Hope but with new characters. The film has some interesting aspects, such as Finn being a stormtrooper, but it fails in its execution of that. If Finn was a stormtrooper with potential to change, why does the last quarter of the film see the resistance mercilessly murdering them by the dozens, even hundreds?"
4704,1,Disney destroys a great story once again,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens seems to get an awful lot of spammy upvoting . I used to see this movie in a more positive light, due to it saying 'Star Wars', but there's far more to it than that. For example, Kylo Ren's a pathetic and unsympathetic joker, and merely a ripoff of Darth Vader. I suspect the actors and actresses are not Star Wars fans either because if they were they would not participate in this."
4705,5,Did you like A New Hope?,"It seems obvious to me that Disney wants to distance themselves from the franchise George Lucas created as they have done their best to create a brand new, albeit similar universe which deviates significantly from the previously established star wars universe."
4706,2,JJ's A Tool,"... unless you have a good lawyer.<br /><br />Firstly, it is an insult to Jar Jar and secondly Jar Jar may sue you for defamation and he would win.<br /><br />This director reeks. he just rips off and is so obviously odiously trendy that audiences will gag. Gender switch? Check? Rip off? Check. Reboot (without attribution)? Check. Bore my pants off and destroy Star Wars? Check."
4707,5,"This movie consists of nothing more than easily digested, brainless and derivative scripting designed for the casual viewer.","The plot is a carbon copy of a new hope, the acting falls flat, MARY FREAKING SUE, and the philosophy of the established force just is completely thrown out. And why in heavens name is the victorious Rebellion (episode 6) still a rebellion?? How did that happen?<br /><br />The only cool thing was the concept of the masked kylo ren. Aside from that this movie (entire trilogy for that matter) is a disappointing view."
4708,2,Do not Call Him Jar Jar Abrams...,"Yes, this will contain spoilers. But you know what? If you've seen episode IV, you won't actually be surprised by this movie."
4709,3,Super underwhelming,"If you haven't seen any movies of the Star Wars saga, you probably are going to like it. It has beautiful places, costumes and special effects. Thumbs up for the overall costumes which have been very well revamped, especially the Storm Troopers."
4710,5,"Completely unoriginal and full of plot holes, but entertaining.",That the actor and actress (loosely meant of course) Marey Sue and Finn showed up and gave interviews and thought they are hot stuff now. They are not only untalented but also blind. Anyone could have looked in the mirror or looked at their own footage and seen what a no-talent disaster they are.
4711,5,"Luke Skywalker, where were you buddy?","This was the first Star Wars film that I left the cinema feeling extremely underwhelmed. From the opening scrawl telling us that there is a mission to find Luke to when he finally appears, right at the end of the movie, there is just emptiness.<br /><br />I was looking forward the great legendary Jedi being epic and what do we get? A beard on a windy island.<br /><br />The story is a complete rehash of the original Star Wars which became known as Episode 4 A New Hope. Well, all hope has run out on this new trilogy. Absolutely no originality whatsoever. The effects were great but the story was drivel.<br /><br />The Rey character was ridiculous and the black dude, Finn, is an overt coward. Finn makes no sense whatsoever. He is supposed to be a hardened highly trained stormtrooper that was schooled in soldiering from a very young age. What we see is a guy who suddenly gets a conscience, despite the years of ardent brainwashing and development of warrior brotherhood, resulting in him going AWOL. Whenever his soldier skills are needed he is utterly useless. Later on he tells us he was actually a janitor. Rey on the other hand is so kick ass it is astounding. And she is instantly epic in everything she does.<br /><br />Han Solo is turned into a failed father who has not progressed in life at all. The only memorable thing about Princess Leia is her frozen face. It seems botox in a galaxy far, far away is as obvious there as it is here.<br /><br />Yes, the film is stylish. Unfortunately, it's just a very poor rehash of the original and fails miserably in its girl power banality."
4712,2,You Know What Is More Shocking Than How Boring This Remake Is??,"The movie was just bad. I agree with all the bad reviews. It is the first time I ever write a review and it is the first time I want my money back. The actors are bad, especially the villains. It is really bad, the last Terminator was awesome in comparison to that. The plot is ridiculous. Th people, who created it,- do not have a taste, or they just do not care. The person, who wrote the script, needs to be tired. There will be 2 more movies, they will have a chance to improve it, but I am not sure that I will go to the cinema. Much was expected from this movie, so the fans notice every mistake, but if to forget that it is Star Wars, it is just a mediocre fantasy movie, I would not watch it again. And I watched mad max for 2 times. You need to respect the viewers, we are not dumb."
4713,3,Style over substance,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens(2015) Starring: John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Gwendoline Christie, Domhnall Gleeson, Lupita Nyong'o, Peter Mayhew, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Andy Serkis, and Mark Hamill Directed By: J.J Abrhams Review Every Generation has a Story When I was a little kid I loved three things Marvel, DC, and Star Wars. I got introduced to Star Wars with Episode III: Revenge of The Sith, my friends favorite for Anakin Vs. Obi-Wan reasons. My favorite was the original Star Wars: A New Hope. It had a sense of adventure with Luke as the farmboy looking towards a greater destiny who banned with Ben Kenobi, Leia, and Han to defeat an empire. When I was a kid I had a giant coloring book, lightsaber toys, action figures, floppy disk DVDs of the original trilogy I loved Star Wars. When we saw episode III we always though like now their going to continue the story with episode VII but three years had passed and I deemed it less likely or actually never going to happen, who knew ten years ago I predicted the future. This film maintains that sense of adventure and isn't a rehash of the first film but continues the story and mythology of Star Wars. It furthers the story brings us new characters while having the old, and they all serve for the plot. Thirty years after defeating the Galactic Empire, Han Solo and his allies face a new threat from the evil Kylo Ren and his army of Stormtroopers. I don't want to talk about to much about the plot because my plan was to know nothing about the movie before I saw it and I knew barley little just character names and guys I found another Star Wars movie I loved. The acting is amazing, standout from the new cast being Daisy Ridley, from the moment she is on screen she steals the show, John Boyega did amazing as well some thought he was going to be the weakest link but he's a Star Wars fan I usually have great faith when a fan of this profession such as acting or directing something they love and have a passion for. The movie is the biggest Space Opera epic I have seen in a long time and it has great looking practical effects and the movie looks beautiful on screen. I can not wait to see it again and again for years to come, the saga will continue in a glorious fashion if it keeps going in this direction and while it's going to be hard now to say which is my favorite because their's going to be a Star Wars film every year and my latest up and coming favorite director Gareth Edwards is directing the first anthology film coming next year it's going to be hard but this movie was beautiful I haven't had this much enjoyment at the movies in about two months but this movie was just something beautiful and special, I loved, this movie, really, really, really loved this movie."
4714,1,Just bad.,"From the beginning I was extremely excited to see the new Star Wars movie. The entire series (games, books, TV series, toys, and more) were a big part of life for since my childhood. They guided my dreams to reach space, led me to attempt an aerospace degree and eventually got me an internship at NASA. And that's not counting my Star Wars Jedi Outcast tattoo. So, it was bad enough that Disney made the decision that my childhood was now no longer Cannon, then to have this movie slap me, my wife, and two oldest boys in the face made me upset. The entire movie is filled with plot holes, unexplained events, and science far-fetched even for Star Wars. An apathetic-at-times performance from the veteran cast made it all the more disappointing. For starters, why is there a third death star? From a writing perspective, it's unimaginative and lazy, from a plot line perspective it's just plain dumb. The previous two failed with an entire fleet backing them up, not to mention bankrupting the entire Empire. Oh, by the way...there's more, it's an entire planet this time that somehow took less than 30 years to build, can suck the power from the sun and can shoot multiple planets at the same time. Next, why is the new empire basically a color version of WW2 Nazi footage? Seriously, they have a parade, a screaming leader, a giant flag, and a speech about taking over the universe. They even steal people and brainwash them to fight for them. (Which means the good guys are killing innocent people by the way) Then, they replaced Yoda with a new character named Maz Katana, who can't use the force, but seems like she can use the force and somehow has Luke's old lightsaber. She never really clicks as a character and isn't explained well. And that brings me to my next point, the cantina Maz operates. It's a cut and paste from Episode 4 cantina scene and was lazy writing. Im getting tired so I'll wrap up the last complaints. The entire movie takes place in one star system???? The New Republic isn't explained or showed, and why is the resistance (lazy writing and basically the Rebellion) separate from the Republic and only has a dozen x-wings? Why is a 60 year old princess the only general shown in the resistance? How can Finn use a lightsaber? Why does the only First Order Trooper with a stun baton find Finn and know who he is and beat him in a duel? Why does Ray learn how to use the force as good as a Jedi Master in a few minutes. Why does Kylo (Adam is terrible for this part by the way) get beat by Ray even though he has years of training and is in the Skywalker bloodline? Why is Ben Han and Leia's kid in this universe when he is Luke's son in the original universe? (lazy writing) Why was R2-D2 in low power mode? (lazy writing) Snoke is a new emperor, they didn't even try to be creative (more lazy writing)"
4715,1,Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review,"This movie is literally just a remake of New Hope, only this time with boring characters"
4716,4,"To put it all in one word, I would say ""Disappointed""",The slymo that made this should be fed to the rancor.
4717,5,Copy and paste of New Hope with less interesting characters,"Yes, Disney hired a perennial remaker to remake the original once more, but then none of the actors were very good either. I am not sure whether the director failed (in this respect too) or the casting crew were working on a tight budget."
4718,1,Bantha podo,"Based upon a script written in the 1970s, Star Wars The Force Awakens suffers from a lack of fresh ideas."
4719,4,Not Good,"JJ Abrams is the worst kind of Hollywood tool. What is the punishment in hell for JJ Abrams, her sugar mamma Kathleen Kennedy and his back door girl Daisy Whateverhernameis for imploding Star Wars?"
4720,3,One Sentence Reviews,"The Force Awakens definitely brought Star Wars back to its hype. After a year of speculation, it's finally here. So, what does it have to offer?"
4721,1,JJ's A Tool,"J.J. Abrams really know how to play save. I cannot hate this movie yet there is an empty feeling when I left the theater. I personally doesn't have anything to say when a friend asked me ""how was it?"" even Transformers and Iron Man could made me rain the words toward my friend and encouraged them to watch. This one though, I will only say ""Just watch it if you want to"". I was hoping this one to be a breakthrough, yes it is a kick-starter for a whole new saga but and several OMG moments here and there but still, it is too mediocre, I just hope that the sequel will be like a whole lot better than the predecessor like Empire Strikes Back did. Now that you already have a save grounding for this saga, please, please, please, J.J. don't falter to rock the sequel like crazy!!!"
4722,5,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a great adventure movie, but not a great sequel to Star Wars","Jar jar clearly had not watched a single movie, let alone a star wars movie before. First off, how did the empire come back? I thought they completely at the end of return of the Jedi? Second of all, they HAD to do a gender switch of the main character cause otherwise it wouldn't attract most audiences. Third, whenever they allowed rey to take Luke Skywalker's lightsaber and actually injure a SKYWALKER with it is such a disgrace. The only good characters in the movie are han solo and Finn, both of which are either injured or killed. They ruined star wars and are literally trying to resurrect a dead film. Star wars is dead. While I love and cherish the old movies, they should have ended episode 6."
4723,5,Playing Save All The Way,"Upon paying for the film, and sitting in my cozy seat in the movie theater, I was immediately struck with an overwhelmingly fantastic vibe of ridiculous proportions. The reason I have decided to give this film a 2 of 10 is because the film is TOO good. When I entered the theater and handed the cashier my money, I was looking for a good movie, not an excellent movie. This movie was good to the point of making me angry. As I sat in the theater, scarfing down popcorn as if my life depended on the crude and excessive consumption of popcorn, I fought back the tears of anger as the film played on. I can only imagine the pestilence I caused fellow movie goers as I stood up from my seat and shouted with great disdain and angst words unbeknownst to me and my posse of fellow aggravated fans of Lando Calrissian."
4724,1,This movie is a waste of time,"I think only interesting part was this: one of them was a chick that cannot die so she was safe in her knowledge of another pay check from episode 8. However the other girl, er I mean cosplayer, looks as much a loser as his love interest. At the end it turns out he is worse than his only friend (in acting). So are we surprised? Yes, that this film was not straight to video."
4725,2,Frustratingly Excellent,"I had really good faith JJ would bring us a cool and interesting Star Wars movie but instead what we got what a reboot of the series that caters to the younger fanbase instead of the whole. The beginning starts off pretty strong. It gives us a different point of view through Fin's eyes as a stormtrooper, a interesting way of starting the film indeed. later on after the new Starkiller (Death Star 3.0) is revealed is where the movie starts to fall on it's face. The starkiller has a small entry weak spot just like the previous Death Stars! The rest of the movie is just a modernized version of a New Hope. There is nothing original about this! Every Star Wars movie had something different going on not the same recycled stuff. The new big bad leader guy is not at all intimidating and looks like a grotesque odd version of Darth Plagueis. Also the importance of the force has been cheapened, now even a former stormtrooper can wield a light saber and dish out hits on Kylo Ren; a guy who already knows how to use the force! Rey discovers her force abilities and becomes an overnight prodigy and almost kills Kylo Ren! WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING? The lightsaber combat scenes are weak! I've seen fan made youtube videos that are better choreographed! There's also no force powers used during the lightsaber fights, really? The ending is cheesy, it ends with Rey pointing Anakin's old lightsaber towards Luke and they awkwardly stare at each other waiting for one to speak. It cut to the credits right there and that was probably the worst ending in Star Wars history."
4726,1,A weird story of three poor actors,"If this film is a sequel to anything then Donald Trump was truthful when he said he remembers Pearl Harbor, that he saw Muslims dancing in New Jersey celebrating 9/11 or that he didn't pay off Stormy Daniels out of his campaign funds (two months before his lawyer admitted he did)..."
4727,5,Mixed bag...,It was an awful photocopy of the original Star Wars (1977) movie.
4728,1,"Lies, Lies And More Lies","The movie itself is not exactly terrible, but their insistence on casting and using Daisy Ridley as the main character makes little sense. With due respect to her, her acting in this piece is sub-par (if you look at any scene with her, she is either holding her mouth open in a shocked O or widening her eyes, and that seems to be the limit of her ability) and her character's development makes little to no sense. This is kind of the common point throughout the movies; things aren't really thought out for any reason and don't connect in any sensical way. Why does a desert scavenger with no vehicles larger than a motorcycle possess incredible starship piloting abilities, to the point where even the famed Han Solo is impressed? Why is someone able to immediately grasp the finer parts of the Force less than a day after hearing about it for the first time? How in the universe did the New Order manage to build their weapon without anybody noticing? Why why why? There are so many loose threads that you can safely enjoy the eye candy, but definitely don't try to get your brain involved or you might leave disappointed."
4729,1,The people who wrote the script should be shot,"The one major flaw in this film is the complete lack of snowtroopers, they had me so hyped with the design but 12 snowtroopers appear for a total screen time of about 2 seconds, it's quite sad as so much merchandise was made of them and I really like them and have all of said merchandise, it's just sad to see an amazing design wasted - I just hope they visit another cold world in the next two films."
4730,4,"Entertaining enough, but not a solid Star Wars movie","This is by far the biggest disappointment ever... Too many jokes, too simple story, bad characters, too many effects,... no words, just bad....<br /><br />MAybe the first movie that made me want my money back after cinema"
4731,1,Good but one major flaw,Boring movie and stories
4732,1,End of Star Wars,"A gender Switch Hope, er I mean The Force Awakens, attempts several things (humor, drama, romance, misandry, feminism) and fails to entertain or come across as Star Wars. The acting is awful; the characters are weak and incomplete. The film can't decide what it is or what pace to go at."
4733,3,For Losers,"Well, I didn't, I was born in '77 but I think you get my point.<br /><br />I was REALLY hopeful that we'd get a continuation of the magnificent original trilogy. That Disney would build on the lore and expand the wondrous universe built by George Lucas.<br /><br />Instead we got a soft reboot leading us into absolute misery. J. J. Plagerism started the ball rolling under the watchful eye of Kuntline Kennedy.<br /><br />How can either be considered ""professionals"" yet create this abomination?"
4734,3,Dreadful Boycott Disney if you have integrity,"As predicted, disney ruined star wars. great tool for prying $ away from devoted fans, tho (which i am not)."
4735,3,Pretty sure I saw this DONE BETTER back in 1977,"I have to say, I have never disagreed with the reviews on IMDb more than I have with this movie. I do realize the similarities between this and Episode IV, but I never felt that this movie was purposefully following the same story line. Maybe for others this was a glaring issue, I just did not see it this way and neither did the 100s of others sitting around me in the theater. I did get a bit of ""this is a little similar"" feeling when they hid the plans in BB-8 and the scene where they decide to destroy the new Death Star was very lame. Other than that, I thought the new cast was really amazing. Daisy Ridley was beyond good as Rey. I was also very pleasantly surprised by Oscar Issac's role in the film and how well they all seemed to have a good chemistry. BB-8 was brilliant. He added so much to the movie. I also really enjoyed how each scene seemed real and not overly CGI like the prequels. They did an amazing job with the costuming and cinematography. All in all, this film is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars world, 100 times better than the prequels which do not see the light of day in our household. Let's be honest, even the original 3 films had issues, none were perfect with the exception of Empire. The deal with this film is it has the magic that made the original movies enjoyable. I would disregard about 99% of the reviews on her and go see the film. This film is ultimately a setup film for the next and I would imagine all those nitpicking at this film will eat their words when it comes out."
4736,2,jumped the shark,"What a kick to the Star Wars gut !<br /><br />We waited 33 years to watch them kill Han Solo and give us 6 seconds of seeing Luke ( Only at the very end of the film AND with NO dialogue ! ) Horrible ...<br /><br />Also, NEVER take the villian's mask off for no significant reason in the beginnings of the film !<br /><br />It makes him completely unintimidating .....<br /><br />The whole mess was super lame & a total scam to the fans. Embarrassing"
4737,5,Unreal Reviews on IMDb,Overall 4 out of 10.
4738,3,THE FARCE AWAKENS !!!!!!,This Film Should Not Have Been Produced<br /><br />Disney Star Wars is a stupid attempt to get soccer moms to the movie theaters. I don't know why Lucas sold Star Wars! Was he settling betting losses? Hollywood made this movie for a  demographic and destroyed Star Wars. This remake is an embarrassment. If the actors and actresses get any type of IQ one day you can find them in back alley plastic surgery dens in Hollywood getting new faces.
4739,4,Star Wars Expendables (Pathetic Oldies return),"I was quite annoyed when a whole bunch of annoying ""Star Wars"" nerds would not stop analyzing the new ""Force Awakens"" trailers. This was a film hyped up and discussed so much that really made me want to hate it going in (even if I was somewhat excited about seeing a new ""Star Wars"" film at the same time). The only reason I felt the need to hate this new movie was really just because of the predictable hype and overexposure, and I wanted to leave the theater and tell everyone I hated it to be ""edgy"" or whatever, which is a horrible mindset to go into a theater with."
4740,2,Magical Disney Princess,"What made Star Wars Star Wars? For those of us old enough to remember, it was fresh; it was bold; it was DIFFERENT. Although it had its roots in ancient myth, matinée serials, and westerns, it dared to go against the grain of the cynical and hyper-realistic face of American cinema in the 1970s and usher in a new era of energy, optimism, and imagination, fueled by never-before-seen technology, visual and sound effects, and unprecedented use of a lush and brilliant symphonic score."
4741,5,A Great and Exciting Sci Fi Marvel!,Really bad script coupled with really bad actors and actresses in a really bad gender switch film.
4742,5,It's time for Star Wars to dare to be more -- again,"She is not quite Ezri Dax boyish but almost. The Mary Sue of this Disney gender switches runs arund,f rowns and grimaces for some reason no one can understand. I hope JJ Abrams got some tail because I wouldnt touch her on any couch."
4743,2,SAY NO,"As a huge fan that I am, a ""fundamentalist"" of this franchise and SF genre in general, I went to the preview, 0:05 pm on Thursday 12/18/2015 Romanian time. I bought tickets like a month ago with a good friend and I waited with almost childlike joy this moment."
4744,2,Blugh,First of all: This is an enjoyable movie. It feels like Star Wars and it is in my opinion the best episode in the saga since Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.
4745,3,Star Wars Episode VII: The Force awakens - a fan chronic,First 2/4 of the movie was good! I liked it. But then i realised that the main protagonist was all powerful (without training) and the main badguy was a whiny weak kid that looses (as a trained jedi/sith) to the all powerful Mary Sue.
4746,5,"Good-looking, but unoriginal take on Star Wars","WHAT is this? I know it is a remake, but what is the point of the remake is 100 times worse than the original. For heaven's sake the pouty misandrist expression on the Mary Sue is repulsive."
4747,2,Meh,"Just awful. If you liked Star Wars....you'll hate this. If you hated Star Wars...you'll rub your hands in glee sith style. Because it's just bad, no redeeming qualities whatsoever..."
4748,1,I will NOT watch anymore Star Wars based on this,"A poorly written and wholly mediocre attempt at Star Wars, although not without potential. A basic rehash of Episode 4 with bits of the other films sprinkled in."
4749,2,Highest Budget Dumpster Ever,This movie redefines bad. My grandchildren were enthralled but they're 5 and 6 so one can make allowances for their lack of taste and or discernment.<br /><br />What a dog's breakfast this movie is. I'm sure the actors who landed the roles were ecstatic at their good fortune... until they saw the finished product. Geez Louise!!!
4750,4,"Mediocre at best, but with potential.",It's a real tragedy how disconnected these new Disney films are from the original Lucas films. What is the world coming to?
4751,1,My grandson made me watch it!,"This was such a boring cliché with terrible accounting-driven directing and really lame actors and actresses. Look, I am a man so if you gender switch at least get the girl to show some skin and have long feminine hair or do something! Anything!<br /><br />Star Wars was destroyed by this stupid reboot."
4752,1,How to ruin the best movie franchise ever,"I watched and observed. I planned and plotted. At the stroke of midnight I jumped over the wall of LucasFilms headquarters and evaded the security camera and the guards. I scooted to the building's far wall in less than six seconds and broke through the unwired basement window. I was in, but there was still a long way to go and motion detectors to avoid!"
4753,2,Say NO to this and other gender switches,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Ladies and gentlemen, I really, really wanted to enjoy this movie. I come from a huge Star Wars background. Though I didn't watch any of the 6 in the cinema (as I was too small), I was really looking forward to Episode 7. I've read pretty much every Extended Universe book there is out there, I know that Han Solo was only out-shot twice in his life, I know that at the 'end' of the now gone Extended Universe, the Sith ruled the universe; and I know that Darth Vader had to fight a doppelganger at one point, and put a lightsaber through himself to kill the doppelganger. I also know that these are now non-existent. That is probably my major complaint about the movie; that it killed off so many avenues that previously existed in the Extended Universe. I am aware that the movie was never supposed to be about any of the stories in the Extended Universe; however, that angers me even more, seeing how blatantly Abrams and the other writers drew on such concepts as the star-powered superweapon (as anyone who knows about the Star Forge can tell you) and the concept of a hyperspace-travelling laser weapon. These concepts, including many others, like the fact that map parts were missing which showed the location of something – a concept used many times in the Extended Universe stories - , a New Republic which ruled the universe, fragments of the now-destroyed Empire (Admiral Thrawn, anyone?), were all Extended Universe ideas and stories; the fact that it was stated the film would not be about the Extended Universe followed up by such ripping apart of ideas to create this I call that nothing short of severe hypocrisy, which really sucked some of the fun out for me. I mean, if they were going to borrow so heavily from Extended Universe concepts, why not just make the movie Extended Universe friendly to begin with? They've literally discarded all of the extra stories about Han Solo and Leia that the Extended Universe was full of. I feel that this cannibalization of Extended Universe concepts to suit their own aims was really poorly done and it really ruined large parts of the film for me. Leaving aside my woes about the destruction of the Extended Universe and the simultaneous picking (like vultures) from some of the concepts that were so dear to it, the film itself was not Star Wars material. The film featured many action scenes, which we all like, but those very action scenes fell short of having gravity. While I appreciate the nostalgia (I did in fact exclaim with delight when Han and Chewie first stepped on the Millennium Falcon), it goes to show that Abrams pretty much chose to recycle the old concepts of the Death Stars 1 and 2. While I certainly love trench shots of X-Wings (with a new paintjob!) desperately trying to blow up the superweapon before it fires, it felt that I was simply rewatching Grand Moff Tarkin getting blown up all over again, albeit with better effects. The First Order was a nice touch and I appreciated the 'fragment of the Empire' idea, but oh my, when, in the 30 years after the fall of the Empire, were they able to even build up such a powerful civilization? After all, the Empire spent around 19 years actually building the original Death Star; how on earth did a shadow of the power of the Empire build a planetbuster superweapon in only 30? Moving on, there were certain other problems inherent to Supreme Leader Snoke, the 'Knights of Ren' and Kylo himself. WHEN, exactly, in the 30-year span, did Snoke suddenly appear as a veritable Sith lord out of nowhere (when the Rule of Two dictated only the Emperor and Darth Vader should have continued the Sith order) with an apprentice and an entire ORDER of the Knights of Ren? Here we have one of the major plot holes that seems to litter the film as it progresses. These plot holes, the Snoke-Ren appearance aside, are also evident in Han and Leia's separation (how did you think you could explain that with maybe 10 lines of dialogue?), how the old man at the start even got his hands on the information to Luke's location, Luke's complete absence for such a long period of time, the fact that New Republic did next to nothing to stop the First Order (since apparently, they're strong enough to build hyperspace planetbusters) and many more. However, I sincerely enjoyed the humor and most of the acting and it did feel great to see Harrison Ford again, in the tired but mischievous, old smuggler; I'd probably say that that was the highlight of the movie for me (""TELL THAT TO KANJIKLUB!""). What really crushed the movie for me was his death, which I understand the reasons behind, in that Harrison wanted out and Solo couldn't really be played by anyone else (don't you dare, Abrams). Han Solo's death was the most unnecessary film death I have seen in any movie ever. It was supposed to add the much-needed gravity to the film but it fell short; Han Solo's drop reminded me of Bespin and Luke, but Han died for nothing; the entire plot revolving around his son was like a bad joke, after all, we've already had a 'No, I am your father' moment before. Despite all this, I did like the movie in some ways. Abrams managed to pack in acceptable action scenes and a couple of nice jokes, which I felt were spot on (BB-8 and the lighter, for instance). VERDICT: Abrams pulled off a nice movie which, if considered as any generic action movie, really did well. My fundamental complaint is that it was not Star Wars in the sense that, after Episode 6, it built on practically no story, created plots (or tried to) with little to no backstory and failed to deliver for me."
4754,2,I Have Seen Things!,"I watched this movie and it made me feel dumb WHICH I am not used to. I didn't like what they did to my favorite franchise they added all these characters I don't know and don't wanna know and it had nothing that I wanted in a storie. I could have made better Star Wars movie. I just mad at the movie. I am very mad. What did they do to Luke. Make hime grumpy, no no. Thanks a lot dismey. I give 1 Star."
4755,5,"Good movie, Bad Star Wars","The movie was fun to watch, especially after 10 years since the last film. The new leads, played by Boyega, Ridley, and Driver, are much better than Christensen and company. And... Thank Goodness... NO tag-along ""comic relief"" aliens."
4756,1,Movies bad I am upset,"Soft reboot of episode 4<br /><br />hero starts on a desert planet.... hero doesnt know his parents... new deathstar, but bigger... new Vader but low budged..."
4757,5,Not Bad... Certainly Not Extraordinary... Better than the Prequels,"I love the new Star Trek movies (at least 1&2, the third one is actually pretty bad) but unfortunately I hate to say that JJ completely blew the new take on the Star Wars Universe. This movie is truly bad!"
4758,4,Mediocore,"I'm not a professional movie critic, but I did love the old star wars saga. What got me excited for this film was the buzz that it would recapture the magic of the original universe, and all the approving reviews. When the score began I got goosebumps and was entirely ready to be consumed by an epic adventure. But I left disappointed. From what I can see this opinion is not shared by many, but I'll argue that this movie is far far away from the magic of the originals. "
4759,1,What the hell happened to you JJ?!,Just bad.
4760,4,An action movie with hints of star wars,"Little sense, which is being attempted to be compensated by massive special effects. Watching this movie I got impression like I've seen it already and could easily predict not only what is going to happen next, but also a race of each character as well as order of appearance just to follow the rules of racial equality.<br /><br />The main personage of an ""evil man"" again predictably chosen a white guy.<br /><br />I could see a hidden message, created by this move ""white man is still good, but his time is over"". <br /><br />It looked like creators of this movie were more concerned about racial complains and racial relationships, rather making this movie having more spiritual sense.<br /><br />US, what happened with your movie industry?"
4761,1,They Call A Light Sabre A Laser Sword,"I liked The Force Awakens well enough. Nonetheless I can now shake my head and say ""I knew it"" remembering how I was cursing the day someone decided JarJar Abrams, who should at the very least NEVER, and for any reason, be allowed to write scripts to science fiction films, was the guy for the job. And if I wasn't a star wars fan, I'd rate it a star less for sure. The movie is salvaged by the nostalgia brought on by the ol' gang, and because it's an inferior remake of A New Hope. Which still makes for a decent film, because it's very difficult to screw up such a faithful remake of star wars beyond salvation."
4762,1,"Primitive, boring, predictable","The acting was questionable.<br /><br />The story is a repeat, only faster.<br /><br />The same thing over again.<br /><br />Seems a little feminist at times.<br /><br />40 year old transition effects."
4763,5,Star Wars: An Old Hope,To say it was better than the Star Wars prequels isn't saying much. The prequels were a mess in all aspects.
4764,2,"Not a star wars fan, used to watch as a kid but now, never again.","First of all I went into watching this film with great expectations. Maybe it was all the media hype forced down our throats, or perhaps because it had almost been a decade since the last Star Wars movie. Toward the end of this movie I was telling myself ""Really?"" ""This is the best that Disney can do with the franchise?"". Maybe George Lucas fell short with some details and direction of the prequels but at least those movies felt original yet maintained within the same story world as the first trilogy. TFA felt like a recycled movie that tried way too hard to be like episode 4, and made by people who didn't really care about the franchise. "
4765,4,The Ultimate Kitsch,Adam driver good so Star Wars bad.
4766,4,"Really wanted to like this movie...But only ""awakened"" disappointment","First off, a couple of disclaimers:"
4767,1,I can't believe he's bad :(,SPOILERS.....
4768,5,"Some will like it, some will not.","Only a reboot, not a sequel, completely copied from ep. 4, only worse...."
4769,5,"Good, but still disappointing, I left feeling empty - SPOILERS","Each movie in the franchise featured a large space battle. The battle in this film should have been huge. It simply is not. The Resistance in the film seems small, tiny compared to the First Order. Most oddly its 30 years later and there are few and far between improvements in technology it seems. The X-wings are painted black and the First Order has some new flashy outfits. It is not a completely thought out universe. It feels old like Leia and Han do, It didn't evolve and change. Ms. Ripley by far is the stand out star of the movie. Han Solo does his thing and reminds us why we wanted a sequel with this cast. At times this movie brings the magic back, other times it feels small and incomplete, and at times its just a bad movie. Its an odd orange version of Yoda."
4770,1,How to destroy a franchise..,The story is a remake of the IV and there are no new ideas in it.
4771,5,An ageless story feels old,"Do people really watch this stuff? So twisted. No one film caused the hate and addition to remakes in this country, but Star Wars has enlarged the mess So full of half stories, bad acting and dishonesty. When will there be a Star Wars that is as good as the originals? This is too bad."
4772,4,Same old stuff,That story is really bad and there is no thriller.<br /><br />Hate that robots and lots of boring fighting scenes . Yes but fan rate it high rating is don't know why . According to me overall really bad movies doesn't deserve more then 5.0 rate
4773,1,Too Sad!,"But yeah, nothing to see here except mindless, tasteless troll garbage from troll garbase master Jar Jar Abrams"
4774,1,This movie doesn't have star wars soul,"I did not really want to watch this movie. However I only did so because the Star Wars sequels have led to such a great amount of creative and interesting youtube content (RLM, MauLer, and so on). Just for being better able to follow those youtube movies I decided to watch this again (a bit pathetic perhaps, I know). And I must say, it was a chore. The movie is just so uncreative, ripping off the OT and stacking contrivance upon contrivance.<br /><br />Just one example: in A New Hope, the droids ""luckily"" end up with Luke. But at least it makes some sense: they were heading to Obi Wan, and Obi Wan was watching Luke. So there is a reason why they would be in that vicinity.<br /><br />In this movie, the droid ends up with Rey. But there is no connection (established in the movie) between Rey and Poe's contact. It's just lucky she happens to be there also, on that particular part of that particular planet. What are the odds? And that is basically this movie. (random friend of Han happens to have that lightsaber, random stormtrooper defecting on his first combat happens to know the one flaw of the new Death Star, and so on). It just so boring to watch."
4775,1,This inferiorgender switch remake is almost as bad as Dotard trump's hair implant,"Nothing but an unimaginative, poorly written re-hash of episode IV with a 'Mary Sue' main character and plot holes. A lazy attempt by Disney."
4776,3,The non creativity let to creativity,"Unfortunately, SW7 was not just a disappointing movie, but it caused serious harm to the SW legacy. "
4777,1,Copy of episode IV,"Complete copy of A New Hope, brought nostalgia however seriously lacked originality."
4778,3,The demise of star of wars,"Mr. Abrams, I find your lack of creativity disturbing."
4779,1,Deja-vu,"OK OK, I admit, I am a huge fan of the originals and one of the few who thought the prequels were OK in short doses. Ever since the teaser trailer came out for The Force Awakens I have been counting down the days. The good parts.... Imagery was amazing, the worlds were wonderful on the big screen and the falcon looked as great as always.... Rey was the best character in the film and she will, if handled well, become a great character over the trilogy. The bad parts.... Plot and story were awful Han Solo rocks up with Chewie from out of no where. Finn was OK at best and Kylo Ren was as scary as a dropped pie. It was a rehashed Episode IV with no where near the amount of fun or swashbuckling adventure. Personally I though Guardians of the Galaxy was a far superior film with the central characters great to watch. I enjoyed this in parts for the imagery, the nostalgia and seeing some old faces, however J.J.Abrams did a better job with Star Trek. Maybe this film was too big for anyone to take on.... Better luck next time please.. 5/10."
4780,1,A Lesson In How Not To Do A Trilogy,I hate it
4781,5,Not bad but oh could have been so much better!!,Et je suis fier.
4782,2,Would it kill you to get a pretty girl with feminine hair in your films??,"They just do not have the stories to fill these things, but always find studio system directors to take charge and burp these out."
4783,1,Je Suis Une Mary-Sue,They all suck (and no not in the way that would make them useful).
4784,3,Ha! Another Franchise Film!,"FFF!<br /><br />The Fart Awakens and it stinks to high heavens.<br /><br />Shame on George Lucas for getting old, wimping out and cashing out. I have the old DVDs. There is no chance in hell I would buy this on DVD after watching it once.<br /><br />All involved should go under the knife and become sterile to make this world smarter.<br /><br />Finn and Ray should be shipped to Sudan, Israel or some dump and left there forever"
4785,1,Kill All Disney Princesses,"Wow this really is one of the most sleep inducing, yet financial and critically successful movies I have ever seen. Well it's quite obvious Disney knows exactly what they are doing, there targeting the biggest fan base in existence. The Star Wars fans! But it's not only the fans of Star Wars that run out to see this crap in cinemas, it's just about every living person. And do you want to know why? Because Star Wars is a huge event, an unavoidable event!you'll eventually get around to watching even if your not a fan of Star Wars, it's almost like a curse."
4786,1,For Fart Fans,"The ending of Return of the Jedi might as well never have happened. We're back to where we started. These wars never end. The galaxy might have millions of stars but we're stuck watching these idiots blow each other up and shoot each other with laser guns. Is that all people do in this galaxy? Yes I get that this is Star WARS and not Star PEACE but these people still have lives right? They must have industry and jobs of some sort. I'm sure it doesn't matter. These movies are made for people who like big video games, not practical jobs. That's why so many Stars Wars ""fans"" (who hate it anyways) look like children in adult form."
4787,1,Star Wars The Force yawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwn!,Perhaps I am not the biggest Star Wars film fan out there? I didn't have a father to take me to watch the original when it was released (and was probably not born yet). This film was not terrible exciting. It is probably better if you associate nostalgia with it. I am sure though that they gave character development short shrift.
4788,1,All they do is fight in space. It goes nowhere.,This is where it starts getting very bad
4789,4,Just so-so,"Here we go again. Everyone is back except Darth Vader etc. So why all the negative reviews? This is good entertainment, but not much more. Star Wars is maybe the first movie franchise, or the first cinematic universe. So no point complaining about Star Wars being commercial. It is the the definition of commersialism."
4790,3,Star Wars Haters Make A 'Star Wars' Movie (Shame on George Lucas For Taking The $$),It is Disney and JJ Abrams. I fully knew it would blow and destroy Star Wars. I was right.
4791,5,A wonky force,"So I see they did some good improvements in movie as for the technological side of things (R2 replacement robot being able to move easier). It was also good to see some details such as food makin' scene of Rey. I like how they started as if the movie is just another Star Wars movie and slowly connects to Episode 6 and u realize that it's actually a sequel. Only things I'd complain about is that it felt as if we are watching the same scenario as the episode 4. Again there is a new hope like Luke in E. 4 (Rey), again the dark side seems to be so much powerful... I mean I can almost see the end of this triology after just watching the half of the Force Awakens."
4792,2,Not Disappointing,SPOILER ALERT!
4793,4,Mehh,*** This review may contain spoilers ***
4794,1,Well...I didn't actually see it,Frustrating main characters that act against Star Wars and the force and Jedi knowledge and wisdom and makes stupid decisions to help Disney reboot this rubbish for preteens. They also continually break into comedy and one-liners despite being in a high risk situation under close watch. Could easily have been a children's TV movie.
4795,3,"Sorry Lucas, you were our only hope we couldn't see...",Gender Switch
4796,2,Poor man's 'Star Wars',"Best avoided unless you enjoy stupidity, cheesiness and snoring in front of the television. Fans of ugly chicks with no feminine charm should buy two copies though. 1 star because the broad was not fat and did not have her head shaved."
4797,3,Yikes,"It's a good film, but it's not really Star Wars (I'll explain that in a sec). It's a complete copy of Episode IV."
4798,1,The Murder of Star Wars,They destroyed and laughed at Star Wars.
4799,5,We've seen this droid before...,A big stumble backwards
4800,4,How do the power couple JJ and Daisy show their faces in public??,"Just kidding!<br /><br />To all the spammers giving this a good rating, get over it! hated the Mary Sue power element, but mainly it was just super tacky."
4801,1,Like A Fart In An Elevator,"My friends were telling me about what a twerp JJ Abrams was, so I watched this film to find out if it was true. All I can say is WHAT A TROLL. Why would anyone make such nasty insulting stuff and troll Star Wars? I mean, they're not even remotely funny. Usually there's a element of camp to bad Disney but JJ is simply an arrogant maladjusted attention seeker with nothing useful to offer humanity. His psychopathic behavior appears to be consistent with the greedy traits common to most criminals and rip offs, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, the need for control, and predatory behavior towards art that came before him."
4802,2,I loved it,"Some random multicultural people running around for no apparent reason and doing magical things for no apparent reason in a far away galaxy that really looks like earth with desert and forest and humans.<br /><br />Dang Hollywood, at least put a pretty chick in your films. Snoring man here with this film!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4803,3,Sad,"Im not the biggest starwars fan, but i honestly found this not very starwars. It seemed so desperate to end the story, that it felt like 5 starwars movies, but with only the climax of each movie in it. The main character is a young girl whos parents have left her at a garbage planet, and all of a sudden becomes a jedi. it takes no training, no work, no effort. She just becomes a jedi. Doesn't that seem kinda dull to you? any other jedi had to train for years on edge just do use the force, and learn how to fight with lightsabers. She just closed her eyes, and beat Kylo Ren who was abducted as a child to become the ultimate Jedi, and was trained to do nothing else since. They also destroy the death star, and find the last jedi in the universe. Luke Skywalker didn't use the force a single time in his first appearance, except for that one time he shot a missile, which was just to prove he was starting to get the force. Now this chick makes Obi Wan-Kenobi that defeated anniken look like jarjar binks. She doesn't have to learn to use the force, or try, but LITERALLY just closes her eayes and lets the universe fight for her. when a character starts off to strong for challenge, we don't get attached, we don't get to see them grow, they just have a few epic fight scenes. that's not enough to be one of the greatest starwars movies of all time. this thing ranks up to castle in the sky, one of my all time favorites, and i haven't seen it tell i was 4, but remember the whole plot and all the main characters easily. i think this was OK"
4804,1,In Spanish: el-lameo,Having a subscription to Disney+ of course.
4805,5,"Not bad movie, But feels desperate for no sequels",The good:
4806,2,What is the most embarrassing thing in the world?,"Disney: Fresh from remaking every crap they could (Lion King, Cinderella, Snow White etc etc etc) they remade Star Wars. As usual, every new clone is worse than the one before it."
4807,3,Bad heroes. Bad villains. Recycled Plot. Good Everything Else.,"The Force Awakens sits in a strange place. It both hard reboots the franchise by copy-pasting A New Hope, whilst also continuing the saga from the end of Return of the Jedi."
4808,2,Bad Mixture,"A disappointing rehash of episode IV, the worst aspect of which is the ridiculous Finn character. He instantly goes from being a stormtrooper to the nicest and best human in the galaxy. However, all the other stormtroopers remain killable subhumans. The worst part is that they've really missed a trick - an escaped 'child soldier' could have been an extremely complex character. But no, this is the muppet babies in space."
4809,2,Missed Opportunities,"Well, they managed to take how much the prequels killed the majesty of the original trilogy and finish the job."
4810,4,Finn is ludicrous,"This is the first review I was ever forced to write.  I nearly forgot the pure and shocking awfulness of this, really  incredible how alcohol can make you forget horrible things that  happened to you.  So I did it, I watched it AGAIN!  After my 6 months stay in Hospital when the blood stopped pouring out  of my eyes and I was able to be in a room with a Television again  without starting to panic and blaming JJ Abrahms for Tschernobyl,  global warming and the fact that my coffee machine broke down I wanted  to read other peoples opinions on this Movie.  And then I saw em....9/10, even 10/10 Reviews, and I started to wonder.  Am I too old to get the magic of this Movie? The Child has grown, the  dream is gone? Well, after 2sec of thinking about it, I say ""no"".  This is just pure garbage still, even looking back at it after months  and let away all the hype that so often leads to disappointment it just  won't hit any boxes. You guys mentioned all the stuff that is bad about  it so I will just mention the part that hurts me the most.  The World shown is simply no world you can dive in. It's just a flat  surface with a Star Wars picture painted on it. No big Fan of Ep 1-3  but they were living, breathing Star Wars Worlds while TFA is just a  dead body. JJA has done the same to Star Trek, (to be honest I quiet  liked it). Take out all the even slightly intellectual contend, fill it  with stereotype non controversial characters, add CGI till there is no  tomorrow and then make a cut every 0.2 seconds to make it feel really  fast paced. Done. But it didn't work at all for Star Wars, mainly cause  Star Wars is based on the story of characters, even if those are  Droids, and a Universe that has a certain vibe to it. A lesson this  movie teaches us is that you cannot create a Vibe if you just cut to  random places that have no relevance whatsoever.  And too bad the characters in this thing are a bit too flat and middle  of the road to be even remembered. A Girl who has obviously super  powers and makes all male Star Wars Characters seam lame instantly as a  main Character, OK, we've all seen this coming after we all hummed the  mocking jay whisper. A black guy who escapes slavery, oh wow,  creativity gone wild. A bad boy that is like a 14yr old son of idiots  acting like an dumb brick, just is plain annoying for no reason and as  menacing as a baby kitten cause that is how the young audience likes it  (Bieber-style). Check! Now give us a bad female character please and we  have the common sense overkill. And there she comes....ha ha, gotcha  It's like they laugh you in the face "".... and we still make money with  this rubbish."" Yeah, funny and please keep my money you'll need it.  DO NOT WATCH IT, RATE IT DOWN, IT'S BAD!"
4811,1,The start of the fall,"This rip remake, is pointless, it's just from a Star Wars hater, with no drive no purpose and no evidence, just a bunch of totally meaningless complaining so makes NO sense whatsoever."
4812,1,I'm getting old...thank God!,Boycott starwars and Disney. And IMDB where do u find 8 stars for this film !!! It smell bad...
4813,1,Pointless,"If you want to experience a treasury department's fantasy, this is it!! :) For that it made money lots of it. The acting is even pretty bad, given that the writing is clumsy."
4814,2,Bad.,Who needs another gender switch??<br /><br />Nobody.
4815,3,The Fantasy Of A Treasury Department,"Again, I was so excited when the these sequels were announced....WAS."
4816,2,The Aftertaste Of Yet Another Gender Switch,Bring back George. This movie had zero originality. It's just the plot of the first movie with modern graphics and a dumbed down childish and stupid script. George at least had originality in every movie. I loved each one for that. This is just pure recycled garbage. They will kill the franchise and fan base with this rubbish.
4817,1,Oh Lord help us...,"The opening sequence, the seventh time I've watched with bated breath, goosebumps, a a tiny tear in my right eye, had to be the best part of the the movie. The second best was seeing Han and Chewie. The third was when the credits ended. J.J. Abrams: you spun out Star Trek magic. This time you spin out on black ice. And there will be two more? Goodness gracious!!! Well...so much for the long wait. 16 years of nothing.... Three tedious and absurd prequels.... Then another hiatus to.... Well.... Enough said. Lousy movie. "
4818,2,"A shameless, soulless remake. I was a Star Wars fan. No longer.","All cashing in, no soul."
4819,5,"Bad remake, not a bad sequel","Not going to write a lengthy review since I'm so late to the party in seeing the movie (yes, I just watched it in 2017). Glad I didn't kill myself to see it when it first came out; though, I felt like I was the only one on the planet who hadn't seen it."
4820,2,I Rather Watch the Dotard's home video boinking Ivanka than this,"So my review is quite biased, being a fan of what used to be the EU (now legends), having read more than 50 books and played many of the now non-canon games. Therefore, take this review with a grain of salt. TL;DR at the bottom."
4821,2,So Weak! A Replica of the Original in Nearly every way,"I rate it "" 1 "" and that's for special effects . Awful story and actors and acting are worse ! Its obvious that they just wanted to make something and name it Star wars and put Harrison Ford to say ""See ! Its Star wars ! There you see storm troopers ... told you its Star wars !"" The girl heard the words Jedi and force and suddenly she awakened / Oh dear she is a Jedi now ! You must be very Credulous to say ""Okay , she could be a Jedi that fast ... its OK ^_^"" or you have never seen old Star wars movies. Seriously these awful things they make and name them Star wars just ruin what we have in mind from classic Star wars in every aspects except visual effects ."
4822,1,The EU died for this? Seriously?,You want to know how bad this is?
4823,1,Awful replica's,Honestly very glad that I didn't go see it in theaters. It's kind of like someone tried to make a B movie version of Star Wars. Also they made the force powers really different and kindve lame.
4824,2,Terrible,"Episodes four to six were... OK, if I remember right? I watched them as a kid but they were nothing too special, I never grew too fond of the Star Wars lore. I watched the episodes one to three when they appeared, and if I remember right, I liked them when I was a kid. They were loud and fun and suspenseful. Rewatching them few years ago made me realize that the prequel trilogy was mostly as horrible as people claim them to be."
4825,3,Not good.,"If you are going to extend the gender switch trend and fad to Star Wars at least make the said Mary Sue wear something skimpy so we can enjoy her body. For heaven's sake she is a bad actor, she has no expressions and everything falls in her lap, she gives the middle finger to the force, the teachings of yoda and does not need the Jedi academy... and she is not attractive or pretty??? Hell, if she is not cute and cannot show off then I cannot give anymore money to you guys."
4826,3,A good reminder to not revisit the prequels or the original trilogy,Who do Bad robot spammers think they are fooling? We have eyes. We can see how awful this remake was. Why do they keep spamming? It would be easier if they spent their time learning how to make a film instead of spamming the Internet.
4827,2,A Plea to Disney,That's me in the corner
4828,2,Terrrrrrrible,Chewbacca and Han is awesome Rey not as awesome <br /><br />They should remake the movie and the giant Death Star as a plant that's just stupid and like episode four
4829,2,Sung To The Tune Of REM's Losing My Religion,"Let me just say NOBODY, NOBODY wanted to see this movie more than me. Ever since I was a little kid I had always wanted them to continue the movie trilogies, so of course I was ecstatic to hear that Disney would be continuing it.(ironic)"
4830,1,Could've been better,"To be honest since TLJ came out I now hate TFA. In itself the film was just an ok-ish film. If it wasn't starwars it would just be an unknown film. JJ did good, it was somewhat original but it lacked interesting storytelling."
4831,2,STAR WARS but for normies and casual fans,"The first time I saw this, it was called The Original Trilogy."
4832,1,Hated it,"Thanks to high-tech CG, this is the best of all series so far. The story was still childish, but I could enjoy it from beginning to the end. Harrison Ford has been appearing for 4 decades, that is amazing. I respect him for his dedicating to ""Star Wars""."
4833,3,It's Already Been Done,"This Star Wars has totally killed the series for me, not that I was expecting too much from Disney but at least a minimum. For example, Ray learns to master the force in 2 seconds. The actors are really good, but the script, the story, and all the jokes added to the movie make it disappointing knowing that star wars was never really into jokes or pity for the ennemy. I will never watch one of the disney star wars again, I guess I will stick to my old SW DVD's. Despite all of that I think it is good to put a girl jedi for once, plus the other story's like rogue one or solo are really good."
4834,3,Better than 70s classic version.,The people involved in this movie tried their best to start the new trilogy very carefully by not overloading it with new stuff. That was a good idea. The whole movie just suffers from so many problems. The main problem is that this movie is not focusing on the main protagonist and instead tries to do a lot of world building and checking of long lists of stuff that need to happen. What people disturbed the most was an murder and death of one character that not made a huge amount of sense. Still this movie is watchable.
4835,3,Disappointing. (Contains spoiler),Wouldn't he know where Luke Skywalker was on the island since he was actually there on the island with him and fled the island? Why did he need the drone if he was actually on the island he should've known where it was
4836,5,A honest try to restart Star Wars,"I don't love the ""prequal"" films Lucas created for Star Wars, but at least they feel like attempts at adding to the Star Wars story. This movie felt like a cookie-cutter, formulaic attempt at dropping recycled plot and dialog references from the original trilogy, in order to play on Star Wars fans nostalgia, while shoving it all into the modern Hollywood package of non-stop manufactured suspense, drama and induced emotional responses. It's basically Titanic or Pearl Harbor, set to a Star Wars theme. I appreciate the attempt at recreating the magic of the original film, where Lucas cast a series of previously unknown actors, and ended up creating something special, with a couple of the actors going on to have pretty remarkable film careers (most notably Harrison Ford). However, we'll never actually know whether they're good actors, because they were all shoved into a pretty tight mold and required to follow a very conservative script that is typical of modern day Hollywood. The ""evil"" factor was also dialed up on the villains to where we now have what appears to be a barely pubescent version of Darth Vader torturing captives and... well, I don't want to give away key parts of the plot for those who still want to watch it, although I don't really recommend doing so."
4837,3,Wouldn't he know where Luke Skywalker was on the island since he was actually there on the island with him and fled the island?,"After years of anticipation, the reboot is finally here."
4838,2,This movie reveals what Hollywood has become since the original series,This movie is a soft reboot of the original Star Wars a New Hope. Abrams uses key plot points from the original to try and reignite a franchise that died many years ago.
4839,1,"Good start, some annoying and highly ridiculous scenes",Completely ruins one of the greatest film series ever to exist.
4840,5,A bad start to an Iconic franchise reboot,"This movie is somehow disappointing in every way possible. The creators found a way to break everything that was know to be cannon, while also being unoriginal."
4841,2,Did this film even need to be made?,Kind of a rehash of the original star wars movie.
4842,3,Increadibly Disapointing,* Spoiler Alert *
4843,5,meh,"But I will become a calm and compliant believer if someone somehow frees Star Wars from the clutch of Disney. This was awful. Sordid. Stinky. Wretched. My wife and I did not wait to see who is the director until the end of the film. I got up and checked out the back of the DVD to find out. The film did not improve (actually got worse) and I am here now hecking out what else the man J.J. Abrams has done.<br /><br />He is on our total avoid list!<br /><br />The film smacked of marketing department approved trash all the way. Oh it was so cool 2019. I am being totally sarcastic. Wow. Give it up, Disney and Mr. Abrams.<br /><br />I am older than 7 so cannot like this film."
4844,3,"Utter garbage, with no respect for the original",I mean yeah Star Wars quality has dropped but the girl is not a fat chubster like Ghostbusters and other newer movies. There is that at least.
4845,1,I do not believe in god,"It was an extremely hard movie to make. I mean could we expect a better plot than the original one? This movie made it though, and I mean only just. If it were not for those five minutes were a beloved character was killed off, I would have been utterly disappointed with the film. There is however one problem. Lets begin by looking back...Annakin Sky- walker was a pretty cool kid. We all loved the guy. He went through some serious emotional trials. When he finally turned into the monster he had motive. We could feel his pain, however, this new guy comes off as a psycho who just killed his father for the pleasure. Yes, there might be a strong motive for his decision to go to the dark side...but it didn't come out for me. So this movie leaves me with a big question mark...BUT WHY?"
4846,5,Not That Bad,"Just a mish mash of the original series. Got to keep those marketing points copyrighted. I saw this show for what it was from the get go. The Kennedy girl made it clear what she went off with her, ""The force is female"" tort. It was so bad, Harrison Ford probably demanded his wish to just be killed off like he ""supposedly"" wanted in the original series. Then for some lame brained reason actually returned in the concluding movie?!?! It was so bad Carrie Fisher died of embarrassment. It was tragic to see her go out with this as her last credit."
4847,1,Motive...,1- All franchises suck. ALL.... just cash grabs with no dignity or shame
4848,3,"Please, just try to be original","This movie was okay, but not even close to as good as the original trilogy."
4849,2,This franchise film proves three things,"The Star Wars movie ""shows you something you do not know"", this movie is ""confusing what you know""."
4850,5,What happened to Star Wars?,"They call it Episode VII, but it is a clone of Episode IV... they lied to you in your face."
4851,1,It is not that Star Wars movie,"One would have had to live under a rock all their lives to have not seen Star Wars: A New Hope (1977), which begs the question: why are they remaking it here? And, as is almost the case of any remake, it pales in comparison to the original. This episode lacks the pacing, the pathos, the rawness, the acting and the excitement of the first; it is dull, recycled, predictable garbage done half as well. "
4852,2,Liar Liar Pants On Fire,"This is where the beginning of the end of Star Wars happened. It used to be a venerable institution of hope and fantasy. It is now a douchebagged self cover version with a frowning girl instead of a man, boring cliches and Disney fantasy magic. No love interest, no story, no character development, never mind. Forget Star Wars"
4853,4,Utter rubbish,See my sister date a pig than watch this again
4854,2,The Dismantling Of Star Wars Begins,"Star Wars TFA is first of all a tribute to the original trilogy. Everything in this movie has a ""retro"" touch. The SFX (perfectly integrated and never too invasive), the characters (like the ones taken from a comic book), the action (that again mirrors the old trilogy). There is nothing innovative about TFA, but the trip is certainly worth the price of the ticket (and J J Abrams is certainly giving justice to the saga). Disney succeeded in assembling an event, before the movie itself. The problem is that the promoters grossly over-hyped the movie. Moreover all box office expectation discussions are just annoying. Star Wars TFA will probably brake some box office records, but is not memorable like, for instance, Avatar. James Cameron's movie set some new standards and people came back to the teathers for more. I do not think I will go back to see Star Wars anytime soon as there is not enough magic around it. I rate it 7 stars out of 10. Re: A Sci-Fi with a ""retro"" outfit"
4855,2,I Much Rather,"If I had known this movie would just be a fan-service mash-up of the Original Trilogy (minus a compelling story-line), I would have saved myself the money and time I wasted going to see this turkey. The characterization was weak even for Disney; the ""Mary Sue"" character (Rey) had nowhere to go in terms of story, because she was already perfect. There was, at least in my opinion, no reason to care about any of the new characters, and while it was nice to see the original cast members again, there wasn't really very much for them to do. Of course, I probably should have known better, what with J.J. Abrams directing; like his ""reboot"" of Star Trek in 2009, I'm just going to have to consider Episode VII as something that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far away in some alternate universe that has no bearing on the universe of the first six Star Wars films. And now that I've seen what Disney can do with the franchise, you can bet that I won't be seeing Episodes VIII and IX (or any Episodes beyond the Sequel Trilogy)."
4856,5,A Sci-Fi movie with a retro outfit,I am going to agree that Star Wars is as hip as shopping at Wal-Mart now... I hate Disney and JJ Abrams...ALL!!! People just don't learn... Every time they give money to these robbers! Looking forward to the next 10 Star Wars going bankrupt... Gender Switch with a shorthaired ugly chick.
4857,1,Yet another Abrams disaster,"Whomever made SW movies in recent years is a lover of My little pony, Superman, Batman, Thor ."
4858,2,It's Gender Switch Time Boys & Girls,"DIsney lost it so badly they dont even give us any lightsaber duels, that should be the least"
4859,1,Crap from Disney,"It deliveres on what it is trying to be.<br /><br />Though plot's a rehash of original Star Wars' plot, but this time almost everything is run by coincidence and galaxy seems to be the size of a small town, judging how easily everyone runs into each other."
4860,1,DIsney lost it,"Spoilers talked about but NOT IN DETAIL SO I DON'T RUIN YOU FROM UR MOVIE. So I saw the movie in 3D at 7pm with my fellow geeks born in the 70's and 60's. Standing in line since 1pm So we as the older crowd loved the 4,5,6 movies by George Lucas, 1,2,3 were modernized but still helmed by Lucas. Hearing that the original cast (most of them) from 4,5,6 were gonna return I had to see this movie. It starts off good with music and lettering but no action started off slow not typical Lucas its Disney. Whole movie is made without the magic hands of George Lucas saying what happens and how it will get done and its HIGHLY Noticeable. George Lucas may be a so called Creative Consultant but none of his ideas were really used he says on interviews. Spoilers now. I tried to enjoy this movie at a solid 8 then a main character dies down to 5 the character I loved dies in a rather dumb way. Yes I'm annoyed that the biggest star has died!! Another main Character says absolutely nothing just looks at you like a dumbass! Older Characters appear closer to the 60% thru the movie and thru the end. Plot holes are everywhere those of the 35 yrs+ crowd will agree and will catch them. New actress does a good job. Same with the young black actor. However Disney RUINED MY CHILDHOOD STAR WARS TOTALLY. I'm 37 years old I didn't come to see new stars of Star Wars I came to see the originals reprise their roles and go forward. I PAID 18 BUCKS to see Harrison Ford be Han Sole I don't care if he is 73 or 93, color his hair, do cosmetic surgery on his face, get him a personal trainer and protein him up so he has the same energy and muscle and send him in there but no they didn't. I was expecting him to be all over the movie, same with the others. I don't care if all of them are in their 50's 60's or 70's thats all I wanted. All I saw is most 3 new actors eating my Star Wars time. FYI TO Disney YOUR WRITERS ARE NOT STAR WARS NERDS AND YOU MESSED UP HUGE. I'm 37 I got money to buy all the Stars Wars merch not a 16 yr thats broke asking parents for money to barely see the movie. I buy the video games, food items, movies in blueray, the action figures, lightsabers, tshirts, shows, pants, cosplay and more. I spent over $10,000 in Star Wars Items not including real used props and thats extra. You catered Stars Wars to children and teens not the Adults that have the money to buy everything and bring more awesome memories back. Instead of making us adults happy you screwed it up with the giant lack of use of the MAIN REASON EVERYONE BOUGHT A TICKET ""THE ORIGINALS""! I won't be watching the next Star Wars movie that continues to get worse or kill off another original Character. Movie started slow like a normal movie but stars wars isn't a normal movie. If I see the next one it will be at the cheap 1 dollar theater as I felt robbed from the movie sure I loved the 2 1/2 hours time but you under used cast to be helmed by 4 new actors LAME!!! You can see it yourself and see if your an Adult and you will feel happy seeing the stars and then disappointed in their lack of use. Good effects, story plot is OK, character removal is bad!"
4861,4,Safe corporate product to deliver nostalgia,Especially the angry looking short-haired super Mary Sue. because they will never get another role again. They are terrible.
4862,4,NERD BORN in 1978 and grew up with Stars Wars originals in the movie theater not just a BETA or VCR,.... Banging away on their keyboards out of shillabad India. They rate this remake high and keep using the word 'franchise' as though it is OK.
4863,2,All The So-Calledd Actors And Actresses Involved Should Find Very Good Investment Advisors,The movie has a bad and juvenile history and I hate too much the return of the reboot tropes like Han Solo and more.
4864,2,You Just Know Who Disney's Hurly Contractors Are...,Bad movie. Disney just ruined Star Wars with their new trilogy.
4865,2,Very bad movie and work...,"So,yesterday I went to see the 7th SW. My impression: biggest load of crap and mistakes on this great franchise J.J.did he should never again do any movie. At least he could have watched previous SW so he can know what to do... So lets go, SPOILER ALERT!: 1. Anybody noticed that Anakins/Lukes lightsaber is not the right one? -it is the same chassis one that Luke constructed himself after Vader destroyed his arm and blue lightsaber fell in the rift at cloud city. It was a different hilted saber. NOT THIS ONE! And here is described as the one Anakin had and Luke later... :/ wtf - BEN SOLO ?! - Wrong imaginative family tree and member, there should have been Ben Skywalker and Anakin Solo, etc... the guy invented new member (and anyone with brains could know the Leia and Han who knew Obi Wan superficially only by the name obiwan never would have named son BEN but Luke would who knew him by that name,who was his padawan etc...) - destroyed super weapon planet- grand explosion, and for expect is that Ben survived that event and escaped hahaha funny, so funny...- he was left in the middle of the forest wasteland wounded heavily, the Millennium Falcon was already in the air and in the right place and they barely escaped that explosion... - they destroyed multiple systems, like all Republic planets, but Luke stays on some godforsaken planet on a small island something like Thailand and cast 20 seconds in whole movie. NOT ONE WORD IN WHOLE FILM!!! No reaction on all the evil in galaxy... - Ben looks like a Severus Snapes son from Harry Potter!!!! Not a single resemblance with Leia or Han... His acting sucks... - Where is the new generation of Jedi that Luke trained that was mentioned? - some repetitive and false done rerun of episode IV... - Ben is like strong in the force, he even froze a blaster shot on a duration of few minutes, but a stormtrooper from sanitation who weld sword for the 1st time gives him trouble?! Who, the Hell, is SNOKE? another newly created character of J.J. All in all effects were great, and this movie is good for someone who knows very little or nothing of Star Wars... Shame on Disney and J.J.!!!!"
4866,1,Bad,What?
4867,3,Waste-of-time-sadSWstory,"This is not Star Wars, this is something else and something completely bad. Pretentious fake."
4868,2,7.9 For This??,I was looking at a list of gender switches then I came across this video The farce awakens is the worst movie all of time! it's really true that many are saying the farce awakens is the worst movie of all time out of all the horrible movies. I didn't watch the whole remake as it was so terrible because I felt ill. Overall this was a boring fecal film. Do not watch this video.
4869,1,Not a SW film,"I thought it was cleverly done. The mixing of the old with the new which was nearly seamless. Although a little disappointed in the cyclic nature of the story line, the drama,actionable and emotional connect were are all there. When the old characters appeared together it was just magic and a lump developed in my throat. This movie departs with a glimpse of Luke Skywalker the only remaining Jedi. I did miss Yoda//Obi also for those little words of wisdom about the force but hopefully we will get that in the next one. The story line with destruction of the third but larger Death Star/Planet although a bit disappointing rings true almost like the obsession of building a bigger more destructive bomb like we do here. Having said that for sake of entertainment the story tellers will need to source another plot for the next installment. No doubt having to go back to the past and look at some of those World war 2 movies or back further to plot lines /stories from ancient Japan which is where I think Lucas got his initial inspiration. Investment in the story will always be rewarding because when people ask what was it about you need to be inspirational with this sort of movie."
4870,1,Horrible Gender Switch,This the worst movie of the star wars movies. first if you have to kill Han Solo don't do it like that. that is pathetic.<br /><br />the movie us so long for what it adds to the story. all you did is make a character introduction for 2 hours.<br /><br />it's trying to be something it's not. trying to make another great villan? he can't even weald his light saber right and he got defeated by a girl with no training? I get she is overpowered but still deosn't make an excuse for defeating a sith apprentise.<br /><br />Rey is overpowered. nothing else needed to add here.<br /><br />worst film of star wars
4871,3,A timeless classic that will appeal to most,"I'm not a big star wars fan. In fact, I just recently decided to watch the entire series of movies. This is basically a new hope again except with crappy characters and an over emphasis on comedy."
4872,1,why are they trying?,"I have read other reviews here. First off, I don't think the girl could be considered an actress. Second, they had overpowered the force, the Jedi, everything we know for the whole movie?? Come on...the force deserves better."
4873,5,Remake or reboot??,Just slightly. I mean just a hair above the pure garbage that was The Last Jedi. So it's got that going for it
4874,2,Cheap Acting With One Facial Expression,"That is what this remake about. Star Wars fans, science fiction enthusiasts and people with fair to good taste will stay away.<br /><br />Fans of gender switch and masculine hair on a 'female' need to order a 4K version of the BluRay"
4875,2,Slightly better than Last Jedi,"If you've ever wished there was a version of Star Wars Episode IV that sucked, this is it!"
4876,2,"EPS, ROI, EBITIDA and ROIC..","I am a big fan of comedy, jokes and practical gags. This film doesn't deliver so much. As far as fictional comedy I suggest The Hangover. As far as pure comedy laugh-out-loud that is a better recommendation. As far as dress up people parading around watch Spaceballs. The director and the dress up actors in this preteen reboot should try another line of work."
4877,1,"Episode IV, But Worse",Franchises and Jar Jar Abrams suck double big!
4878,2,Bad comedy (the joke's on Star Wars),"Yes. It is that bad. Loser city. Rip off story. No Hope, no interest and no cool scenes. Disney is vomit and JJ Abrams is the nugget in the vomit.<br /><br />Stay Away."
4879,2,Franchises suck,"The movie, although full of CGI at times has too many jokes and coincidences, none of which have anything to do with the lore of hope and justice that was Star Wars. Moreover, many of these so-called actors and actresses are major Mary Sues and clearly the production/direction is all about JJ Abrams' girlfriend."
4880,3,The Wal-Mart Of Cinema,Being not a blind star wars fan but an average human who has normal taste: this movie is complete not entertaining. The plot is horrifying and therefore the characters and therefore nothing to experience at all.<br /><br />Just like a bad essay from a very bad student. Shame on you Hollywood for not risking anything instead just producing a star wars jubilee show.
4881,2,I Rather Watch More Of Melania's softcore reels and photos (She is one ugly woman),And I certainly will not waste one minute watching or attending or caring for the so-called Episode 9.
4882,2,Wow great effects!,"When in 2015 they announced a new Star Wars trilogy that will take place after Ep 6, I thought it was either going to be the best or the worst."
4883,2,2015 Is When Star Wars Died,"A shameless regurgitation of a new hope, with a Droid carrying around an important bit of information and anything else Jar Jar abrahms could copy from Lucas. No story to carry on the trilogy this kicks off, and worst the most dumbest and needless and senseless way of wasting our true characters from the original trilogy. We never got at least one damn scene with all our beloved heroes. Truly disappointing: this franchise is now damaged forever."
4884,3,A start of a great disappointment,Forget the last three movies happened they have really uninteresting characters and ruin our loved characters in the star wars franchise. Really bad writing.
4885,5,Cut and paste,Nothing new to see here. Go watch the original trilogy
4886,1,Better to not watch,"Yes, it is that bad!"
4887,2,Remake,This is not a sequel. it is a remake.<br /><br />In the last episode the good guys won and their power was restored. Here they make it like none of that happened.<br /><br />It is almost as if they want this film to be for preteens and younger only!
4888,2,It is Oscar Worthy,JJ Abrams and Disney do not. It is just an investment for them. This is why the galaxy's biggest plot hole and worst and most unemotional story collide and create a disaster that is called The Force Awakens.<br /><br />Terrible. I am not watching any more 'Star Wars.'
4889,3,This Is All Wrong,"I don't get the high rating this movie have; it's boring, uninspiring, it's just Finn & Ray running from everything, have ANOTHER ""Death Start""...again... for the third time in the series... It's a poor star wars movie. Rogue One was not the best, yet was still a lot better than this crap on a carpet of a movie! JJ please don't do episode 9!!!! PLEASE!"
4890,1,George Lucas Cared For Star Wars,I watched this with my wife last week and I have to declare that this was even worse than I ever believed possible.
4891,1,Star Wars The Boring does not awakens but falls asleep,"I loved how stupid Han was to actually believe his Son still cared about him and was actually worth his time to even speak to, it felt like a fitting end to the worst character of all time that took a poop on Anakin's legacy by sexually abusing his daughter."
4892,1,"The Worst Movie (it's by JJ Abrams, in other news water is wet!)","This makes no sense. It is so low quality. I cannot understand why anyone would watch anything by JJ Abrams again. It is all cliches, slick visuals (attempted) and meaningless cliffhangers.<br /><br />It is not Star Wars however when all the rules of Star Wars, Jedi order and the force are violated. I guess they went out of the door with George Lucas' $4 billion."
4893,4,"It's not a sexy, environment friendly original film.","My message is that I've been watching you J.J. This is all wrong.<br /><br />I shouldn't be up here.<br /><br />I should be in my parents basement playing video games.<br /><br />Yet Dysney come to us you for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. An entire Star War fanhood is collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass fans extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of Rey Skywalker.<br /><br />How dare you!"
4894,2,Stupid,"First of all, a Star Wars fan here. This should've been arrested and not released by a QA team. Second of all movie is pathetic, waste of time...Star Wars and the force with a boy who keeps taking his mask off give me a brake"
4895,1,HOW DARE YOU ??!!,Actually it is a good movie. 
4896,2,Disney is fooling you,"Let me start by saying that there are some awesome parts of this movie: the actors are great, the score is amazing, virtual effects and pretty much every practical aspect of this film hits the spot."
4897,5,Good movie,"To start with, I am not a Star Wars fan. In fact, this 2020's ""May the Forth"" was the thing that made me watch the movies, so I watched chronologically the first seven movies (and also the animated series!), but I had to stop here."
4898,5,Feels like an unimaginative fan fiction written by an impressionable teenager,It is like going to Wal-Mart and watching the looks and 'fashion' sense of the customers. My eyes HURT.<br /><br />Just stop already. They are just redoing the story line. What is the point?
4899,2,I couldn't believe my eyes,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the first installment of the newest Star Wars continuation which is approximately thirty years from the events of the Return of the Jedi. The movie itself does a good job in encompassing the Star Wars feel and boasts an array of different characters which are important to the Star Wars universe. The character of the Storm Trooper Finn is especially interesting as it gives an inside look to the Storm Troopers and the person they are under their mask. The acting itself is very stellar especially for an action flick and powerful performances from newcomers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are a treat to viewers. Although aesthetically the film is very powerful in regards to its visual effects, sound effects and design the film feels as many people have said just like A New Hope, not that that is a bad thing it just makes the movie feel predictable at times and after watching the film you feel as though the movie is just lining up for the next one of the franchise. Many aspects of the film rely on nostalgia which is why I would recommend watching this movie if you have seen the original trilogy, and would not be surprised if star wars newcomers disliked the film. Another thing to note is the The Force Awakens does not have nearly as many light saber duels as the prequel trilogy which may bore newcomers. Overall The Force Awakens is a fresh resurrection of the star wars franchise which is gearing towards the next installment in the franchise."
4900,3,A Disaster In Motion,It was boring and things were happening for no reason. The supreme darkside darth is defeated by a girl who doesn't even know what a lightsaber is and well resisted by a sewer scrubber.<br /><br />This film didn't have any pretty girls with nice bodies either.<br /><br />I am not sure I will watch anymore of these Star Wars films.
4901,5,A New New Hope for the Star Wars Franchise,"A prestigious series has fallen under the talon of remake specialists (Disney - Beauty And The Beast, Power Rangers, Cinderella...) and there is as much originality here as Donald Trump lying that he is not a liar. Some good production design aside, this is a sleep-inducing rendition of the classic space fairy tale. Do yourselves a favor and watch the original 70s film."
4902,1,Shouldn't have watched it,"Here is the core of what is wrong with this movie: everything that had been accomplished in the first 6 movies, everything the rebels and Jedi fought for, everything I had emotionally invested in for over 38 years, was scrapped in 30 seconds when Starkiller Base destroyed the Republic. Now we and the good guys are right back where we started in 1977. It is as if Disney and Abrams pushed a giant reset button. I expected this episode to start from and build upon the Rebels' success in Return of the Jedi, as did the Timothy Zahn books. I expected to see the Republic flourishing and the Jedi returned to glory led triumphantly by Luke Skywalker. This episode should have moved the story forward, but instead it boots it back to zero. For shame."
4903,1,Leaves A Lot To Be Desired,"Guess what? You lost your money to a company that is so used to having princesses (lately ugly ones) that it took Star Wars, gender switched it and made the magical princess wave her hand and get things done."
4904,4,Not Canon.,"I grew up on Star Wars, I idolized Star Wars characters as a kid, and owned just about any memorabilia I could get my hands on. This film's new characters just couldn't cut it. The VFX and CGI were good though, and it really bought goosebumps to hear the title theme again, but eh. Storyline was rather weak, no good characters, just feels like this film exists to continue ripping money out of nostalgia. The film had no great moments, nothing that I would want to talk about years from now or even right after the film ended. The original trilogy was greatness, would honestly just rather see 100% remakes of those with modern technology."
4905,2,Disney made money,Why should I watch it?? No pretty girls. no flaunting. no originality. no hope. no good acting. no reason. Mary Sue.<br /><br />Snorefest!
4906,5,"Not a terrible film, but not much good either.","This remake is pointless. It's just from a Star Wars hater, with no drive, no purpose and no evidence. It is just a bunch of meaningless rip offs and Mary Sue-ism and so makes NO sense..."
4907,2,LAME,Throw in the towel
4908,1,Pointless,"If you compare this film to the original trilogy even the prequels it's not very good. The humor is off, the cinematography is off, and a lot of other things are just... Off. it's hard to explain the new characters are rather interesting but most of them aren't fleshed out. Very much to make room for Rey who is your quintessential Mary Sue type of character that the feminists eat up. He does everything right nobody questions her, she's perfect in all the wrong ways. Despite this Finn & Poe Dameron were interesting characters that should have gotten a little bit more character development, not to mention kylo Ren was actually a somewhat intriguing villain until he took his mask off. Despite this it's still create the foundation that could have been used properly and fortunately it was not. On its own, it's an okay film but I consider even the prequels to be more that Ventures and exciting. A sign of the times I suppose."
4909,2,Dear Hollywood,.. and it was so much better than this even tough I feel it was completed on 1/10th the budget.
4910,5,"Very flawed, but watchable.","Honestly, whether it's a storm trooper picking up a light saber or a so called ""dark apprentice"" getting owned by a noob... I can barely watch this movie. I tried, I really did TRY to get into the story but some of the BLATANTLY dumb stuff Disney wrote into this story is so far fetched I might as well be watching a movie about dragons and snow beetles battling for control over a taco stand... really Disney. How about you put a little more thought into a meaningful and believable story that creates a tantalizing ambiguity as to how the movie will end. This is such a failurw... I'm shocked it got past review."
4911,3,I Just Ended Finishing A Foreign Movie..,IMHO with regard to quality not profit this franchise is obeying the law of diminishing returns. This current travesty has no redeeming features unless you are the sort of person that has an obsession with rectifying perceived gender and racial imbalances within popular entertainment. If the rationale is that people can only relate to protagonists that resemble themselves I do wonder why white males should be expected to relate to Rey and Finn. 
4912,2,Does anyone on the storyboard read what they write?!?!?,Anything! Just get this loser out of movies.
4913,1,Why didn't they just officially remake A New Hope?,7.9 for this?? Seriously???<br /><br />Then what constitutes a 6 or a 5 or a 3 or a 2 which is what this juvenile reboot remake deserves??<br /><br />Disney/Bad Robot/JJ Abrams GET REAL
4914,1,Someone give Jar Jar Abrams a McJob,The worst film from Star Wars series that spits on fans and lore and pretty much everything.
4915,2,"Hello , How Much For The 'Platinum Package'?","Anything that the Hollywood studio prostitute JJ Abrams touches is a rip off and tacky. He has no ideas at all. Just rebooting and copying others' work and making a million. Cash is everything to him and his hos, respect or art or dignity are all Greek to him."
4916,1,Complete trash,I noticed how much it reminds me Star Treck now. Tons of special effects. Tons of boring dialogues. No jokes. Barely anything interesting is going on. At all. It's like you read some Computer Science book. What can you expect from Disney?
4917,2,The tacky Touch,Booooooooring
4918,1,What's the difference between Star Wars and Star Treck?,"In this review I want to purely focus on the aspects that are not relevant to the story in any way, so this is going to be SPOILER FREE."
4919,2,Disney Milks Cash,"At first I thought the movie was ok. But seeing the beginning, already disappointed me. J J used the same concept as Episode 4, the evil people are looking for plans of some sort on a desert planet where they meet a person who doesn't know they have the force until the get mentored. Then the mentor gets killed in a relatable fashion. Before that, the new force user needs to go to a cantina to find safe passage to a certain base. 2: You can't just create characters from nothing. Snoke, Rey, Maz, Hux, Phasma, and many more were introduced into TFA. Bu do we get any explaining about them? NO! Because that would make the story different. We don't want the same thing! We want originality! Not like TFA and TLJ. TLJ wasn't as bad, but it had some other issues. Back to the similarities between 4 and 7. Starkiller= Death Star. Trench run again. Someone taken captive gets rescued aboard an imperial/ First Order station or ship gets rescued by someone in a stormtroops outfit. Harrison Ford even talked smack about the movie. SJWs go crazy happy about this movie because they don't know what is really happening! One of the big points in here, is the lack of LOGIC! Even if Luke failed, he would've gone back to his friends and told them what happened and then maybe leave. He wouldn't just leave because he was looking for something. And If Leai can sense when Han died, then how can't she sense Luke? I know he has blocked himself off from the force. But she connected to him in TLJ when he didn't reconnect yet. Han randomly dissappeared for no reason. Oh hey I'm going to leave my life because I wanted to. I don't care about finding Luke or staying with Leai, I'd rather haul crap. 4. MAREY SUE. Do I even need to explain? She was good at EVERYTHING! She knows everything for no reason. Living on a desert planet without education. Knows how to fly almost perfectly, somehow saved the Millennium Falcon from blowing up by removing something that not even Han cared for. Rey=Luke, Snoke=Palpatine, Kylo=Vader, Hux=Tarkin, Poe=Leia, BB-8=R2D2, etc. How is this storyline considered a great movie? I don't like what the media says about this movie. It doesn't take a genius to know that it's not a good movie. Anything is better than TFA. If you think I'm kidding, don't test me. Prequels were so much better because they had ORIGINAL CONTENT EVERYWHERE! Sure some things were really bad, but I didn't think thy were horrible. They were showing the progression of Anakin's fall to the dark side and the clone wars. I think the millennial are back at it again. They be too blind to really see TFA and what it really is. About 1/4or more of the money that Disney got, was money that probably wants refunded. WAKE UP EVERYONE! ARE WE BLIND?! DEPLOY THE GARRISON. PUT ACTUAL ORIGINALITY IN FRONT OF LAZY COPY AND PASTE! TFA sucks. I don't care what others say, because it seems o be more true on the side that thinks that it was a horrible movie than the ones that are mostly too blinded by media comments of it then actually looking at it."
4920,4,"Definitely didn't disappoint, though there still was some potential for improvement",Bad Robot staff and Disney contractors in Papadum India should be ashamed
4921,1,"J J Copy and paste of A New Hope, but worse!","I am all for diversity but the role of Finn and to certain extent Rey has been grossly miscasted. Because of this , there is no star wars soul left in the film. The actors seem to be reading something on the wall at times. It's an eye sore to look at them and people struggle to make any connection with the new cast ."
4922,1,Complete Utter Garbage,"In my short life I have seen quite a whole lot of bad movies. In this category, this one beats the rest by a mile. This movie is a serious disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. All that work put into building a legendary movie series and with just one 'remake' (that's what it is, it's definitely not a sequel) they completely destroy all credibility."
4923,1,Horrible casting,Worst. Movie. Ever (next to all the new Marvel crap)
4924,1,The Worst of the Very Worst: Should be Forbidden,"OK so where do I begin. Firstly people that have given this a positive review are obviously biast Star Wars fans who would enjoy anything with the name Star Wars on it but unfortunately you need to review it as a movie. Don't get me wrong it was OK but I agree with a lot of the negative reviews here, that it is basically a rehash of a New Hope. It was as if the director was too scared too come up with new original ideas. As bad as the prequels were at least they were original! We also got really cool stuff from the prequels, for example, pod racing, darth maul, duel of the fates, clone wars, young yoda, anakin turning evil and the jedi council. But this movie has basically copied new hope, I thought Rogue one was a better movie because at least they took a risk although most of that film was a little too bland, the ending of that film was amazing. But anyway very disappointed with this, I wanted to see something different and also the actress who plays Rey was soooooo wooden. Also Disney do we need a Han solo movie, why not give us a boba fett movie or a movie on the old republic. I wish Disney knew which direction to take Star Wars but unfortunately they don't. I hope they bring out a movie to prove me wrong."
4925,2,Sequels Suck,"Star wars has been demeaned, and its heart breaking. It's basically the old story lines told over again but its rushed and cheap and just plain disrespectful to the fans. If you have any respect for your love of star wars do not watch. Keep and protect whatever beautiful memories and nostalgic feelings you have now because its all downhill from here. Horrible acting, no creativity, rushing through story lines they have no business rushing through, or going over."
4926,2,"Mediocre, a new hope rehashed.",It is bad. Sorry everybody. The excellent CGI is pretty much the only thing positive about The Force Awakens. 
4927,1,Gravely Disappointed,"The plot is a remake with worse actors, actresses and direction. The idealism is gone. The plot holes are obvious. There aren't any pretty girls that show skin. I am not really sure why this film would have any fans. Maybe gender switch completists???"
4928,3,"I didn't want this movie to be bad but,",Coupled with the trendy gender swap.
4929,2,Nothing in this film for me,"We all know reboots, remakes, sequels and prequels are Hollywood's cash cows and good for them and bad for us (I downloaded this for free) but did you know that this is not a new film? It is a copy of the original. This movie was just sad, like being euphoric due to abysmal acting and a bad script - in this case cloned script. This is my initial review and I felt obliged to rate this because there is no way in justifying the current 80% grade. I feel like there must have been a lot of paid reviewers vote prior/without watching the movie to influence the vote. Save your time, there are plenty of other movies worth watching out now."
4930,2,Standard Issue JJ Abrams Rip Off,"1. It's a ""New Hope"" Remake 2. The Enemies are bad. Snoke is 1:1 like Sidious, Kylo Ren is a crybaby and i can't take him serious and the rest of the first order are space Nazis. 3. Rey is overpowered 4. It was obvious that Han Solo will die 5. Boring 6. Many things don't make any sense (like a third Death Star after the first and second one got destroyed) 7. THIS MOVIE IS WORTHLESS! Why should I watch it again? It's the same Story like in ""New Hope"", the character aren't interesting and it's adds nothing new to the Star Wars franchise!"
4931,1,I Created An Account Just To Warn People That This Is A Copy Not A New Script,"This film has nothing. It is empty. Did it really and truly cost 200 million to make? Or is it just hearsay?<br /><br />The story was cloned from 1977, the chick was ugly and the gender switch was standard. Jeez man if you want me to come back to the theater get a cute chick next time. Over and out muthas"
4932,3,Most boring Star Wars movie,"After watching the film and discussing it with my brother, he pointed out that the plot was similar to A New Hope. Upon further inspection, it is essentially just the same as A New Hope, aside from the cast and characters. I admit, some things did seem different and/or new, but it generally did not meet expectations, and felt familiar. Taking influence is one thing, but this is essentially the film version of plagiarism, but in a lesser form."
4933,2,I don't get it,"Warning - Spoiler! The film was really disappointing. Those who have not seen it better wait for the movie to appear on the internet / DVD because it deserves corporations like Disney who have only one interest and to take your money out of your pocket, relying solely on people's nostalgia and special marketing Aggressive."
4934,5,Déjà vu,"As a man why should I watch it if it is a juvenile kiddified remake, there is no story, no good acting and certainly no eye candy??"
4935,1,weak,"Te movie was an insult to the intelligence of human kind. What a garbage movie. It felt like a comedy the way they acted, and the dialog was soo sooo narrow and empty. I feel really tricked by the ammount of hipe it got. In the end the only thing it got was allot of refferences, and nostalgia, but they even didnt do that right. The most shocking part is that it seems like people are affeaid to say they dont like it because it is star wars. This aint star wars, this is a garbage fire, star wars are good movies."
4936,2,Not A Single Good looking Woman In The Whole Damn Thing,"I like how america shows oneself multicultural tolerance by making blackskinned guy a rebel stormtrooper (but it works in the other way). Awful movie, nothing to add. Feels like they spent 245KK on advertisement."
4937,2,An excercise in misleading the public,"The crew and the actors did a great job on this one. I did like The Force Awakens very much, but if I were to compare this film to the previous six, I would give it a better rating than the prequels, but not as good as IV, V, and VI. This film is better written than the prequels (which doesn't say much) however, I found this film is no where close to being as engaging as The Empire Strikes back. "
4938,1,"Budget is $245,000,000","If you wonder to whether this film is a good film, you only need to ask yourself a few questions. "
4939,5,"Very Good, but not excellent","As you can see by that title and the review, I despise what was done to TFA by Kennedy and J. J.. This movie is something we were so hyped to see, and tbh, at first I though it was good, until it struck me when I got out of the theater. I was disappointed, let down, and angry, and I still am after seeing TLJ. What is different about TFA compared to the Trilogy? NOTHING! A person is on a mission to recover plans to bring to a small band of rebels, but is ambushed by the enemy. The enemy sith Lordish dude is a person wearing black armor, wearing a mask, blah blah blah. Then it shows this person who goes to save the fugitive upon a ship of some sort. Then there is a person that has been separated from their parents on a desert planet, who doesn't know that they are force sensitive. They meet up with a droid or two, and saves the droid(s) that carries the plans, or the map to something very important. It goes on, and on, and on, with the same exact things as before. Rey is a MAry Sue, which basically ruins her character. Finn is ok, but needs some work. Poe is the Wedge and Solo combo. Ruined Han, by killing him like that. This whole movie was and is RUINED. JJ makes us think Luke ran away because he failed. Wouldn't he have rejoined with his family, to tell them what went wrong? Luke's character was ruined, because that is not Luke to just run away. We get no explanation of who some of these new people are. Literally nothing in this movie made me excited to say that ""This is a Star Wars movie"". Disappointing. I know there is so much more wrong with this movie, but I'm getting too lazy to complain about it, because people don't understand detail these days."
4940,4,Of course this film is a good film,"A very anticipated movie and a huge disappointment.<br /><br />For a SW fan the pain of watching it is almost physical. Without diving into a detailed review I'll just highlight the moments when it hurt the most: The terrible, ridiculos, miscast face of Ren. Very cheap rebel base. Ren's constant alternation between being all-powerful and very weak. Surprise appearances of characters and their powers. Overall weak plot."
4941,1,The Fart Awoke Inside Disney,"Droid with vital information coincidentally found by Force user girl on planet and saved from destruction. (Coincidence No. 1) Of all the First Order soldiers in the Galaxy, the one that suddenly has a change of heart (Finn) is on the ship where owner of droid (Poe) is taken for interrogation, and this is the exact moment he has this unlikely change of heart, even though he must have seen quite a lot of ugly stuff already, and also used to work as a janitor (seriously?) on mega-superweapon Starkiller Base. Oh, and Finn, who seems to be a cautious guy, chooses the most idiotic method of deserting the First Order's ranks: he gets in a Tie fighter with Poe, hoping to escape, even though he knows they would likely be shot, INSTEAD OF delaying his desertation just a little bit, until they land somewhere and he could arrange his disappearance in a battle or with some outside help. No, he wants to do it right here and right now. (Coincidence No. 2, although this is actually a combination of unlikely coincidences, Implausible Behavior No. 1). After they land and Finn leaves the scene, he meets Force user supergirl (Rey) by sheer chance. Rey could be at home, or out scavenging, it's not as if she spends her entire day in the settlement. Also, if Finn is trying to get away from imperials, why on earth does he head for the settlement when he knows that's where the First Order are most likely to look for him? (Coincidence No. 3) Soon enough, the First Order guys find them and start shooting them with laser cannons from fighters whoosing up and down above the settlement. If they really need the information in the droid, isn't that a bit of a risk to take? Why alert their prey and why not wait a bit and send a large landing force to surround the settlement? Why shoot with laser cannons when the droid could be hit and the information destroyed? Just for fun? (Implausible Behavior No. 2) So Finn and Rey are on the run now, and guess what they find conveniently lying there in the desert just a few hundred meters away: the friggin' Millenium Falcon! Of all the places in the Galaxy, the Falcon is on the planet where super Force user girl lives, Luke's friend with the vital information lives, and where an indoctrinated First Order soldier decides to finally break ties with the evil First Order. (Coincidence No. 4, or we could call it Product Placement No. 1, the product being Star Wars nostalgia) Okay, so it's only natural then, that after they successfully escape with the Falcon, they are captured or found by none other than... oh, yes, I can feel the Force in action now, it really awakened, didn't it... Han Solo and Chewbakka, who else? Everyone is here for a party, it seems. Okay, the ship does have a beacon, and they find it via the beacon signal, but as they clearly state: ""Just lucky we were in the general vicinity when the ship powered up and its beacon snapped on."" Yeah, just lucky I guess. Of all the places in the known Galaxy, they were in the general vicinity. (Coincidence No. 5) And this is the exact moment when two rival gangs arrive to settle debts with Han. They did not find them by tracking the Falcon (in that case, this would make sense, as the Falcon's beacon has just been turned on), but by tracking the freighter. So the exact moment when Han finds the Falcon, the gangs arrive with guns blazing. (Coincidence No. 6) They have to escape in the Falcon, to a planet called Takodana, where Maz Kanata lives. And guess what this female wannabe Yoda happens to have lying around in her basement? Hmm? Noone? Friggin' Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, that's what! Of all the places in the Galaxy, our team of adventurers happened to wind up in the cantina where also Luke's lightsaber is kept. By Maz Katana, who sympathizes with the Resistance, yet has somehow failed to mention this so far to anyone at the Resistance, even though she must have known they are actively looking for the lost Jedi. (Coincidence No. 7, Implausible Behavior No. 3)<br /><br />And this is just the first quarter of the movie, and just the most embarrassing stuff. It's not a story, it's intergalactic roulette. Coincidences abound, irrational behavior is the new norm, product placement rules supreme. Oh, and did I mention the new superweapon, Starkiller Base can destroy multiple planets or whole systems ANYWHERE in the galaxy? I understand they wanted to up the ante, but seriously? How are they going to raise the stakes next? Galaxy-destroying thermal detonators? Uber-Jedi with the ability to destroy the entire universe with a flick of the wrist? No, thank you. They have lost sense of measure in the attempt to impress the audience, using the characters as disposable plot elements in a game of galactic roulette. Logical, character-based story arcs are a thing of the past. I could go on, but there's no point really. Money seems to be flowing in for Disney, so why should they care? Lucas referred to the SW movies as his kids, and added: ""I sold them to the white slavers that takes these things, and...,"" Then he laughed and decided it's better not to finish this sentence..."
4942,1,"If the Empire wanted to punish everyone who cheered for rebels, it would have made this movie","Soul crushing experience really - After generations of children and families growing up with these movies, it seems as though that the time of such practices will be coming to an end, if the quality of movies produced are to be the standard of the force awakens. Id recommend anyone who disagrees with my judgement to watch all the movies in a marathon, in order of release and cross examine each movie. My experience was that I was forced to keep myself awake if anything, so at least they got the title right. The casting - practically all British. Im British myself, born and bred in the heart of London. And I will say (call me prejudice, or what may have you) but British actors lack the emotional capabilities to portray the characters in such films like star wars, our acting schools, nature/nurture, unfortunately do not produce (generally speaking) a good environment for creating a-listing actors for a film such as this. I really wish that Disney's involvement would not of had such an influence. And I only wish George Lucas will return to save the sinking ship."
4943,1,A game of galactic roulette with product placement,The Mary Sue running around in this movie being all magical and arrogant is so stupid. How does JJ pick her for his love life or movie???
4944,1,"The film that brought an end to an era - Horrible casting, Poor script, No direction.","The opening scenes of the film are just stunning, and the whole escape from Jakku absolutely nailed it for me. The wreckage from an epic battle combined with a familiar desert setting feels as though it was all carefully crafted to simultaneously provide the sense of continuity and nostalgia needed to draw you firmly back into the Star Wars universe 30 years later. Not an easy task, but for me personally they got it spot on."
4945,2,The Movie That Made Me Not Be A Star Trek Fan Anymore,"As a longtime Star Wars fan, I feel this one is a bad movie and ties for the weakest in the whole franchise with Rise of Skywalker, which coincidentally was also directed and written by JJ Abrams. The 2 positive that I can say, are that the cast is excellent (both new and old). The VFX are excellent too, and those 2 things are the only positives I can give."
4946,5,"Lots to like, but re-boot feel and continuity gap is jarring","I wonder if JJ Abrams actually respect himself because no one else does. Yes, he makes money and I am sure lives in a nice Hollywood mansion, but respect? No way. What is this? How dare he and Disney destroy Star Wars? Why are they reenacting the original with inferior cast and the mandatory woman instead of a man? Isn't that itself discrimination?"
4947,1,"The cast is excellent, however J.J.Abrams shouldn't have borrowed most of the plot from A New Hope, he should have done an original story instead. All tease and no explain",This is a film for them and about them.
4948,2,Yet Another JJ Abrams Commercial,"i a writing this review just to get my voice out there about the problem with this film which many others agree with. this film shows how Disney is turning star wars into a money generating industry just like what has been done with marvel, they are all the same and people continue to watch them, the force awakens has demonstrated that they are willing to do the same. the movie is pretty much a new hope! it even has another death star! what were they thinking!, there is not one bit of originality in this film and it frustrates me. i mean on its own its a decent film but when you consider the past films and how this film has just copied them it just ruins the franchise. that is something that the prequels did well, although they weren't good movies from a character or story construction point of view they did do a good job of being original and fitting into the star wars universe, expanding the mythology and showing a time that was different to the original saga, the force awakens doesn't even do this, we are just thrown back into a situation where the empire is attacking again! there is nothing new. i hope i contribute to expressing the fan disappointment of this film"
4949,2,Of Course all mary Sues Would Love It,"This was a good movie, only shame was that it has been already done years ago. Nothing really changes, it's basically episode IV remastered. I wonder what they'll do whenever they want to refilm the first trilogy."
4950,1,alright on its own but horrible as a member of the star wars franchise,"Young nobody struggles in life, greater force pulls him/her in an intergalactic fight between good and evil. Young nobody becomes somebody via the new found purpose. The bad dudes consist of old ugly leader, black mask weak apprentice and army general who is there to be bullied. They also have massive indestructible planet/weapon that the good guys destroy laughably easy. Oh and there is also a comic-relief robot that must deliver a secret message, a badass princess to lead the good guys and Han Solo."
4951,4,Episode IV on steroids,"I am not certain why this producers think I should watch their films. The girl is ugly and hostile. She has a chip on her shoulders. I have to work hard to earn money. When I go to the cinema I want a girl who both has it and flaunts it. Is it so hard to understand? If the girl is the same or in this case uglier than what I can see on the street, the film is a remake (or a rip off as officially it is not a remake) and everything as a result is predictable (including the 2015 standard issue gender switch) then why would they expect me to like it and come back for more? It is not like the cinema theater has good food and I want to dine there."
4952,3,Let's play a game,"I am objective on this. I know. I care. Therefore, I hate Disney Star Wars. I love Star Wars. This has none of the Star Wars feeling from beginning to end. The plot does not work. The chicks are Mary Sue are lame and feel inauthentic. The way we're introduced to each of the old classics was exemplary. This reboot is not. I hate it."
4953,3,The Girl Is Ugly,"So last night I saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens and it was pretty great. I have to say that this is the best Star Wars yet (however considering 1 and 2 are bad and 3-6 are just mediocre that is not saying much). First let me start with the flaws. The entire movie is a pandering nostalgia trip, it is basically episode 4 but better. Also some alien costumes still are not very convincing (Also this is my main problem with all the Star Wars movie: either really bad practical effects or really bad CGI, in this case it is bad practical costumes for some aliens). The villains are not established except for wanting to take over the Galaxy and restore order, OK what happens after? are they communist or conservative? what do they want after they take over the Galaxy? this is a problem I have had with every Star Wars movie. Now for the good. The action scenes are really well done and there is a lot of them. The cinematography is jaw-dropping great. The acting is great. The pacing is pretty good. The writing was fine and occasionally we got some pretty witty and well done humor. The heroes can be easily related to, understandable, well established and likable and the villain's were menacing (though not very well established). All in all this is a well made movie. I am greatly recommending this."
4954,2,Sucks,"I've been reading star wars books forever, there are about 165 books out with a timeline out to 45 years past a New Hope. Great stories. In them Han Solo and Leila have 3 kids, two are twins all with the force. Luke married and had a son named Ben. Why didn't they use any of those great stories. Never was there a First Order or a leader Snopes mentioned in any of them. Yea one of Han's son turned to the dark side and became a Sith Lord but was killed by his twin sister. Disney totaled ignored the Star Wars universe and just made this story out of the air. So much material to work with and they use basically a repeat of a New Hope with different characters. Movie was ok but very disappointed."
4955,3,Great despite all the annoying nostalgia baiting,"The number one reason to watch any film is the story, then how that story is made to come to life. In this case the story is bought and paid for the first time around. It is all copied."
4956,3,"Changed the story, where did they get this stuff",A remake of A New Hope with terrible character believability. For me this is now the worst movie. Phantom Menace moves up a notch.
4957,2,Boring,"They destroyed it. Bad acting, lame directing and a rehash that sweeps everything that happened in the previous episodes under the rug!<br /><br />SHAME. Star Wars used to be good.<br /><br />It is time to move on to something else."
4958,2,Unfortunate,All the trendy idiots who likes this in the early days must be embarrassed now that they jumped on the bandwagon and gave this a high mark now that it has been exposed as a tacky fraud.
4959,2,Thanks to Disney it is embarrassing to like Star Wars Now,"Its not a movie its just copy of another movie. I couldn't find any difference between this and new hope. only difference is the name of characters, thats it. There was so much similarity and I was guessing the next scene while watching the movie"
4960,2,Worst so-called Actors and actresses and director and writers ever,"They say imitation is the highest form of flattery. By that estimate Disney and its boy JJ Abrams are paying the highest compliments to George Lucas. However, truth is that the fans should not have to pay for it at the wicket, by wasting their time or via the false advertising that this film is. It was billed as Episode VII, but another orphan, another desert planet, another hidden message, another death star with the same design defect, another troubled father-son relationship and another cute droid on the sand, etc etc."
4961,2,this isn't a movie,"The useless MaRey Sue that, ehem leads this remake is so bad with her one and only facial expression that screams 'I am self deluded and have a chip on my shoulder' that the audience member would be forgiven for believing, no knowing, that Disney is a garbage rip off lowbrow corporations and Jar Jar Abrams is a saboteur that needs to grow a mustache after plastic surgery and move to Mexico.."
4962,1,Regurgitation,"What was that World War 2 and the Nazi, ha ha come on, the black coat, red and black flags, the high-pitched maniac voice and the salute of the soldiers, then a big boom and they've got a nuclear weapon now, oh my! I am not a fan of the previous movies, this one was pretty much OK, but still all that fuzz!!! And the rating 8.4 this is crazy. I didn't watch it on cinema, cause I knew it was not going to be anything special and was hoping it didn't break Avatar's record, thank god it didn't! Not that Avatar was great but still. I noticed that old princess, don't know the name, well the actress did disappoint, kind of awkward performance like she didn't feel comfortable in front of the camera. And the bad guy being the son of that guy and grandson of this guy trying to create some kind of intrigue like in the older movies did not work, killing one of the main characters didn't work either, like somebody got surprised. And the grand finale that girl standing there like an idiot reaching, come on!"
4963,2,MaRey Sue,"Don't like, glad it's not canon. Prequels are better than sequels"
4964,5,Average movie better than the previous ones.,This film was in the Top 100 and is going where it belongs: into the dustbin.
4965,2,"Meh, but not canon.",Just awful in every possible way. Do not watch if you watched the original ones!
4966,1,Finally Falling out Of IMDb Top 250,"I am not a fan of Trump and his bunch of racist retarded liars, but I must also say I am tired of the cliched formula that everything has to have a female lead. Ghostbusters, Ghost In The Shell, X-Men, Moana, Atomic Blonde, new Star Trek series...."
4967,1,Gender Flip Rip Off remake (a.k.a. JJ Abrams),"...but I hate this movie... no creativity at all... playing it safe sucks, Disney."
4968,1,The Keywords Do Not Lie Here,"The other Star Wars movies all connect and clearly link in the same universe. However, in the Force Awakens, despite a few key characters from the original trilogy, most of the characters are new. There isn't the slightest hint about how it could even possibly connect to the other trilogies. The biggest villain, Snoke, seems to have just appeared out of nowhere. It is very hard to adjust to this being a Star Wars movie when it is unclear how the plot developed, where most of the characters came from, and how new, important planets just seemed to appear. If it were the first movie of the series I would say this is a great movie, but what I wanted was Star Wars and The Force Awakens just didn't give me that."
4969,1,I love Star Wars...,"Feels forced in every way. Forced to be inclusive, forced to mimic the original."
4970,4,Barely Even Star Wars,Bad:<br /><br />Girl is lazy to grow her hair and be eye candy to men<br /><br />Rip off of the original<br /><br />Awful actors and actresses - this is almost shocking - like deliberate sabotage
4971,5,the forced awakens,"Wow. The special effects were standard and the desire for this to be Star Wars was palpable but I swear I can't even remember any of the main character's names. Why? No character development. All I saw was one unbelievable coincidence after another and we didn't get a chance to get to know any of the actors. How could we? They are redoing the original script. James Cameron should have directed this movie. Perhaps he could have saved it from mediocrity and used a new script. What about the history of any of the others? Anyway, the girl hero was a total jackass. The film was predictable. Girl's eventual fiancée is going to sacrifice himself to save them all but girl's daddy can't bear to see his daughter's heart broken so he sneaks off to Ireland and stands on a cliff. Does this sound familiar? Hello...seen it in Armageddon! Two thumbs down!"
4972,3,Good And Bad,"The Force Awakens is by far the worst Star Wars movie, in my opinion, because it has zero originality. It is almost literally a scene-by-scene remake of A New Hope. If they had made that clear, maybe I wouldn't hate it, but trying to present it as a new story is just a joke."
4973,1,Whatever Happened To Character Development?,What can I say as a Star Wars fan I admit I was excited to see this movie. After watching it I was speechless. It was that bad. No original ideas completely trash storyline the only improvement was the animations. Disney needs to have an original idea and try not to create garbage. If you watch the movie again closely you will see that the plot and everything else follows the New Hope. And what about the fact that Rey in like two days could wield a lightsaber and beat people with it. That's so dumb and that's why this deserves a 3/10
4974,3,"A remake, not a reboot","The movie is made using a disgustingly boring recipe.<br /><br />After watching the other classic 6 episodes as well as Solo and Rogue One, this is utter commercial crap"
4975,3,Star Wars 7,"The Force Awakens was good the first time I watch it, but it has since become obvious that it is just A New Hope with a new skin. Rey is too overpowered, and can seemingly do anything the plot needs her to do. There were some cool moments, but they don't make up for the lack of originality."
4976,4,Very bad movie,It is a gender switch movie.
4977,4,OK movie with a rehashed plot,"I saw this film not longer after a release and a few times since, but never though to review it until recently."
4978,3,Like Mad max,"Big budget couldnt save this, its bad.<br /><br />Is the first and only Star Wars movie I saw so far for which I was constantly checking how much time is left."
4979,5,Mediocre reboot sequel,"So the movie is not bad, compared to other movies of 2015 it's quite good. I don't know if it is just my problem but I kinda expected something more. If it wouldn't have been so hyped and publicized it may have seem as a much better movie. Another problem with it is that it's pretty much a remake of Episode III, with some elements from Episode IV and (this is probably the best part) much better special effects (compared to Episodes I-III, somehow I find the special effects from the first movies as being better than EP. I-III) and no silly ""Jar Jar Binks"" characters (it does have some mistakes in there, but they wouldn't count for the majority of moviegoers). Now I'm hopping that they are going for a better one with Episodes VIII and IX, kinda like with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The first one was good in setting up the plot for the other two films. Why did i gave it a 7/10 - it has to do mostly with the hype, probably just too much of it. Otherwise it's a good film - as somewhat of a SPOILER a much beloved character dies towards the end, and you get a few hints it is going to happen along the way."
4980,4,A bad movie with a lot of budget,"Because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews this film gets I'll concentrate on the main issues with this film- note that I gave it a 6 so I don't think it's bad, it's generally well directed, with beautiful production design and of course memorable soundtrack. While the film is generally well directed, and the effects as well as the production design are well made this film is a complete Disney ""safe-zone"" film. Instead of trying to take it anywhere interesting, we get a complete rehash of the original Star Wars and while the direction was quite good, with nearly no parts which ""took me out of the film"". No, the main problem with this film is with it's plot, and to a lesser extent it's characters. The plot is nearly identical to the original, and it shows that this film is marketed towards 2 audiences: The absolute fans who scream at the sight of Han Solo, Chewbacca and everyone else, for them everything this film does is the following: ""Nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia..."" it nearly seemed to me like this film literally shoves it down my throut: ""Feel the nostalgia! Hey look isn't it nostalgic"", ""You remember that from the original film right?"", but isn't the point of a new film to take it somewhere else but that? Would remaking the first film really be a better choice? Well, the very least it's the SAFE choice- nothing truly new occurs. For the newcomers who haven't seen any of the previous films I admit they would actually most likely enjoyed it as it is not badly executed."
4981,5,"Not bad, not great, just a spin on Episode III",I can't think of a single film that JJ Abrams has ever dished out that doesn't pop the question into one's mind 'how does this guy get any jobs?' He is good at playing the network I guess but has no talent.
4982,3,"Good introduction for newcomers, nostalgia trip for the huge fans, just meh for others",The plot is cringingly predictable. It's the exact same as Episode 4 A New Hope. The new villain is also laughably childish with no depth of character. He's not even scary as he takes off his mask at his hostage's request. 
4983,3,Living proof of the waste Disney throws out at us,"'The Force Awakens' starts off strong, introducing us to characters (Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo) in their natural environments, building up links to the past, but in a way that works very well, and through this first arc I think we truly get the best half an hour of solid story telling out of the three films. Rey is introduced as a scrappy scavenger orphan, lost on a baron world that connects us to the all too familiar desert world. We see her jumping through star destroyers showing she has a tenacity and natural athleticim. Kylo is introduced as someone strong in the force, powerful and merciless, but with an anger that is yet to be controlled. Finn is introduced as a turncoat to the Empire, meeting up with Poe, who instantly we want to see escape and forming instant chemistry through that action. But this is where the story takes a diversion...one literally built to undermine one of the main characters and replace him with OT nostalgia...let me explain."
4984,5,Worst job they could have done with a great series.,"Well this was really boring. I know the reviews are great and its a huge series with many episodes, books and comics but honestly the acting and coincidences were too much and boring. Also, I am not a teenager so I didn't appreciate all these jokes and oneliners Don't know maybe now that I have full breasts lol I am too old for this stuff. By the way do all girls have to be like so manly nowadays? Nothing wrong with being pretty and cool and flaunting it like a girl once in a while. Nothing at all. isn't that nature and natural for women? Anyway this film was two hours long."
4985,4,"The Fault in our Star Wars, why TFA played it too safe.","The irony is that when reviewed on its own merit, this movie would be tossed in the clearance bin after a few months with a red sticker saying ""$5.99"" but..."
4986,1,Boring,I was looking forward to a relaunch of the Star Wars franchise with episode 7 and I was interested in how Disney would go about it. 
4987,3,This is when the gap between expectations and reality widens to a maximum,"After the sell-out to crappy Disney by George Lucas every single invitee showed up to 'star' (cough cough) in this. Luke, leia, Han, et cetra all said 'yes' and showed up. Not one of them has the integrity to refuse to drag Star Wars' good name through the mud.<br /><br />That Jar Jar Abrams would show up, wag his tail and obey the CFO of Disney was never in any doubt, but it was disappointing to see how sucky this film is and how everyone has no integrity.<br /><br />The Farce Awakens sucks."
4988,5,Lackluster,Not one attractive woman in this galaxy.
4989,2,No One Comes out looking Good Here,Look Disney if you have a remake that is trying to reboot a franchise and make money etc. at least compensate your lack of ideas and novelty or originality with a pretty girl or two we can ogle.<br /><br />What is the point otherwise? I am a man. If the story is a standard issue gender switch from Hollywood at least put the girl in a mini skirt and give her long hair extensions so I can enjoy that and not feel my money is being stolen.<br /><br />Please!
4990,3,Did you notice?,No more cinema or DVDs for me if there is not a pretty smoking hot leggy super thin girl in the film who flaunts some.
4991,2,At Least Next Time Place A Pretty Girl In Yoru Film,"Going out of this movie me and my girlfriend had a conversation about what people must have felt like when they saw the first Star Wars. They must have had their minds blown was the conclusion. Because never before was there movie like Star Wars with its immense and intricate universe and state-of-the-art visuals. And we couldn't help but feel disappointed. We both knew that a seventh installment in the franchise couldn't be as mind-blowing, but still it was clear that we had both expected more."
4992,2,New Rule,"The script is the biggest pile of dog dodo ever, plot makes no sense, tries to be something it isn't (an original film) and I had no care for any of the characters. The chick is not pretty and shows no skin. Would struggle to give it a 0.1/10."
4993,1,"A decent movie, but ultimately forgettable",The remake by Disney and Bad Robot is predictable in every slight detail .
4994,1,One of the worst gender switches I have ever seen.,So silly and underlying preachy vibe. The first three eclipse this one by 1000 to 1.. what is this??
4995,2,Copy of a imitation,I am literally giving this movie 2 stars. 1 star for having Harrison return for this  movie and 1 more star for having good CGI. Other than that complete waste of time.
4996,3,An abomination of a gender switch remake reboot,"One of the laziest movies I have ever seen. It's just a new hope with better visuals and poorly written characters, the only thing it has going for it is the visuals and the nostalgia."
4997,2,Disappointing,"Often you'll hear that the reason so much we already knew and had seen in episodes IV, V and VI was rehashed is: But they're making these movies to draw in new fans from a younger generation."
4998,4,Lazy,"This film is terrible. An ugly girl and a serer duty stormtrooper? Why?<br /><br />This film is full of torture, betrayal and lack of creativity.<br /><br />Why are we here??"
4999,4,Star Wars for a new generation?,"After viewing this movie I was disappointed in the lack of character development from Rey, Fin, and Po. In StarWars mystery is common for characters as it makes them interesting and allows more room to explore them. Surprisingly Kylo Ren has the most interesting arc of the entire film and he is the villian. StarWars movies like this are why I only say there are six StarWars movies. And as a passionate long time fan of StarWars I'm disappointed in the lack of quality this movie has given the fans of StarWars. George Lucas would have done better than this piece of garbage. It's not worth the $$$$"
5000,1,The Keywords Say It All,"Spoiler Free: Star Wars: The Force Awakens, directed by J.J. Abrams was an amazing film. It wasn't however a perfect movie, it did really have only 2 problems for me. 1. Now I do like a fast moving story, but the plot sometimes moved a little too fast for you to feel more emotionally connected to the main characters. There were also some things that were revealed in the movie that did get almost completely glossed over, but thats not necessarily a bad thing and its a whole lot better than how the characters in the prequels walked around and talked as a way to reveal exposition. 2. The cliff hanger they used to end the movie was not really that good, there I said it.The cliff hanger in empire strikes back helps tie up that chapter and keeps you in anticipation for what happens next because it was a cliff hanger built up through two movies. The Force Awakens cliff hanger felt kind of awkward and rushed. But thats my opinion you just have to watch it. The movie sure is way better than the prequels, but i'd say it's on par with Return Of The Jedi."
5001,1,George Could have done it better.,"The answer is no, it is worse. So, I hate films that are made purely for cash and to rip off other films and what without acknowledgement. And I have a strong dislike for hack directors. Yet, despite that we went in with hope and walked out knowing all the bad reviews were correct. The acting and story is hilarious stupid, both in seeing what awful art can be made by JJ Abrams as well as laughing at a genius director and actors who do not even know how the force works."
5002,5,"It was fun, but alright.",Not what the Bible ordered!
5003,1,Is The Force Awakens really That Bad,I have watched all the Star Wars films. When the greedy ones at Disney Corporation took over I was still hoping to see the last three episodes of this saga. Well thanks Disney Corporate for totally destroying what was once a great saga. I do not care how many more cash-ins you greedy raiders release I am done with Star Wars. This was the single worst episode of the series even if it was a reboot that I have ever watched. Does Disney know where they are going with Star Wars or are they just shovelling manure out in order to recoup the payments to George Lucas. It was not until the middle of this film that I figured out it had no resemblance to the quality of Star Wars. I am an optimistic guy. At least Disney could afford bringing in good actors. What sort of a casting do they do?
5004,1,Mixing of the races,"To start off, I submitted my rating of 2/10 and then IMDB asked me to sign in. I did, and when it popped up again, I had somehow magically rated it an 8. That explains how this awful, hokey and utterly contrived POS got such a high rating. In a nutshell, I felt like I was watching a parody of a Star Wars movie. The only thing I've seen lately that was remotely close to the three great original films has been Rogue One. Don't waste your time or money watching this USA Network slapdash hunk of saccharin, watch Rogue One instead. J.J. Abrams is now officially the ruination of cherished memories."
5005,1,Hope Lucas Is Enjoying His $4 billion,"Pretty Cheesy, and rushed and not true to the original 3."
5006,2,I won't bother to rehash,"I mean... I was totally bleeding from my eyes. I'm a fan of 4-6 episodes of Star Wars, but this was just utterly disappointing. I couldn't watch it till the end and will never watch another Star Wars movie again, except for Rogue One, that one was good - probably because it was a side story and without that rund down last jedy-crap."
5007,3,Not Good 😬,The audiences are the rebels.
5008,1,"Just one word ""disappointment""","A frantic search for plans concerning an intergalactic super weapon?<br /><br />An introduction of a young potential hero seemingly stranded on a remote desert planet who as yet has no knowledge of the force?<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />Well hold on there one second, this isn't a review of ""A New Hope"" this is ""The force awakens"" or more accurately it's ""not the new hope"""
5009,2,The New Order Is Disney,"Don't waste your time with this movie, and The Last Jedi was even worse. I don't care how much you liked Star Wars as a kid or whatever, these films don't have the slightest vibe you get from watching a Star Wars film. Absolutely terrible, I don't know how Disney wasted so much money producing such an awful movie. Do yourself a favor, save your time and money and pretend these movies don't exist and the series stops at episode 6 lol"
5010,5,It's the new hope that's not the new hope.,I loved the original Star Wars movies but this was WRETCHED! The storyline was as slow and shaky as 75yr old Harrison Ford trying to run around like an action hero. PAINFUL to watch. Equally painful to see John Boyega try to act. Boyega and Ridley were TERRIBLE in their attempts at fight scenes that went on forever without a purpose or expertise.
5011,3,Disappointment would be an understatement,"Really enjoyed it on first viewing. The nostalgia of watching an original Star Wars film again, the quick pacing, the intense action -- they all swept me up in excitement. "
5012,1,HORRIBLE,"Not only a remake of A New Hope, but a terrible film in it's own right. Even worse than The Last Jedi, which is saying something. Makes the prequel trilogy look like the original trilogy in comparison."
5013,5,Doesn't Age Well,Just a remake with a girl instead of a boy
5014,1,Derivative garbage,Jar Jar Abrams doesn't do plots
5015,2,Rip off,I hope JJ Abrams made enough money to feed that ex-wife he keeps bringing up.
5016,2,Plotholes Galore...,"Surprise, surprise, the ultimate fanboy JJ has plagiarized another popular film. Unfortunately the few changes introduced destroy the integrity of the film while nearly nullifying the achievements of the original trilogy's protagonists."
5017,2,Just Like Jar Jar To Mess This Up,"The only redeeming thing about this movie is the fact that Disney paid Harrison Ford enough money to comeback as Han Solo, and the fact that the title says Stae Wars. Aside from this the film is poorly filmed, too much shabby CGI, and terrible choreography. Not much in terms og good character development either. Overall the story is just a bad copy of episode IV of the original trilogy so nothing new there either. I can not recommend anything about this film aside from the fact that it's a Star Wars film, but that probably is not enough to save this movie anyways."
5018,1,Another atrocious science fiction/fantasy film.,"This new remake by Disney and JJ Abrams (now universally called Jar Abrams) is quite horrid and quite inferior from the installments that came before it. It is frightening that something could be worse than the prequels but Disney and its accounting cash bag man have done it! Boring, very uninspired, VERY plagiaristic (literally they swapped a good actor with a bad one and just made the new one female). She looked so much like she is having a ball prancing around to the old script."
5019,5,Not a good movie,"Such stupid, worthless, rip off story line . Glorification of magical Mary Sues where the sole role of a woman is to be magical and be a video game heroine on God mode. She is not even pretty or shows skin to make us enjoy and is instead an egotistic and entitled female character.<br /><br />What does this have to do with Star Wars? Even the Bad Robot spammers could not tell you."
5020,1,Very Blah Remake,"I have gotten flak and will get flak for my opinions of Star Wars. Such opinions include liking midichlorians and defending Jake Llyod's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker. However, surprisingly, non have gotten more hate than my opinions of The Force Awakens. I thought it was a great movie, but it has many flaws, the one I will address here is everything surrounding the destruction of the Hosnian system. We had no reason to care. When I say that, people compare it to Alderaan. The thing is, with Alderaan, we had a survivor. We had the line ""I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."" There is more impact in that moment. In The Force Awakens, its treated as ""The universal government just blew up... So, what's up next on T.V. There is no impact, no emotion in the destruction. If we had seen some people on the planet, like was originally intended, it would be better, but the scene was cut. The other problem is more with the New Republic. Who are they? What does the New Republic do? What power do they have? What is there relationship with the First Order and the Resistance? These questions are never answered, or even addressed at all. However, despite this, I still love this movie, just not as much as A New Hope or Phantom Menace."
5021,3,Wattpad script?,"Another step forward two steps back another step forward three steps back, are you still with me then good good good."
5022,5,"Best Star Wars movie, but not my favorite",Stop with all these gender switches
5023,5,Follow me,"Let's say it's canned food for children. For the regular Joe who needs something easy to chew. If I had seen the reviews here before watching the film, there would not have been a need to suffer through this joke movie. And I admit that I was about to even become a fan from the start, but then I watched this film and I forced myself to see it and notice how much they destroyed what Star Wars stands for. I clarify that I am not a biased fan. I am only a person who enjoys a story well told. And this copy is not one of them."
5024,2,Hurl at my TV,"Don't watch this, just waste of time. Only some good graphics and visual can be seen. But specifically we need a story for sitting 3 hours under the banner 'Star Wars.'"
5025,1,When a work of art is Crushed,Jar Jar Abrams sucks.
5026,2,The Farce Awakens And Stinks up The joint,Which time disney buyed star wars.<br /><br />Star wars is finished
5027,1,"Be Careful If You Watch This: Cheese will drip from your TV, walls, ceiling and house","If you pause the film and just look at the screens it will give you more joy than seeing it run. The script is so bad, even the prequels contributed more to the universe than this utterly unambitious film. Even though it contains some worthy scenes, the story and plot will just make you sad and angry. And people are saying Abrams saved the franchise from Lucas, but even on his worst Lucas managed to add additional valuable lore to the saga, while Abrams gulps up a remake with bigger explosions!<br /><br />This script makes me sick."
5028,2,Disney,"This is the start of the reboot/continuation of the series, and it's a lot of fan pandering but not much of a good story. We see old characters and get's introduced to new ones, but it's kinda meh."
5029,4,"A real shame this movie was so bad, or else it could have been good","This film is so silly I felt forced to write a review. copied from the classic with no shame, copied, full of clichés, poor acting (this is big), poor storytelling, no script writing (it just copied the originals without announcing it)- it's got it all. If you want to see lots of CGI modelled after someone else's ideas and hear lots of pointless bass noises, then this is the movie for you. It was so poor, I fell embarrassed. I would have hit stop, but the tiredness from my sleep compelled me to just sit there. The only redeeming features are: won't pay for any more of this series the CGI (in parts) is great and the story is connected to the Star Wars name. Nonetheless, this film is a waste of time and money (unless you don't care for originality or are younger than 11 mentally and don't know Star Wars)."
5030,5,"Neither good nor bad, but a new beginning.","Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a missed opportunity and another example of how Hollywood has run out of ideas and stories to tell. Out of all of the stories that you can tell in the star wars universe they chose to tell a story we have already seen. Episodes 4,5,and 6 tell of the epic, galactic struggle of the rebels to overcome the evil empire. They succeed. They make you feel like good has won. There was a good arc and that story is told. The Force Awakens chooses to negate everything that happened in the original trilogy and tell the story of the resistance overcoming the first order. We have seen this. This is nothing new. In a universe full of interesting aliens, cultures, and worlds we are going to get movies full of everything that we have seen already."
5031,2,So bad I had to create a review account,"It sucked as a movie, and compared to Rogue One, it was absolutely pathetic. Rogue One was well done and a good movie even if you don't like Star Wars. After having seen Rogue One again this weekend, Force Awakens ##### me off as bad as those Star Wars episodes 1-3 did a few years ago. Same territory."
5032,3,A missed opportunity.,Or The Last Jedi. They are both bad. One is a copy/paste (this) with a mary sue chick. The other one is a lacksadaiscial attempt at a movie with impossible physics and no clue.<br /><br />I don't dig these films.<br /><br />Star Wars sucks.
5033,1,It sucked.,"This film was over hyped to oblivion. Expectations were high and as a result it was just played too safe. Many of the ideas were straight up stolen from other, more successful, Star Wars movies."
5034,2,Not Sure if this is worse,"I liked the movie a lot, it felt like Star Wars which the prequels didn't. Is it a total homage to ANH? Yes, but it kind of had to be in order to not only get back us as fans but win over new fans as well. ANH is the perfect skeleton work from and this movie DOES do enough new stuff to make it it's own film. The characters are all likable and fun and move the story along at a energetic pace. There is not one dull moment in this movie which is breathtaking to say the least. So used to the placidness of the prequels that I forgot how fun Star Wars actually was and could be. So yeah go see the film (you probably already have) you won't regret it and just go with anyone you possibly can because this film is more than a movie it's an event and the beginning of something huge."
5035,1,A very very mediocre film,"When the First Star Wars movie came out it was a risky film. I used an orchestra to make a soundtrack, when disco was very popular, supported happy endings, and it went against the realism that was dominating cinema. Then this film goes against the hole idea of Star Wars by just recycling the plot and even the sets' and props' art. There was nothing surprising, as all I had to do was connect who was the New Hope character, and I already knew the major plot elements an hour before they happened."
5036,3,"Good start, you have me interested in more JJ.",It is game over.
5037,1,Too much of an Unnoficial Reboot,"After watching every Star Wars and now watching the reboot, The Force Awakens I can say this was a complete disappointment, and the clear proof that how things are being done at Disney: reasonable contacts, speaking gibberish and making the movie-attending public believe they are smarter than they actually are because the they can get a way with a copy/paste script."
5038,2,JJ ABrams Destroyed Star Wars,"Look even at times the most welcome change of the times wears out its welcome. As a woman, I was happy that the equality of genders takes shape and grows and becomes more common, but I am starting to think Hollywood has gone too far. First, putting aside the copy/paste script of The Force Awakens, the story line makes no sense. It defies all the logic of the Star Wars universe. This super instant jedi stuff is just not on. But also it is painfully obvious that in order to bow down to the PC trends they have placed a woman at the forefront. I mean Ghostbusters? Mad Max? X-Men? Rogue One? Arrival? so on and so on every film has a female leading actress nowadays... I have no problem with that if the acting was good, the story was good, it made sense, but no.. instead we are treated to bad stories and acting in a forced situation! I mean look at Gravity... No original idea in sight!"
5039,1,This is Anti-Star Wars - Boycott,"This movie was a sad attempt at making a Star Wars movie. The plot was extremely weak due to it being a sad remake of A New Hope. Such as when the astromech droid gets stranded on the surface of a desert planet and meets the hero, a person in their late teens who then escape the planet with a few new friends on the millennium falcon when the empire attacks. The teen goes on to find a mentor, learns the force, and destroys the Death Star. Also, there are a few plot holes such as when Rey is able to best Kylo Ren despite never even holding a lightsaber before or when Rey knew how to fly the Millennium Falcon despite obviously never learning how to fly it. That being said, I couldn't bear giving this film less than three stars because, despite its flaws, the performances were decent (with the exception of Kylo Ren), the visuals were very well done, and John Williams' musical score was amazing. So, in conclusion, the story is unoriginal and contrived, and there were a few decent parts, but these failed to make up for the weaknesses in the plot."
5040,2,A cliché is a cliché is a cliché,"It was that bad, bland and boring!"
5041,1,The weakest Star Wars movie,"First of all, this is my first review, sorry in advance for my English."
5042,2,Is The Director Denis Villeneuve?,"Besides the fact that this movie is a complete rip off of the original and some of the laziest writing in movie history, its a complete slap in the face to the fans who made the franchise what it is today. From the beginning you have the nearly all white male army with the exception of 2 characters that resembles Nazis, 1 is the only black storm trooper who can see how evil these white men are and decides he wants no part of this. 2 is the only woman storm trooper who is obviously the only strong and competent one out of the entire army. You got the main villain who looks like some kid that gets his lunch money stolen every day and throws temper tantrums like a 5 year old. Now to the main star, forget Luke Skywalker. In his place they put a 90 pound woman to be the hero. Not only is she a hero but she can use the force without even knowing she has it and win a light saber duel against a trained Jedi because girl power. No Yoda no problem, they managed to create a female that resembles him to take his place. she serves no real purpose but damned if they're not gonna replace every male character possible. There are 2 white heroes in this movie, one who you see for a total of about 5 minutes when the plot calls for it and Han Solo who is killed off so the female and back guy get to fly his ship without looking like the bad guys and give the fans some sense of nostalgia while they destroy one of the greatest film franchises. So much effort was spent in replacing white male characters that the new characters have no substance whatsoever. At no point do you think the heroes might fail nor do you care. The story and characters all suffered because of Hollywood and now Disney SJW agenda."
5043,5,A very enjoyable film,"There is absolutely nothing good or original about this film. Its worse than the prequels. At least Ep. 1 had Darth Maul vs the Jedi, the duel of fates sound track and Otoh Gunga. At least Ep. 2 had Count Dooku, Jango Fett, Kamino, the mass Jedi battle. At least Ep. 3 had Mustafar and Obiwan Vs Anakin and Yoda vs Palpatine. What does TFA have? Its just a blatant carbon copy of things we have already seen and so badly put together that it is laughable. This review is spot on in my opinion so please watch this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g9cJ5WKZeU&t=19s So next we have the last Jedi. Mark Hammil is back. May the force help us. Its going to be a disaster."
5044,1,More social justice at its worst,"Ghostbusters, Robocop, Total Recall, bla bla bla I guess I am tired of all of these remakes."
5045,1,"Pathetic, empty, brainless, waste of time","Apparently this reboot is still playing so anyway we thought we should watch it but unfortunately this is one of the worst remakes. Can Disneyland make it any less obvious that they are trying to rip us off? It has been years since we watch the original film, but we could tell every plot element coming because they are the exact same... they just switched the man with the good acting with a woman who frankly cannot act. And that is fine, the director cannot direct either. he is too obvious and shallow. We found the droid cute but of course it should be for sale at the Disney Store, right? LOL"
5046,1,I Guess I Am Tired Of All These Reboots,"This film is so bad that it's good. I saw it for the first time on New Year's Eve and I spent the whole film wondering where the good parts were. Then I figured 8.1 is payola and IMDb needs mullah. I burst out laughing at the former owner of a spaceship who runs into it in the vastness of the cosmos. Much like the film Ishtar, it's the lame story that really makes this film so bad that it's good. I wish they would release this for free in China so that nation starts to change and sees the true face of American boredom."
5047,1,My wife and I will be saving money not watching the next one,Indeed as everyone knows this film is bad and bad and worse. That is  not new. For more information read the 16 pages of straight negative  reviews on this site. They add quite a bit to our thinking about this  reboot. What I wanted to add is that even if i am a woman i still think  character development is necessary and a female lead should be  justified. This is Star Wars! think about those things! What is more is  that despite the copious number of very bad reviews of this reboot I  have read positive reviews of this film that insult Star Wars and its  fans. Clearly those people speak a truth. people who like this reboot  hate Star Wars (in addition being Disney office employees as evidenced  by the fact that they refer to 'franchise' because they are corporate  jerks). Ignore those Star Wars haters and Disney employees and  boycott Episodes 7 to 15. They are craptacular reboot rip offs.
5048,1,Great Film - For Cloners,"Reading the pages of reviews here I almost did not write this review. Those reviews are right. There is a strong case of deja vu running through this reboot. In other words, if you have seen A New Hope why watch this? The desert planet, the orphan, the death star, the 'alien' bar and so forth."
5049,1,The Worst,This film was awful. It is just a cash cow to add to the monthly Marvel release schedule of Disney.
5050,1,Very disappointing,When are they gonna hired proper writters for those blockbusters?<br /><br />That trilogie is so bad even a Star Wars fan can't watch it.
5051,1,Cynical Remake They Call A Sequel,Lesson: How to train your Jedi(!)<br /><br />Subject: How the first Jedi has become?
5052,1,"Terrible, Bad written and no character arcs.",They kill the force and make it something like 'intuition' or 'will power' and then call this film The Force Awakens.
5053,5,Is it a parody Star Wars Film?,"In the realm of the worst remakes and films in history this one must be the most mocked. I am not only referring to 3,000+ negative reviews on IMDb or the fact that Disney has hired payola reviewers to give this reboot a positive spin, but the hordes of videos on YouTube and vimeo mocking this."
5054,1,Hypocritical much?,"First of all, yes I acknowledge that a 6 is probably too low a score for this movie. It is well above average and deserves around 7, however in my opinion it does not come close to a score of over 8 and therefore I did this to show my displeasure at that high a score."
5055,1,How many reboots do you know that have entire video libraries mocking it?,As far as Hollywood remakes go this is a bad one. You can almost see the bean counters on screen staring at you laughing with derision.
5056,5,There are issues,Being a long time fan of Star Wars I decided to watch this film with my wife and boy I wish I had listened to my friends who all had said this reboot is a markedly inferior remake and makes little sense. They were correct.
5057,1,As Bad (or worse) As you Have Heard,Who would hire JJ Abrams to direct Star Wars? A pickpocket that steals from the audience and stabs them in the front.
5058,1,I Wish I Had Listened To My Friends,"With the exception of the final lightsaber hand over scene, the movie was wrapped up in the same sloppy bow it was presented in.<br /><br />Good triumphed over evil without any training?!? Seriously Disney, and people who support this trash the most evil get defeated in one movie by kids with no training."
5059,1,A Sign Of Hollywood Bankruptcy In General And Disney In Particular,"I honestly tried to watch the remake of A New Hope until the conclusion, but I could not (and I am sorry for the time spent on watching this reboot)."
5060,3,No reason for a trilogy...,"It seems that this piece of crap will keep on sinking down despite the tremendous effort probably of Jar Jar Abrams himself (Note that how many 10/10 reviews could be recently read below praising JJ Abrams). Before me many other real reviewers have already written down why this abomination does just not deserve to be called a movie: no plot, terrible acting, not respecting the nature of the force, insanity of Starkiller base: sucking a sun and exploding worlds hundreds of Light Years far away with a laser beam (which travel with max. speed of light)etc. Beside all of these I would like to highlight how this thing downgraded complete and living worlds to merely a stage of a theater act. There is a desert world with a tiny camp containing a shop where you can buy food for crap, there is no history, no reasons why it exists. Just a shop surrounded by tents. There is a forest world with a cantina in middle of it. Just a cantina. There is a tiny secret base of rebels without any reason for its existence. And there is the planet for the imperials. ...and one more word: Porgs will come..."
5061,1,Worst Disney princess ever,"Acting is bad, script is bad, everything's bad, don't bother watching it, that's all."
5062,1,Porgs,"I've never seen the original Star Wars film so I went into watching this with very much an open mind. It ended up being incredibly disappointing although the CGI was cool and reminded me of Independence Day films, the girl, who I imagine is funny in her own right, seemed to have absolutely zero chemistry with anyone else and oddly enough the cleaner trooper character ended up being even more confused than her."
5063,3,Bad,The basic structure of the plot is too similar to A New Hope and far too much time is wasted on fan service. Unfortunately they have made too many unsatisfactory alterations for this film to work as a worthwhile remake.
5064,2,Disappointing,That's right. I fell asleep in the movie theater even though it was a ridiculously loud movie. Save your money at watch at home.
5065,1,I'd rather watch The Star Wars Holiday Special,Which is 0.01 out of 10... and that is because I am generous.
5066,2,Sleeper,I was so confused with the intro of this movie I didn't know what was going on until half way through the movie. Terrible. JJ Sucks.
5067,1,I Give This Reboot 10 out of 10 out of 10 out of 10,"She lied. No wrist, only me trying leave her. No wrist, just grappling the handle of my suitcase. No wrist, I packed to leave. No wrist, wanted to leave so many years ago. No wrist, just getting lied too like lies before knowing me about her uncle. No wrist, I am a good man. No wrist, as everyone knows me, before her, during her and after her."
5068,1,Star Wars The Farts Awaken,"Not sure how something like this gets such good ratings. As a Movie in and of it self its not too bad (but also far from good). As a Star Wars Movie its just crap. It is unoriginal, full of tired missplaced and unnatural characters."
