0,,"All the fun of the original with a much better, darker plot","The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion.  While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large."
1,10,"Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday."
2,10,I enjoy this one more than A New Hope,"So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem."
3,,"A worthy second (or 5th??) Star Wars installment, might be the best of the bunch.","My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai."
4,10,It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature,"`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now."
5,10,"Even though he wasn't at the director's helm this time, George Lucas has done it again.","In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained."
6,10,Best Star Wars FILM,"After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been hounded by the Empire. Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo are with the Rebel forces on the secret base on the planet Hoth. Darth Vader locates the base driving the rebels on the run. Leia, Chewie, and Han with C-3PO escape on the Millennium Falcon eventually ending up in Lando Calrissian's Cloud City. Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda."
7,10,finest of the trilogy because Lucas didn't write the script,"SPOILERS Three years after ""Star Wars"", creator George Lucas released the second part of his trilogy. Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential."
8,10,"Manages to be even better than New Hope, and that was just as brilliant","The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
9,10,"The best ""Star Wars"" film ever made.",(Note: This review contains some spoilers.)
10,10,This is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Disney+. The storyline picks up where Star Wars left off with the rebellion building their army and the evil Empire rebounding from losing the Death Star. Luke will try to master the powers of the force by searching for a new Jedi to train him; meanwhile, as he digs into his past he discovers more about how he became a Jedi to begin with."
11,10,The best movie of all Star wars,''Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back '' is my favorite one from all the star war series.
12,10,Fantastic Sequel,"The rebels' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends? "
13,,The best film in the original trilogy.,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."
14,10,"""It is your destiny""","It's obvious to most movie fans that Star Wars Episode IV deserves tons of praise for being the first in its respective series and also for spawning one of the biggest cultural phenomenons of all time, but in my view, The Empire Strikes Back is superior. I have seen someone state this already, but I will say it again here, as it is a very good reason why this movie is arguably better: character development. We get introduced to the main cast in A New Hope, but even by the end of that film, they're not fully fleshed out yet. We never really get to see how adept Luke is at using The Force, and Darth Vader, one of the most feared men in the galaxy, appears completely subservient to Peter Cushing's character, Grand Moff Tarkin. Episode V takes Star Wars in a risky direction, as Luke is separated from his friends for most of the runtime, but this decision totally paid off and I don't think the movie could have gone any better. The story picks up 3 whole years after Luke has destroyed the Death Star: the Empire's feared space station capable of obliterating entire planets. Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, the two most powerful men in the Empire, send floating droids all over the galaxy to locate the secret base of the Rebel Alliance (the empire's enemy), under the command of Luke's sister Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Vader eventually finds what he's looking for and locates what looks like a stronghold on the frigid planet of Hoth. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating an area around the rebel base and is attacked and nearly killed by a yeti-esque creature called a Wampa. Luke manages to slice off one of its arms with his lightsaber and is then rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Before being saved, Luke sees a vision of his late trainer, Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) telling him to travel to a planet called Dagobah for some reason. Confident they have the rebel base in their sights, the Imperials launch a brutal onslaught on it using huge, walking, mechanized assault vehicles called AT AT's that decimate everything in their path. Luke and a few other rebels pilot rather slow spaceships known as snowspeeders in order to destroy the imperial walkers by tying their legs with tow cables and then blasting the weak armor on their neck joints. Despite their best efforts, the base is hit too hard and has to evacuate. Leia, Han, C-3PO, Chewbacca and R2D2 pile into the Millennium Falcon, Solo's rather mediocre but dependable starship, and fly off just as Vader enters the hangar. Luke doesn't regroup with his allies right away, and instead flies to the planet Dagobah as Obi-Wan's ghost told him to. Upon arriving in the planet's atmosphere, he loses control of his X-Wing and crashes into a swamp. Here, he meets Yoda, a centuries old Jedi Master who trains Luke in the way of the force. While Han and the others try to elude Vader's fleet of ships and star destroyers by weaving through asteroid fields, Luke expresses frustration at the difficulty of his training. He knows the force seems to be a magical aura of divine, supernatural energy that surrounds everything and inhabits all living beings, but he is not willing to put up with the time required to bend it to his will. Yoda makes things easier for him and uses his mastery over the force to easily lift Luke's crashed spaceship out of the swamp using only his mind. Luke quits his training early to pursue his friends to a planet called Bespin, since he can tell they're walking into a trap. Concurrently, Han Solo and the others arrive at Cloud City on bespin; a huge floating metropolis situated entirely in the sky. There, they meet Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who is a no good smuggler (like Han) and an old acquaintance of his. While on cloud city, Lando reveals to the group that he's actually betrayed them to the empire. Vader, accompanied by the ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett, take Han to a specialized chamber where he is frozen in carbonite so Boba can transport him to Jabba the Hutt for a reward. As the group (minus Solo) tries to fight their way out of cloud city, Luke comes face to face with Vader. Even with the force training he has received, Luke is no match for the dark lord's lightsaber proficiency and powerful strikes. Vader corners Luke, severs his hand, and reveals he is actually his father. Vader wants his son to join him so they can kill Palpatine together and end this galactic war, but Luke refuses and lets himself fall down a waste disposal chute that leads directly out of cloud city. Barely managing to hang on to a flimsy piece of metal, Leia senses something isn't right and flies underneath cloud city to rescue her brother. The ship jumps to hyperspace, slipping out of Vader's grasp once again. Back on a rebel medical ship, Luke receives an artificial right hand, and Lando promises to look for his friend Solo. Aside from the fact that this is a star wars movie, there are no doubt a ton of other reasons why it is worthy of adoration. Probably the most visually obvious reason are the special effects. Despite being over 4 decades old, this movie still looks great, and the effects will always look good no matter what year it is. The battle on hoth is amazing. We see the empire's enormous AT AT tanks, and how even their footsteps cause destruction. We see the millennium falcon get chased by massive, dagger shaped spaceships. Most of all, we see much appreciated character development. Luke still hasn't mastered all his force powers by the end of this movie, but he's come a long way thanks to Yoda. Speaking of which, Frank Oz did a great job puppeteering him and basically created one of cinema's most beloved characters. Even the villains are interesting and likable. Vader I believe needs no introduction, but he contrasts heavily with how he was in the first film. He's completely in control here and does what he wants, unlike in episode IV where Tarkin bosses him around, and episode VI where Palpatine does. While still a cool bad guy, it's always annoyed me how Boba Fett is consistently ranked as one of star wars' most popular characters, mostly just because of how he looks. He only has 4 lines in this entire movie, but he's still memorable for being one of the few people who can talk back to Vader and still be alive afterwards. It's not like I need to state the obvious, but John Williams' score really serves to make an epic film even more epic. All I have to say for my closing remark is that The Empire Strikes Back has clearly secured its place as one of the most well made star wars films, which should be common knowledge for any fan of this immortal franchise."
15,9,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema."
16,10,Greatest Movie Ever,"This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through.<br /><br />Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for.<br /><br />That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. <br /><br />The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. <br /><br />The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years."
17,10,Why can't they make them like this any more?,"From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor."
18,10,One of the best movies of all!,"The sequel to Star Wars is argueably the best of all the Star Wars films.This is much darker than the 1st one.Look for the Super Star Destroyer,it is a awesome ship.Boba Fett makes his fist appearence here.The chase scene the M.Falcon is being chased down by the Star Destroyers and Tie Fighters is really a cool scene.I f you like the 1st Star Wars then you will love this one!"
19,,Outstanding follow up.,"Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system."
20,10,Star Wars Episode 5 Empire Strike Back,One of the best movies in Star Wars is a very interesting movie
21,10,Best of the best,"I cannot believe some people out there didn't like this film, yet claim to have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. ""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!"
22,10,My Favourite Film Ever,"So my next step in watching Star Wars films is the 2nd film released The Empire Strikes Back and I'm going to spoil the review for anybody watching this is my favourite film I have ever seen so expect me to be very positive about this film. The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker travel to the planet Dagobah and learn from a Jedi Master in order to improve his skills, while Leia, Han, Chewbacca & C-3PO are on the run from The Empire with Darth Vader in charge of everything."
23,10,Top Tier Cinema,"What can I say about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that hasn't already been said? This film takes everything great about ""A New Hope"" and elevates it. The cinematography, the setting, the characters, the story, everything is crisp and succinct in ""Empire"". There were multiple times (3 to be exact) that I had full body chills, all because of the brilliant marriage of story, score and performance."
24,10,Best of the three,"Like the Wrath of Khan, Empire improves upon the first movie in the series. In fact, once all three were out, this remained the best of them. Often times the second movie of a trilogy feels more like a step that was needed to reach the conclusion rather than an adventure of its own. Empire succeeded where so many others failed, even in the modern trilogies. The characters are further developed, the special effects are ground breaking and the universe in which this is based is rich."
25,8,Who's Your Daddy?,"After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?"
26,10,still the best star wars movie ever made,"And one of the best movies in general, it's better than a new hope in every way possible and it's one of the strongest sequels in the cinema."
27,10,More than 20 times viewed and it NEVER gets old,"I literally watched this movie about twenty times when I first got it, VHS , a box-set of the original three. But this one is best! It was the most exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the whole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy in the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor. This is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any of the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many household names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those people lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films. All I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on this 5-star, one of a kind classic. Must see, it's too great for a 10 out of 10 rating. It was way ahead of its time. It's a film of the ages and has caliber modern films dream to re-create!"
28,10,The snow movie!,That's what I called this when I was too small to reach the movies in my house. My poor mother had to decipher that description.
29,10,The sequel to the groundbreaking Star Wars revisits everything that worked the first time while upping the stakes and refining the rough spots.,"Following the events of the last film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew),Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), their droids R2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and the rest of the rebel alliance have been driven into hiding on the ice planet Hoth after their destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader(physical: David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) continues his search for Skywalker and eventually finds the rebel base with the rebel forces forced to retreat and Luke is separated while Han and the others attempt to elude pursuit of the Empire. Luke travels to the Dagobah system at the direction of his deceased master Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) and directs Luke to locate his former master Yoda. As Luke dives deeper into the teachings of the Jedi and The Force, Luke's friends will face a danger that will force Luke to make a choice that could lead him to the Dark Side and discover revelations that challenge everything he's learned."
30,10,A proposed alternate subtitle: The Humiliation of Luke Skywalker.,"There are two main ways to follow up a genre film. The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the ""bigger is better"" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go."
31,10,Even better than the original,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a more mature, unpredictable sequel that continues to expand the universe and is overall even better than the original, as one of the greatest sequels of all time. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher are all incredible. James Earl Jones is even better as a more threatening and ruthless Darth Vader and Frank Oz is excellent as Yoda. Billy Dee Williams is a welcome addition in a effortlessly charismatic performance. John Williams' musical score is perfect once again. It's expertly paced and Irvin Kershner's direction is incredible. The action sequences are extremely thrilling and it has the best lightsaber fight in the franchise so far, in my opinion. It also has one the greatest twists of all time."
32,10,An Honest Review,"So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition."
33,9,Big Improvement Over The First Star Wars,"Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series."
34,,The Son,The Son
35,10,"""Still is the best sequel of all time""",I remember to see this movie with my father(R.I.P)in theaters and in that time you don't know nothing about the movie is not like this times that you have magazinez and web to know everything about the movie so i was in 0 when i got to see it.
36,10,Flawless.........,"So good. Star Wars A New Hope was amazing when it came out. So the hype around The Empire Strikes Back was huge. But wow, this film was awesome. The film did everything that made the first film great and added with it. From the iconic twist, to introducing new characters such as Bobba Fett, Lando Calrissian and the other bounty hunters. It added on so many new things and it worked great. Overall this is a classic film that everyone should watch, Star Wars fan or not, the original trilogy is a must watch for everyone."
37,10,Masterpiece,A true masterpiece. in my opinion the best star wars movie.
38,10,2nd the best,"For the Original Star Wars trilogy this was a pivotal movie to get right and they got it right. Perfect middle film putting the story together and as we all know two of the greatest lines in the star wars franchise in this movie, one from Darth Vader and one from Han Solo. Brilliant film all round."
39,10,Definitely one of the greatest movies of all time,"It's really sad to see what star wars has become these days..unoriginal, uninspiring, lacking passion..I can go on and on and on but I just don't have the stomach for it anymore..but this movie right here, star wars empire strikes back, is just so masterfully inspiring and masterfully done. The fact that George Lucas did this movie on his own with his own money should tell you everything you need to know about how amazingly tenacious he is, not only that, he brought the characters to life..making them memorable, believable and most importantly relatable. Yes it's an old movie, yes it feels out dated...but trust me, if you look really past that and focus on its level of storytelling and the amazing writing of the story, you will understand why this movie has a rating of 8.7...most movies today and even in the last decade haven't even gotten close to that. Give it a shot...you won't be disappointed."
40,10,The best of the original trilogy,"Empire Strikes Back is by far the best of the original trilogy. I'm sure there were plot twists before 1980, but this movie has to go down in history as the best and biggest plot twist ever with just 3 words: ""I'm your father""."
41,10,Even better than the first one!,"Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader (David Prowse)."
42,10,Star Wars at its best,"Some films you love because you can't separate your childhood from your view, but this is as good as popcorn entertainment gets either way. I've watched and watched and now my son loves, if only you can get hold of the untinkered version it's just brilliant."
43,10,Well Done. One of the best sci-fi films ever. It almost equals the 1977 original in terms of quality and popularity.,"Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall ""The Empire Strikes Back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original."
44,9,Maybe the Best of Them All,"Every time I revisit the good old first trilogy I wonder: did Georg Lucas spend all this creativity on the first three movies or did he have some ghost writer or maybe he got the story dictated by a supernatural being? Without any doubt, those three first movies of the ST franchise are still and maybe for all eternity gems and milestones to the sci-fi genre, but almost everything else that was produced and published after Return of the Jedi is in comparison bad, really bad, with a very few exceptions (Rogue One was good). But maybe the saying even a blind hen sometimes finds a grain of corn just fits too well to Mr. Lucas. Anyway, he gave us these three epic movies, and for these treasures I am grateful in all eternity, and the rest I can just ignore. Amen."
45,10,The saga thickens and matures,"This film is the continuation of the story of the first. The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film."
46,10,My 8th favorite film of all time!,"This is my favorite of the classic Star Wars trilogy! It is the most suspenseful of the three and, as great as the other two are, they don't flow like this one does. This one explores the relationships instead of just action sequences (which are good in all three, though). The romance between Han and Leia and the one between Luke and Yoda, for example. This does have the best action sequence of the three of them, though; the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader. Pure brilliance!"
47,10,Awesome,(5 out of 5 stars).
48,10,The darkest and best of the original trilogy,"One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny."

50,9,HOW TO MAKE A PERFECT SEQUEL.,This is the best example of how to make a perfect sequel of a movie. A sequel that clearly differentiates itself from the original whilst building on the characters and the story in thrilling and surprising ways without a fault. An iconic masterpiece of pure escapism filled with thrills and fun.
51,10,My favorite Star Wars film,"There's only two Star Wars films that I actually really love: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. That's not to say that I like some of the other films in the franchise, but the two I just listed are my alltime favorites."
52,10,brilliant sequel,"The rebels have had their brief victory over the Imperial Forces; destroying the Death Star. But the rebels are on the run, hiding on the remote planet Hoth. Though hidden for now, it doesn't last long. The Empire have found the rebels base and are going to wipe them out. When the rebels escape, Luke goes to find Yoda, to begin his training to become a Jedi. Han, Chewbacca, Leia and C3PO are having more trouble. They are being run down by the Imperial Force fleet; trouble is the Millennium Falcon is falling apart, making their escape all the harder. Finally escaping they head to the cloud city to take refuge with Han's old friend, Lando. But Lando is stuck in a bind. He is being used as a pawn by Darth Vader, to set a trap for Luke."
53,,A Bigger and To Some Better Sequel,The Empire Strikes Back (1980) 
54,10,Easily One of the Best Films Ever Made,This film is as Star Wars as Star Wars gets in that it is one of if not the best story told in the franchise. Empire Strikes Back takes everything that was good about A New Hope and just completely expands upon it. It is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history.
55,10,"""No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.""","The summary line is one of my favorite movie quotes of all time because it embodies a philosophy and a discipline. Whenever I hear someone say 'I'll try', I already know it's a cop out with no intention of getting involved with the task in question. Had George Lucas 'tried' to make the movie, it would never have gotten done. I guess that's why Yoda is my favorite Star Wars character. Yeah OK, he's a puppet, but the character of Yoda is like the Spock of the SW universe, a stabilizing force (Force?) who helps Luke remain grounded and in control of his emotions."
56,10,My Favorite Star Wars Adventure!,"In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later."
57,10,Striking Distance...,"Luke, Han and Leia find themselves waging war against the Empire, along the way they meet the Emperor, Lando, Yoda and find out Luke's hereditary tie to a certain Darth Vader. Again as I said in my review for a New Hope, film criticism from me is practically irrelevant since I love the original 3 movies. The Empire Strikes Back is still one of the most shocking film experiences of my life, mainly in how it ended, in which the good guys lost, Darth Vader was Luke's father and it ended on such a somber note. It also led to extreme debate as to where they would go from here and many kids at the lunch table wondered how this twist came to be. I still stand by A New Hope being my personal favorite, but this is a better overall film, the snow walkers in particular are still breathtaking and Cloud City while not as spectacular in 1980, still holds up really well. At the time this was out of this world and I left the theater crushed at the film's finale, but eagerly anticipating Star Wars 3."
58,9,"This film was released wide in the USA on June 20th, 1980","Before the release of Star Wars (1977], in the theaters, it still had to go through the same steps as any other movie. It too was considered a one shot deal, just like any other movie. It too, like every other film, had to pass the big test at the box office first, before anything else could happen. As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films. What makes Empire Strikes Back (1980), so good, is the fact that, the film is one of those bridge-films. It bridges the gap from the first film to the third film. Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story."
59,10,Perfect Star Wars Film in an Imperfect Saga,"The Empire Strikes Back brings the viewer further into the galaxy of Star Wars. Following the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, this darker chapter brings newer characters and adventures to the table. We learn more about who we have already come to love in the previous installment and we are able to enjoy a much more well-rounded and fleshed out idea of what Lucas' galaxy far far away should look and feel like. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo steals the show alongside his companion Chewbacca, played by the late Peter Mayhew. Mark Hamill really ups his game with Luke, making him into a less adolescent and sheltered farm kid, he's learning more about his past and the life he never knew. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa is the perfect mixture of sass and whit as she shows us that not all space royalty is uppity and useless. Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect Star Wars movie in an otherwise very flawed saga. I recommend it for anyone that wants to go on a wild and fun ride through the stars!"
60,10,The only film that gets a 10,"And I've seen some great films. However, within this one it's the culmination of both fortuitous events and the craft and skill of everyone involved that makes this the best film of all time."
61,8,Pretty darn good,"I never really cared for the sequences with the Falcon parked on the asteroid (and all the faffing about with the faulty hyperspace drive stopped being funny fairly early on), nor with much of the Dagobah stuff."
62,10,Instant Fav -- best of the OG trilogy,My hands-down favorite of the original Star Wars trilogy. The dark side has started seeking their revenge after the destruction of the Death Star and Luke trains to become the Jedi master that his father once was.
63,10,"Darker, more fluid advancement in the story line but not necessarily better","George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'."
64,7,"Action, Adventure, But Lack Of ""Epic""","In terms of action and adventure, ""Empire Strikes Back"" is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that ""sense of something epic"" inherent in its original predecessor."
65,10,They do strike back and make the best sequel in film history,"After the success of Star Wars I think I might have expected a slip if they took it to a sequel but apparently George Lucas' love for this world trumped film making curses for bad sequels. The Empire Strikes Back brings back the incredible original heroes, gives them even more depth and story and still finds time to bring in new timeless characters that become legends in their own right. Even with a new director at the helm, Irvin Kershner, the story and the world that made the first Star Wars so incredible is in tact and even better. The only problem really with the first Star Wars is it felt like only the beginning. Like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and The Empire Strikes Back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. On top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. I won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades. The fights are epic, the new characters are amazing, and even Hamill as Skywalker starts to really shine and get some real depth to his character."
66,10,My favourite Star Wars film,I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was young and just completely loving it. Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.
67,10,the best film,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."
68,10,Vader's fatherhood,"A very well deserved ten to the famous I AM YOUR FATHER. Just loved this one, the action, Han and Leia, Luke's training with yoda... all I can tell is try or try not cause there is no try HAHA, absolute art, 10/10."
69,8,The best in the trilogy,"This is no doubt the best of the three Star Wars films. I don't count the 'prequels' or recent 'sequels', spin-offs and such."
70,10,An amazing 'Star Wars' movie,"""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is an incredible sequel of all time, it had epic moments, perfect lightsaber duel, shocking twist and every that Star Wars delivers."
71,9,The Empire Strikes Back,"Outstanding follow up to the original ""Star Wars,""with Luke Skywalker learning the ways of a Jedi Knight, while Darth Vader awaits a battle with Luke as he sets up Han Solo and Princess Leia. Amazing in the technical department once again. Unmatched. Unforgettable."
72,9,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (Short Movie Review),Positives:<br /><br />
73,10,The Best Star Wars and One of the Best Films Ever Made,"It took many years and many viewings before I could say that I liked this film better than A New Hope. But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret."
74,10,ICONIC,SCORE: 10/10
75,10,"A Timeless Space Opera, The Perfect Sci-Fi Epic","Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect."
76,10,"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter","Why is The Empire Strikes Back (1980) such a beloved movie? Star Wars (1977) is more fun, but Empire marks the point where the story gained more emotional depth and the matinée serial black-and-white morality of the original becomes less defined."
77,10,Stop me if you've heard this before--The best of the Star Wars movies,"Generally regarded as the best of the 5 Star Wars movies(so far, the sixth and final one comes out in May 2005), The Empire Strikes Back is everything Star Wars wasn't. Back in 1977, George Lucas brought us the first story from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars (Now known as ""A New Hope""), and it was a bright, cheerful Saturday afternoon serial with some great special effects. Three years later, George Lucas' story about Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo took a decidedly darker tone in The Empire Strikes Back. None of the good guys win in this second chapter of the 3 film saga that makes up the Original Star Wars Trilogy, the film acts as a dark bridge from the light, fun action of A New Hope to the concluding Return of the Jedi. Even the last scene of this film reeks of ""To Be Continued,"" without actually saying it. The rebel forces, after blowing up the Death Star, are forced to hide out on a the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader tracks them down, and our heroes are forced to flee. Han and Leia go one way, Luke has to find the Jedi Master Yoda on his secluded swamp planet (voice of Frank Oz). Yoda may be the most lifelike character in ""Empire,"" and that's a pretty good compliment to a Muppet. We see Luke fail to master his Jedi powers, and we see him leave in haste to try to save Han and Leia who walk into a trap while visiting Han's old card playing friend, Lando Carisian (Billy Dee Williams). How Luke tries to save his friends is unimportant, as the single most shocking movie revelation comes during the final duel of the movie between Luke and Darth Vader. Unsuspecting movie goers have been blindsided by this scene for decades now. The tone, set by director Irvin Kershner, is darker and more serious, lends an adult feel to what is basically a kid's movie. The special effects are again top-notch, especially in the beautiful Cloud City and the fantastic looking asteroid field chase. Who knew in 1980 George Lucas had reached the pinnacle of his Star Wars franchise with a movie starring a green little troll voiced by the same guy who voices Miss Piggy?"
78,10,The most highly anticipated sequel of all time,"And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering ""the world is not flat it's round"" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying ""Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!"" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that ""This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that."" As Hamill said so eloquently, ""In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!"" I must also include Silent Bob's quote ""She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'."" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect."
79,10,"Even though my review will be lost in the mass of others, I have to voice my opinion of how much a classic this is","This is the epitome of sci-fi movie making. It's a classic, a tale that thrusts the audience into a world completely unlike their own. We love it not just for the famous twist, not just for the cultural impact it has and had on society, but simply for the story and the ground-breaking special effects, one should easily be able to see how much of an achievement this film is."
80,10,Just as good as the first!,"Since its release The Empire Strikes Back has gained a lot of popularity, and it is now widely considered to be the best of the series. Initially many people were disappointed with its cliffhanger ending. I know I wouldn't want to wait three years for the answer to the ""big question"" that was surely on everyone's minds! Anyway, I think Empire has become widely respected for its maturity in comparison to the other Star Wars movies. It's much more dramatic than A New Hope, and it doesn't have the cutesy aspects of Return of the Jedi. Until Revenge of the Sith, Empire was the darkest Star Wars movie. Empire clearly beats it in the execution department though. All of the characters are put into the worst situations imaginable and have to fight their way out."
81,7,Entertaining,"Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news."
82,10,Possibly The Best,"After the sensation that Star Wars was, it would seem impossible to make a worthy follow up but somehow Lucas and his team did. In fact, there's a strong argument to be made that Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back even surpassed its predecessor and is the best of the franchise/hexalogy. While I may not propound that myself, I couldn't exactly reject it either. All I can add is it does contain the best cinematography of all the films, courtesy of Peter Suschitzky."
83,6,"Good Story, Great Action... Unfortunate Pace...","The momentum throughout the largely-adored Star Wars instalment isn't exactly energetic enough to win against A New Hope. So overall, it's a very well-constructed sequel that continues with the epic sci-fi action, but is mainly disappointing."
84,10,And that's why you should respect your elders.,"It will forever stay classic.<br /><br />Generation after generation,it will."
85,10,A Return to Innocence,Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter  priceless.
86,10,Empire Strikes Back Review,"After the Empire takes control of the rebel base on Hoth, our core group is divided. Luke Skywalker sets off to continue his Jedi training, while Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO are running from the Empire."
87,10,One of the best sequels ever made.,"This is a Hollywood masterclass on how to make a good sequel. 'A New Hope' was a fantastic movie, and 'The Empire Strikes Back' improved on it greatly. Awesome story-telling, great action, the movie is just wonderful. Go watch it. 10/10."
88,10,Better than Titanic!!!,"While the Titanic made all the rich people (with the exception of Molly Brown and Rose) automatically uncaring, snobby, and thoughtless just because they were rich and needed a couple of villains for the story, The Empire Strikes Back did not portray ""the villain"" in a completely evil light. Sympathy is induced when we see the back of Darth Vader's scarred and pasty head.  When he tells Luke of their blood relationship, some feeling is allowed to creep in, telling us that he is not just some maniacal killing machine, but a human, fallen from grace, yet able to retain some sense of love, however twisted it may be."
89,10,The Star Wars Goat,"The gold standard of Star Wars films, Empire outdoes ANH on every level with a deeper look at the characters, superior acting, special effects and story. The only film in the franchise without a giant finale, Empire transcended blockbuster movie making with Irvin Kerschner showing George how these movies should be done. The Michael Jordan of Star Wars. 10/10."
90,10,I guess that the Force will be with the original series forever!,"I don't know whether or not ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was better than ""Star Wars"" or not, but it's pretty much equally good. Since everyone knows the plot, I figure that I'll just talk about a few aspects. It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching ""TESB"", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that. They played it to good effect here (I personally thought that ""Return of the Jedi"" overdid it a little). But anyway, the Force is with this movie from start to finish!"
91,10,No Less Than Epic,"This is the cream of the crop for not just the original trilogy, but the entire saga. To me, this film even surpasses the original. Everything is finally perfect, for just this one time. The tone is generally dark and somber, something Episode VI tried to live up to. But thanks to things called Ewoks it didn't quite keep the tone steady. The comic relief is given at the right moment and isn't over done."
92,10,One of the worthiest sequels of all time,STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 
93,10,Slightly better than the Original,"The first Star Wars movie, is a Sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level."
94,10,The Perfect Sequel,"Most of the time, sequels are a bit of a disappointment, because of lame story and poor special effects. The Empire Strikes Back on the other hand is one of the best sequels I've ever seen in my life. Everything in this film is marvelous. The story is great, and the character development is far more dark and gruesome than in the first film. The new characters, such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian really add something to the Star Wars saga."
95,10,Best of the trilogy - one of the best movies ever.,"Hoth is great - asteroids are great - space slug is great - Yoda is one of the best original characters ever in a movie - Vader is a real bastard - Lando ""colt 45"" Calrissian and Boba ""he's no good to me dead"" Fett take charge of cloud city -- Leia and Han fall in love - Luke gets all sweaty during the training - best lightsaber duel of the three flicks -- ""how you doin' chewbacca, still hanging around with this loser?"" -- 3po gets shot and r2 saves the day at least three times again --  THIS MOVIE IS THE REASON LIFE CAN BE SO GRAND - the trilogy has given me and many others endless hours of happiness. A gem. 10 out of 10."
96,10,Possibly the Greatest Sequel in Cinema History,"This film is just pure awesome, for kids, adults, and everyone in between."
97,10,The best of the six,"Like most children who loved Star wars when it was first released I looked forward to the next big screen instalment of the saga. I was not disappointed. The action started almost immediately and keeps up throughout the film till the climactic light sabre battle. We are also introduced to the new interesting characters Yoda, Lando and the Emperor himself."
98,9,The Way Star Wars Was Meant To Be,"Any comments here refer to the theatrical release, not the pile of rubbish known as the special edition. Rick McCollum should be tracked down and given a good kick in the pants."
99,10,Top 5 movie of all time,"Another genius episode by George Lucas. Fantastic story, f/x and cimedy. This has it all."
100,10,The Empire Strikes Back,This is in my opinion the best Star Wars movie yet. It improves upon the first movie and has the one of the best plot twist of all time. Luke's Story in this is great and Yoda is a lot of fun. Darth Vader is an even better villain in this film. This film is fun and exciting from beginning to end. It never gets slow and is fast passed. This is an amazing film.
101,7,An Original Blockbuster,The second installment of the original Star Wars trilogy benefits from coming from a time when there were very few films that could be called that. If it was made and released now it would be lost in a sea of big budget battles of good and evil aimed at making big money for a week or two and then disappearing.
102,9,The perfect sequel to its perfect predecessor,"In many ways, The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect sequel. But before I begin, let me get one thing out of the way. This is NOT the best Star Wars film of all time. That honour lies with the original, which it always will. There's a multitude of great scenes here, but I can and will argue that every one of them is derived from the original."
103,6,Difficult to see all the fuss and love nowadays as much as those present for its inauguration did.,"Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays."
104,10,Maybe even better than original,"I'm not sure which part I liked more - this one or the original. But this part sure is better in some terms. Like special effects, which were really better than in the first part (probobly because of the bigger budged). It's also better in terms of action. The sword fights were much more impressive than in first part. The starship battles were also very impressive and pretty realistic. Many new colorful and very important characters appeared in this part. What else did I liked was Darth Vader's position in this part. Here he looked more dangerous and independent than in the first part. It's a really entertaining movie and it's worth watching."
105,10,The best movie in an overrated franchise,40 years later and Disney with all of it billions of dollars still can't make a Star Wars film that comes close to this.
106,10,Would Not Work Alone,"This movie is really good, obviously the best star wars movie. But it would not be has good has it is if the other star wars movies did not exist. Star Wars episode 4 helped a lot by introducing the characters and the universe. The drama is great, the acting was ok, the character developement is awsome, the fight scenes are ok and the rest is really well done. For sure Star Wars episode 4 was essential to the sucess of this film, but it still has to be recognized for how good it is."
107,10,Best.Movie.Ever,"Wow, what a film, I never knew that I could love a film soooo much in my life, but here it is, my favourite film of all time, the one that made me love Star Wars. First of all, the acting in this film is amazing, People who watched the film didn't know that actually most of Harrison Ford's lines were improvised, which is awesome. Carrie Fisher as Leia was great, especially when she talks to Ford, Frank Oz as Yoda is great, way better than CGI Yoda from the prequels. Luke as the hero was great, but I like how they show Luke as the hero, but he still loses, which brings me to Darth Vader. He is by far one of the best villains of all movie history, he is menacing, mysterious, then when he tells Luke, ""I am your father"", that completely changes how we first watched A New Hope. Effects are good for that time, also two others characters that I need to mention are Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, these two characters really showed me that this is such a great movie franchise, Lando with huge charisma, and Boba being silent badass, so out of ten I would give this incredible movie a 10/10. Perfection."
108,10,Favorite movie of all times,An amazing film with an amazing story written by an amazing guy that we all love
109,10,The standout film in the series so far.,"Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""Star Wars"" film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him."
110,10,Cool,"The best of the ""original"" trilogy. I like the bit when Luke gets his hand cut off and finds out Vader is his father"
111,10,The Perfect Sequel,"It's not easy making a sequel to a hit movie, especially when Episode 5 was being made as sequels were not as common. So, it goes without saying that no one knew what to expect."
112,9,There's something in the way,"I am A Star Wars fan, always have been. The difference was the direction in this film there were standards set. The Imperial Theme is one of the most well known themes and has been repeatedly parodied although it has kept respectable as time wears on. Darth Vader is given more than barking orders in ""A new Hope"" Boba Fett the most feared and universally loved Bounty Hunter even though he had only one line in the first three series makes his debut but actions speak louder than words. David Prowses body Language as the dark lord mixed with James Earl Jones voice is iconic. The budding romance between Han and Leia was a surprise when I first saw this. I thought for sure Luke would get it on with her, but Lucas had other plans which I was really happy about."
113,10,"It's Star Wars, you know how good it is","The cultural and technological significance of The Empire Strikes Back speaks for itself. It revolutionised CGI and practical effects to a whole new level.<br /><br />The characters are so good, no wonder why they're so iconic. Everything points to the director having an idea of the characters created: Yoda's monologue about the force is so beautiful, it embodies the love Yoda has for it. And Han Solo's ""I know"" is so to character, keeping that arrogant and boastful persona as he would.<br /><br />The use of the force is the epitome of subtlety as it creates this beautiful living organism.<br /><br />It's a cinematic masterpiece: where the CGI might not hold up today, the cinematography certainly does, clearly inspiring movies to come.<br /><br />Obviously it's one of the greatest action movies, let alone movies in total.<br /><br />For some reason I prefer A New Hope"
114,10,This is it!!,"If the first Star Wars (1977) was groundbreaking, this one is breathtaking! According to me at least - the best picture in film history! A culminated crown-jewel after a decade of excellent drama productions, such as The Godfather I & II, one flew over the cuckoo's nest etc, etc. Everything is there.. skillful focus on the character-arch.. a relaxed and charming love story.. fantastic action and heroism.. and above all- George Lucas story! What is going on inside that man.. ""A modern age Genius"". How does he come up with all that weird but super-cool stuff! And John Williams music..!! The themes and their crafted development to the story context.. wow.. Why he didn't get the academy award, still remains one of the biggest mysteries to me, up to this day.. If you find yourself crying, getting goosebumps and laughing at the same time when viewing this piece, don't worry- You're not alone...The force is strong with this one!!"
115,,Incredibles,An amazing sequel my dad loves and I mean love's this movie I think it is pretty good but I don't think it's as good as a new Hope new Hope is a classic but still a really good movie.
116,10,Everything a Classic should be!,"Epiaode IV - A New Hope is 10 out of 10. Certainly, I would love to give Episode V more than 10. This is great movie with great twists and turns. This is everything a classic should be."
117,9,What a Twist . . .,I didn't watch this movie when I was a kid.
118,10,Legendary,"The best Star Wars film in the saga no doubt and the greatest Sci-fi movie ever. This movie is absolutely legendary. Brilliant cinematography (the framing is flawless), great special effects and sound, unforgettable scenes, an outstanding score, some of the most iconic characters in movie history which are really allowed to develop in this film, the best and the most shocking plot twist in cinema history and an amazing storyline."
119,10,Wars not make one great,"The story of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire continues with Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO on another blistering ride."
120,9,Best of the Star Wars Films - The Empire Strikes Back,"The first three installments of the Star Wars series of films are easily the best three of the entire series; and this film, The Empire Strikes Back, is the best of the top three. If for no other reason, the development and dramatic impact of the Darth Vader character within this film sets it apart from all the others. When Vader utters those famous five words in a battle scene, we remember them for the rest of our lives. The intensity of this film is greater than the first or third one (and far more than the latter entries). Not one, but a trio of characters, are fleshed out in this film more than in any other Star Wars entry. Obiwan, Luke, and Vader all have great character development. The music is outstanding, the cinematography is outrageously good, and the script is more sophisticated than the first entry. Don't miss the best of the Stars Wars films."
121,10,A rare perfect sequel.,"""Star Wars- episode V: The Empire strikes back"" is directed by ""Irvin Kershner."
122,8,One for All & All for One...,"Yavin 4 had been discovered so they fled, three years later and it's Hoth where rebels tread, Luke Skywalker's on patrol, when a Wampa takes control, leaves him hanging in its cave to have with bread. He escapes into the blizzard and the cold, has a vision from a friend where he is told, seek to train from Master Yoda, find him on planet Dagobah, Han arrives, and slips him in a Tauntaun fold. A droid informs the Empire what it's found, leaves the rebels little time to hang around, first protect the energy field, that provides the bases shield, as off to Hoth, Imperial forces bound."
123,8,Excellent follow-up,This film continues the first Star Wars film in a way that really expands on the world without overshadowing its predecessor. It is worth it just for the famous plot twist that really defines the series. The Empire Strikes Back is even more thrilling and intense.
124,9,The Best of the Franchise,"Honestly, I just absolutely adore this film, and the further I travel in life, the more that I discover that I'm not the only one. In fact it seems to pretty much be the favourite of all of the Star Wars films, probably because there is so much happening, and also because of the big reveal at the end. In fact, the big reveal was kept so secret that only Mark Hammil, James Earl Jones, and the creators knew about it, which was why it was such a shock."
125,10,Perfection,"To this day, this remains my favorite Star Wars movie, from a story point of view, the villains taking order for the first time in a while, and after 39 years, I still think it will be hard to be topped by reboots or remakes."
126,9,Very nice,"Second chapter that can be defined as a transition between the first and the last, is a chapter full of plot but in any case of passage, useful only for the construction of the final phase of the saga."
127,10,This one is just as great as IV and VI,"I think when this came out in 1980, no one saw the twist at the end coming. If you don't know the twist because you have been blocked from or chose to block the Star Wars saga, you are missing out. I don't know a lot of people who don't know how it ends."
128,9,I am your father,"In my opinion this is not only better than the first film or the fourth whatever but it is the best in the entire franchise. I loved it from the first minute until the last, I love star wars even since I was about 4 years old and I used to hate this movie but when I watch it now it's just amazing. Also in this film great Star Wars characters make their debut with the likes of Yoda and Orlnado Calrizion (if that is how you spell it and I can't remember if it is Orlando and Lando so excuse me if I got it wrong.)"
129,10,What to say,It ist the best Star Wars Film. The atmosphere in this Film ist just awesome.
130,10,Amazing,Takes the first Star Wars and improves literally everything- many of the shortcomings of that first film are either outright fixed or at least made less noticeable.
131,10,The Best Star Wars Movie Of All Time!!!,My favorite scene of this movie is when Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader Duel with Lightsabers And I love how the Empire want to catch the Millennium Falcon and then put Han Solo in ice and how Yoda trained Luke Skywalker. This is the best Star Wars Movie for me.
132,9,Huge Character Development,Luke Skywalker goes from naive country boy to that over in a soldier and that he is maturing and growing very much big.
133,10,Probably better than Star Wars,"Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday."
134,10,Trouble with the truth,This movie takes place after A new hope.
135,9,Empire Strikes Back Is Truly A Striking Sequel That Mostly Fascinating,"Empire Strikes Back got way more to offer in terms of a story, character, and performances, it's an epic journey with a more clever and exciting continuation, nit picky was still there like A New Hope at least for me, i think Han Solo and Princess Leia relationship was a bit too much and too in depth later in the movie, i mean i like the first couple of them, but overall still Empire Strikes Back is truly a striking sequel that mostly fascinating, it's still an incredible sequel."
136,10,The greatest sequel of all time,"This is how sequels should always be done.  Higher budget.  Preplanned story arc.  And memorable dialogue.  The best sequel ever made hands down.  In many ways this film is even better than its predecessor.  But, unfortunately, because it doesn't stand so well on its own, it will always be considered the second best Star Wars movie."
137,10,All time favourite!,I love this episode of the series. It's a fun comfortable watch for me and I enjoy everything about it.
138,10,Simply the Best and Endlessly Rewatchable,"First of all, this is not just my all-time favourite sequel but my all-time favourite film. It thoroughly deserves that title because I consider it nothing less than a masterpiece. It takes everything great about the original and simply improves on it, a task many would've seemed to be impossible."
139,10,"If I could rate it above 10, I would.","The best of the Star Wars series? Without a doubt. What makes this movie so great is the fact that it is not like other movies, leaving you with all the hope you need at the end. In this film, however, the only hope is that all of the main characters are still alive at the end."
140,10,Much anger in him...like his father.,"Empire Strikes Back took everything that was revolutionary from Star Wars and improved it, and then some. It is deeper, more mature, and asks more questions of the world. R2D2 and Chewbacca, who became lovable fan favourites from the moment they hit the screen in 1977, did so without speaking a single word, but here they are much more than just accessories to the plot. In their grunts and roars and beeps, they now became beacons of loyalty for our group. The iconic opening crawl speaks of the events in between the two films - a time skip has occurred and the rebels are in hiding. The strengths of the characterisations show us exactly what has happened in these months unseen; Luke has become a respected fighter and commander, Han a captain, and his bickering and romantic tension with Leia only growing stronger (and which results in one of the most iconic confessions of love of all time). We see the bonds of friendship so much stronger in this sequel, and as Chewie attempts to repair CP3O and carries him around like a backpack, we recognise this is as an emotion of universality. No wonder Lucas used it again with Luke and Yoda. "
141,10,"""impressive, most impressive""",I love this movie so incredibly much it's so nostalgic for me watching it as a kid but even excluding that this movie is an apsalute gem giving us tonnes of memorable characters and lines that have been so iconic. The movie is iconic with sets and props that have inspired to many other science fiction movies and movies in general for years to come.
142,10,The one story every later filmmaker takes inspiration from.,"I can't say anything new to this massive spectacle of a movie. Everything has already been said, but I can share my personal expirience with you and it was epic, grand, exciting and every positive adjective you could think of!"
143,10,An amazing sequel,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is truly masterful. The acting is convincing, highlighting the intelligent emotional depth and well developed character arcs present throughout the film. Interesting new characters build the intrigue of the feature, too. From beginning to end, the storyline is thrilling, with intense battle scenes full of great visuals and sound. There are few plot holes, the writers impressively delivering a largely seamless, constantly moving story that still has time for pause. Various comedic moments cleverly contrast, and in turn compliment the more serious undertones present. Dialogue throughout proves especially meaningful, delivering many iconic lines. The concluding sequences were highly satisfactory, as well. Overall, this feature is a wonderful addition to the franchise's lore and cinema itself."
144,9,Exile To Hoth,"Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back."
145,10,"Best film in the saga ""Star Wars""","The best movie in the Star Wars saga so far, one of the best movies ever. Improved soundtrack, more interesting story, better special effects, and a fantastic casting. Highly recommend."
146,10,No beginning and no end........The plot darkens,"This film, the second of George Lucas' incredible Saga, not only expands on the first and improves upon it in many ways but it also proves that a film can be a huge success without having a true beginning or end. Rather The Empire Strikes Back is but another chapter in the enduring tale begun by a New Hope.But it has enough witty dialog, amazing action sequences and brilliant new characters to make it a wonderful film in its own right as well."
147,7,The Empire Strikes Out,"The second ""Star Wars"" film to be released has non-stop action, but the problem is that there is no compelling plot to make the action interesting. Endless shots of star ships gliding through space soon become tedious. The last third of the movie does generate some interest but it's too little, too late to save this from being more than a mediocre entry in the series. The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make."
148,10,One of THE best sequels ever made,"Forty years ago, in a galaxy far away. A sequel of the movie that changed cinema forever was made, and it sure as heck didn't failed on anyone."
149,10,Great movie,This film is legendary. Controversial opinion but it's my second favourite in the series. I love the moment when Luke and Leia hear eachother through the force.
150,10,I love this one!,"This is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best movies that has ever been made.Star Wars was a great movie, and a sequel being better then it seemed impossible, but empire strikes back is a better movie with a lot of good stuff.The special effects are still good today and the story is pretty good, i love a lot things that this movie has that star wars didn't.Like a lot better fight scenes, and they show a lot more of places and planets then the 1st one.I was very pleased with this movie and think it is a great film for a true movie fan to watch, i disagree with a lot of people who say it is the best star wars movie.But i can understand why they say it, empire has a lot of things to it that are just well done and impressive.I think this movie is worth owning and is a movie you can watch many times."
151,10,Masterful,"Hands down the best Star Wars movie to date. It's cross between adventure, pulling heartstring , plot, acting , etc is peerless in the sW saga"
152,7,It's Good But Is It Really That Great ?,"A conjunction is a word linking two sentences . A couple of examples of a conjunction is "" and "" and "" also "" so when I say THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good film then I also have to use the conjunction "" but "" in case I suffer an internet disembowelment on the grounds of blasphemy or heresy "
153,10,In the top 10 best movies ever made,"A masterpiece....difficult to improve on A New Hope yet it does....very rarely watch a movie more than once...,,amongst those exceptions are Lawrence of Arabia, Blade Runner and a New Hope (around 5 times each).....and then, The Empire Strikes Back, 21 times."
154,10,The absolute best!,"Although Star Wars Episode IV was groundbreaking, as a kid I always loved to see Star Wars Episode V, as basically it took all the things developed in the first movie, and built on them to create something 1,000 times better like a good sequel should, rather than just retracing the steps of the previous film. Although my family didn't own Episode V, my brother's friend did, and surprised me when I was about 6 years old by bringing over Episode V in secret, and I adored every last minute of it!"
155,,Wow! What a follow up!,"After the success of Star Wars you would think that it can't get any better. Well it did.  Empire is much more ambitious than the first one, and it shows.  The story is more involved, it carries the story arcs from the first one over flawlessly.  The Battle of Hoth is amazing to watch, as is the asteroid chase.  Luke begins his training as a Jedi and we see in the tree that he is going the way of Vader.  Han and Leia squabble but they slowly start to warm up to each other in a classic scene of love finding its way through dialogue that never mentions their love for each other.  Yoda's philosophy of ""do or do not.""  are words to live by.  Throw in the smooth talking Lando and a light saber duel that is truly exciting and you got yourself one hell of a follow up to one of the greatest films of all time. All that and finding out that Darth Vader is Luke's father!"
156,10,It's a dark time for the rebellion; and us the audience as well.,"Luke, Leia and Han are fighting with the rebels in the hope of defeating the Imperial forces. But Luke gets a calling to the planet Dagobah, where under the tutelage of Jedi Master, Yoda, he hopes to become a Jedi himself, but that also brings him closer to his, and Leia's, destiny."
157,10,The best...,"This has everything in the first movie - the visuals, story etc. BUT. It has loads and loads of plot twists, which makes the movie so, so interesting. Almost everyone would agree that it's the best Star Wars movie. Go watch it. Now."
158,10,Unlike Father & Son,"Back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of The Empire Strikes Back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal Star Wars. But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film. "
159,10,"DO OR DO NOT, THERE IS NO TRY!!","As brilliant as ""A New Hope"" was this film takes it and raises the the bar. Darth Vader and the empire are in pursuit of the Falcon and Luke to strike a decisive blow into the rebellion. Luke goes off to train with an old Master Yoda before facing Vader. The fight and chase scenes are taken up a couple of notches from the the previous film with the Carbon freezing and Vader unveiling as Luke's father are still as iconic as ever. Its a magnificently constructed movie and earns its rightful place as one of the all time great movies."
160,8,Definatly a must see for Star Wars fans,"Again, the magic of Star Wars will not be forgotten. This is one of those films you just have to see in your life. And some of the most memorable lines in movie history are in here, so I would strongly reccommend for movie freaks."
161,10,Go to the dark side of the force.,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back. Go to the dark side of the force. Great sequel to the Space Saga. Yes, the sequel looks darker than the first film, but that doesn't make it worse. New heroes and new villains, all accompanied by great music."
162,10,I enjoyed this film better than episode IV,"This was my favorite film in the ""Star Wars"" series until ""Rouge One"" came out. Still a film I can watch to this day and enjoy"
163,9,The Retaliatory move of Darth Vader and the Empire,"""New Hope"" showed the whole world that fiction can be adventurous, fun, and new worlds, as George Lucas showed, need further disclosure. A new film was needed that would continue the story of the confrontation between a small army of rebels and an unshakable and gloomy Empire led by Darth Vader. The fans got such a movie."
164,10,"Perfection, just as the previous one","Just as its predecessor, its practically perfect. It makes the story even more interesting and on a very natural path, and the dark tone this one has makes it stand out even more and the ending is perfect. There is literally no other way to describe this movie besides perfection. Maybe its the best star wars movie."
165,7,"Luke, I am your father","I don't regret watching this, but I would not watch it again. Nice way to kill two winter hours and that's all."
166,10,Succinct in Sixteen,Romance among the stars. Hope lost and miraculously scavenged. One of the biggest plot twists ever.
167,10,Its a snowy one!,Lots of snow in this one bois! Lots and lots and lots and lots of snow. There is also a bear / goat / big foot sort of creature!
168,6,Star Wars does it again,"This film is for SciFi fans. The film is for everyone 7 and older who love SciFi. The film has plenty of action to keep you in your seats. Luke Skywalker undergoes both Jedi training and we see his character develop from the rash young man he was in Star Wars IV. We also begin to see a hint into Darth Vader. I fell in love with Yoda in this movie. All the main characters from Star Wars IV are here. However, it is Luke and Yoda who steal the show. However, the movie did make me feel like I was between episodes and want more. I also felt that it really didn't have a true ending, just a closing of a chapter. However, it is very enjoyable and keeps the Star Wars saga going. Not only do I want more, a continuing story; but I want a beginning. Little did I know that all I had to do was wait a few years. If your are a Star Wars fan, be sure to include this one in your collection."
169,8,Arguably the best star wars film plot wise,Rating: 8.0
170,10,"One of, if not, the best film of the franchise","I am a major fan of the Star Wars universe. But this film, in my opinion, takes the cake as one of, if not, the best Star Wars film of the franchise, especially of the OG trilogy. I love the conflict with Luke and his destiny, how he is all for training, and completely obedient to his master. But at the same time, he is so willing to leave it to help his friends and the rebellion, despite the words of Master Yoda and Obi-Wan. It almost seems like he will abandon it for them, which both shows his loyalty and stubborness. And this episode, even without an 'actual ending', begins to foreshadow Luke's battle with himself and the dark side for the next episode. All-in-all, the amazing story combined with the great visuals for its time is a very good film, and remains my favorite."
171,10,When Everything Clicks,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, or as some might call it ""Empire"" is widely considered to be one of the greatest film sequels of all time. Following up from the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back continues the saga with what is the second film of the trilogy. From repeatedly re-watching it over the years, it's come to my attention that Empire is very different in comparison to the rest of the films. Sure it has its humor and all, but overall it's much more dramatic. My favorite films are those that depict the story before it has been shown, and the title alone, clearly foreshadows what's to expect in this film. It reveals a tragedy in which we see the first glimpse of victory for the Galactic Empire since the fall of the dreaded Death Star."
172,10,Episode 5,Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back. Another Masterpiece in the Star Wars Universe and this is definitely my favourite in the franchise and is definitely the best story they told.
173,8,Star wars originals #2: the empire strikes back,"Whenever I call a movie a perfect sequel, I usually say it's also an imperfect movie, the empire strikes back would be one of the first examples I would give out, I do think that it kind of has a slow start and some of the C-3PO stuff is unnecessary. But that doesn't bring down the fact that it's one of the best sequels of all time and of my personal favorite star wars movies, everything that happens after this revolves around the twist in this movie, and then they made the prequels and revenge of the sith explains everything, I prefer the empire strikes back over revenge of the sith as a sequel, but as a movie, I prefer revenge of the sith, this movie also has a lot heart and stakes. So it's not perfect but it's still great."
174,10,2nd favourite film,Just looked at other reviews. Not much more can be said. It's a 10/10 from me.
175,10,The Saga Continues...,"It's very rare when a sequel outshines the film that came before it,""The Empire Strikes Back"" manages to do that in many ways. ""Star Wars"" always will be considered an all time classic,but ""Empire"" is a great follow up."
176,10,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"One of the best film sequels ever made (along with The Godfather, Part II and Terminator 2), this is the second part to great original trilogy, and saga, from writer/creator George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" on the ice world of Hoth, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating possible Empire activity, only to be attacked by a snow monster. He manages to escape with the help of the Force and his light sabre, but he is still stuck in the blizzard, and before going unconscious and being rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford), he sees a vision of Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Degobah system and find Jedi master Yoda. So after a quick battle between the Rebels and the Empire, Luke, with R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) heads to this planet, and eventually he finds Yoda (a Muppet style creature voiced and performed by Muppet member Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear), and they start training. Meanwhile, Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are in the Millennium Falcon, pursued by the Empire (because of a tracking device), and hide for a while in what they thought was the inside of a near meteor, but it was in fact the belly of a giant worm alien. When they do get out, they head for their destination to fix the ship, the planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han's old shifty gambler friend (and original Millennium Falcon owner), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But what they didn't know is that Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and the stormtroopers arrived before them, and they are the bait of Vader's trap to get Luke, who he has become obsessed with finding. As a prize for finding them, Han Solo is frozen in carbonate and (when confirmed he is alive) is give to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt (who you saw in the first film). Eventually, Luke does land on the planet, and he and Darth have a long and exciting light sabre fight, while Leih's gang escape in the Millennium Falcon. The pinnacle twist and great quote of the film is, after cutting Luke's hand off, Darth Vader revealing the truth about his father's death, he says ""I am your father!"" After this he is eventually rescued, has his hand replaced, and Lando and Chewbacca fly away in the Millennium Falcon, a more more obvious 'to be continued' moment. Also starring Julian Glover as General Veers. It won the Oscar for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for John Williams and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), it won the BAFTA for Best Original Film Music for John Williams, and it was nominated for Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 67 on The Ultimate Film, and along with the Episode IV: A New Hope, both were number 1 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!"
177,10,One of the Best Films Ever Made!,"This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever).  The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.  Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch.  And it is actually quite good.  With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience."
178,6,Not as good,"My preference goes Return of the Jedi, A new Hope, then this one. I found the characters had better chemistry and the dialogue seemed more natural in the films of 77,83. This one I know the director was attempting to humanize the characters but thought the dialogue was forced and it lacked chemistry."
179,10,Revenge is Sweet,"This, is one of those times where it's great when the bad guys win. I had grown up watching old westerns and kiddie movies, where it was all good guys win at the end. And when I first saw this when the Original (Best) Trilogy reopened in theaters, my parents rushed me to the nearest cinema. I was astounded. Great acting. Even better directing, it's the greatest space movie pretty much ever made."
180,10,Iconic,"By far my favorite Star Wars movie. Contains the iconic parts of the saga, for example the reveal of Darth Vader. The settings for the entire movie are outstanding from Hoth to Cloud City. As always the score from John Williams was on point more so than ever in my opinion. The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute. The characters really establish themselves with more famous moments such as Han Solo's ""I know"" line towards the end of the movie and we get to see Luke's agony as he hangs from cloud city."
181,4,competent!,"Hey!!! breath of fresh air after the garbage that was episode VI. it still wasn't good overall, but significantly more watchable. a few cool action scenes, the light saber fights were decent. better characters, better story. acting still bad, except han, he's pretty awesome. still lots of stupid parts and old movie qualities. (1 viewing 12/25/19)"
182,10,The greatest of the entire saga!,"When this movie came out in 1980, people were unsure of how it can live up to the hype due to the success of the previous film. But it did deliver! This movie went to even darker places this time around, and the characters are left at the lowest point by the end of the film. Great action sequences, great acting and above all the biggest twist of all time! "
183,10,Probably one of the most influential movies on my life,"ESB is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. In most circles, there tend to be a division between 'regular' movies and science fiction ones, but the Empire Strikes Back not only wrote the importance of the previously establish Star Wars saga into history, but borough the Joneses and Kims and N'Danou's and Guptas and everyone else from all over the world a re-lived curiosity about a genre that often is exclusively reserved to geeks, gamers, and goblins. The first star wars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The Empire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing conviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it! Lucas made us believe in a world far away, long long time ago, which any other creator would have made seem like another Star Trek or Stargate episode (like the prequels)."
184,10,Best Star Wars movie,There is no better Star Wars movie. The Empire Strikes Back is just perfect.
185,7,"Entertaining Adventure, Not to Be Taken Too Seriously","""The Empire Strikes Back"" clearly has the feel of the middle episode of a trilogy. The beginning carries on from the original ""Star Wars"" film; although the Death Star has been destroyed, the Empire remains strong and the evil Darth Vader continues to hunt down the rebels on their base on the icy planet of Hoth. There is no really definite ending; the film might just as well have ended with the words, familiar from old Saturday morning serials, ""To Be Continued""- which of course it was in ""Return of the Jedi"". In between, the mix is much the same as it was in the first ""Star Wars""- a science-fiction adventure incorporating elements of other film genres, notably the war film but also the western, the oriental martial arts film, sword-and-sorcery type fantasy and the Robin Hood type of mediaeval adventure, all topped off with a helping of mystical religion."
186,10,Behold the Legend Itself,"This film is so great. It works on so many levels and the best sequel of all time. Who doesn't love this movie if is well shot, great characters and everything is just 10 times better than the original. Star Wars is still to this day one of the greatest films ever made and I didn't think it could get better. I was wrong."
187,10,This Changed My Life,"This film changed my life....i fell in love with Star Wars when it was re-released on video in the early 90's.I was a small boy that would obsess over things like Batman & Nickelodien.After i saw the trilogy, i went and bought everything i could get my hands on.Children of nerds should be given this at birth.This film is,in my opinion,is the greatest of all the Star Wars films.I think that it has a fantastic ending,cool characters (Boba Fett,Yoda,Lando) and great acting.I recommend this film for every Sci-Fi fan (even the Trekkies).I also must say that this is just a great film all around(not just for a space-fantasy)."
188,10,The Most Powerful Star Wars Movie,"The Empire Strikes Back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over A New Hope. The amazing thing is that this time Lucas wasn't the director. That doesn't change anything, he guided Irvin and ESB is still his creation. "
189,10,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars movie,"The story is very interesting and well paced. The characters are really well written and fun to watch. The score is beautiful. The acting is also very good. Most of the effects look very good, even for today. Probably the biggest plot twist in cinema history. It has Very good Fight scenes. My favorite Star Wars movie."
190,10,Best of the Star Wars Movies.,"Empire Strikes Back is not only a great sequel to one of the best science Fiction movies ever made but its probably one of the best sequels ever made. A movie that not only blows away the first film in terms of scoop and magnitude but in story telling as well. This is the second of the entire Star Wars series of movies and in no doubt, the best. Not even the movies that come after were able to capture the landscape of this great cinematic achievement."
191,10,Greatest Star Wars movie,"This is an example of how to not only do a perfect sequel, but a perfect sci-fi movie in general."
192,10,The best Star Wars movie there is,"Empire strikes back is amazing with great characters,an amazing plot twist,and a film that serves as a good middle chapter to the original trilogy. And by the way what character does big bank hank compare himself to?"
193,9,A great classic movie (9.1/10),"Of course, this is the best Star Wars movie ever, and the best Darth Vader version. A very enjoyable classic movie, with great epic events and music, as we are used to in the Star Wars atmosphere."
194,,Relentless,"I usually watch this show every two years to keep a fresh perspective on it. This is the first real film experience I ever had, and it remains the strongest influence on me. The thing that amazes me about this, time and again, is the ingenuity of the pacing, the orchestration, and the motion of the vehicles and ships."
195,10,This film goes well beyond sci-fi. A true cinematic masterpiece.,"The Empire Strikes Back represents everything that I've come to expect from a film: Brave heroes, menacing villains, a well-written story, fantastic action scenes, a strong supporting cast, drama, romance, surprises, and a beautiful musical score. ""Empire"" focuses heavily on developing the characters from the first film, rounding out their personalities, and introduces several great new characters (Yoda, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett). The special effects still hold up well to today's standards, the dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the character dynamic allows the actors to play well off of each other. It's a very different kind of film in that the ""good guys always win"" theory is proved wrong, and Darth Vader's surprise revelation at the end of the movie is still one of the best movie moments ever, which was shocking for its time. "
196,10,Almost Flawless,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film."
197,10,This movie rocks,"This movie is awesome man<br /><br />It's funny, action packed and has a great soundtrack"
198,9,Simply The Best When It Comes To Star Wars Movies!!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the second installment of the Star Wars franchise released in 1980 and widely regarded as everyone's favorite!! This film wins this monicker because - unlike most sequels that try to repeat the original & fail - Empire, as most Star Wars fans affectionately call it, delves deeper into the character's psychology & the film introduces new, cool characters such Yoda, Boba Fett, & Lando Calrissian that spark our interest!! The film takes us in different directions & to different planets & one of the things - in an odd way that is satisfying to the audience - is that on the surface the evil Empire WINS in the end making this one of the few American movies to my knowledge where this happens!! Extremely well directed by Star Wars creator George Lucas' late mentor the late Irvin Kershner, Empire has outstanding performances by all its actors with classic lines that still permeate American culture today!! Excellent special effects, a soundtrack that is second-to-none by legend John Williams and a set up for a very satisfying sequel film make The Empire Strikes Back the strongest film of the franchise!! My rare 9 out of 10 stars!!"
199,10,Probably the best movie ever made,"It's just perfect. Its darker and more philosophical. Extremely well directed, acted and great dialogue. IMO Kershner should've been nominated for an oscar for best director. Also best picture."
200,9,The Brilliant and Shocking Second Star Wars,"Review:<br /><br />This is basically the fun of the first Star Wars, but faster, more intense pacing, a deeper story line, Mature characters. And of course THE PLOT TWIST TO END ALL PLOT TWISTS...."
201,10,One of my favorite movies(along with The Phantom Menace),"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect. Everything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama? Heart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and hysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some! As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart, humor, action, drama, suspense. I highly recommend you see this one(if you haven't seen it already)."
202,10,The embodiment of Star Wars...,"In many ways ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best and most outstanding of all the movies in the ""Star Wars"" franchise. There is just something epic and very impressive about the story and presentation of the movie."
203,10,The Peak of Star Wars,"Trilling, excitement adventure. Yep this is what many consider to be the best Star Wars film and it's not hard to see why. Not just a great movie but an amazing sequel. Filled a great cast of Heroes and Villains. The effects 45 years later are still pretty amazing with amazing sets and puppetry work by Frank Oz, an amazing opening scene with tons of action and an ending that ends bitter sweet yet somber. Not to mention one of the best movie twist in history, with of course the only huge issue with the twist is even non Star Wars fans know what it is due to pop culture but that's basically a testament to how great it is."
204,10,Best Star wars movie ever.,"Empire strikes back is the best star wars movie because it does everything sequel should do. She expands the star wars world and teaches us more about it. There are good actors and George Lucas is the director and writer in this film. In my opinion, this is the best acting star wars movie. She is also so much different from New Hope. When New hope was a happy and bright movie, Empire strikes back was dark and not afraid to do something new and dark. Also this is the first movie that Yoda is in. Special affect in this film is amazing during the 1980s, everything that happens in space is amazing and the practical affect in this film is gg. Yoda is, in my opinion, the best character ever made in movie history. The movie doesn't end on a good note for our protagonists, I think so because then we get a good ending in the next movie."
205,10,Yoda and the one of the most powerful lines of all time.,"When I first saw The Empire Strikes Back I didn't really care for it. I wasn't really into the darkness that covered the movie. Now, I'm a little older and can appreciate this movie. This is the best Star Wars movie hands down. Not my favorite, but the greatest. "
206,10,The Early Peak of the Star Wars Franchise,The Empire Strikes Back is the last Star Wars property ever made that I genuinely love. It marked an early peak for the franchise and unfortunately it all went down hill from here (with some minor spikes later on).
207,,Why did this film need a special edition??,"Ask yourself this:Why did an already excellent film need a special re-tooled edition?Other than some minor effects touch-up(i.e erasing the black lines from the models)this film is virtually flawless...The effects advance instead detract from the story which is superior to the rest...The dialogue mercifully not written by Lucas is funny and insightful...So why the re-edits.The only reason I can think of is once again so Lucas can try out his new toys...Some of the re-edits are unecessary...The scenes with the Wampa are an example..If Lucas wanted to show the Wampa then it could've been edited right...Instead we get shots of the wampa eating then getting up.Then we see the wampa writhing in pain with one arm.Are we to believe that this is the same Wampa that attacked and captured Luke???Based on how it was shot and edited,it looked like there were two in the cave to me.Another unnecessary edit is shots of Vader's shuttle going back to the Star destroyer...Lucas said he did this because you wondered how Vader got there when you watch the film.I never did...If you pay attention to the film,Vader tells his troopers to bring his shuttle...Case solved...The extended scenes with Slave 1 and the Falcon I can understand but the shuttles scenes are done in what is essentially a fast paced car chase..Lucas cut the Biggs scenes because they interrupted the flow of the opening of New Hope but yet he had no problem putting in Jedi outtakes that are slow and lumbering into a fast paced scene....And did we need to hear Luke scream a recycled scream from one of the other films??....No,I don't think so...Nor do I care about Cloud City being opened up..It was fine as is....Overall,Empire was and still continues to be the flawless cream of the crop of the Star Wars sextet...There was no need for a special edition...."
208,10,Luke I Am Your Father,Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back Was a lot Fun I Really did enjoy it the story and action were all enjoyable.
209,10,Star Wars is the hit,"After few years Star Wars came back better and stronger. This time Luke Skywalker is being trained to face his father Darth Vader, as there are side plots like Han Solo being frozen and more. We have a swamp planet that looks like the stench swamp from the Labyrinth, the icy Hoth and the cloud city that looks like San Marino an enclave on the top of a mountain. There is a little romance, lots of action and feelings too so here is something for the whole family when you have over 2 hours to spare."
210,10,"The Boy Who Loves ""Star Wars""","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing)."
211,10,One for the ages,"As great as the original Star Wars may be, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best film in the series. As the years pass, the real achievement of Empire only grows. While the original film has grown somewhat dated in appearance, and Return of the Jedi feels a bit silly now, Empire has maintained remarkable staying power. The effects in the film feel as fresh now as they did in 1980, and as importantly the story and tone of the film still hold an ominous feel and lend the series the grandeur that made it so lasting. Without Empire, Star Wars would have been remembered but not nearly in the same way. Everything that was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right down to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the now-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John Williams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers in the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of the Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with Vader. When I think of ""Star Wars"", most of the images that come to mind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so sharp and rich."
212,10,One of the best films ever,"The Empire Strikes back is the best of the original trilogy, as well as being the best of the entire series. Its so good that it is on my top ten films of all time. It manages to switch between the cheery space opera tone of the original film with added darkness and despair."
213,8,Still good,"I remember going to this film with my older sister at the Garrick downtown, which by the way they closed yesterday.  We arrived at 11 am, figuring we would be the first in line, to our surprise we met this guy Andy Swan, who was there from 9 am on.  He was waiting in line from about 8 am on for his friends, I got to be number 11 in line for this film on the first day.  The line up was over 3 streets, and there were people with Darth Vader Masks, Light Sabers, etc.  It was more like going to an Oakland Raider game, than a movie.  The wait, and the build up did not disappoint the viewer.  This film was original, and not a copy of the first.  A plot that left the viewer hanging, and some great special effects.  I love the Yodi guy.  Not as spell binding as the first, but in someways better."
214,10,The Best Sequel EVER!,"I remember first watching this as a kid right after I first watched a new hope, and I was even more mindblown on how amazing this film is. It is the best Star Wars Movie Ever Made! If this will be your first time watching it, you are in for a treat. I continue to love this film from my childhood up till now. This film holds a special place in my heart. If you have not seen this film, you need to watch it. If you have seen it, then you know what this film is all about and the pure nostalgia to an all time classic! Overall, 11/10."
215,8,Excellent Connection Between 4 & 6,"Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. "
216,10,The strongest Entry in the Star Wars Saga,"how do you top a movie like the original star wars.well,it's not easy,but you make a better movie.by better,i mean a more fleshed out storyline and characters.also the motivations of some characters are more clearly defined.this movie is definitely darker than the original,which makes sense since the enemy triumphs,if only for a short time.this movie built upon the strengths of the 1st one,namely good story line which carries the movie forward and of course the villain,who is much stronger in this installment.it goes without saying that the visual effects are once again outstanding.this entry is considered by many to be the strongest of the saga,and rightly so.it sets up perfectly for its sequel""return of the Jedi"".this film gets a very strong 10/10 only because that is the highest rating given by IMDb"
217,7,Darth Vader Strikes Back.,"Star Wars: Episode 5- The Empire Strikes Back (1980): Dir: Irwin Kershner / Cast: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse: Blindsiding visual wonder recalling the threat to Rebel forces whom are hiding on the ice planet Hoth. Luke Skywalker is instructed to seek Jedi training from Yoda. An attack by Imperial forces leaves the Rebel base in ruins but Han Solo, Princess Leia and company narrowly escape in the Millennium Falcon. They venture to Cloud City where Lando Calrissian betrays them thus setting a trap for Skywalker. Cliffhanger ending hinders it in standing on its own but director Irwin Kershner explores darker aspects. Mark Hamill returns as Luke who learns endurance, concentration, priorities, friendship, and very hard truths that leave him literally dangling for survival. Harrison Ford as Han learns to put the needs of others ahead of his own particularly when sacrifices arise. Carrie Fisher return as Leia who strengthens her leadership. Billy Dee Williams as Lando realizes his mistakes and hopes correction is possible. David Prowse dons the suit and presents the intimidating presence of Darth Vader who presents those ever famous hard hitting words to Luke. Special effects are just as electrifying with the appearance of Yoda among other creatures and landscapes. The film serves as a follow up to Star Wars with intriguing suspense and imagination. Score: 7 / 10"
218,10,an almost flawless movie,"this is the best of the star wars trilogy,and also the best movie of all time. when i got a chance to see it agian in the big theatre, for the first time since i was in four grade i`m 27 now. was the greatest movie experience i`ve ever had.i still think its the best achieve in f/x in movie history."
219,10,Still amazing,I love this. I first saw it when I was little. It is still great.
220,10,Perfection,I could do a long review detailing how every part of this movie is brilliantly made and executed but l its easier just to say this movie is the greatest most perfect film made
221,8,"""The Force is With You Young Skywalker!""","Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Peter Mahew, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Frank Oz and Alec Guiness star in this 1980 sci-fi sequel. This chapter starts off with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), Han Solo (Ford), Leia Organa (Fisher) Chewbacca (Mahew), C-3P0 (Daniels) and R2-D2 (Baker) on an icy planet, Hoth. Luke gets hurt while trying to locate a meteor and sees a vision of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi (Guiness) telling him to go to a planet, the Dagobah System where old Jedi master, Yoda will train him. Soon, Han finds Luke and they're rescued by rebel pilots who take them back to the base where Luke is nursed back to health. When Vader finds their base, they escape and head to Cloud City, where Han's old pal, Lando Calrissian (Williams) lives. Luke goes to the Dagobah System and soon meets Yoda (Voiced by Oz) beginning his training while his friends become Lando's guests learning that they're used as Vader's bait to lure Luke to the dark side. When Luke senses his friends in trouble, he attempts to rescue them and confronts Vader. I recommend this great Star Wars follow-up."
222,10,One of the best movies ever!,The Empire Strikes Back has entertained and will continue to entertain people of all ages for years to come. This movie is so iconic in every way.
223,9,"The ""Star Wars"" universe matures and refines itself in Episode V","""A New Hope"" opened us up to a galaxy of possibilities. ""The Empires Strikes Back"" begins to show us just how large that scope really is. Not only that, but there is a definite sense that ""Star Wars"" has grown up a little bit in Episode V, including taking a much darker tone."
224,9,The best in the original trilogy,"It's wonderful that Lucasfilm has finally consented to release this film in its original format without new additions and alterations. Now we can see the original matte work and effects, which are quite beautiful accomplishments and stand among the best of their era."
225,10,One of the best sequels ever!,"The first Star Wars film was released it was a massive success audience were craving for more. George Lucas promised more and when The Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980, it was not just a film release, it was an event. Despite fears that a sequel would never be as good as the original and the film technically under-performance this is one of the few sequels that was better then the original."
226,6,How do you review a cultural icon?,"This film as well as A New Hope has put me in a very very strange predicament. How exactly does one evaluate a film in which one knows the entire plot a priori, to no fault of the film. As well as a film with astounding visuals at the time, but very poorly aged visuals and shot selection today. Such is my problem with star wars as a franchise. So considering the circumstances, let me shortly say the following."
227,,"big, grand, breathtaking saga","Just when you thought it couldn't get any better it actually does in this exciting, edge of your seat sequel which never lets up for a minute! Having completed a successful strike against the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance goes into hiding from fear of being exterminated by the Imperial Army. Young hero Luke Skywalker travels to a remote planet at the far edge of the galaxy to seek out the omnipotent Jedi Master Yoda, in hopes that his tutelage will give him the strength and courage to confront the evil Sith Lord Darth Vader. To complicate matters further, Luke learns the shocking truth surrounding his ambiguous past. Lavish and awe-inspiring sequel is spectacular in every way with startling, dramatic revelations, and thrilling, memorable action scenes at every turn. An absolute must-see for Star Wars fans. ****"
228,10,Maybe the best,"Many feel The Empire Strikes Back is even better than Star Wars. Is this true? I really don't know, as Star Wars is probably the greatest film ever made, but many say ESB is as well."
229,10,"""No, I am your father""","The Empire Strikes Back expands upon the established world of Star Wars without forgetting what made the first movie so amazing. The effects are just as enthralling as they were in Star Wars (if not more so), as shown in the amazing new worlds that Empire introduces (Hoth, Cloud City, Dagobah), and John Williams once again blows us away with a score that is on par with his work in the previous movie.<br /><br />The story takes us in a different direction than Star Wars, giving the audience a greater insight into the workings of the Empire and Darth Vader's character. Vader's arc culminates in his iconic confrontation with Luke Skywalker at Cloud City, which ends with possibly the greatest twist in movie history.<br /><br />Empire's story is more mature than its predecessor, and leading actors have matured and greatly improved as well (props to Mark Hamill, who did about half of his scenes with a puppet and still made them believable). The dialogue is sharp, the camera work is clean, and new iconic characters get to shine in this movie. I especially loved when Yoda gave his explanation of what the force is, increasing the audience's understanding without removing any its mysticism.<br /><br />Overall, this movie expertly balances pretty much every aspect it should. The acting, the visual set pieces, the sound design, the score, and the story all shine, combining to create a masterpiece of a movie."
230,10,A Flawless Sequel,"It is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic of an original film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story begun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short."
231,10,The dark heart of Star Wars,"Star wars is a Saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat 'let's have an Olympic medal ceremony' ending...Empire discards the fluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious appeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the process. The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history."
232,9,"A Masterful, Groundbreaking, & Timeless Film with Mesmerizing Effects and Standout Performances by Hamill & Co.","The Empire Strikes Back is an absolute classic science fiction film released back in 1980. It continues the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo as they battle the evil Galactic Empire."
233,10,The Force is strong with this one...,"Star Wars may have been a brilliant beginning, but it's The Empire Strikes Back that has made sure this epic saga will remain unforgettable. In my opinion, this is the best Star Wars-movie ever, alongside Revenge of the Sith. Darker and more mature than its predecessor, Empire is 100% masterpiece."
234,9,To Quote or not to quote... well I can't bloody help it...,You know a movie has had a real effect on you if you start using it's lines to answer people during your day-to-day routines:
235,10,Fabulous sequel to Star Wars  best of the series.,"This sequel to Star Wars is actually even better than the original, and the best of the entire series. In The Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas allows his story outline to be scripted and directed by other hands (Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay, Irvin Kershner on directorial duties). It is a triumphant science fiction epic, a film of great invention and excitement, with remarkable set pieces and tremendous special effects. The film has a darker quality than its predecessor which lends a more complex and mature feel to the proceedings. It also manages the near-impossible job of being a thoroughly satisfying ""transitory"" movie  you have to remember that this movie doesn't have a start in the normal sense of the word since it continues a story already begun in an earlier film, nor does it have an end as such because much of the plot is left unresolved in preparation for the next movie."
236,9,The best in the series,"Empire Strikes Back has long been my favorite in the original trilogy. I remember going to see this when this was released theatrically as a little kid with my grandma. Empire is one of the rare cases where the sequel blows away the original. Creator George Lucas got some very good help in making this with writer Lawrence Kasdan and hiring a director that actually knows what he was doing, Irvin Kershner. With outsourcing some good help, this collaboration turned out to being a winning team to bring (and improve upon) George Lucas's vision. The film looks incredible to this day and the groundbreaking special effects from the 1st film are improved upon and look better here. The story in this installment is darker(and better suited to my tastes), but is also stronger and better as a whole. The characters are better fleshed out then the original film, the chemistry between the actors and performance are also much better. Not only is Empire Strikes Back the best in the series, but I also would argue that it's the foundation on which the franchise continued to explode and why it holds up today."
237,6,"Okay movie, but not an epic","""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the second film from the ""Star Wars"" franchise and the fifth in terms of chronology of the contents depicted in there. It was directed by Irvin Kershner over 35 years ago and had some success with the Academy Awards, even if not nearly as much as the first film. And I myself must say that I found it not better than the first (even if the IMDb rating says so), but also not much worse. Once again, it delivers especially on the visual side in terms of sets, cinematography and special effects while coming a bit short in terms of the story. The characters are all fairly memorable though, the humans and the others. There are many many characters that appeared in the first film already, for example Obi Wan Kenobi is even back for one scene, but there are also some interesting new additions, most of all the uber-famous Yoda. And Darth Vader is the main villain in here while being just one of several villains in the first film. A great light saber sequence is included here too."
238,10,THE BEST SEQUEL EVER,"After watching this film for the 5th time, there is not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's simply just a terrific movie. The story, acting and almost everything is at a near perfect level."
239,8,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) ***1/2,"This is one of the SW films I've seen before, back in 1997 when they were re-released to theatres. I didn't recall much about it when I watched it again recently but found it to be highly entertaining and certainly a ""new"" experience and a revelation after recently having become familiar with Episodes I, II, III and IV. It's much more enjoyable and interesting when you know what everyone's talking about! This being the second of the ""original"" films, coming after the mega-success of the first movie, there was obviously more money spent on the sequel and it shows. Many impressive locations and effects, and I really loved the music score this time around (especially the ominous ""theme"" each time we returned to Darth Vader's ship). Better performances from the main cast (especially Mark Hamill), too."
240,4,Star rating: 2 out of 5,"Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants). "
241,10,"Excellent, the best star wars movie out of the star wars saga! 10/10","I love this movie I've seen it 20 times, mainly because now that we have Disney+. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be shocking, just because there is only one shocking scene at the very end."
242,8,Stunning Science-Fiction Classic,"The Star Wars saga continues as the Rebel heroes are forced to flee their new base on the ice planet of Hoth; Luke Skywalker travels to the swamp world of Dagobah to learn from Jedi master Yoda, whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia flee from Imperial pursuers to the cloud city of Bespin. The three are ultimately reunited, but with terrible consequences ..."
243,10,An obviously well done sequel.,"Although the Death Star is destroyed, the war against the Republic has just begun. The Empire Strikes Back I must say is quite easily better than it's previous, A New Hope. The AT-AT attack scene at Hoth is the scene I crave most. The rest compared to that scene is pretty good, including Yoda's first appearance, Cloud City, and of course, ""I am your father."" It's interesting that this Irvin Kershner replaces George Lucas for the directing (I almost assumed Lucas directed all six films). Overall, the action scenes were great (the AT-AT scene being phenomenal), the acting was great, and I also thought some of the humor was better, especially with C-3PO. A well done and thought out movie once again."
244,10,Best Episode of the franchise,A masterpiece of a movie.<br /><br />Everything fits perfectly together.<br /><br />No more words to add.
245,,"The best of the ""Star Wars"" films","No matter what you think 'defines' ""Star Wars""- the action sequences, the detailed and enthralling mythos, the memorable characters, the romance, or just the atmosphere of adventure, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is in just about every way the most rewarding viewing experience out of any of the six live action ""Star Wars"" films (I have not seen ""Clone Wars"" and don't intend to right now). Why? Because it pulls off what ""Revenge of the Sith"" failed at: creating a compelling and well-written character-driven story while still delivering plenty of action, humor, and remaining an homage to the serials of the 1930's and 40's. "
246,10,Awesomeness!,"I so badly wish that I could say that the original STAR WARS:EPISODE IV,A NEW HOPE(ANH) was the best of the STAR WARS films, but it is, frankly, not! That honor goes to STAR WARS:EPISODE V,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (ESB)(1980). ESB is that rare sequel that manages to top it's predecessor. Make no mistake, though, ANH is still as magical, pure, and fun a flick as it was in 1977 when I first saw it as a kid! But ESB ups the ante and succeeds in it's own depiction of the Star Wars universe. In reality, ESB is in basic tone the antithesis of ANH, which is a big reason why I think that BOTH films stand the test of time! If your in the mood for a fast-paced, imaginative adrenaline-rush of pure action-adventure, then pop in ANH! But if you want imagination combined with character depth and detail, mystery, mood, and atmosphere, then ESB is more your cup of tea! "
247,10,The best of all six,"Where the first was an introduction to this vast universe, this is a further adventure in it, and an expansion of it. New worlds, creatures and technologies. Like its predecessor, this has something for everyone, and this is a stronger film... perhaps the most so, of the entire series. Kershner is undoubtedly at least part of the reason... he worked to make the characters realistic and credible beyond what they were, and it pays off. The various relationships are more believable than in the others, and the developments are very natural. This offers an emotional connection to the material, for the viewer, in addition to all the entertaining aspects. The plot remains interesting throughout and it never stands still. The pacing is spot-on, there isn't a boring moment in the two hour running time. The effects are impeccable, and Lucas had the crew push themselves to the limit, and it shows... big time. The score is yet again fantastic, Williams adds to what he created for IV. The acting is good, and seldom poor. The tone gets darker, setting up a sequel. The episode before this was a solid story even if it would be the only in the franchise, and this is a perfect middle part. This has by far the greatest light-saber action in the Original Trilogy. This is exciting and masterful with dialog and tension of high quality. The DVD features a commentary track well worth a listen, with several speakers, including Irvin. I recommend this to fans of Star Wars(regardless of what exactly you take that to mean), science fiction and movies. 10/10"
248,10,"the best of the Star Wars saga takes up a somber, more nihilistic note and emphasizes the fact that special effects can be special in more ways than just persuasiveness","Having viewed both the theatrical and updated versions of the first ""Star Wars"" picture, my reaction is still the same: a mixed review with an ultimate marginal note of recommendation. Now I have sat down to watch back-to-back both the theatrical and updated versions of the second movie, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and my verdict is still unanimous on that one as well: this is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made and it still baffles me how critic John Simon could comprehend of saying that a movie this bold and imaginative and daring and thrilling is junk and is dehumanizing to the younger generation. It certainly isn't to me. And the reason why I primarily admire ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is not the fact that its special effects are first-class or that they are used with imagination, but that its dominated by a superb science-fiction story, memorable characters, smart dialogue, and a true foreboding and mysterious atmosphere totally alien to the cheerful opera-like personality of the first movie."
249,9,Can't believe it took me this long to watch it,Such an exceptional film. It's amazing that these were made decades ago but are still jaw-dropping. I was totally missing out on the Star Wars universe.
250,10,Peak fiction,"This movie is the perfect example, on how to do a sequel right. This is easily the best Star Wars movie ever made. The action is much better and advanced, than in the pervious one. The villains are both amazing. Darth Vader established himself, as one of the most iconic villains of all time in this movie. The emotion is well implemented and it fits very nicely with the story. Lando Calrissian was a very neat addition to the group, which I very much enjoyed. Yoda was amazing in this movie as well. There is basically nothing to complain about. This is another one of the perfect movies."
251,10,The best part of the first trilogy!!!!!!,"I still think that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best one of the trilogy. I haven't seen the new Star Wars movie yet but that won't last for long. The reason why I think that this one's the best of the first trilogy, is because it is the darkest, it's the best sequel I've ever seen and it's got all the ingredients (romance, adventure etc.). My"
252,10,The Best From Trilogie,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. I am sure that everyone watched it, so you probably know how good this movie is, if not, then i don't know where were you for last 40 years?... Its perfect."
253,7,Big improvement over the original!,"The worst part of the movie were Chewbacca's excessive and excruciating howlings. That, plus the annoying (although less so) R2-D2 noises made the experience less pleasent for no reason (I guess kids love these things?)."
254,10,A great sequel to Episode IV : A New Hope,"I had gotten curious about the ""Star Wars"" saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the ""Star Wars"" saga."
255,8,Makes an excellent case for the best sequel of all time,"The Empire strikes back is a complex movie to review. On the one hand, in terms of plot development and pacing it feels like a step back from A New Hope. Luke goes to train with Yoda, while his friends evade a Star Destroyer through the power of plot armor. Eventually he goes to save his friends."
256,9,Learning Game,"George Lucas doesn't understand religion.  He can never convey the concepts and theories of it (or the belief in it for that matter) to any extent. Hence, the best movie he directed is American Graffiti since it is not so concerned with making obvious subtexts."
257,10,My #1 movie of all time,"When The Empire Strikes Back was released for the first time, I didn't think it would be as good as the very first Star Wars that was released because usually a sequel isn't as good as a prequel. But boy was I ever wrong!!! In my opinion, I think that this is not only the best sequel, but the best movie ever made."
258,10,Irvin Kershner vs George Lucas,"For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best films I have seen. It is the best of the five Star Wars films, though perhaps that is down to director Irvin Kershner who tweaked George Lucas's original vision into something darker than the original and infinitely bleaker than the follow-up Return of the Jedi. Lucas reportedly hated 'Empire' upon seeing what Kershner had done to his film and put together another cut that he later conceded was inferior, and Kershner's vision made it to screens around the world."
259,7,just barely below the first one,"Another Lucas masterpiece. This film is just a little bit weaker than the first, or perhaps the impact of some of the SFX was lessened by the fact that they were pretty much the same as the Episode IV. While they were novel in the first film, they were expected in this film. Still, a great film. This entire series is destined to become ""Classic"", et al. I think that people went into this film with high expectations and were not disappointed. I wasn't, not really - it's a great film. Still, as I said, just a LITTLE bit less great than the first one."
260,10,The best adventure movie ever.,"One of my seven 10s (of my about 200 rated movies) are given to this movie. And when I first wanted to vote for it, I had just seen it, yet again experienced the class, the acts, the dialogue, the action, the characters, the amazing adventures of Han, Luke and the rest. And let's just say that I hadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well, unreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original Star Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series. It's so intense, its plot and subplots are perfectly intertwined, just about everything in the film is perfectly fit for its genre. This is why this movie deserves a 10."
261,9,A near perfect masterpiece of a movie,"The Empire Strikes Back is a 1980 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and direct sequel to Star Wars. As a brief summary, The Empire Strikes Back is a classic example of a movie that the critics of the time got very wrong. Initially receiving mixed reviews and being slammed by some is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and the best Star Wars film overall...and its not hard to see why! The Empire Strikes Back continues on from the events of Star Wars revisiting the characters of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. The Empire Strikes Back is known to be the much darker sequel, with much more character depth, vulnerability and emotion. Lucas continues to develop his beloved characters in all the right ways with the Han-Leia relationship, the more powerful feeling of friendship and of course the biggest, most shocking twist in cinematic history with Vader and Luke in the final act of the film. The Empire Strikes Back also continues to evolve the world introducing us to new places, new characters such as the legendary Jedi master, Yoda, improving the special effects and an even more beautiful soundtrack, provided by John Williams. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example of a sequel done right, equal and at times even better than the original. Epic battles, intense space chases, powerful emotional character development, shocking twists, thought-provoking ideas, themes and messages and finally groundbreaking sequences and special effects. In terms of flaws The Empire Strikes Back virtually has none whatsoever, other than an unfortunate twist which has had a negative response later on in the franchise, a few unnecessarily long scenes of Luke's training, and in my opinion a slightly weaker general plot than the original story. These however barely affect this near perfect masterpiece of a movie. 9/10"
262,8,A superlative sequel,"Although it has aged somewhat, this film was magnificent in convincingly creating a seamless alternate reality. I saw this after Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones so perhaps that's why I'm not so in awe of it as other viewers. Nevertheless I appreciated the attention to detail, the competent acting, superlative special effects (for their time), exploration of universal themes, and sheer entertainment of this science fiction masterpiece, 8/10."
263,10,My favorite movie of all time.,"This movie is my all-time favorite. From the massive battles, to the surprising twist that even this day I get tingle from. I can't stress this enough that Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest movies to be released. I remember first watching this when I was not older than 3 years of age, and gasping during the biggest reveal in movie history. If people say they hate Star Wars, then they obviously: "
264,10,The symbol for what a great sequel should be,"The Empire Strikes Back is the most suspenseful, well-paced and most emotional entry of the Star Wars saga. It's the greatest of movie sequels and as far as it goes, it is everything a sequel to a great movie is supposed to be: a darker tone, more development with the characters, universe expanding with some new and greater additions and features."
265,6,"""Laugh it up, fuzzball...""","In a 'post-classical' era, films are often quite simplistic - they are driven by high-concepts and childish premises; experiencing them is fragmented by tie-in merchandising and the like. They concentrate on action too much, substituting character psychology. Or so the argument goes in Bordwell & Thompson's 2006 book ""Film Art"" - whether or not you agree with any of this, there is no questioning Star Wars' role in facilitating it."
266,10,My Favorite Film of All-Time!!!!!,"The Empire Strikes Back, formally known as Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, is the sequel to the superb Star Wars. Empire is one of those few occasions in movie history where I think the sequel has surpassed its predecessor, it just wasn't a remake of the original it took the story of the original in amazing new directions. The script, the directing, editing, special effects, everything is just head and shoulders better. This movie is also one of the first times in Hollywood history where the bad guys actually won. The movie superbly expands upon the original story-wise as well, the romance between Han and Leia is great, and the big revelation at the end of the film is probably the most shocking moment in film history. Although George Lucas didn't direct this installment, Irvin Kershner did superb. This is just a picture perfect film that did everything right and is my favorite film of all-time."
267,10,The Force is Strong with this one!!,"What a Shocker...I think this one is everyone's favourite as nearly every single fan will say ""This is the Best Star Wars Movie of All Time"" and I agree with them, but that's not the main reason why I love it."
268,9,The Empire Strikes Back..,"Oh it was a lot more fun than I thought. I was a bit bored in the episode 4, but this movie is not at all. Every scene is really tense and immersive. The music that comes out every time Darth Vader appears is truly heartbreaking."
269,8,The Great Galactic War..,**Warning! Spoiler Information Inside!**
270,10,"This is it. My childhood, present and fluture!",More than a movie. A world for me and for many people around the world.
271,,A breathless Sci-Fi thriller,"This brilliant Sci-Fi thriller, ""Empire Strikes Back"", simply showcases why Star Wars has been the most influential film franchise for the last forty years. It is just impeccably constructed. The production design, set pieces, action sequences, visual effects, sound editing and music score are among the best of all time. The editing, story and performances are also fascinating, and keeps the breath of the audiences all the time. For this particular installment full of imagination, only the sky is the limit."
272,8,"40th anniversary showing, still a classic",Although on the big screen the CGI now looks a bit dated this film is firmly still a classic and still very much worth the trip to see it in all its glory.
273,10,Deserves it's reputation,"Empire Strikes Back is highly regarded as a masterpiece and one of the best sequels ever made, and it deserves all of the praise it gets. After all this time, it's still one of the best Star Wars movies to date and the best of the original trilogy."
274,7,And it strikes back with a bang,Empire Strikes Back is widely called the best Star Wars film (to date) and it is clear to see why.
275,9,A Film That Truly Shows the Magic of Cinema,"I remember that when I first came into contact with Star Wars, I was around 13 years old. It was on a TV show, the movie itself had been released at least a few long 16 years ago. I myself had already been charmed by the headline, when I watched the movie I just couldn't even sleep trying to find a way to build a lightsaber too and fight the bloodthirsty Siths. That was 23 years ago, even today I still dream of being a Jedi, although I know that I am too old to be trained."
276,10,The Brilliance Strikes Back,"Prior to 1980, there had not been a movie sequel that quite destroyed over dethroned the original in terms of quality, cultural impact, and everlasting effect. Ever since 1916, when the first movie sequel was born (Fall of a Nation---completing your pointless trivia of the day), there had been very few successful sequels that could stand tall with the original. Of course, there was French Connection II, and Godfather II, but neither of them could quite compare to the original. Enter Empire Strikes Back. Not only did this sequel have a tougher job to live to its original counterpart (a box office phenomenon that would forever change marketing, merchandising, and film-making for generations to come), but this sequel quite frankly did the unthinkable by changing the tone, raising the stakes, and not promising a happy-go-lucky ending that usually associates with sequels. Empire Strikes Back is yet another Star Wars movie that broke the rules of how to make a film and also ushered a new style and technique of film-making."
277,10,Sequel Greatness,When you talk about sequels that don't suck this is one of them. The 2nd movie to the original Star Wars trilogy was always my go to and most watch over the original movie.
278,10,The Greatest Film Ever Made,"In creating a sequel to the phenomenally successful Star Wars, George Lucas and his team were faced with a seemingly impossible challenge.  How could the original be surpassed?  Three years (and a lot of cash) had, of course, given the film-makers the opportunity to develop the special effects technology far beyond the original film.  But this alone was not enough. Where Empire truly excels over it's predecessor is in the two essential fields of film storytelling-- both the plot and the characters are far richer and more captivating.  Why is Empire the greatest film ever made? We will never again see such a perfect blending of romance, adventure, emotion and movie magic."
279,,Definately the WORST of the original trilogy.,This film is without a doubt the worst of the Star Wars movies. I have no idea why people say that this is the best. Watching Episode 5 is watching a really really good movie...then the ending destroys it from being supurb.
280,10,Star Wars V,"Beautiful Movie. Absolutely perfect, great story telling, good camara work, nice acting. Star Wars is such a big part of my childhood and this lovie is a big reason why. It makes me remember what good days I had with my friends and why i fell in love with art and movies."
281,8,The best of the series,"As a youngster certain parts of this movie creeped me (training with Yoda, the opening) but as I've matured, or at least got older, this now is easily my favourite movie of the series."
282,10,Best film in Star Wars saga. (For Aydar Gumarovich XD),"Take a journey to stars with your favourite characters with the best film in whole Star Wars saga. Saga creator George Lucas with him unforgettable plot created not only well-reviewed, but one of the best reviewed film, which no wonder takes the 15th place in IMDb's top. And almosr all of Star Wars' fans name this film best in trilogy."
283,7,"I will remove a star each time a toxic fan marks my review unhelpful, and increase one if they mark my review helpful","Just before the release of Rise of the Skywalker, I had decided to watch every single Star Wars movie so that I could finally understand the memes and also catch up on time. So as I watched The Empire Strikes Back, I was actually really disappointed. Because of how much people speak about it, I was expecting it to be something more than that. But as I grew up, I started appreciating it more and more. Why I hated it earlier and why I like it now, I'll explain it further in the review."
284,10,Impressive... most impressive.,The greatest film in the franchise and solidified Darth Vader as the greatest villain on the silver screen. Everything about this film is perfect (apart from Vader's tiny cute hologram).
285,10,Best star wars film.,"The only problems i have are that Luke and leia are being sus and the visual effects have dated. Apart from that this is a perfect film, and you will not be disappointed."
286,10,Another Great Star Wars Adventure!,Star Wars: Episode 5 - The Empire Strikes Back
287,10,How do you match Star Wars? Make The Empire Strikes Back!,"When George Lucas made the Empire Strikes Back, he succeeded where so many filmmakers have failed. A Sequel to match the original, and the secret is simple, don't mess with the formula that worked the first time."
288,9,How sequels should be done,This review is for the 1980 theatrical release and not the 1997 and later specialized editions.
289,7,The Empire Strikes Back,"Yoda adds his name to the list of Star Wars characters. He starts out as a puppet and ends up as a computer generated image. I never liked the venerable Yoda. He is self-righteous. His wisdom is inscrutable. At 900 years old, he is not quite as old as Methuselah who made it to 969. The exotic names and grotesque creatures become hard to digest after a while. Lightsaber duels afford opportunities to doze. I saw this movie because I saw the one before it. Lucas made it because he made the one before it. His franchise was becoming a money-making trap. The dark, confusing scenes bothered me. A lot of the action felt contrived, as opposed to being something which occurred naturally."
290,8,Great movie but not the best in the saga,"So I am probably going against most Star Wars fans who rate this as the best in the saga but for me it's a great movie but not the best. I can't really put my finger on why. I found the whole trip to see Yoda a bit boring and it went on for too long. Hoth was great but did not see why we had to spend first ten mins watching Luke get captured by the yeti type monster. The chase in the asteroid field was all a bit yawn. That being said there were some fantastic highlights such as Hoth battle, Cloud City stuff and of course the Vader/Luke father bit. I just found it all a bit trying to be edgy in places. Great movie but not the best in the saga for me."
291,10,It's easy to say. It's more difficult to explain: The best movie ever made,"The saga continues (please excuse me for some dumb spelling mistakes, they just got here)... The first Star Wars movie didn't really turn me into a deep star wars fanatic, but I must say, these three movies are my absolute favorites!"
292,7,One of the Better Episodes,"Watching these with my wife (who has never seen them before). Episode V is certainly a step up from IV. However, it's paced a lower slower than I remembered. Unfortunately, the pervasiveness of State Wars in pop-culture does take away of the intended surprises of discovering who Yoda is and the relationship between Vader and Luke. Nevertheless, it is a good film."
293,,Great film! definitively the best Star Wars movie.,"Definitively not like A new hope. The empire strikes is a good entertaining film. The action sequences are a lot better, we don't see something as stupid as the lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Obi Wan. The fights are slow but intense. The stuff that happens on the film actually seems important, not like the boring stuff of A new hope. The empire strikes back creates some genuine tension on the plot. Characters are better now. They were good on A new hope, but only because they were fun. On here, we see the more of the characters, and the movie makes the viewers sympathize with them. The characters aren't profound by any means, but they're interesting. And here, i can forgive that Darth Vader is boring, because the movie adds some plot twists at the end that actually points to something interesting in the next movie. Is a classic, definitively not a masterpiece, but is the perfect entertainment movie."
294,,"The best of the ""trilogy""","Undoubtedly, by movie standards, ESB is the best of the trilogy. Unlike Starwars and Jedi, Empire is a profoundly mystical experience, dark and gloomy yet still part of the Trilogy. The first movie was absurdly simple and cheery - especially the end; the third movie would be fairly cheery and slightly slow. Empire is just at the right timbre for a good movie, as well as having what is currently the greatest movie soundtrack of all, according to my sources. All in all, a good movie and quite an experience."
295,10,Greatest of the Star Wars Films.,I love the Star Wars films as a whole. However I feel that The Empire Strikes Back is easily the greatest film of the series and one of the greatest films ever made.
296,10,This is how you make a sequel!,"Just like The Godfather, they said it could not be done, but they made a sequel to Star Wars as compelling as the first. The Empire Strikes Back is darker than the original, but none of the matinée fun is lost in the process. In a sense, that makes it even more impressive than the first! In this chapter, the empire is closing in on the rebels and Luke must go learn from a mysterious Jedi named Yoda, while Han Solo and the rest of the rebels must dodge Darth Vader. The beauty of the first Star Wars is all here, the elements of destiny and fate, the terrifying scenes of Darth Vader, the powerful visuals, and the well-timed comic relief. Even with Lucas not in the directors' chair, the film is still amazing in every sense."
297,8,To the Hoth System!,Episode VI is a very mixed movie. I think it gets more appraisal than it deserves (though I admit that the acting is much better this time around). The movie also has a type of darkness that makes it different from the first.
298,10,Yes,"The best Star wars movie ever! Great story, Great acting and Great action. Even the music in this film was amazing. Usually when a great film comes out the sequel sucks. Not in this case. The Empire Strikes Back did not follow the crappy sequel line. The reason it might be so good is because George Lucas did not direct it. The only problem I have is the ending. Why is Lando Wearing Hans clothes? does Han have a closet full of the same clothes that fit Lando? who knows... The Empire Strikes back is a film that you can watch over and over and never get bored. I have seen this film over 100 times and I still love watching it."
299,10,Incredible StoryThis,"This film is incredible. I am so thankful for George Lucas and his boldness in writing it. I have watched quite a few documentaries on the Star Wars series and each documentary gives me more and more appreciation for the three films that came out in the 70's. Lucas took quite a risk with the Star Wars franchise and it (obviously) paid off for him. If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of these documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like when it was first made. The crew and cast describes it as a lot of chaos and self-doubt until its first debut when it gained its cult following. The way that Lucas wrote and directed these films is a tribute to his true genius and success."
300,,Easily the high point of the original trilogy,"'The Empire Strikes Back' easily bests the original Star Wars. The film moves fast, has very few lulls, the Special Effects are more impressive, and the confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader remains a dramatic high point. The wise Yoda is introduced and his scenes with Luke are still worth watching. As always, Harrison Ford dominates the film. This was truly a star-making trilogy for him. Hamill is average as an actor. The droids R2D2 and C3PO are fun and their antics remain watchable specially for kids. This film is easily the high point of the original trilogy."
301,7,Good,"The cinematography is stark and bare. It's fun watching it because its complexity begins within its characters. Say what you will, this film is very light-hearted and not complex at all as the different characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated too many falsehoods. The story is nothing special, but exceptional performances from most of the cast go a long way. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Filled with charm, innocence and drama. The blend of strong acting, a strong story and some inventive camera-work earns this outer space vehicle a rating of 7/10. It was well-received at its American premiere."
302,10,Great Film,"It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy."
303,10,The best sequel to ever be produced!,"End of discussion, really...some may declare that The Godfather: Part II to have that title, but I would respectfully disagree. Is Godfather: Part II a masterpiece and an excellent sequel? Of course! It's a classic! But, hear me out...The Empire Strikes Back isn't just a terrific follow up to Star Wars, it's a terrific film in its own right! For those who loved Star Wars, it's sequel is sure to loved even more! With its darker themes, quicker plot, excellent character development and, not to forget that epic climax...this has to be declared the best sequel ever produced!"
304,10,Best Star Wars Film.,"This is, with out a doubt, the best ""Star Wars"" film. Straight in from the beginning, there is action galore, with the Battle of Hoth, to the climatic duel between Luck Skywalker and Darth Vader, it never pause's or breath."
305,10,Great movie,"I really loved all star wars movies. I must say that music is excellent and that Dart wader theme is just great. The Cloud City, the most awesome of any of the Star Wars arenas, is a beautiful exterior with a dark heart. The film culminates in a whirl of emotional intensity and the infernal machine of the carbon freezing chamber. With John Williams' breathtaking score and the dark red hellish lighting, the whole feel is of a Wagnerian opera: dark and epic."
306,6,"Involved, occasionally rousing, but lacking spirit...","The first sequel to 1977's ""Star Wars"" was so hotly anticipated, it sparked the whole trend of film-goers sleeping outside movie theaters in droves, waiting anxiously for the eventual release. Once the picture premiered, it didn't seem to matter to the faithful that it was missing the frisky spirit of ""Star Wars"", as well as a solid finish. Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker, being educated by mystical Yoda and facing off against Darth Vader, who reveals an unanticipated secret. Irvin Kershner's direction is thoughtful--he brings to the action sequences a deep undercurrent of purpose--but he's also mechanical, perhaps spending too much time with Luke (who, due to a car accident suffered in real-life by Hamill, has a perplexed, dour appearance). Harrison Ford provides lots of old-fashioned charm, the special effects and music are wonderful, but the cliffhanger finale wasn't really fair (at the time, it felt like a slap in the face). Producer/creator George Lucas re-released this to theaters in 1997 with three extra minutes and a lofty title change. **1/2 from ****"
307,6,Nice,"It's another great job here, great script, incredible visual effects, fantastic soundtrack and good performances. Another great Star Wars movie."
308,6,Not all that bad,The Empire Strikes Back is not all that bad and has its moments. 
309,5,I wouldn't say there's anything UNlikeable...,Certainly a perfectly watchable piece of science fantasy yarn even if it does take itself a bit seriously.
310,10,"""I love you""... ""I know""","Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, this movie paints itself across your screen. Opening with the famous Hoth battle you gasp in awe as the famous Imperial AT-AT's march to crush the rebellion, and watch as your favorite heroes try desperately to stay 2 steps ahead of the empire. Be introduced for the first time to Yoda, and journey to Bespin where you see Boba Fett, an incredible bounty Hunter. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better Darth Vader faces off with his son, and let me just say it is cinema gold. Jump up and down in your seat and gasp as you hear Vader say, ""No. I am your father."" Mutter the words, ""Never tell me the odds,"" and ""Do... or do not. There is no try,"" as you sadly drag yourself away from the movie as you remembering Han Solos fate and the Lose of Lukes hand. I give this a 10/10. ""Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking Nerf herder."""
311,10,"The Empire Strikes Back is a flawless,character driven masterpiece with dark,complex plot full of twists and some of the best visuals and music scores of all times","This movie is a flawless masterpiece.The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best of the Original Trilogy but one of the best sequels ever made(with The Godfather Part II and The Dark Knight).The Empire is darker than its predecessor,it develops our beloved characters from A New Hope and makes them more relate-able and complex.It also introduces new characters that became fan favorites.This movie has a complex,dark plot with depth and shocking twists.The film is full of incredible dialogue with memorable and quotable lines.It goes without saying that the visuals are mind blowing and the music score by John Williams is iconic.In a nutshell Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes back is a dark, mature sequel that exceeded the original and it is considered one of the best films of all time that you totally have to see(but you probably saw a million times)"
312,10,STAR WARS : THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,"Not Only The Best Chapter Within The Star Wars Franchise, But One Of The Greatest SciFi Movies Of All Time."
313,7,Fun--But Much Better When I was a Kid,"I'm continuing to watch all the Star Wars movies in preparation for ""The Force Awakens"". I've made it up to ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"". "
314,9,The biggest star in the Star Wars universe,"The Empire strikes back is an excellent sequel that represents the essence of taking the best of the first part and becoming it bigger, darker and even depper in terms of character development. The movie gives us probably the most iconic scenes in the Star Wars universe and plot twist of the cinematographic world."
315,,dark. and useful,"one of the films from series who gives not only a good show but a special key for discover heart of the story. dark. and precise in exploration of details. the presence of Yoda, the meeting between Darth Vader and Luke, the battle scenes and the evolution of the group's members are pieces of a large puzzle. a film who defines relationships and gives fascinating scenes. first definition of Force and dark side, inspired map for the status of Luke Skywalker, fascinating adventure and extraordinary scenes who preserve the elements of old fairy tales. short, a dark part. and useful trip in heart of a universe who defines popular culture."
316,10,New acquaintances in 1977 became old beloved friends in 1980.,"An exciting sequel to the original ""Star Wars"", this has certain elements in it that are a bit better better the original, although there's no improving on that classic. The original film gave the audience an opportunity to get to know Hans Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia as well as robots C3 PO and RQDQ and villain. Darth Vader. The time has been taken for the sequel to really flesh those characters out, and the result means that the audience will root for the 3 heroes all the more even though they had loyalty from the start. There's an amusing battle of the sexes presented with the obviously attracted Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Hans (Harrison Ford), and the youthful Luke (Mark Hamill) truly has become a man after winning the battle against the Death Star. With his rise to power as the main villain, Darth Vader is all the more fascinating, and James Earl Jones is even more commanding than he was before."
317,4,Not that good... (take three),"I saw The Empire Strikes Back (TESB) when I was 13 or 14, and I didn't like it back then. I've seen it many times since, and in my later views I really wanted to like it, but I ended up disliking it even more. The first sign of silliness in my eyes was the snow-speeders equipped with harpoons and towing cables. Why should anyone install a harpoon to a flying machine? It turns out to topple AT-ATs. But how did they know they'd fight against walking moto-quadrupeds? Well, they didn't. It dawned on me that that was nothing more than lazy storytelling. Create the outcome first (tackle walking machines), invent how to generate it (using cables) later. And do it again, this time with Luke."
318,10,the best Star Wars film,Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best Star Wars film to date with the best charters a complex story and the greatest effects.
319,8,Decent,"I think this movie is amusing and decent. With its interesting storyline, good characters, a surprise plot twist towards the end, and so much more are sure to keep you entertained. I don't like the scene when Han Solo gets frozen. But all in all, I recommend you give this a try."
320,,It's easy to say. It's more difficult to explane: The best movie ever made,"The saga continues (please excuse me for some dumb spelling mistakes, they just got here)... The first Star Wars movie didn't really turn me into a deep star wars fanatic, but I must say, theese three movies are my absolute favorites!"
321,10,Rich and Rewarding...Beautifully Done...Perfect Production Personafied,Anticipation...
322,10,Pure Brilliance,This movie was a work of art as was the trilogy. It is a trilogy that we will never see the likes of again (though Godfather 1-3 and the Lord of the Rings trilogy have there place in cinema history as well).
323,9,One of the greatest movies of all time,"After the indescribable success of the first amazing Star Wars film, people were hungry for more, so George Lucas decided to go ahead and make a sequel."
324,9,There is a great disturbance in the Force.,"Sound, Art, Music, Special Effects, Costuming - these all make this a film worth revisiting on a Hi-Def TV. Even without the Hi-Def cable, this is a special film to watch and enjoy."
325,10,The Empire Strikes Back: A Classic That Lives Up To The Hype,"If you haven't seen The Empire Strikes Back yet, stop what you're doing and watch it right now! This film is the epitome of a timeless classic and a must-see for any movie lover. Even if you're not a Star Wars fan, the plot, characters, and special effects will captivate you from beginning to end."
326,10,"Not just one of the best sequels ever made, not just one of the best science-fiction movies ever made but also one of the best movies ever made.",Widely this movie is known as perhaps the best sequel ever made. However calling this movie the best sequel ever made alone is not enough. It's so much more than just a sequel and it's overall one of the best movies ever made.
327,,The best of the trilogy!,"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) **** Mark Hamill, Harrison"
328,7,Better than the first one.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, and A New Hope it's now time for The Empire Strikes Back. I thought A New Hope was the weakest one, okay it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but the truth is that the later ones are just of better quality in every domain. the Empire Strikes Back was already a bit better but still not of the same quality as the others. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1980 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the seventh movie of eleven in barely 72 hours for me, next one today will be Return of the Jedi in the hope the quality still continues to improve, looking forward to it."
329,10,re-watched for the millionth time,"i wanted to briefly state that this is how films and sequels should me made, i know i am not stating new ground here but the sophistication of this film makes me wonder why the template hasn't been used more. it doesn't pick up where we left off, we aren't treated as morons with constant plot explaining, it ends with hope lost. can we have more of this, i don't like happy endings, never seems real in a movie. Han solo being froze is my favourite thing. the twist is a classic move, lando comes in and is instantly a great character, the universe becomes more expanded. the effects look better, i don't know why this isn't higher than 12th at the time of writing, i just wanted to state i love this film"
330,7,"Fun, imaginative, iconic space adventure with a kick-axx cast","""Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) was the anticipated follow-up to the initial mega-hit blockbuster from 1977. It's an epic, but simplistic space fantasy about an evil empire and the noble souls who dare to fight it. The main cast features Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and the voice work of James Earl Jones (Darth Vader), Frank Oz (Yoda) and Clive Revill (Emperor)."
331,10,More creatures and excitement as the trilogy continues,"From the overwhelming success of the first Star Wars film (""Episode IV - A New Hope"") the movie-going public was chomping at the bit in anticipation of this second film. It came out three years after the first and continued the mystique of the first film. The fans flocked to the theaters, and the critics couldn't heap enough praise on the production."
332,10,Still the most visually stunning entry in the Star Wars series.,"This for me is the best Star Wars movie...I even like it more than the first one.  Even today I find it visually stunning and it looks a lot better than anything in the most recent two Star Wars films.  The plot is a bit darker as this film in the series seemed to be more aimed at adults, but kids could enjoy it too.  It is a shame that the one scene in this film that is the most memorable will be kind of wiped out thanks to the new trilogy.  You know the one with Luke facing Vader and Vader makes the startling revelation.  Anyone who watches these movies in the so-called correct order is not going to be very surprised.  Though if they do watch it in order they may never get to this classic cause they will probably stop after the Clone Wars cause lets face it the new triology just isn't very good.  Watch the original trilogy and forget the new...I just wish these were availble on dvd."
333,9,Best Of The Series,"Episode V is the finest entry of the first two trilogies, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes'(Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher returning as Luke, Han, and Leia) attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the next chapter nicely."
334,10,Star Wars doesn't get any better than this.,"You've gotta admire George Lucas' moxie. It was bold enough that he sought out to self-finance ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but the movie has to be a downer on top of it. Make matters worse, he ends on one humdinger of a cliffhanger that people had to wait 3 years for resolution. That's sheer balls. "
335,6,What I don't like about this one...,"I'm probably gonna be the Most Unfashionable & Despised Reviewer Alive for saying this, but I am not a huge fan of this episode. In fact, I consider it to be the weakest in the story. Now, when you've stopped hyperventilating, I'll explain why."
336,,irresistible,"I see it. again and again. it was only part from Star Wars trilogy present in Romanian Comunist theaters. and wise Yoda, terrific Darth Vader, courageous Jedies was perfect bridges far from reality. secret of success - the nuances of fairy tale more than a SF. or only the good taste of freedom and the adventures of heroes as small drops of soup-opera. sure, artistic is wonderful creation. but it remains a sentimental product. fight scenes, the cold Darth, the war of David against Goliath, the traces of stories from so many places, the vision of George Lucas, the joy to be child without necessity of mask, the sounds, the atmosphere, maybe dialogs makes this movie more than a good prey for artistic temptation but circle of an innocent mode to see things."
337,10,George Lucas' Best,In 1980 I was 8 years old... I still have vague memories of standing outside the movie theater waiting to get in to the (then) new film. I was so excited I could hardly stand still. Once inside the theater I saw what was to become my favorite movie in the Star Wars Saga! 
338,10,A continuation that doesn't have a right to be this good,"""Empire had the better ending; Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father, Han gets frozen, and taken away by Bobba Fett, it ends on such a downnote. That's what life is, a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."" - Dante Hicks, Clerks."
339,10,The best in the SAGA,I gotta admit I never always like Star Wars episode 5 the empire Strikes back. I use to think that it was boring and had too much talking and Information but I grew older and now I study films and notice Why certain things happen and how they make a film better. I will not deny that I am tired of hearing certain scenes but that doesn't happen Often. Honestly if you haven't seen this you must. The only problem I can think Off is the battle between vader and Luke. I want to know why vader didn't kill Luke and what happened to R2. Why did he get dragged down at dagobha What was the point of that scene. The film has a great beginning and a good Ending. Overall as a trilogy it is better than the prequels
340,9,"The ""heart"" of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy...","""The Empire Strikes Back"" does its best to visually surpass the original ""Star Wars"" and the special effects or the creatures' designs are as convincing as the pioneering space epic, there's also a richness of landscapes, taking you from the snowy summits of a cold planet to the tropical jungle, but beyond the escapism, it's the excitement to see again that iconic gallery of characters, Han Solo, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2, Luke, Chewbacca (whose mourning and moaning sounds took a whole other resonance) and a few newcomers. In ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the key word is ""Back"". "
341,10,Part five of a great fantasy series,This is the fifth part of my essay on the themes and motifs of Star Wars.
342,8,The Force Continues.,"Picking up where Star Wars left off, ""Empire Strikes Back"" is the 5th episode in the trilogy, and second film in the series. In this film, Princess Leia, Han Solo R2-D2 and C-3P0 tried to flee the Galatic Empire, but are later captured by Lord Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker is getting Jedi training by Yoda (his first appearance in the series). We see a determined Skywalker trying to master the technique of being a Jedi, and attempt to rescue his friends. What results is another film full with imagination, character development, action and suspense. One of the best heroic scenes, I think, in the movie is when Skywalker tries to master the technique of moving and lifting objects using the Force. The element of friendship and love continue in this film, as we see a growing teamwork bond between C-3PO and Chewbacca, and a love interest between Princecss Leia and Han Solo; all the human drama blends in well with the sci-fi action. Also, Billy Dee Williams first appears as Lando Calrissian, who join forces with Han Solo and the crew to battle Darth Vadar."
343,5,"Way too over-rated. Definitely not in the same class as ""star wars"" and ""Return of the Jedi"".","I was very disappointed upon seeing ""The Empire strikes back"". I expected more in this movie than just the scene where Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker:  ""Luke, I am your father"".  I was expecting as much excitement and unpredictability as in ""Star wars"".  I'm not saying the movie is bad or boring, but if you compare this the first and the third (or the fourth and the sixth), it just isn't as good, that's all.  However, just like in ""Star wars"" and ""The return of the Jedi"", Harrison Ford's performance is excellent and is the best part, in my opinion, of ""The Empire strikes back"".  But for fans of the trilogy, it's an absolute must-see."
344,9,"""Lucas Strikes Again""","They should title this one ""Lucas Strikes Again."" Once again he managed to create a compelling story (though he didn't write the screenplay OR direct it) where the bad guys keep winning throughout the entire film! I only wish that I could go back in time to see how people reacted when Darth Vader's secret past was revealed -- oh well, that's what I have kids for. Shhh! Don't spoil it for them!"
345,10,Love it,"Best movie of the series, including the latest effort."
346,10,A dark sequel,"Great film, this film does not try to copy the first one, it has its own atmosphere, its own mood. Though or better because of this The Empire Strikes Back is as good as Star Wars I. It was a risk to make this film with Irvin Kershner as the regisseur but he was well worth the try. Thx Irvin for this great film."
347,9,Thank you for Star Wars!,Thank you George Lucas and to everyone involved in bringing us this wonderful movie series! I love Star Wars Episodes 1-6 and it is my favorite movie series.
348,9,Wow!,After almost 40 years movie still looks really good.
349,6,Good but just because it is darker doesn't mean its better.,Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back tells the story of the evil galactic empire attacking the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the Death Star. One thing that I feel is worth noting right off the bat is that I don't think this film surpasses A New Hope but is ratter on the same level in terms of substance as well as quality.
350,,"The Sequel That Raised The Bar For Sequels, The Empire Strikes Back Is The Finest Episode Of Star Wars Saga","One of the most celebrated film sequels of all time, Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back is the follow-up chapter to George Lucas' revolutionary Star Wars that happens to be both notorious & influential for its much darker ambiance in comparison to the adventurous tone of the original. Regarded by many as the best chapter of the whole saga and memorable for its unforgettable final twist that no one saw coming, The Empire Strikes Back does feature a more involving storyline but thanks to its marred visuals, this was just as difficult to take seriously as its predecessor."
351,,The One That Changed The Playing Field,"""Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back"" is a great example of expanding on the universe established in the original one, and turn to a more darker tone and direction that adds depth in everyone's beloved characters and of course, tragedy."
352,,A step down,"Bigger isn't always better. Clichéd, I know, but it's perfect to describe this. Dazzling action sequences and it's not really a big decrease in quality from the first, but some of the creativity and wit is gone, and instead it gets to be too much of an overload. Still, it's pretty entertaining for the most part, the characterizations are once again the best thing about it, and where it leaves the characters in the end is truly fascinating. Unlike A new Hope, I can't say that I totally get the acclaim this one's gotten as the ""best"" in the franchise. Still, this is definitely pretty good and definitely doesn't add a bad taste to the franchise."
353,,Wars Not Make One Great,"In this sequel, Irvin Kershner takes over the director's seat from George Lucas (who is the writer and producer). The movie takes off a couple of months from where its sequel ended. Our favourite heros, R2, Luke, Han, Princess Leia, C3P0 and Chewbecca continue their fight against the dark side (Darth Vader and Co) for freedom and justice. Of course like 'Star Wars', this one holds tremendous nostalgic value for me and, having seen it more than twenty years ago, my memory of this one is fresher than the aforementioned. I especially remember the sequence with Yoda, Luke and R2 that takes place in a marsh."
354,9,The best film of the trilogy...,"Well I have to say that I am a fan of the old and classic movies of the cinema and not the new ones. Star Wars is not just a movie, is the beginning of a new era, it's the beginning and the peak of movies with space and its defense."
355,8,The Star Wars strikes back with an Impossible Classic Sequel.,Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -<br /><br />Brief Review ;-
356,8,Hoth and bothered.,"I can't review ""Empire"" man! What am I supposed to say? ""it's good, yeah"". It's one of the founding films that makes up my cultural mentality. I've been watching it for most of the 40 years that I've been alive. Anyway... let's put something down."
357,9,Better Than Episode IV!,"This movie is a little better than Episode 4 but sill it's just an ordinary science fiction film. It wasn't until Return of the Jedi when some really good science fiction kicks in. There were many good moments in this film with Han Solo and the return of my favorite character, Yoda."
358,10,I'm Your....Reviewer,When I meet people who watched this already knowing the big reveal I pity them and explain how things used to be before the internet and spoilers became almost a sport.
359,,Almost As Good As the Exceptional Original,"The much-anticipated sequel to ""Star Wars"" dazzled audiences in 1980 and is almost as good as its outstanding predecessor.  Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) and his evil forces do just as the title indicates: they strike back.  An amazing secret that few could have figured out is revealed in the film's finale and leaves the window open for the third installment in the vastly popular series.  Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Alec Guiness all shine again.  Billy Dee Williams also joins the cast and only adds to the terrific screenplay.  Irvin Kershner does a fine job with his direction.  A very good sequel to say the least.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
360,10,Sci-Fi at its Very Finest,"Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's an impressive sequel that manages to surpass the expectations of its predecessor, this is the standards that every film maker should aim towards when considering a sequel, the first one is fun and introduces the characters in a light hearted manner, but this one further develops them and their universe in a much darker tone. It's definitely the bleakest film in the series, showing the main characters succeed the least, and even the ending isn't particularly joyous, let's just say the title suits the overall tone of the movie perfectly. The cast are still in great form here, in fact several of them have improved between the three year gap of the first movie, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have certainly improved as actors and, overall, they seem much more comfortable in their roles. We are also introduced to some great new characters in this film, such as Lando and Boba Fett, but the one who stands out the most for me is Yoda, one of my favourite characters of the franchise, Frank Oz perfectly portrays the wise and woeful personality of this master Jedi. There are so many noteworthy moments here, whether it be the wise words from Yoda, the battle between Vader and Luke or Han's farewell to Leia, every scene makes me smile, it's a piece of film history that will be remembered for years to come. Terrific performances, a thrilling storyline and special effects that still hold up today, fans of Star Wars and sci-fi in general will not be disappointed by Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back, I would recommend it to all moviegoers. "
361,10,The best movie out of the 3,"Out of the first 3 movies this one is clearly the best. Still dear to my heart to this day. It's fun, exciting, breath taking at times but overall joyful"
362,8,Solid sequel,"I saw ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" in the the theater. I saw the ""Special Edition"" in the theater too. I've seen it many times at home. Every time I watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" I remember how the audience reacted. I remember when they laughed and I remember when they cheered. Few movies can bring be back to the theater experience like this movie. I don't watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as much as I watch the original Star Wars but I still have seen it a bunch of times. It's always an easy watch."
363,9,The sequel that strikes back and was pretty good.,"Directed by Irvin Kershner, The Empire Strikes Back, like the original movie came out with mixed reviews with a difficult production, it's since then became considered one of the greatest film ever made. The film is set three years after the events of Star Wars IV: A New Hope where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has studying the Force under exile Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Mid while, Darth Vader (voice by James Earl Jones), is in pursuit of him and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. When his friends are capture, Luke Skywalker must confront the man that kill his mentor, and save his comrades. This gritty movie was once criticize for its darker tone, and cliffhanger ending, but I love it, it really put all the characters to their limits both physically and emotionally, dealing with deceptive allies and make you want to watch the next movie. That's great filmmaking. Like its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back draw from mythologist Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, directly in it's tales that is taken right off from several mythological like Arthurian, classical Greco-Roman and others. There are similar motifs taken from other films and television shows like 1936's Flash Gordon, 1975's Dersu Uzala, and others worth noticing in the film. The movie even took influence from historic events like Nazism, the Wild West, and Samurai culture. It even dig into world religions. Some people might seeing the teaching of Yoda as boring scenes, but I love them. The movie really makes good on explaining more about what the Force is. The Force remind me of a new age amalgam of various eastern religious and western philosophical sources. A sense of Manichaeism, mixed with elements of Ralph Waldo Emerson's Romantic nature worship, Pantheism and Western-influenced Buddhism. Luke is not as annoying as the previous movie, as the film is mostly about his growth to maturation and self-discovery, but he does have some awful whining in this movie that makes you want to slap his face. Yoda in this movie works with the puppetry. The way Frank Oz performed and voiced him, made this character stand out. Not once, did I think it was a puppet. I would say, this was way better than the CGI Yoda or the puppet from Episode 1, big time! Industrial Light and Magic really pull it off, the action scenes in this film. This movie really make the Hoth Battle look real and intense. Another big prop to them is how great, Cloud City looks. As the technology has improved, Lucas has continued to tinker with the films, adding more creatures and more detail to the backgrounds and even reshooting certain scenes to get them closer to his ideal vision. In my opinion, this is one of the film that didn't get ruin by the 1997's Special Edition with pointless added scenes or badly done 1990's CGI. Glad, they didn't add the bad delete Wampa scenes. The Special Edition in my opinion, honestly, made it better. A good example of this is Cloud City. You really see more of the city than the original. It's beautiful. The 2004 version hurt the film a bit, changing Boba Fett's voice, but at less they add the real Emperor. The music by John Williams is great. I love the Imperial march introduced in The Empire Strikes Back as the theme music for Vader's pursuit of Han and Leia. The march's rhythm is driving and relentless, capturing Vader's own relentless progress through the story. For action, it's not as epic as 1977's Star Wars, but the story is way better than that movie. The love story in this film seem more realistic than the fairy tale love affair in Episode 2. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer) are just amazing in their roles, and give the movie, it's really needed humor. You know that they kinda dislike each other, but slowly they found caring for each other. That's realistic. The love affair had a shade of grey to it. One memorable exchange of dialogue was partially ad-libbed in which the character professed their love with Han Solo given a badass reply. That was amazing! Without spoiling it, the whole cliffhanger about Han Solo was at least in part due to the fact that they were not sure that Harrison Ford would return for a third film. I glad he did. Another thing, good about the writing is that there isn't a lot of dumb things that question logic in this film, like the other films. I did find a few. I don't like the whole Leia kissing Luke thing. It makes no sense even if Episode VI wasn't made at the time. It's still gross. Another one is how Ben Obi Won Kenobi (Alec Guinness) hide the truth from Luke, throughout the film for no good reason. Why!? You would have thought that information would help Luke deeply before heading to Cloud City! It doesn't make any sense. Once again, without spoiling it. During production, there was great secrecy surrounded the truth about Darth Vader & Luke Skywalker's relationship, to the point that most of the crew didn't know about it. I like how George Lucas fought for this movie. To preserve the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas put the screen credits in the end. Even though this is more common now, this was a highly unusual choice at the time as the Writers and Directors Guilds felt that the credits should be shown first. They fined him and attempted to pull the movie out of theaters. Due to the controversy, he left the Guilds, and the Motion Picture Association. He also left 20th Century Fox over controversy when the President Alan Ladd Jr. got fired for helping fund the sequel, which cause Fox to lose Raiders of the Lost Ark's film rights. Overall: George Lucas change movie history with this film and the world is better because of it."
364,10,part 2 is better then part 1,This a great movie. It is better then 1st one. It has a great story line. Great acting. Great special effects. Return of j.e.d.i. is better. But still all the Star wars movie are great. More c.a.n.a.d.i.a.n.s need stop carrying so mush about kids games like hockey. And see more good science fiction movies. This movie is very scary. It has a lot action. See it. It see. It so cool. All the Star wars movies are cool. Great movie. Great movie great movie. One of beast movies ever. J.J Abrams can make a great great great movie or he can make total s.h.i.t. He did a great job star trek. So maybe he can do great job with star wars. Who know he might even make one that is better then return of the j.e.d.i.
365,1,Hard to believe the series survived this terrible movie,"At least the original Star Wars had a story, with a beginning and an end."
366,6,Direction is horrible,Nothin more annoying that Chewbacca's growl over and over and over ...
367,8,I am your father!,Very good and have some cult moments. It have also a new character: master yoda who will help luke skywalker to become a jedi. Still pretty good and its a pretty good adventure movie. I enjoyed it. Have some strong revelation too. Love the movie and i lovee the character of master yoda. A good Star wars.
368,8,Not Better Than The First,"Whilst a lot of people deem this movie superior to ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"" and one of the best sequels ever made. I disagree. "
369,10,How do you top a great movie? Like this.,"While Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) started the ball rolling with a bang, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) takes that explosive start and runs with that momentum in leaps and bounds. I've seen many sequels over the years, Terminator 2, Aliens, RoboCop2, Shrek 2, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings (bare with me on those two since I know they're book series), etc. and yet none of them seem to hit the beats of the development of the characters and plot alongside the action so perfectly balanced. I don't know, my review may seem a little ramble like but it's just one of my all time favorite movies and I'm kind of at a loss of words for how to talk about it professionally."
370,10,"Trumps A New Hope, but both a damn near perfect","As argued by Dante and Randal in Kevin Smith's slacker classic Clerks, the question of whether A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back is the better movie is one of cinema's most popular debates. Episode IV's introduction to George Lucas' world of aliens, droids and intergalactic war struck a chord with audiences back in 1977, and continues to do so today. It is a fun good vs. evil story that only touches upon the spiritual elements of the 'Force' that we now know so well, and on the vastness of the universe it is set within. Personally, I have to agree with Dante's argument that Empire offers a darker and richer experience, which not only develops the series' mythology even further, but paints its characters with far more layers than seen before."
371,10,Conflict in the Shadow of Darkness,"Conflict is never a one-sided affair, where there is great victory for one side comes great tragedy for another. This film is one of my favorite films of all time, it's my favorite ""Star Wars"" film of all time and my favorite sequel of all time."
372,10,A big step forward...,"Sequels are rarely as good as the films that spawned them- but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (thanks to the direction of Irvin Kershner) proves the exception to the rule. Mature and thoughtful in a way the first film never was (though still chock full of the kinds of critters and fx that most fans of the original took to), this first sequel remains the best (by far) to date. For once in this series, the viewer feels s/he's in the hands of a genuine STORYTELLER. While Lucas himself may have written the script, it's Kershner who gives EMPIRE life, whose taut direction lifts what might've been just another also-ran sequel to a much higher plane than the original ever attained. (For every step forward, there is a step backward: the next film in the series would turn out to be the worst of the lot.)"
373,10,for me it was Episode I (screen) (vhs) (dad),"Back to summer 80, this was the 2nd movie our parents took us to watch on a big screen and the next day, i got fever because i had been so impressed by this scary bad robot guy ! But things get better soon because i became a avid player of Kenner SW toys and keep making stories with them up to 1987 In a way, this movie (like the 2 others) has imprint my imagination like no others : it was like i got new cells in my brain or 2 more eyes while this universe was as deep inside me as in a galaxy far away And remember, in the 80s, we didn't have the tapes, books, articles and digital things to go on : so the audience was really left alone with its memories ! "
374,6,GENERATION X NOSTALGIA- FOR KIDS SURE AN 8- For 12 & up Don't watch it.,"If you were born 1965 or earlier....I can't imagine this being more appealing than other TOP late 70s films such as Network, Serpico, Godfather, Rocky etc.....<br /><br />Once in a while as an adult I'll watch it purely for Nostalgia my entire massive collection my mother threw out...my figures, my Milenium Falcon...Luke's Glider....planet of the Clouds ships...my Foot tall Vader & Chewbacca, My Star Wars R2-D2 waste basket etc... and to see how much better it looks than something like Infinity Wars..<br /><br />The father son nonsense...the Jedi Master puppet (total lack of respect Skywalker has for his teachers) this is a Children's basic good vs Evil storyline and that's it. The last one Return..I wish he would have Redone the Return even as a kid Teddy Bear Revolt...Good in you father...Force Force blah blah...very irritating for seeing emperor. If one objectively asks themselves if they were over 12 when these films were released would they LOVE THEM? NO!!!!!<br /><br />And SHOUT OUT TO JJ....SOME EFFORT IN A NEW STORY LINE?! Your first two star treks and last Star-wars you put a slightly different spin and new actors for pre-existing stories....YOU'RE A TOTAL HACK !<br /><br />Outside of simply remarkable Special effects and costume pre-CGI era is mind blowing...it was done so well that the prequels which was relatively early CGI (Disappointing as they were story wise- were not impressive special effects wise except the Significantly faster choreographed Jedi fights)."
375,6,May the rose-tinted glasses be with you,"Not for the life of me do I understand how people think this is better than its predecessor. Yes it has its moments but there is a distinct drop in quality, not least when it comes to the special effects. At times it looks like watching a close up of toy spaceships being moved around on fishing wire."
376,10,empire strikes back,This is one awesome and legendary movie and for me the best star wars franhise
377,10,One of the few movies to set a new standard for sequels.,"Given the enormous popularity that STAR WARS received upon its release in 1977, it seems inevitable that a sequel would be produced. It is usually common for a follow-up to an original to be a let-down, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is not one such example. Directed by Irvin Kirschner, this new chapter in the saga doesn't just live up to its predecessor, it surpasses it--and then some. The storyline takes a darker, more heavy-handed spin as Luke, Han, Leia, and the Rebel Forces find themselves under assault from Darth Vader and the Imperial troops. As the movie progresses, we root for our heroes to prevail--only to find ourselves downcast when we come to the somewhat sad (yet hopeful) conclusion. Yet the movie is all the more magnificent for it."
378,9,"Terrific, again","Terrific, again."
379,10,Simply known as 'The Best',"Best sw movie ever made. period. pacing, character development, its dark theme, shocking twists, and a model for filmmaking"
380,10,One of the best sequels ever,"Unlike so many unplanned sequels to standalone movies that don't know what to do with themselves, Star Wars Episode V pulls ahead like a champ. It does it by taking the existing universe, expanding it in a logical manner, staying with what worked in the previous film yet adding something new and original as well. You can definitely see that they hadn't planned for this film in advance because there's a lot of new stuff. Suddenly we have the character of Yoda, the reveal of Luke's father, the romantic tension between Han and Leia (you can see pretty well in the first film that she was supposed to end up with Luke) and the continuation of the war between the Alliance and the Empire."
381,8,The Best Star Wars Film,"Empire opens with Luke Skywalker pushing back his return to base camp to investigate what he assumes is a meteor that has crashed nearby. We know that it's one of the probe droids Vader has sent to track him down. What happens on his journey to investigate? Is he confronted by Imperial Forces? Does he realize just in time? Actually he's knocked unconscious and taken captive by a horrifying Yeti-like predator to be savagely devoured. Immediately, the tone is set in stark opposition to the movie's predecessor. We're on Hoth, a planet blanketed entirely by snow and ice, routinely pummeled by countless meteorites from a neighboring asteroid belt, but the craters are fleeting as the planet is in a perpetual snow drift. The only native creatures to our knowledge are the tauntaun, camel-like creatures, and the Yeti-like ones. The latter eat the former. This is a clear indication of a film series that's going somewhere, not just playing variations on the same notes."
382,5,"Not only one of the most overrated Star Wars films, but one of the most overrated films of all time period.","Seriously. The Robot Chicken specials are much more entertaining to watch than this ""Star Wars"" film."
383,10,The plot gets deeper!,"After destroying the Death Star, the heroes set off into another adventure where the try to destroy the empire created by the menacing Dart Vader(David Prowse). When Luke Skywalker is on Planet Hoth, it would quite resemble Antartica in a way. The Tauntauns are the fine animals that would endure the harsh cold there. And the Wampas are so fierce they would catch any victim off guard. Luke Jedi instincts paid off against the Wampa. I liked th part where Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) snickers at Han Solo(Harrison Ford) where Princess Leia Organa(Carrie Fisher) tells him off. There were a lot more characters in the movie, too long to list, but I know that in the swamp scene, where Yoda teaches Luke more about the Force. And getting that X-wing fighter jet out of the swamp needed more work. Then there's the battle between Vader and Skywalker. That fight scene would take the storyline further and further to the truth of Anakin Skywalker; Luke's father! This movie has a lot to show, and it's just as fun as the fourth one. Which I thought was the first. Still, I enjoyed this all the way through. 5 Stars!"
384,10,AS Good !!,Is it possible that this is even better than Star Wars: Episode IV? 
385,9,This too alienated fans,Returning to this wonderful film after seeing the collective reaction to The Last Jedi is eye opening. This film's strength lies in subverting the expectations and formula of A New Hope. Much of the film's charm comes from denying fan service. Whether it is the big reveal at the climax or the characterization of Yoda this story goes into much darker territory and as result feels like a much more believable film.
386,8,The force is stronger,"After destroying the death star, the rebel alliance seek refuge on a remote ice planet called Hoth believing that they will be safe from the Empire. However, it doesn't take long for the evil Darth Vader to discover their whereabouts and he soon sets about destroying their civilisation. Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca & C3PO all manage to escape on the Millennium Falcon, but when Luke Skywalker gets a message from Ben Kenobi asking him to seek out the Jedi Knight Yoda (who will offer Luke the necessary guidance and training to defeat Darth Vader) Luke naturally obliges..."
387,,"More aliens, monsters, planets and fantastically darker","Fleeing the evil Empire, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill at his best) travels to Dagobah develop his teachings of the force from Obi-Wan Kenobi by the legendary Jedi master, Yoda. Han Solo is still on the run from Bounty Hunters and him and Luke's friends are captured in order for Lord Vader to have his revenge."
388,10,"If it ain't for this movie, star wars wouldn't be what it is",Literally perfection.
389,10,I know it's a little late but...,"...What can I say? I wasn't even alive when ""The Empire Strikes Back"" came out in 1980; I wouldn't be around for another five years after its release and even then, I still couldn't comment on it like this until I had learned to read and write. But it's 26 years later and we can't change what has already happened. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is considered the best (if not the best) movie sequel of all time and here's why: it just can't be topped; it's that good, it's that awesome. Bigger and bleaker than its 1977 George Lucas-directed predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" this time directed by Irvin Kershner, is an example of a movie sequel done right. It's completely different from the original and does not try to repeat formulas or details or ideas from the predecessor and most importantly, it's just too damned good and much better than ""Star Wars."" Some time after ""Star Wars,"" the Rebel Alliance has retreated to the ice planet Hoth while the Galactic Empire has sent imperial probe droids all over the galaxy and luck out when one reports back data from Hoth. The Empire, now under the command of Darth Vader (played by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), sends effects wizard Phil Tippett's AT-AT walkers to the planet to lay siege to the Rebel base. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) must journey (with unwilling robot ally R2-D2 accompanying him) to the swamp planet Dagobah to begin his training with venerable Jedi master Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). In the meantime, swashbuckling pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is on the verge of leaving the Rebel Alliance behind in favor of repaying his debts to intergalactic gangster Jabba the Hutt but his growing affections for Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) keep him, his ship the Millennium Falcon, and Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) around and in service. After the Rebel base evacuation, Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and droid C-3PO journey to Bespin's Cloud City to reunite with Han's old buddy Lando Calrissian (trilogy newcomer Billy Dee Williams). ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the definition of a fantastic movie sequel. As stated, it's bigger and full of more surprises than the first entry. With more shootouts reminiscent of our favorite westerns, fearsome bounty hunters (including Boba Fett), more Force philosophy and a climatic lightsaber battle (that reveals a secret so big it deserves its own movie), it's everything a proper ""Star Wars"" picture should be. Just don't get too carried away with fantastic fan responses like this one."
390,10,The very best of Star Wars,Many people regard this as the best of Star Wars movies. The details and the story are much more denser than the first installment.
391,10,"More than the Dark Side, A Great Movie","When talking about The Empire Strikes Back many people have commented on how dark it is in comparison to the other two films from the original trilogy. However as was expected by Star Wars fans, Revenge of the Sith without a doubt took the title of Darkest Star Wars movie from Empire's mantle. Given the galactic scale of tragedy in the final prequel, Empire's personal tragedy reveals itself to be a little self-absorbed. In the post-prequel Star Wars paradigm, we should be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the final revelations of Empire."
392,,Awesome!,"New characters (Lando Calrissian, Yoda, Boba Fett, etc.), terrific action and battle scenes, and a coherent story make this film a worthy follow-up to Star Wars. Most of the movie focuses on Luke Skywalker receiving Jedi training from the ultra-cute Yoda. The AT-AT battle scenes are good, and Han Solo steals the Millenium Falcon. "
393,10,"Favourite all time movie, a piece of perfection","I saw this movie in the theater in 1980 multiple times and many times since. It is a great film and tasty ""meat between the sandwich"" sitting in between A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. This film has it all from a battle in the snow with mechanical walking beasts, a trip to a swamp planet to introduce the legendary Jedi master, a beautiful city in the clouds that houses the climatic end to the film. This film is darker and more menacing than the other 2 films including a more evil Darth Vader and introductions to the mysterious Bounty Hunters including Boba Fett. Excellent effects, beautiful locations, top character development and Masterful directing. Go rent it out, you wont be disappointed."
394,8,Not the best Star Wars movie,"You know what the dirty little secret about The Empire Strikes Back is? While many people would claim this is the best Star Wars movie, it really isn'tand it isn't even close."
395,10,This is my very favorite movie!! Bobafett is my favorite character,"I love this movie dearly.  We find out Darth Vader is Luke's father, Han and Leia get together, and Boba Fett makes his appearance.  Let's not forget the wonderful Cloud City, Bespin, is first shown."
396,10,This Sequel Defines High Adventure!,"When I watched this movie, it just grabs you and pulls you in from the first scene and takes you along for the ride in a way few other movies can rival!"
397,6,Formidable 5th entry in the stars wars saga...,"1st watched 7/23/2005 - (Dir-Irvin Kershner): 6 out of 10 Formidable 5th entry in the stars wars saga, keeps the story moving pretty nicely with good character building of the friendships between the main three and add a 4th in Lando Calrissian who can only be somewhat trusted. Introduced are many well-done stop motion animation sequences and Yoda created by the Jim Henson people and the voice being his counterpart, Frank Oz. What this movie does(which was originally the 2nd star wars film) is takes the good formula of the space cowboys epic and gets you to care about the people involved. A nice little love triangle is hinted at between Leia, Han and Luke and the bantering between the stars seems more natural than in the 1st movie. We are also setup for the next entry with a rather hokey ending but nevertheless the movie, for the most part, is fun like the original with slightly different settings, and the same battle between the good side of the force(the rebels) and the dark side(the empire) with Darth Vader taking over greater control and becoming more obsessed with his personal issues(mainly the turning of Luke to the dark side). We know this battle will continue and this movie helps us look forward to this if nothing else."
398,1,The Empire won alright... because their weapon was boredum.,SPOILERS
399,9,Much better than the original,The second instalment of the original trilogy is in my opinion far better than the original film. The original film introduced something brand new to the movie scene back in the 70's but aside from being an instant classic and being very original it had some problems. The characters were very badly drawn up making them nothing more than card board cutt-outs and in the end that felt very unfulfilled. This problem is rectified in Empire Strikes Back. Its very obvious that George Lucas has had more fun writing the characters in the second movie. He begins to give them edge and more depth. The story in the second film is also far more fulfilling than that in the original and the twitch at the end is still one of the most interesting and well-thought-out twitches in movie history.
400,5,Better than episode 4 one.,"After terrible first (4th movie) this comes at a surprise, it has much better action scenes and interesting ending. It's not a spectacular movie, but fun can be had with this one."
401,9,"Best Star Wars sequel, doesn't quite exceed the original","I could watch this many times and re-evaluate Luke Skywalker and Han Solo's character development. But I still think the original is probably the best. It's a debate that anyone who has seen all the Star Wars films could have any time. Even so, I thought this was a mesmerizing that held my attention from start to finish. It's also a great film about building up courage and fortitude for a challenge that lies ahead, specifically Skywalker's storyline in this film. Give me Darth Vader's best scenes in this film, give my Han Solo's best lines and Skywalker's training with Yoda and I'll tell you about a film for the ages. The Empire does strike back. And what a strike it is! Highly recommended"
402,10,The best movie of the series......until further notice,"Until Episode II comes out, this will rank as the best in the series. Not only are we introduced to Yoda, we're introduced to a darker side of the series, a film that doesn't feel like it is a part of the group collective. I think this is why so many fans regard this as the better film. This movie also gave us one of the best sword fights in the history of cinema, culminating in a climax that seemed improbable at first, but quickly made a lot of sense. This was easily Lucas' most witty edition to the series, and it tends to stand up better than most would think."
403,10,How to sequel.,"Empire brings back the Star Wars franchise with a killer sequel that does everything a sequel should do like continuing the ongoing story while having it's own unique plot, expanding on the universe, and introducing new characters."
404,7,Best of three?,"Episode V in the ""Star Wars"" trilogy will always be remembered as the film that introduced a serious plot line to proceedings. After the rebels' success in Episode IV, the Empire chased them throughout the galaxy, finally confronting them on the ice world of Hoth. The group escapes and Luke goes to train as a Jedi under Yoda. Lando Calrissian betrays them to Lord Vader, and the evil master of the dark side has a startling revelation for Luke. Captain Solo is sold to Boba Fett who takes him to Jabba the Hutt. All of this leaves us hanging for Episode VI. Though thick on storyline, and revered by critics, it was probably the least entertaining for the kiddies with its meandering middle and sparse action. The AT-AT Imperial Walkers and the Millennium Falcon's flight through the asteroid field are the definite highlights."
405,9,"Darker, more creative and more balanced than the previous, Irvin Keshner George Lucas and surprise the viewer and further expands the saga","After the resounding success of A New Hope, George Lucas became one of the most admired filmmakers and most successful film industry. As the director got the profits from the previous film, he was brave and put much of the money earned in the 1977 film, the production of The Empire Strikes Back. And here he was able to make an even better job. Amplifying all we had shown earlier and presenting new facts of great importance for the entire series of films in cinema, The Empire Strikes Back, even without a beginning and an end, is regarded by most fans as the best of all movies."
406,,great movie,"""Obi-wan never told you what happened to your father"""
407,10,Just downright one of the most entertaining films ever.,"Stars: Mark Hammil, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Frank Oz (voice and puppeteering), Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels, ALec Guiness and James Earl Jones."
408,10,One of the greatest sequels of all time,"I hold this movie up with the first greatest sequel of all time, The Bride of Frankenstein. Simply a great, and breathtaking movie from the opening battle on Hoth to the great reveal by Vader (which I still won't mention here). The story flows brilliantly and is a more than worth successor, and in some ways is better, that A New Hope. One of the best movies of the 1980's and beyond."
409,10,Astounding,"The Empire Strikes back is the best Star Wars film ever made, it takes all that was great (which is all of it really) about ""A New Hope"" and expanded on that lore and those characters organically, and methodically, Lucas and Kershner giving their blood, sweat and tears to bring to life one of the greatest blockbusters of all time, again. Larger than life battles such as the Hoth invasion and the final lightsaber duel between father and son strike this film home and being bigger and better than the original, with a darker and more brooding villainous plot that leads into the third chapter of the saga, it keeps viewers entertained and captivated. The story beats aren't forced and each character is given time to become fully realized, even side characters like the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who doesn't need a lot of dialogue for us to know his intentions. ""A New Hope"" is us being introduced to the force, while Empire Strikes Back sees us believing in the power of the force, through characters like Yoda and Ben Kenobi, and the all too real Luke who struggles with the belief, we are transported to this galaxy and I definitely don't want to leave any time soon."
410,9,"Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking Nerf herder.","Sound, Art, Music, Special Effects, Costuming - these all make this a film worth revisiting on Blu ray. Even without surround sound, this is a special film to watch and enjoy."
411,7,Great sequel to a great movie.,"The Empire Strikes Back is about the continuing battle between the Rebels and the Empire. All the good guys from the first film return to fight the evil Darth Vader, and this time around, a big secret comes out. This movie probably contains the first great twist in a film."
412,9,Amazing sequel,"While the first Star Wars film was revolutionary and groundbreaking, the second is simply amazing in ever way. This is a fantastic movie."
413,10,Best. Movie. Ever.,"The exciting story. The enthralling places. The captivating characters. The lively sounds. The overwhelming music. Not to mention the dark mood, the brooding feel, and the seriousness of it all -- hand in hand with the often quoted claim that ""these are movies made for children"". It all comes together in a maelstrom of pure movie magic. This is the pinnacle of ""Star Wars"". It goes straight to the heart... and then through it. It's an emotional bomb."
414,9,Takes it all up to the next level.,"A surprise new director at the helm Irvin Kershner, who had previously not directed a really well known film, totally delivered with this incredible (looking) sequel to 'Star Wars'. When I was a teenager, i was gratefully exposed to possibly the finest special effects (for it's time) in cinema history. The advantage of sequels is that all the characters have been previously introduced and so you are straight into the action, on a thrill ride (to outta space and beyond). The musical score was brilliant and most effective, when coupled with an already iconic baddie 'Darth Vader'. The general feeling from the 'Star Wars' faithful, is 'Episode V' is the very best and I totally agree. You can forget the pure crud, they release today under the same banner as 'The Empire Strikes Back' was never, ever bettered."
415,,Yowsah yowsah!,"This is really good, not better or as good as the first one, I might add, but it certainly more than stands up on its own. It is fast moving, better acted(esp. by Hamill/Fisher) and tautly edited. We get to see as much of Vader as we ever need to, and he is brought off brilliantly. Love the Cloud city, the Asteroid fight/flight/chase, the snow battle. You can see that they went for a real edge of the seat type of pacing here, and it works to the films betterment. Overall, very good."
416,10,The greatest cliffhanger ending film of all time!!!,"Very few films before 1980's Empire Strikes Back had a cliffhanger leaving room for a plot-ending sequel, but this one changed all that. Most people who saw Star Wars A New Hope thought that Darth Vader was Luke's foe, but when Empire came out, near the very end of the film, Darth Vader revealed his true identity to Luke by saying these immortal words...""I Am Your Father."" To add insult to injury, Luke's right hand gets cut off by his dad's light-saber and Han Solo gets carbonated!!! Once Jedi opened 3 years later, everything was solved and they lived happily ever after. The End. Out of all the Star Wars movies that have came out, this one is the best."
417,10,Retrospective Review,***Spoiler Warning***
418,10,Probably the finest of all sequels.,"The Empire Strikes Back is more than just a sequel to one of the most successful movies ever made; it redefined what a sequel could be. You could take a pre-existing story, expand upon it greatly and STILL make it a well-rounded and debatably self-contained movie. Empire reprises the stars of the original Star Wars movie and makes them all shine; Mark Hamill is great as a self-doubting yet well-meaning hero, Harrison Ford again gives a great take on cinema's most loveable scoundrel Han Solo, and the late Carrie Fisher gives Princess Leia a post-Alien sci-fi feminist makeover in that she's no longer anyone's damsel, but her own strong-hearted woman."
419,10,Star Wars is A Cinematic King! Empire is Cinema Gold!,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it. I still love it now. Star Wars was such a massive ground-breaker for 1977, that it was barely conceivable a film this masterful would be able to live up to its predecessor at all. Luke Skywalker came back and learned a terrible truth about his family, Han Solo was more badass than ever, Leia kicked stormtrooper butt, and Yoda appeared for the first time on screen! Empire Strikes Back has classic scene after classic scene jammed into its perfectly structured story."
420,,The Dark Side,"This film relies more on characterization than the original did.  For the first time we see Luke as he deals with his demons, especially the fact that we do get the shock that Vader tells him that he is his father.  We also see the beginnings of Leia's and Han's love affair.  The only thing that brought it down for me was the rather dark turn the series took with this film. However, this was part of a saga and like many before it, it had to have some down spots in it.  However, that aside, it is a worthy sequel to the original."
421,9,Best Star Wars film in the series,Rated PG for Violence.
422,10,"Easily the greatest of the ""Star Wars"" saga...","This is probably the greatest sequel to ever come out of Hollywood. Continuing the story of the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire, this film takes place a few years after the destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader hunts for the hidden Rebels while Luke is given the task to continue his Jedi training under the guide of Yoda. This film takes a darker, more mature path than its predecessor."
423,10,The Empire Strikes Back (1980),"Directed by Irvin Kershner. Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, David Prowse, Julian Glover, Kenneth Colley, Alec Guinness, (voice) James Earl Jones. (PG)"
424,7,Old,The reason why this movie is all that overrated is because it was made in 80s
425,10,"The franchise at its highest, film at its highest. Perfect and flawless.","This is my second favorite movie of all time and I have seen many many movies in my life. If most scenes don't leave you with your jaw dropped, then you've watched Empire wrong. Han Solo kills it, Darth Vader Kills it, Yoda kills it, John Williams kills it, and much more! While it can be a lot to stomach and handle, nothing is richer and more satisfying. There is nothing like the ""I am your father.."" twist, the asteroid field chase, Yoda's lessons, Luke's and Vader's development, and the Hoth battle. Who needs a happy ending if it's a movie like this??"
426,10,The Best of the Original Star Wars Trilogy,The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the original Star Wars Trilogy. The sets were even better than the Star Wars sets. This movie had great action and even some humor. I think this movie has the best Lightsaber duel ever. I also like the music. This movie won an Oscar for Best Sound. This movie has more character development than the other Star Wars films. The special effects are even better than the first one. I think this is Darth Vader's most sinister role of any of the other Star Wars movies. Secrets will be unfolded. I think Irvin Kershner did a great job directing this one. This is the order of the original Star Wars Trilogy: 1. The Empire Strikes Back 2. Star Wars 3. Return of the Jedi. This is the best acted of all of the Star Wars movies.
427,9,The best film in the series,"With ""The Empire Strikes Back"" George Lucas & company delivered the next chapter in the hugely popular ""Star Wars"" saga. Picking up where the first film left off, the rebels are on the run from the Empire, who've stepped up their efforts to stamp out the uprising once and for all. Meanwhile, Luke seeks to learn the ways of the Force in preparation for his showdown with Darth Vader."
428,8,Empirical Satirical,"A better movie than its predecessor (and successors) in every way  acting, story, direction, set design, writing, and a vastly more mature interrelationship between the love triangle of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and C-3PO (I know what you're thinking, what about the triangle of Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo and Chewbacca?) "
429,7,"Overrated, but a good film, especially the first time.","Empire is an entertaining film and a terrific setup for the finale. The battle and setup at Hoth is entertaining. The exchanges between Han and Lea are entertaining. The droids are quite funny in this one, but don't belittle the drama. The development of Darth Vader and the Empire is vicious and well placed. The end a real cliff hanger and a surprise the first time through."
430,8,Somewhat disappointing sequel to Star Wars classic,"Sequel to Star Wars starts out hot, becomes talky and loses steam in plot entanglements.  Was it really necessary for Darth Vader to be Luke's father to make this work?  Does that make Alec Guinness a liar (heaven forbid) in Star Wars, when he describes Luke's father?  Is there any reason to make a movie of this ""magnitude"" and expect your viewers to wait two years to find out what happens?  At that point, do we care what happens?  No, yes, no, and not as much as we did before."
431,,The Epic Adventure Continues,Return of the Jedi is my favourite Star Wars film. The Empire Strikes Back is my second favourite and Star Wars is my third favourite although they are all brilliant films.
432,8,Awesome.,Nothing to say. Just... i love Star Wars.<br /><br />That's enough.
433,,Secrets and suspense,"Filled with secrets and suspense, The Empire Strikes Back is worthy sequel to the 1977 classic. Good special effects, great music and story and a excellent lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader."
434,10,The greatest episode so far.,"Cinematic nirvana. The best of the three. Splendiferous, awesome, and majestic on every level. This film has unfairly been stigmatized as ""the sequel to Star Wars"" or ""part of the trilogy"" instead of being judged on its own merits. Can be considered perfect pulp, as well as the ultimate children's storybook or a space opera of the highest order. Its brilliant elements: Boba Fett, the freezing of Han Solo, the Imperial Walkers, John William's soaring score, the asteroid field, and the miraculous Yoda. This was indeed a blockbuster, and did help usher in the still-current malaise of ""weekend box office"" mega-movies, yet it is in fact one of the greatest films ever made, and should be thoughtfully considered a true work of art."
435,10,"Chilling, the best of the bunch so far!","Empire is a soap opera.  It is a season finale that leaves you hanging for three years until the next one comes out ( fortunately for us that was 19 years ago and they are all out on video now ). And it is one of those movies that does something wonderful, it makes you feel something.  It grabs a hold of your emotions and twists your insides like a pretzel.  I rented this movie last night because just recently my own copy of it was stolen.  And let me tell you, the film still left me exhilarated, exhausted, full of hope, excited and yearning to watch Return of the Jedi so I can see how Han gets rescued and I so badly wanted to see Luke and Darth square off in that final battle.  But the one thing that this movie does perhaps like no movie has ever done is makes your heart stop."
436,,Ian Mcdiarmid added to DVD version of Empire Strikes Back,"Out with Clive Revile and in with Ian McDiarmid. George Lucas has once again retouched this movie, but with little fanfare this time. In the new Star Wars Trilogy DVD 3 pack, (episodes 4,5, and 6) The scene with Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine has been redone. Clive Revile has been entirely cut out, and an improved holographic projection of Ian has been added along with expanded dialog. And I have to say this is probably the only scene George added to the original trilogy that actually made the movie better. But I think George could take a lesson from the great painting artists, the painting always looks the best when incomplete, otherwise it has no ability to stimulate our imagination."
437,10,The best in the triolgy and the best star wars flick ever made,"TEMSB has to be one of the greatest sequels ever made. The action, special effects are all better, the storyline is much darker and the pacing is great. I remember going to see this movie back in Januray of 1997 and loving it. I got the feeling you're supposed to get when you see a Star Wars flick, excitement. I just wish they would release it on DVD."
438,10,"Matches the original, though good for different reasons","The Empire Strikes Back is the first sequel to Star Wars (1977), a thrilling and lively action/adventure movie, but Empire is actually a different kind of movie. It's darker, more thoughtful and slower. There's less action."
439,7,"Better than ""Star Wars""","I just have one thing to say: What an improvement from ""Star Wars""!! A word of advice to George Lucas; he should stay away from writing scripts and directing movies. Obviously, there are other people who can realize his ideas much better than the man himself. Other than that, you can read my comment on ""Star Wars"" because apart from this one being better than the first film I feel pretty much the same thing about the two films."
440,8,The Empire Strikes Back,"Really high stakes and setting that aged very well. Better acting and action scenes this time, too."
441,8,Star Wars continues in this one of a kind sequel.,This is the 5th Episode of Star Wars. It has a more dark twist than the previous one. It introduces some new faces and other planets.
442,,An example of how much better Star Wars can be when Lucas takes his hands off the reins...,"With Episode IV raking in so much money that George Lucas was really becoming a law unto himself in the world of film, there was almost nothing to stop him from doing exactly what he wanted with the next episode. Only the limitations of technology stood in the way of him making shots work exactly as he wanted, and they only took another couple of decades to be removed."
443,3,Luke sky walker the idiot,"When I watched this movie as a kid I loved it. However now that I've gotten older I'm realizing that it's a pretty bad movie. The movie is mainly a bunch of drama and pointless scenarios. I know that back in the 80's violence on t.v. wasn't really the normal thing, but it seriously lacks. "
444,10,My Favorite Movie of All time-The Gamechanger Of The Sequel Genre,"Watched my favorite Movie of All time Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back which in My But also The Greatest Movie of All time. The Cast Was Stellar With Mark Hamill(Corvette Summer) as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford(Indiana Jones and The Raiders Of The Lost Ark) as Han Solo ,The Lovely Carrie Fisher() as Leia Organa, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca, Jeremy Bulloch(The Spy Who Loved Me) & Temura Morrison(Spartacus) as Boba Fett, Billy Dee Williams(Colt .45 ) as Lando Calrrission, Anthony Daniels (Bashki's Lord Of The Rings) as C-3PO, Kenny Baker(Willow) as R2- D2 ,Denis Lawson as Wedge Antilles,Bruce Boa(Superman:The Movie) as General Rieekan ,Michael Sheard(The Hiding Place) as Admiral Ozzel, Julian Glover(Anthony and Cleopatra) as General Veers , Kenneth Colley (Life Of Brian) as Admiral Piett ,Frank Oz(The Blues Brothers) as Yoda, , David Prowse(A Clockwork Orange) & James Earl Jones(Root) as Darth Vader ,Ian McDiarmid(Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) as Emporer Palpatine/Darth Sidious and Sir Alec Guinness(Lawrence Of Arabia) as Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi."
445,10,The very best STAR WARS there is.,"My Take: Bigger and surprisingly deeper, this visual fest still stands as the finest offering under the label of STAR WARS. "
446,10,It's very unlikely that there will ever be a Star Wars film as good as this one.,"I recently watched the original Star Wars trilogy (1977-1983) in order to see how good these films really are. I already pointed out that I won't be seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi in a theater because Star Wars: The Force Awakens really disappointed me. The Force Awakens is perhaps the most shallow, uninspired piece of filmmaking that I've ever seen in my life. Actually, recently, I got a lot of enjoyment out of reading user reviews of The Force Awakens on IMDb. Almost all the popular reviews on IMDb gave this film a rating of one out of a possible ten stars. On the other hand, almost all paid film critics praised The Force Awakens when it was released. As some people pointed out, this shows that film critics working for popular newspapers and websites can't be trusted. They praised The Force Awakens because they were paid by Walt Disney Studios or because they were pressured. There is a word in the English language that describes this situation. It's corruption. What's interesting is that Disney has been pressuring movie theaters into showing The Last Jedi in all the largest auditoriums when the film will be released. In other words, it seems that Disney wants to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible with the release of The Last Jedi. Make of this what you will. Possibly, The Last Jedi is a disappointing film, just like The Force Awakens. Therefore, Disney wants to make as much money as possible before negative reviews by honest film critics begin appearing on the internet. I'm sure that The Last Jedi will be showered with overwhelming praise by paid film critics upon release, just like the awful The Force Awakens was. I'm not saying that The Last Jedi will be just as bad as The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson probably managed to make a better film than The Force Awakens. But it's possible, maybe probable, that The Last Jedi will also turn out to be a disappointment and a cash grab."
447,10,Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin',"Luke studies under Yoda, fights Vader and learns the big horrible family secret (don't you just hate skeletons in the closet?). Han Solo & Princess Leia fall in love when not exchanging red hot love/hate barbs. And we also meet the man who previously owned the Millenium Falcon, Lando Calrissian."
448,9,The Saga continues...,"with this masterpiece of the Star Wars saga, which in my opinion is the best part of the whole series. I always thought that way and I guess that will never change. Of course I got some criticism, but it is basically the same I have for Episode IV and that would be that the special effects seem not as good as they once did, which is basically due to the enormous change and improvement on the special effects department. Besides that though I do not have any criticism on this film. As with the other Episode I also am talking about the Special Edition here and I must say that Lucas has done some good improvement with this Episode as well. There were a bunch of altered or added effects, like explosions and a few scenes in the city in the clouds, but the part that was altered best, I think, was the one in the beginning involving the creature in the snow. There were really some good scenes integrated here, which all looked very real. Maybe besides the fact that there was just a little blood when Luke gave the creature that stroke with the saber. That might be another criticism of this film. I mean there is quite a bit of lightsaber action in which someone is hit (three scenes) and it just appears that there is almost no blood lost. This might be regarded as a bit unreal by some people, but I was satisfied with that, for I am used of it since I was just a little kid and I think it was much better than the stuff that happened for instance in Indiana Jones (which I saw when I was about 11 or so) . For those scenes at the end of the first Indiana Jones really gave me the creeps when I watched that film for the first time and I had quite a couple of nightmares afterward. Whereas nothing of that kind happened after I had seen any of the thee old' episodes of the Star Wars Saga about a year earlier."
449,10,The Most Spectacular Outer Space Fantasy Ever Made,"Although ""Star Wars"" set a new, spectacularly high standard for movie effects & action, it was also a remake that featured a cast of unknowns & semi-retired character actors. Even with a big budget and built-in audience, it would have been easy to make a second-rate follow-up or even a dud bad enough to kill the franchise. Leigh Brackett's clever script, Irvin Kerschner's directorial craft, George Lucas's unprecedented production values & the energy & intensity of the cast allowed ""The Empire Strikes Back"" to set a standard for outer-space adventure that has never been equaled. Lucas's first original ""Star Wars"" story emphasizes the series's two great strengths: fantastic action & the wily, wicked Galactic Empire. After their hidden base is found & destroyed, the Rebel Alliance flees in disarray, with Solo (Ford), Princess Leia (Fisher), Chewbacca & the droids hotly pursued in the damaged Millennium Falcon by an Imperial fleet. Luke (Hamill) vanishes into a jungle planet to find Jedi mentor Yoda & complete his training. Story flaws, including the fact that Luke's training takes place in the same amount of time as the Millennium Falcon's pursuit & the introduction of important characters near the end of the film, are unnoticeable unless you're looking for them. The action starts early & never lets up, with the battle of the ice planet alone more than enough for any action film. But there's plenty more where that came from, with the amazing flight through the asteroid field & the lightsaber duel in the cloud city standing out. Ford makes the most of his opportunity of developing Solo as a charming ""scoundrel,"" with Fisher game as his reluctant love interest. Hamill, who isn't really leading-man material, is sufficiently believable as the peasant hero growing into an elite warrior. The New Age, Oriental ""Force"" (rarely called a ""religion"") gets more prominence in ""Empire"" but never bogs down into hokiness or boredom. All these elements combine to give the film a never-failing theme of harried heroes hounded by an evil force that is so vast, powerful & diabolically clever that the viewer is moved almost, but not quite, to despair--exactly where Kerschner wants us. This is outer-space fantasy, not science fiction, so don't look for any science. And despite ""The Force"" as a plot device, there's no point in looking too deeply for Heavy Themes or Subtle Meanings. In fact, subtlety of any kind was pretty much killed off by this and other Lucas & Spielberg films. All you get with ""Empire"" is a couple of hours of straightforward, nonstop, matchless thrills without condescension or manipulation that you can enjoy again & again without ever getting tired of it."
450,8,The Empire's New Clothes Strike Back,"The second in the initial run of Star Wars movies, and I must insist that their extreme popularity has always alluded me."
451,8,On even par with it's predecessor.,"We cared about the characters,and we were compelled by their story enough to go back and see what was going to happen next.We were not disappointed.It equaled the thrills of the original(Episode IV if you will).We once again felt the thrills of traveling through space at insane speeds.We laughed at the comic relief of C3PO and R2D2.We are at first angry with Lando when he betrays his friends,but the anger switches to Darth Vader,making us hate him even more,when we realize that Lando had no choice in the matter.We cheer,yet are concerned,when Luke has his showdown with Vader,and are taken aback at what we learn at the end of the fight.This film,much like it's predecessor,did all that it was supposed to do,for us,the moviegoers,emotionally,placing it on even par with the previous film.In short,it's good,not only as a sequel,but as an individual film,as well.Thumbs up."
452,7,Disappointing for Star Wars,"In the second movie in the Star Wars trilogy, Darth Vader continues to hunt down the rebellion base."
453,10,Simply the best!,"For me, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is the best film ever made. It has everything to offer, intriguing story and dialogue (i.e. Leia finally admits her love for Han Solo saying ""I love you!"" and Han Solo replies simply ""I know"" - a classic dialogue interaction, as well as the classic line, ""No Luke, I am your Father""), superb music (by my favorite composer John Williams - the Imperial March is unforgettable, even more so than the original Star Wars Main Theme composition), proper pacing as the story paces along (this can be attributed to a number of factors but I think the editing really takes the kudos), the best acting in the series (Star Wars isn't known for its superb acting but in this case, I really did enjoy the character interactions between Han and Leia, and I even bought the puppet performance of Yoda - in some sense, just as good as the CGI Gollum in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers). This is the must see Star Wars film and in general, the best film of all time!"
454,3,This is #17? Just shows how much this voting really means...,"The 17th best film of all time?  Maybe if you're 13.  This is a nice little adventure story, and quite frankly, if you think this is a great film, your nerd is showing."
455,10,"Characters come into their own. Story develops masterfully. Action-packed! Best Sequel? Heck, best movie?",Han Solo and Luke Skywalker become the most famous space-frontiersmen of all-time.
456,9,Best of the Originals,"The Empire Strikes Back was the rare movie sequel to match or even surpass its predecessor in terms of story, entertainment, and even revenue. Like millions worldwide, this remains my favorite of not only the original trilogy but the entire saga. Whenever I see it in the tv listings I can easily enjoy watching it again."
457,9,Darkness of an empire strikes at the heart of fallen rebellion,It's a dark time for the rebellion. After a devastating attack on their ice base on the frozen planet of hoth. The rebels are scattered by imperial pursuit. The Luke skywalker seeks out the mysterious Jedi master yoda in the swamps of dagobah. While the han solo and leia of outrun the imperial Fleet to the magnificent cloud city of bespin. In attempt to convert luke to the dark side the evil darth varder lures young skywalker into a trap in the midst of a fierce lightsaber duel with the sith Lord Luke has to face a terrible truth about his family legacy in episode v.
458,8,40th Anniversary,"This film made such an impression on a ten year old boy that I, watching it forty years later for just the second time, still know the details of the story, characters and scenes by heart."
459,10,Enormous Progression from A New Hope; This Is the Melancholic Act 2.,"The grace, the sophistication, the darkness, the comedy, the baldness and the psychology of George Lucas' epic saga Act 2, the Empire Strikes Back is truly, truly phenomenal; this is a sequel of the highest order, coming close second to Coppola's Godfather Part 2."
460,10,STAR WARS Saga continues..................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"STAR WARS:Empire strikes back,The second installment in original trilogy and i must say it is best in the series and perhaps greatest sci-fi flicks ever made . Irvin Kershner and George Lucas comes together to make this iconic film which is shot beautifully,even though it was made nearly 35 years ago the visuals still hold up and will for ages to come.More than visuals it is the depth of the story that makes this a masterpiece."
461,9,Nothing to add.. simply timeless!,"The storyline, the characters, the scenes, the scenarios and places used to shoot, the plot.. it was al great."
462,10,Still the best,"Still the best of the series, Empire is a dark atmospheric movie with so much going for it. The characters we knew to love in the first movie have more dimensions now and newcomers add to the mix. And of course that ending..."
463,10,Sequels this good don't come often...,"The original Star Wars was a spectacular movie.When you watch it,you are hooked from beginning to end.Star Wars didn't drag.It is an amazing film to look at too,the aliens,droids,and the fantastic planets.Doing a sequel would not be an easy task.Watching Empire Strikes Back you get the same experience while watching Star Wars,maybe even more so.All though Star Wars is a without a doubt a great film,it had some flaws,mainly in the character development/dialogue areas.Empire Strikes Back soars in these areas.You didn't really know much about Darth Vader in the original Star Wars,except he was a former Jedi who became a Sith lord,and helped start the Galatic Empire.Empire Strikes Back gives him an all new edge,he is eviler,angrier,and obsessed with finding Luke Skywalker.Luke earlier in the film has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi,his slain Jedi Master from the original Star Wars,telling him to seek out Yoda on the Dagobah system to complete his Jedi training.Luke does so after Imperial forces drive out the Rebels from their base on the Hoth system.Han Solo has grown more from Star Wars as well.He isn't the tough guy he used to be.He is softer and is falling madly in love with Princess Leia.The character of Han is given much more character development,he is maturing from the Smuggler he once was.He is afraid of being chased around the galaxy by the Empire,and Jabba the Hutt's bounty hunters but he knows he must do what is right.Han,Leia,C-3PO,and Chewie are being chased by The Empire most of the film.Vader knows Luke loves his friends,and that they are his weakness,if he finds them,and tortures them Luke will do his bidding.Luke learns The Force from Yoda on the swamp planet of Dagobah.Yoda is an interesting character.We all know he is a rubber puppet but for most of the time is very life like and you forget about it,because the character works so well.Another benefit of the Yoda character is that we learn much more about the concept of The Force from him,the concept hasn't really been fully explained but you get the basic idea.Luke is getting pesky he wants to become a Jedi and grows tired of Yoda's methods of training.Yoda explains that a Jedi doesn't want excitement,and that they must be patient.He also tells Luke that the Jedi aren't Warriors.Through a vision of the Future,Luke senses what could happen to his friends by Vader's hand.He rushes to save them abandoning his Jedi training.Han meets with Lando Calarissan,an old friend of his,on Bespin for a place to hide.The Empire is there waiting for Han,they turn him over to the Bounty Hunter,Boba Fett.Han is put into Carbon Freeze.Just when you think anything couldn't possibly be worse,Luke arrives to save his friends,falling directly into Vader's trap.Luke arms himself with his lightsaber and challenges Vader to a duel.The Duel in the original was badly done,partially because of Alec Guiness' age at the time.The duel between Vader and Luke is so much better because it is darker and thrilling.The battle lasts very long but eventually Luke is defeated after Vader chops off his fighting hand.And this is when possibly one of the most memorable lines in film history is said.Vader asks Luke if Obi-Wan ever told him what happened to his father,Luke replies in a rageful voice,he told me you killed him,Vader replies No Luke I am your Father.I would have loved to been alive in 1980 to see Empire Strikes Back,and the reaction to that line."
464,10,One of the greatest films ever made,"Star Wars: Episode V is perhaps the greatest achievement in sc-fi ever. The practical effects are done beautifully and still looks good to this day. The writing is some of the best of all time, and the twist is enough to make M. Night Shamalan blush. The actors are amazing and everything just flows so smoothly."
465,8,Best film!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."
466,9,Ah Darth I am in love with you!,"I was 13 years old, 3 years have passed since Episode IV The New Hope. After initial scare, I have recovered. I was explained that it is all make belief, and Darth Vader was not going to come and eat me for breakfast. I started expecting Episode V with great eagerness. What was it all going to be about? In our little Star Wars club in Sarajevo we obtained information that Episodes I, II and III will be made in a long distance future, and we obtained some short synopsis of what they were all going to be."
467,8,The more known from the trilogy 8/10,"It seems like in every trilogy of films, there is always one who shines more than the others. In the original trilogy of ""star wars"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the one who shines most then the others. I personally don't know why, maybe it's because of a particular scene in the film? (No, I am your father). Or maybe because it shows that the heroes not always win and suffer a lot? Or maybe because of the charming look of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams)? Whatever it is, you can't ignore that this film is one of ""Star wars"" top films and perfect installments of all time."
468,10,Has it all,Excitment. Romance. Adventure. Humility. Betrayal. Love. Defeat. Hope. Humor. Friendship. This film has it all!
469,10,"Easily one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time, as well as one of the greatest sequels of all-time.","Sequel to the 1977 smash hit follows Luke Skywalker (Hamill) training to be a Jedi from the lovable new character Yoda (Oz), while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones), who himself has a life-changing secret. More epic and easily one-ups ""A New Hope"", not just with effects and designs, but also story; with all the characters becoming much more three dimensional, plus the introduction of numerous new character that add spice to the overall series. Easily one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time, as well as one of the greatest sequels of all-time."
470,10,The Evolution & Expansion of Star Wars,"Arguably the best film from the original trilogy (and entire Star Wars saga), The Empire Strikes Back strikes a more mature tone than it's predecessor; still fantastical and exploring a labyrinth of imagination that you could get lost in, but delving deeper into the mysticism of the force and division between good and evil."
471,9,"Better than Black Panther, RIP Jar Jar","Better than Black Panther, But Knack is back so i cant give it a perfect score. My favorite part is the pod racing scene and i cried when Lego Yoda™ killed off jar jar, overall i give Peppa Pig, Infinity War a 9/10"
472,10,You killed the prequels No I am the prequels,One of the best movies ever made every movie wants to be as memorable as Empire Strikes back and only only a few have come close even people who haven't seen the movie have seen it parodied.
473,10,One of the most breathtaking and exciting films of all time,"Straight up, this movie is just so enjoyable to watch. I couldn't tell you the amount of quotable moments or movie influence this film has had at the time of its release. The characters, as if they weren't good enough already, are thrown into completely different scenarios to what they were presented with in 'A New Hope', and it's because of that, we as the audience only grow to love them more. Han Solo's character in this film has changed significantly from the last film, and we are now presented with this half rebel, half scoundrel character that is trying to become a better person and leave his life of smuggling behind, only for him to be chased by the galactic empire across the galaxy alongside Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO. Luke skywalker begins training to become a Jedi, but still has this reckless trait about him that ultimately leads to his defeat in an impulsive and deadly duel against Darth Vader, who reveals to Luke in one of the most memorable parts of the movie that he is Luke's father. Combined with breathtaking special effects and immersive storytelling, this film has risen to become one of the most influential films of all time, inspiring captivating and exciting storytelling and giving birth to the modern cliffhanger ending that many blockbuster films utilise to this very day. It is without any doubt, that Star Wars episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, is an iconic piece of cinema that continues to be treasured and adored by many, and a film many would agree to be one of the greatest of all time."
474,9,The next STAR WARS chapter improves over the previous one.,"The very first STAR WARS movie changed the way we looked at motion pictures, and this second feature is a BIG significant improvement. It is the best in the trilogy, hands down. Regardless of watching another mega-classic, I'm not going to write up a skyscraper-high comment for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK because this only makes one-third of the legendary saga."
475,,Best of Stars Wars Trilogy,"More complex approach into the realm of good and evil than Episode four. Empire Strikes Back(1980) is filled with a machine of emotions that lead its characters and main plot.  Emotions and feelings of Luke, Han, and Leia are developed to the point where they are multi-dimensional as people.  Yoda gives Luke Skywalker tests which are based on emotions that can lead him either on the good or the dark side."
476,10,One of the best sequels of all time,"Whenever one of the few good movie sequels comes out, it is (rightfully) held in comparison to this sequel to Star Wars (1977). Not only is it one of, or maybe even the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies of all time."
477,8,Zooming Through Those Asteroid Belts,"Episode 5, or the middle one of the first (now second?) trilogy of the Star Wars saga, has a great rep these days. It wasn't met with the same delight when it first came out in 1980 and I still don't believe it's quite as good as the original Star Wars (or episode 4-A New Hope). Somehow, despite a much larger budget, the epic scope and fabulous feel of a new universe (a new galaxy far away) is not quite there with this entry. Maybe you can accomplish such a feeling only once. The rebels and heroes flit from the icy world of Hoth through an asteroid belt and end up in the cloud city of Bespin, but it strikes me as a very small, enclosed universe here. I also noted some overacting on the part of the main characters during the first sequence on Hoth, especially from Ford and Fisher - or maybe their lines were just poorly written. The easygoing charm of the first film was gone; yes, this episode was meant to be darker, more somber by comparison. But that doesn't mean the characters need to be awkward, rough shadows of their previous incarnations."
478,10,Best of the original trilogy,"Out of the original Star Wars movies(Episodes IV,V,VI) this is by far the best of them. George Lucas had more of a hands off approach with this movie then he did with A New Hope. The movie has a much darker tone to it then ANH or Return of the Jedi were."
479,9,Love It!!,Since this movie has been out like forever and there are over zillion of review on this I will keep my review to the minimum I could and try to review it as the person that watch this movie in the 21st century.
480,8,Star wars episode 5 the empire strikes back,Darth Vader is adamant about turning Luke Skywalker to the dark side. Master Yoda trains Luke to become a Jedi Knight while his friends try to fend off the Imperial fleet
481,10,Better Than Episode IV - A New Hope,"It really isn't often that you see a sequel that you like more than the original, but I feel pretty comfortable saying that I liked ""Empire Strikes Back"" more than ""A New Hope""."
482,,Very important in trilogy and well-done,I love this part very much because of the Lando and a twist in Solo's destiny.<br /><br />And there is Yoda here!<br /><br />And I love the last minute of screenplay when they are standing and watching out of the window. This is the shot that I always remember when I think of them.
483,10,The Best of the Star Wars films!!!,"Empire Strikes back is incredible. Mark Hamill is amazing as Luke Skywalker as he was once again like before. ""I am your father!"" Darth Vader was better than ever in this equipped sci-fi flick full of brilliant visual effects for a 1980 film. This might be the best of the 80's, well maybe tied with Scarface or well maybe even tied with Return of the Jedi. The action was actually very cool and impressive too and Han Solo again is hilarious with his pal Chewbacca. Carrie Fisher was pretty hott in that one dress. Yoda, which is one of my favorite characters is cool and long live to the brave and powerful Jedi. This is definitely a recommend film. Rent it or buy it!!"
484,9,Set the bar extremely high in regards to what a sequel should look like.,Most of the famous characteristics that are associated with the franchise were established in this film. It has a faster pace than the first (as in first that was made) film. Vader wants to try to recruit Luke Skywalker to the dark side. We are also introduced to Yoda in this one. Every scene is a classic part of cinema history.
485,8,Holds Up the Best of the Whole Saga,"As a kid I was raised on Star Wars, all six of them. I loved each one, but this one stood out as being one of the worst of the bunch. I have no idea why, but watching it now it's easily the best. "
486,10,A Thrill Ride!,"The darker version of the trilogy as three years has passed since the original box-office smash; it was in February of 1997 where I watched the movie in its new edition and suddenly I was like the people who saw the film in 1980 where the sequel was better than ever. Though George Lucas became in charge of the production, he is not directing this film or the other sequel (Return of the Jedi) as Irvin Krishern (Robocop 2) takes over Lucas's desire in a way fans have never dreamed of."
487,,"""Wars not make one great.""","The best of the Star Wars films and the most mature. Lucas was greatly aided by the writing of Lawrence Kasdan and the direction of Irvin Kershner.  The characters have grown and so has the story.  The tone is darker and more exciting; and, even though this has a cliff-hanger ending, the main elements are resolved by the end."
488,8,"Much like its predecessor, Episode V is epic and excellent technically, with more clear character and plot arcs","The Empire Strikes Back has the same grand feel of A New Hope, but brings a bit more consistency in the arc of the story. While A New Hope was exceptional for its world building and ambition in throwing us into this fascinating world. The Empire Strikes Back is more measured and has a clear primary focus on Luke's growth vs. Vader's determination to capture him, with Han and Leia's rebellion goals and relationship as secondary pieces. The plot felt a bit jumbled in A New Hope, particularly due to the abrupt shift in focus from rescuing Leia to destroying the Death Star, which was a sloppy transition. Here, we have a much more consistent plot culminating in a climax that is fitting and is likely the biggest moment of the series. I would dispute the notion that it's an all-time great twist - while it's absolutely surprising and impactful, the greatest twists add deeper layers and comprehension to prior events. We didn't know Vader well enough for the reveal to really click anything into place or imply anything deeper about either of them, aside from explaining how Luke is strong with the force. There's some minor silliness as always (really? they just made him a new hand?) but I think the plot is effective and exciting."
489,9,The best of the saga!! The Yoda's philosophy.,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" shall be the greatest highlight in all the STAR WARS' collection,from the cold and frozen planet Hoth(What a contradiction to name!)the rebel cause faces the new imperial attack, to see Hamill's face in the first scene:scared and looked too old for only 3 years in difference respect the first one,he crashed his car a few time ago,then the fatal consequences can be noted at all."
490,9,Continue the story of its predecessor.,"The sequel of a masterpiece classic, is hard to top its predecessor but somehow it manage to did that. With better plot and story, the story progession and more characters insight. This sequel is no doubt the best in the trilogy."
491,10,My All Time Favorite Movie!,"I've always been a huge Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I was always invested in the world and the characters and the story. I can definitely say as a Star Wars fan this is the best movie of the franchise. Darth Vader is as memorable as ever, including that dramatic jaw dropping moment when he tells Luke he is his father, leading it to be one of cinema's most memorable moments and probably my favorite movie moment! The movie opens up with the planet Hoth and an assault on the rebels, marking yet another marvel of cinema. This movie is my favorite because it's got the most memorable quotes, characters from Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker to the introduction of Yoda and Lando, and incredible cinematic moments that are still remembered and awed at to this very day!"
492,9,Movie Review Profits,Play Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!
493,10,The grandaddy of them all!,The most beloved of all the SW movies. Has incredible action sequences and also moves the story along very nicely. Some of the key moments have become legendary and are truly emotional. From the incredible awe-inspiring opening battle on Hoth to the scenes in and around of Cloud City it's just wonderful!
494,9,Best of the trilogy,"I know you're probably tired of reading comments like this all the time, but it's true for me.  Admittedly, I'm kind of slanted towards this one, since this is one of my early childhood moviegoing memories, since my mom took my brothers and I to a really big theater in New Jersey to see it.  This film explores the central characters deeper without sacrificing thrills and excitement, and while it's a more obvious set-up for the next movie than the first one was, it's still got a good climax scene that allows you to take away something good.  Ford and Fisher are able to create something together too, and Mark Hamill comes off better than in either the first or third ones.  In the book I read on the STAR WARS movies, it said Lucas liked this least of all, but I think he's wrong."
495,1,"THE worst star wars movie EVER, The Last Jedi is still the best by far :/ this had no plot","The characters are the only thing that saved this film, different to the last film THE LAST JEDI which brings us the heart, emotions, epicity, of what star wars truly is, which is smarter, more complex and have not as flaws as this film had, people just repeat what others say, cant believe that this piece of trash had more positive reviews that a masterpiece like the last jedi is, that makes me lose faith in humanity sometimes, its like, u have to give easy, basic and dumb scripts to people, cause if u give them something mystique, magical, epic, complex, like the last jedi, they don't understand it and hate it with no arguments, here in this film, the sound effects almost made me vomit, the plot... well... it had no plot, so it was extremely boring, as the only real fan of star wars, my rating is honest and should be considered as the most important vote."
496,10,"""Do or do not. There is no try.""","With the stage set in A New Hope, and with a cast of fresh likable characters in a vast galaxy, The Empire Strikes Back provides a follow-up that many consider to be the best Star Wars film in the franchise. The film definitely pumps up the stakes as the Rebels are driven away in a massive battle, before the characters become hunted, and ultimately entangled in a web of treachery. This film will probably always be memorable for its big reveal towards the end though; an epic twist of fate that undoubtedly surprised everybody back in 1981. Overall, this film is darker than its predecessor, much more serious than any of the other films, and has a certain theatrical flair that could supersede every other film in the series."
497,7,7 - Good,"For my rather lukewarm reaction to the original Star Wars, I was told that I should see The Empire Strikes Back before writing off the series. And it's certainly an improvement. I like it. One of the best films of all time? No. I don't think this sequel has made the series any more intelligent, well-written or well-acted. But it has amplified everything that the first movie did to 11. Better effects, better costumes, better pacing, some interesting air battles, the addition of the legendary Yoda and the iconic revelation about Darth Vader and Luke. Building off the first film, I did feel a little more invested in the characters than before. Overall, a good entertaining fantasy film."
498,5,I couldn't get myself to be interested in the story,"This movie was a bit disappointing considered that I liked A New Hope, however this sequel had a different tone to it and the story was just not intriguing for me. I found it a bit ridiculous how Ben was speaking to Luke even though he is dead, and he tells him to go to Yoda who I thought was a bit weird and I didn't like him. Around halfway into the movie I wanted it to end because I was just waiting for the story to get better, but it didn't."
499,10,A classic which breathes perfection,"Star Wars: Episode V-The Empire Strikes Back is just a film that shows how a Sci-Fi should be done but also, how to create a movie that is perfection. With so much so good about this there isn't much stuff wrong with it and criticism does not come easy. It is well acted, comedic but also ultimately reaches extreme new emotions for a film series and a sequel that really touches whatever you already knew about film. Overall I felt it was a masterpiece, and here below is why. "
500,10,The Greatest Fantasy of All Time,"Note: this review is based on the 2019 version of the film available on Disney+. There have been many different versions of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released through the decades, and the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy is infamous in the fact that the original theatrical versions of the films are not widely available to the public. With this in mind, I believe that denoting which version of the film that I am watching to write this review should be taken into account. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the least altered of the original movies, with only a few very minor shots, special effects, and continuity changes made to the movie. It is commonly believed that this is because George Lucas had the least amount of involvement in the production of this one. I honestly don't mind any of the changes made to the second film at all: the continuity changes help bring the movie in line with other films in the franchise, and the updated special effects at Cloud City are nowhere near as jarring and annoying as the changes to Mos Eisley in the first movie, or Jabba's Palace in ""Return of the Jedi."" That all being said, I would still prefer the option from Disney to watch whichever version of the movies that I want to watch. A special release similar to the ""Blade Runner"" box set would be nice."
501,9,excellent,"After reading countless reviews about these Star Wars DVD's over the past few months here on Amazon from some who are taking this issue way too seriously to others who just don't seem to have a clue as to what some words mean, I finally feel compelled enough to write a review of my own."
502,,really great,"WOW, this movie is good. It was as good as the first. The special effects were really cool. The characters were cool. I love it when Darth Vador and Luke fighting at the end. This is a classic movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Star Wars, or a really good classic movie."
503,,A good sequel..,"Everything about this sequel was just better in every category compared to the last flim. The story was well written and was executed nicely.The pacing of this movie was good it had a slow start but a great finish. Great acting, dialogue, chereography. and good CGI. Luke's development in this flim was amazing to see and the dynamic between Han and Leia was nicely written also."
504,7,Decently interesting,"It is surprisingly better than I thought. It was action packed, keeping you on your toes throughout the film. However, it was just that. Nothing really stood out to me and simply said, it was just not very emotional. Perhaps this can also be attributed to the fact that even before watching this film, I already know about the spoilers given that I'm watching this so many years after the very famous plot twist occurred. Even so, I must say that there were some instances which I felt were very well done. For example, C3PO's cooks and witty comments help to bring a little laughter and charm into this otherwise bleak and sad film."
505,10,"Best Star Wars film ever, tense, action filled",ESB provides all the drama I assume that star wars provided across the board but never achieves if ESB didn't exist then just maybe Star wars won't be the iconic series that it is today.
506,10,The best!! Better than ANH and my most favorite.,"A New Hope was great but this one takes the cake and not only do I think this film took the trilogy to the next level, but felt it did and more. For one thing ESB is more exciting and darker than ANH with the best direction, best writing, best special effects, best musical score by the legendary John Williams, best story and best action and I can see why Star Wars fans and the general public agree. And the special edition with the added bells and whistles already gives it a more shiner coat of paint made even more delicious on digital widescreen. A more satisfying film that stands out as the best in terms of plot and character development and a fine example that in some cases a sequel can truly outshine the original."
507,10,This part proves why the Star Wars series can last forever,"This part proves why the Star Wars series can last forever. Lucas did not only show the most advanced special effects technology at the time, but also not only built a complex galaxy world, but really did it. Everything that an epic movie deserves: the most classic elements of playfulness, rejoicing against the enemy, father and son rebellion, master-student grudge are cleverly blended together, even if the technology is outdated, but still retains the true soul of the space opera"
508,10,"The Empire Strikes Back, With a Vengeance!","The Empire Strikes Back is my least favourite of the original trilogy, I guess I just prefer the more light-hearted nature of A New Hope and Return of the Jedi (plus when has darkness become a measure of quality?), as well as the sense of closure given by those films but calling it my least favourite is like saying this pizza with 19 slices of pepperoni is it not as good as this pizza with 20 slices of pepperoni. It's appropriate that the second part of the three-act story is the dark entry so the more light-hearted third act can act as a release from the darkness and despair."
509,10,the best film in the trilogy.,This is a little bit darker than the first one and it´s a little bit better.this is one of the best action/adventures ever made.I have watch this movie many times and it´s still as good as when you watch it the first time.
510,10,How to make a good Star Wars movie,"Everything flows, and works well.<br /><br />From the storytelling, character development, to the fight sequences. This movie is simply a masterpiece, and a fine example on how a good movie is made. The creators at the time understood what works, and what does not work. The pacing is right; the characters are true to the Star Wars universe."
511,10,"A great movie, and one of the best sequels ever","Yeah, if you're one of the like five people in the entire world who still hasn't bothered to watch the Star Wars Saga, then just do it, Right Now. If you only want to watch one to see if the series is as good as people say, then watch this one. It does help to watch Episode IV first, but this can be viewed on it's own."
512,10,Star Wars lives! Vote for me!,"VOTE USCWANNABE My name is Tom Costabile and I am currently the lead runner up in the Presidency contest at Hyperspace.com, known on that site as USCWANNABE. I have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that I can't win this with just friends and family...I'm going to need the help of the millions of fans Star Wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so I've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency. "
513,9,Second best in the saga,"With as much magic and inspiration as ""Star Wars"", the sequel continues the wonderful saga. With the same effort, the same fascinating characters and the same fantastic vision, it's hard to fail. This one is even better than episode IV, but feels very much like a wait for episode VI, the very best in the saga. Still - it's inspiring, enlightening and entertaining to watch...over and over again."
514,9,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (DIDIER BECU),"It's rather rare that a sequel is better than the original but with this one it's definitely the case and certainly most of all, this was the best one of all them. Why? Dunno why but the majority of the film is build around the evil of Darth Vader and his empire (more than once you will think of Third Reich-resemblances). The story itself is rather thin (in fact there is none as it feels like you're watching some episode, the movie doesn't even has an ending) but all the characters that made Star Wars such an immortal saga are back, and how... If you only watch a limit amount of movies in your life this one must be included..."
515,10,I'll give this a perfect 10/10,"I gave this a 10/10. Even today Empire holds up super well. I can rewatch it time and time again and enjoy its action, dialogue, and cinematography all the same."
516,6,Not as good as the first,I don't know what people see in this movie but it is seriously not as good as the first. It is still a good movie though. A good story with a good plot twist.
517,10,Best of the original Trilogy...,"It is 3 years after Episode IV and the Rebels are on the run from the Empire. Luke Skywalker explores his Jedi heritage only to be confronted with disturbing truths, Darth Vader continues his quest tom punish the Rebels, and Han and Leia are on the run. The galaxy has become a much darker, more dangerous place."
518,7,Huge improvement from New Hope,"It's far from perfect but still this is a huge improvement from the first part. The pacing is good, the acting is better. Leia is actually beautiful in this. The training of Luke was better.<br /><br />The greatest improvement was the lightsaber fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. I enjoyed this more than the first part."
519,10,"The Adventure Continues, In The Empire Strikes Back","Several years after the Battle of Yavin, Luke ( Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia ( Carrie Fisher) are back. Their friendship has grown stronger for one another; especially Leia and Han's. The Rebellion have found and formed a rebel base on the ice planet of Hoth. It seems to be going well, until an Imperial Probe Droid is dispatched out to the planet. It locates the rebel base, sends the report to Vader( James Earl Jones). Once the findings are complete the droid automatically self-destructs. The Battle of Hoth begins, with the successful flight of the first transport off of Hoth. Leia is reluctant to leave until Han says she has to go, he successfully gets her aboard the Falcon just in time. The fighting continues, but eventually dwindles down. The rebels tell Luke they will see him eventually at the rendezvous.<br /><br />Luke has other plans he and R2( Kenny Davis) set a new course for the Degobah System. Once there Luke will track down Yoda( Frank Oz ) to begin his Jedi Training. Meanwhile, Han, Leia, Chewbacca( Peter Mayhew ), and C-3PO( Anthony Daniels )are having trouble trying to escape the Imperials. The Star Destroyer Avenger is right on their tail, along with a ton of TIE fighters right into an asteroid field. Han is slick he fly's through the field like a pro. He realizes he must find one that he can land on for awhile. As soon as he can, he moves close to this huge asteroid. It seems like they have found a safe place to lie low. The Millennium Falcon has taken a lot of hits and is in need of repairs soon. Han and Leia at times seem to be at each others throats, but deep down they strongly have feelings for one another.<br /><br />On the Star Destroyer Avenger, The Emperor Palpatine( Ian McDiarmid), makes contact with Vader. He warns him of their new enemy, Luke Skywalker. Vader believes if he could be turned to the dark side he would be a powerful ally, a great asset. Luke's training on Dagobah is tough and sometimes turbulent. Yoda gives him advice, but Luke sometimes fails to listen. This is particularly noticeable when his X-Wing sinks deeper into the swamp and his failure through the cave. He is angry, feels hopeless, until Yoda talks to him more about the Force. Yoda proves his might by helping get Luke's X-Wing free, using his Jedi skills.<br /><br />Han and Leia still stuck on the Asteroid, discover a terrifying fact. They are not on the asteroid, but inside a worm creature that dwells in the rock. They are able to get back on board and fly out just in time. As soon as they are free, they are met with enemy fire from TIE fighters and The Star Destroyer Avenger. Han turns the Falcon around, makes a bluff and proceeds into attack mode. Captain Needa( Michael Culver) on board the Avenger is shocked. The Falcon is there one second then gone. Upon seeing this , he realizes he has make a fatal error; and must report to Vader. The Falcon has docked aboard The Avenger until they can fly away undetected to a safe place. Han tells Leia the way they will escape is when the Avenger dumps it's trash, then we will float away undetected along with the rest of the trash. In the meantime they must search for a safe port to land, in The Onenid system. They find Bespin, which is home to Cloud City. Han is familiar with it's administrator, Lando Calrissian ( Billy Dee Williams). Inside The Avenger, Darth Vader employs a few bounty hunters to find the Falcon. A substantial reward await the one who finds it. Among them is Boba Fett ( Jeremy Bulloch). He is the Mandorolian, who vows to make good on Vader's promise. When the trash is released, The Falcon detaches; and heads for Cloud City, not realizing Boba Fett is behind them, in Slave 1.<br /><br />Luke's is now training successfully, but it is suddenly interrupted when he sees visions of the future. He tells Yoda he must go and save them, but Yoda demands he must stay and complete his training. Luke promises he will return, and fly's off.<br /><br />Once The Falcon arrives in Bespin Air space, the four are met with numerous Cloud City pod cars. They are authorizing them for a landing permit which they don't have. It gets a little uneasy, but finally they get permission to land. They are instructed to land on Platform A, I believe. Once they get out of the Falcon there is no one there to greet them-strange. This makes Leia very uneasy, and Han gets upset with her. A few minutes pass, finally Lando along with his trusted aide Lobot( Jack Hollis ) arrive. At first, it looks like it could be an angry reunion, but Lando welcomes them, especially Leia. While in Cloud City Han and Lando catch up on old times, Han tells Lando the Falcon needs repairs. Leia senses something is wrong especially when 3PO goes missing. When Han and Leia are alone waiting for Lando, she tells Han something just isn't right. When Chewy comes in he is carring C-3PO, he's been blown into parts. Leia hopes Chewy can fix him fast.<br /><br />Lando comes in notices the droid and says something, but he wanted Han and Leia to join him in a refreshment first. Once they arrive to dine, the door opens up. There is Vader, Fett, and stromtroopers and they surround them. Lando said he had no choice but to turn them in, Lando was offered a deal to fix his own problems."
520,9,Darth Vader's greatest role,"This is Darth Vader's movie.  We find out why he is the number 2 man(?) in the galaxy.  He's ruthless, insightful, powerful, ambitious, and devious. Most importantly, we find out why he is so evil--he wants to take over the galaxy!  His ambitions are no different than the rebel's, except he wants to be emperor.  He doesn't care about Han, Laeia, Chewbacca, or the rebels--they are just pawns in his ambitious game to depose the emperor.  Of course in episode VI, we find out where his true sympathies lie."
521,1,Grossly overrated,"This film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this ""film"" from almost every quarter – from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The ""Force"" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of ""new hope"". And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects."
522,,Bleak and atmospheric sequel (spoilers),"Sandwiched between the exceptional ""Star Wars"" and the comparatively so-so ""Return of the Jedi"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is widely considered to be the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.  The film has it's one or two flaws, but it does develop the story and characters in surprisingly dark ways.  This has to be the bleakest and most nihilistic ""Star Wars"" film so far."
523,10,Can't get much better,"What else can you say then that the Empire Stikes Back is part of one of the greatest trilogies every made. Being the second film in the old trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back works in a much darker way then the original Star Wars. The film starts out with our heroes on Hoth, an icy planet, while the empire chases after the Rebels. After an awesome land battle and a rebel defeat, Luke flees to seek help from a Jedi Master and Han and Leia are chased by Darth Vader in an asteroid field."
524,10,The best Star Wars sequel,"I can understand that many fans love this film, but for me it's the second-best of the Star Wars films (with A New Hope as number one in my opinion) and it's one of the best sequels. I praise this film as having the best soundtrack and the best battle sequences. Plus we get some new faces in new and exotic locations. And that revelation (you'll see what I mean). From what I heard, this was the least successful film of the saga but it's still good as the secondary film. And that lightsaber duel between the main hero and the main villain. I recommend watching A New Hope first just to see how everything starts, then watching this. I should warn you, it gets a little dark, but it's nothing too scary."
525,10,"Dark, gritty, and depressing-- and it couldn't be much better","We do not need to mention Luke's bout of horrific acting in the Cloud City lightsaber battle. Somewhere, it has been dealt with accordingly. The fact of the matter is, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is even better than its predecessor-- and by a country mile. Instead of wasting time with pointless exposition (title crawl excepted, of course), the film starts right in with two of the main stories-- Vader's pursuit of Luke and the Rebel forces going on the run after an astoundingly impressive battle scene between heavily armored walkers and the hopelessly out-gunned Alliance. Luke learns the way of the Jedi from Yoda, a wise, green, raspy alien who looks like the child of Kermit and Miss Piggy (which makes sense, considering Miss Piggy was also voiced by Frank Oz)."
526,10,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - I Am Your Father!,"The fifth (or second) installment of the highly successful ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really took me along for the ride. Set three years after the original, the Galactic Empire, in the clutches of Darth Vader, are still in pursuit of tracking down Luke Skywalker and his small band of friends, including Han Solo and Princess Leia. When Luke tries to learn the Force from Jedi Master Yoda, and his friends are captured by Vader, he must decide whether to complete his training to become a Jedi master, or confront Vader to save his friends. Wow, what a movie. As a big fan of the original, I'm an even bigger fan of ""Empire Strikes Back"". This movie blew me away with everything new. The characters are still memorable, the visual effects are still awesome, the environment is breathtaking, the story just got better, and the character of Yoda was just plain awesome. But my favorite part in the whole movie was the final confrontation between Luke and Vader, and the climatic ending, that's better to be left unspoiled, is one of the greatest endings ever seen in a movie. Also, this movie was actually very dark, due to containing some graphic moments of blood, killings, and even torture. I was just thinking the same exact thing: ""awesome""! I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and I was blown away by how better the series gets. This is the most darkest, thrilling, and jaw-dropping movie of the whole series so far. Again, this is so far, my favorite Star Wars movie in the series. ""The Empire Strikes Back"", in my review, ""an entertaining spectacle, truly an excellent masterpiece""."
527,10,"One of the best movies ,period!","Empire Strikes Back is no doubt one of the best movies in history. Just everything in here was better of the previous installment. Action, suspense, fights, romance( very easy to became a dumb romantic- comedy, but not in here my friends) and it has, if not the best ,one of the best plot twist at the end no spoilers, but you know for what I am writing about. If I could give it 11 /10 ,I would but ,that it might created problem in the IMDb system ,so 10/ 10 is good enough. It is said that like the New Hope, the production of the Empire had a ton of issues, for example Carry Fisher was high on cocaine during all of the shootings of the movie and the majority of the crew was not in more clear state of mind ,if you know what I mean. Fortunately the Force was strong and the movie was excellent, which by itself that fact considering the production problems is a miracle. I love this flick and as a very picky person ( not in food anyway) I want the best possible and here I got it, I highly recommended it for watching immediately. May the Force be with you!"
528,8,Do or do not - there is no try,Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**
529,10,I Agree with you all: Empire RULES!!!,"Having read most of the comments herein, I must agree that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best movie from the original Trilogy. The acting, effects, story and most noticeably, the music, surpass far and away the original (and that is saying a lot!!!). Though it's obvious ""Empire"" would not be the classic it is were not for the first STAR WARS, it still manages to stand high on its own. As a music lover, I must say the the original ""Empire"" Soundtrack has to be John Willimas BEST musical score EVER. The ominous ""Imperial March"" (also known as Darth Vader's theme) was SO strong, that its motif has appeared in ALL subsequent films, including ""The Phantom Menace"". Same goes for the love theme of Han and Leia, Yoda's theme, and the list goes on. On the acting side, Harrison Ford's acting on this one was his most mature performance out of all STAR WARS movies. His performance on ""Return of the Jedi"" looked watered down compared to this one. Same goes for Carrie Fisher's performance. In ""Return"" she looks tamed and subdued, a far cry from the bossy, devil-may-care attitude of the first one and ""Empire"". And Mark Hammil's acting on this one was his most solid and convincing. It's weird that ""Empire"" worked so well, since most of director Irving Keshner's movies are always a bit contrived. He also did ""Robocop 2"", but that was a mess (thanx in part to the plotless script and last minute re-writes). ""Empire"" is a movie that I saw when I was 12 years old, and to this date, it still amazes me. Let's hope that George Lucas comes to his senses and do the new trilogy justice with the upcoming ""Episode II""."
530,4,Boring mess,"Lame, garish, gimmicky, unedifying, meandering, unexciting, forced, completely and utterly unentertaining."
531,9,A little experience,This is generally counted as the fifth in the entire series. Imagination is still amazing.
532,3,Overrated,"I decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about. I was rather embarrassed by the fact that I had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics. Instead of the masterpiece I was promised however , I was left with a great mediocrity. The characters were barely 2 dimensional , the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy . Episode V was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isn't close to being good. I don't know if it's a case of a movie aging very badly but I can't for the life of me understand the allure of it. To each their own , I guess."
533,10,"The definition of the word ""unmissable""","This movie is probably the reason why so many people devoted their lives to worshiping the saga George Lucas had started three years earlier. Here the adventure continues, but with a twist - after having the basic characters thrown in the first one, here we get a souping-up, and everything and every one is multiplied by 100. The result is the best movie in the Star Wars saga. Here we have some rawness typical of A New Hope, and we still don't have the excesses of Return of the Jedi. The result is a brutally touching movie, where its characters are the main theme and not the battles or the special effects. Magnificent work by everyone involved, the movie is a triumph, and one of the best movies ever. John Williams also suceeds to beat his own work, and present us with a richly crafted score."
534,7,"The film's reputation is clearly justified, although it's not a masterpiece either",In this Episode V the prologue has much more logic. It's a good context for the beginning of the film and not an omission of a sequence that cannot be allowed.
535,10,Better than the first?,"The Empire Strikes Back does not suffer from 'middle film syndrome'. It greatly enhances the Star Wars universe. Luke Skywalker's (Hamill) adventures take us to the ice planet Hoth, where the Rebels are hiding from the Imperials. They're eventually rooted out by Darth Vader and his army. Luke, Leia (Fisher) and Han (Ford) and the droids make their escape, the former heading to Dagobah for Jedi training, whilst the others seek help from an old friend. TESB is full of blistering action; the battle of Hoth, with the AT-AT walkers and Luke's first Jedi experiences making the back of the neck tingle. A now heightened romance between Han and Leia plays out to stunning effect. New characters are introduced, but only a few so that Empire never detracts from the main trio. Then there's the twist. If you don't know about it then you should, otherwise start watching Star Wars now. There's no need to be a fan of science fiction, just excellent entertainment."
536,4,Live Comic Book for Sci-Fi Lovers Only,"A good live COMIC BOOK SCI-FI film as opposed to a good film.  Lots of special effects, costumes, aliens, sophomoric dialog and cardboard acting. Great, daring film in its time.  Great film for sci-fi lovers who will watch anything sci-fi because it had a tremendous budget and didn't skimp on production values."
537,10,"Well, I Said Great For The Original Star Wars, And I Am Going To Say Perfect For This One. Perfect. (SPOILERS)",SPOILERS
538,9,The best film sequel and the best Star Wars film as well!,"Yes this is the best that I believe Star Wars has to offer and this has to be the best movie sequel ever made as well, improving whereto original had already knocked it out of the park. "
539,9,The Empire Strikes Back,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980) has gone on to become not only a Star Wars fan favorite, but also one of The few sequels in film history to equal or surpass The original (godfather ii, The dark knight, etc.)."
540,10,The best sequel ever,"This film is great, I think it's the best sequel ever. Firstly, the plot is awesome, it has the greatest plot twist in cinema's history. Some moments are very funny, but some of them make you cry. Secondly, yhe cast is amazing, but my favourite is Harisson Ford. I really likeiky Master Yoda, he is so cute in old trilogy. Thirdly, the action and visual effects look outstanding, but they are made without computer technology."
541,10,An unmitigated masterpiece,CONTAINS SPOILERS
542,10,The greatest movie of all time.,"I love this film with all of my heart.  The power of the story telling, and the visuals are both awesome.  Every shot is beautifully put together, and I cant help but get swept away with the story.  The climactic ending is superb, giving the film a very dark tone.  The superb direction, and the fantastic star wars universe combined make this an absolute classic, and even the original looks slightly paled in comparison.  If you haven't seen this film already, do so!"
543,8,Holds up better than A New Hope,POSITIVES:
544,10,The best movie ever made,"To say this movie is overrated is just wrong. Not just in the sense of being incorrect. It's morally wrong to speak ill of this movie. This is more important than Picasso's work, or Da Vinci's or any other great artist. And to critique this film in any measure is perhaps the greatest display of a lack of self-awareness that a person is capable of. Who are we to question any aspect of the definitive masterpiece of all of human existence? Every technology breakthrough-from fire or the wheel, all the way to the computer or the internet-is merely a means to this end. If there were an asteroid aimed at annihilating all of human history, and we could only save one cultural artifact, it had dang well better be this movie. It represents the high point of human achievement. It is so mind bogglingly good that George Lucas should probably be etched in stone as his own version of Mt. Rushmore. His impact for good on the world through this movie is frankly incalculable. No human being will ever live on this planet without having been positively affected by it."
545,6,Nostalgia!,"The only reason this film has such high marks is because people have grown up on 'Star Wars'. A simple story and impressive special effects for its time seems to have had an amazing impact in its day (which is long before mine) but should in hindsight be seen in a new light. It is no coincidence that the new Star Wars films receive such low marks (even though much of the acting and special effects are better) because they can't live up to those old childhood memories. Lucas wasn't even that original, given that Star Trek (and many other science fiction films) came before this. The Star Wars films pass for their special effects and level of entertainment but are clearly over-hyped and definitely overrated.."
546,10,A incredible masterpiece.,Nearly everything about this film is perfect. I mean come on.
547,10,Clearly the best of all 4!,"This one is the best of all 4 movies and probably all 6 when the rest are released, but yet it made the least amount of money at the box office. Go figure! "
548,10,Quite possibly the best all around film in history,"'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' is a phenomenal film. Breathtaking, action packed, and heartfelt. It is the best film in the saga, and without a doubt one of the greatest films you'll ever watch."
549,8,This is the pinnacle of all Star Wars.,"This is the pinnacle of all Star Wars. The only SW film which is truly great, at least in my opinion. Let's first talk about the story. Certainly the film started off on a wrong foot as it was very much 'A New Hope' once again, but then it pretty quickly changed tone and went into a completely different territory."
550,8,I Have Rated This Film Using The STAR TREK Rating Scale: It's TNG (8),I Have Rated This Film Using The STAR TREK Rating Scale:
551,6,Sequel to the first famous movie,"Somehow this second movie in the series feels better. Less of a messy movie, but more of an adventure sci-fi with new characters both the master of Darth Vader and Yoda are seen in this movie which has a bit more of a Lord of the Rings and Labyrinth (David Bowie) kinda feelings."
552,10,"Just as good as ""A New Hope""","After I watched Episode IV, I had high hopes for this movie and thankfully it did not disappoint me at all. The very first scene once again got me into the movie with Luke Skywalker patrolling the Hoth base. Immediately, we are thrown into mystery and suspense. Slowly, Lucas reveals certain things and Luke is attacked. "
553,10,"If you thought Star Wars was a tough act to follow, spare a thought for Richard Marquand.","It's hard to think of Empire as merely a film.To me,it represents more than that.In a way,i wish i could watch it again through new eyes and experience it without knowing the next piece of dialogue seconds before it's uttered.When you think this way about a film,it means you love it more than you ought to.This is true of mine and Empire Strikes Backs relationship.I saw it as a child and all the deep and meaningful stuff was lost on me but i recognised that i was sad when Han was taken away. Years later,the power of the film hit me and made me understand that, not only was this film amazing to look at,it covered almost every base technically. Looking at the Star Wars 'franchise' (hate that word) as it stands now, this is the film that made the life and longevity of the thing possible. Empire is truly the best of the Star Wars films and a strong contender for best sequel ever made. It's a film about relationships and growing and learning who you are. It's about finding your place in the world/galaxy and understanding how your impulses,as strong as they are sometimes, are not always the path to progression and betterment. I understand Empires power now, it's a film that teaches if you let it. Its also an amazing spectacle of the imagination that furthers something that was already brilliant and groundbreaking. If you thought Star Wars was a tough act to follow, spare a thought for Richard Marquand, director of Return Of The Jedi."
554,10,Best Sci-fi movie of all time!!!,"Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back is a fast paced and action packed movie that delivers on all levels. It has emotion, a great love triangle, action, amazing visual effects and phenomenal dialogue and acting."
555,8,An epic continuation of the Star Wars saga,"The first time I watched STAR WARS, the immortal words ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" were not there on the screen. I cannot recall when it was that I first saw those words and realized that STAR WARS was but one chapter of a much larger whole."
556,10,The force remains strong with 'Empire',"""The Empire Strikes Back"" brings back the original characters -- Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader (who's really Luke's father), R2D2 and C-3PO --from ""Star Wars.""   The character development is much stronger than in the original ""Star Wars.""  We're introduced to Yoda, who helps Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) continue his Jedi training, even though the Emperor Palpatine insists that Luke ""must not become a Jedi."" Romance develops between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).  Darth Vader (David Prowse) reveals his true identity to Luke while engaging in a duel with sabers. The special effects are even better. The ""Special Edition"" is just as good, but the  story does not change.  The ending leaves a few questions in mind that get answered in ""Return of the Jedi.""  My evaluation: **** out of ****."
557,9,Film Poetry,"When George Lucas was asked which was the worst Star Wars film, he responded with 'The Empire Strikes Back', one of the only original films from the saga that he did not direct. Episode 5 was proven to not be the worst episode and instead, was rather flattered by the critics, gaining 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.7/10 on IMDb. The ensemble cast is carried over from The first film released 3 years before Episode 5, 'A New Hope' and produces a thrilling encounter of the Rebellion' resurrection. It is evident that the titles are almost back and forth for the Rebellion's sake, whenever a title is in their favour, the next Episode pushes them back. It has been 3 years since the destruction of the Death Star and the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, has set up a new base on the ice planet Hoth, a desolate, low-temperature, snow-blizzard land. The Imperial fleet, led by merciless Darth Vader, hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching probe droids across the Galaxy. Luke Skywalker, struggling to control himself in the cold, is captured by a wampa while investigating one such probe. He finds himself tied up, hanging from above in a dark cage, the newly named Jedi is able to escape by using the Force and his lightsaber. Before Luke succumbs to hypothermia, the Force spirit of his deceased mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and keeps him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead Tauntaun mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning. Luke as clearly matured in the three years he has been present in the Rebellion, and he see his character develop throughout. Being more independent, wiser and learning to take matters into his own hands, moulding into the Jedi that Obi Wan formerly was. The probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebel's location . The Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers to capture the base, it was admitted that scenes featuring the large walkers took the longest to film, reasoning their slow and lethargic movements. The Rebels manage to evacuate, Han and Leia escape with C-3PO and Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon, but the ship's hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amidst the tensions, the pair seem to attract quite easily to one another. Several Bounty Hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the the Falcon. Meanwhile, Luke travels with R2-D2 in his X-Wing to Dagobah where he crash-lands in the middle of an eerie swamp. The X-Wing used by Luke is named AA-59 and is a T-65B model. The star fighter is armoured with 4 laser cannons, 2 proton torpedo launchers and 6 proton torpedoes (crucial in the act of destroying the Death Star), weighing 110kg its class 1 hyperdrive rating allows it to be extremely flexible, fitting into narrow spaces. Luke meets with a diminutive creature whilst first plays with young Skywalker, joking around him and confusing him with his distinctive speech. He later reveals himself as Yoda, who reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice after conferring with Obi Wan's spirit. We visualise for the first time, the wise Jedi legend Yoda, who appears unique in his aspects. His small frame supports him as a Jedi, with his low space tee of gravity proving for good balance. His wrinkled face is deceiving to the Sith at first, but inside him is a ruthless nature. His wisdom of the Force is beyond any other Jedi, his experience manifests this. The character itself is a puppet, performed by Frank Oz who also supplies his voice, Oz is also the puppeteer behind the famous Miss Piggy, from 'The Muppets'. Luke learns more about the force from Yoda, who lifts his X-Wing out of the swamp using the power of the Force. After evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet Bespin, which is governed by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Bounty Hunter Boba Fett, son of Jango, tracks the Falcon and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Boba is similar to Jango apart from his improved suit design, he aims to continue his father's legacy as a Bounty Hunter, and has a personal hatred toward the Jedi, following Jango's decapitation from Mace Windu. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the dark side of the Force. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain, Yoda explains to him the importance of patience and that learning the ways of the Force takes time to master, against his and Obi Wan's wishes, Luke abandons his training to rescue them. Vader intends to hold Luke in suspended animation by imprisoning him in carbonate, selecting Han to be frozen as trial experiment, this, much to Chewbacca's discontent, taking his anger out on Lando. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from Jabba the Hutt. The term Bounty Hunter originates from South Africa, coming from the search for HMS Bounty, the famous ship captained by William Bligh that mutinies in April 1789. This could infer to Boba Fett's armour, embodying the traditional South African colours of green and yellow. Lando, still loyal to Han, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. Under attack from numerous stormtroopers, they fight their way back to the Falcon and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a tense lightsaber duel that leads them to the city's central air shaft, Vader appearing more defensive than offensive. Vader severs Luke's right arm, significant as the same happened to Anakin when in combat with Dooku. After Darth Vader disarms the young Jedi, he tempts him to embrace his anger and join the Dark side of the Force. Luke reiterates Obi Wan's telling, accusing the Sith Lord of murdering his father, metaphorically speaking that is true. Vader reveals that he is Luke's father, in 'four words' best known to the film. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, hanging from an antenna. In a mixture of mental states, he reaches out telepathically to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewy to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by TIE fighters towards Vader on his Star Destroyer and finds out that the Falcon's hyperdrive has been tampered with, but the confident, intelligent droid R2-D2 reactivates it, allowing them to escape. Luke rejoins the Rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a robotic prosthesis, just like his father's previously. Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other Rebels watch in unison as the Falcon departs. Episode 5 sees the first confrontation of Luke and his father, Darth Vader and makes for an exciting next chapter to how he, being the only accessible Jedi left, will go about defeating the evil Sith Lord. Leia and Han's relationship expands in the screenplay, but of course is cut short due to Vader's experiment involving the pilot. This situation isn't resolved in the film and supplies a strong costarring base for the next chapter. An incredibly directed film, shows the Rebel alliance growing stronger and replacing the former 'Republic', allowing it to compete with the Galactic Empire. Vader's truth is out and just like Palpatine, his quest to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is his priority."
558,10,Excellent Film!,"This is the sequel to the original Star Wars (1977) and is the best film in the entire saga. It brings back all of the things people loved about the original and added more action and more great characters. This film and the original or considered some of the best movies of all time, and while this film did not receive as much critical acclaim as the first, most fans of the Star Wars saga will agree that this one is the best. "
559,10,This is a true masterpiece,"This is in my opinion the best of the original trilogy. Luke is becoming aware of him having Jedi powers. His spaceship gets stuck in the swamp and he can't get it out. He meets a new interesting wise character called Yoda. Yoda asks Luke if he can levitate the spaceship out of the swamp. Luke says ill try. Yoda then say's do or do not there is no try.. this explains the power of positive thinking. Yoda is able to lift the spaceship out of the swamp. Now onto our friend Darth Vadar who is arguably the best villain of all time.He wants Luke to join him and rule the galaxy with the dark side. Luke doesn't want this and resists Vadar's attempt to turn Luke. There are so many great sequences in this film. For example when Han Solo fly's through the wave of asteroids. The special effects at the time were revolutionary. The performances are solid Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han Solo. This is a true masterpiece of cinema that will live through the ages. If you haven't experienced this saga then I suggest you go out and rent or even buy the trilogy now"
560,10,The Best One,For Me this is one of the most important movies in history. This movie had to live up to the movie that changed how movies were made and filmed and exceeded it in every way.
561,7,Better then the original.,"In 1977, a movie came out, it was a type of movie, had the type been made before, yes, had it been done to this extent, absolutely no. Then, in 1980, The sequel came out, and after the dismal ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" it had a lot to prove..."
562,10,"My Favorite Star Wars, and my fifth favorite movie!",My favorite Star Wars film and my fifth favorite movie of all time.
563,9,"Greatest star-crossed ""lovers"" in history","I don't think I should ascribe the term star-crossed lovers, as in greatest star-crossed lovers in history - but even so, the point about Lando and Luke's magnetism being not susceptible to the audience's sympathy is so."
564,6,Family Fun,I really had a hard time with this one.  I though it was slightly better than A New Hope but not enough to give it a better grade.  The character development really goes into over drive in this instalment of the series. I loved the journey into their lives.  I could only imagine the shock of the Star Wars fans when they found out the truth about Luke's past.
565,10,By far the best of the Star Wars saga.,"Proof that if George Lucas wants his intellectual property to grow and flourish, he should lay the ground work and then take a step back and let it develop on its own. This is evident in the leap in story depth and character development from A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back. Maybe he should have let someone else take over screenplay writing and directing after Phantom Menace. This film really does get deeper into the characters and is definitely the best film in the first trilogy. Sets are extraordinary and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian (aka the only black guy in George Lucas's universe) was excellent. They ended the film in a perfect place making the audience crave to know what happens next. The film gives us a chance to grow even more with the characters from A New Hope and has a massive reveal toward the end (at least to those that saw it in the 80s)."
566,8,An excellent sequel.,"This one proves why the Star Wars series can last. What Lucas did was not only show the most advanced special effects technology at the time, but also not only build a complicated galaxy world, but actually did it.<br /><br />Everything an epic movie should have:the most classic elements of slapstick, joyful enemies, father and son, and apprenticeship between master and apprentice are cleverly combined.<br /><br />Even if the technology is outdated, the true soul of the space opera is still retained"
567,9,Gem of sequels,"George Lucas, STAND up and revel in the glory that be this film. The stand alone sequel brings together events that will unfold for the rest of the series. The special effects are a tremendous highlight, the story tells itself with power, darkness and grit. we get our first look at the manical AT-AT walkers and their abilities to destroy. we also get a first look at Dagoba and the isolation Yoda has put himself in. The realism of who Luke's father comes to light and how he battles that jolt is intensified in the next film. I certainly rate this with a 9."
568,10,BEST action/adventure film ever!,"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK totally surprised me after the disappointment that was STAR WARS. I rented the film as a curiosity item, but found it very boring and uninteresting. So I wasn't so keen on renting the next episode, but since so many people said it was so much better than the first, I tried it. And I was blown away by it. It was so good, I even bought it. Now I've seen it dozens of times. I never expected it to be so good! I was totally amazed by the effects (great for their time!), the action & adventure and the exciting story. This one moves much faster than STAR WARS. Irvin Kershner is a much better storyteller than George Lucas. I still wonder why he chose not to direct this one and leave it in the hands of someone else. It's the same thing Steven Spielberg directing all of the Indiana Jones films. But I'm happy Lucas made that choice. This movie probably wouldn't have turned as good as it did. It's hard to describe what's so good about this movie and the way it makes you feel as you're watching it. The most important feeling it gives me is the sense of wonder. The space battles are truly breathtaking, and are better than anything else you see in movies today. I think it's safe to say that they truly don't make them like they used to. Hollywood forgot that the most important thing in an action & adventure film is caring about the people who are in danger and creating interesting characters. I don't think we'll ever see another movie like TESB again."
569,10,BIG improvement over the first one,"this movie had much more imagination than the first film. It has a lot of action and it explores the feelings of the characters and many other planets of the Galaxy. Great sets, great sword fights, great cruel Darth Vader and lots of new characters. Interesting relationship between Luke and Yoda. A darker more serious tone, with good people becoming evil. These are the good parts of the movie. A great disappointment was the ending, because there wasn't one. The battle scenes on Cloud City were  too long. All in all, the second best of the trilogy, after Return of the Jedi."
570,,The saga continues. This is the best Star Wars movie in the trilogy.,"After 23 years, and now available to watch in 'Special Edition', the way it supposed to be, George Luca's 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best Star Wars film of the trilogy. I believe this because it has great thrills and tension, and some very funny and humorous moments. But best of all, this part of the Star Wars epic continues on the fantasy that I loved to escape as a child, and I still can now as an adult."
571,10,"The best of the origional trilogy, A genre defining film that will never age","The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best sci-fi movies ever created and is perfect in it's worldbuilding and storytelling. It has such a majestic looking movie with plenty of excitement and heart, all of the characters are believable with human motivation and the movie has incredible pacing giving you time to really soak in the locations of the movie."
572,,Good the second time around.,"Truly a great sequel, this sequel seems to be everybodies favorite, even the casts. It has great acting and great special effects, that even surprass the original. Luke and R2-D2 go to a distant planet, to find a Jedi Master named Yoda, so he can be trained has a jedi, mean while Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO flee the area, with Darth Vader one step behind them. But for a bizzare reason Darth Vader is obsessed with Luke Skywalker. Truly a great movie. Terrific acting by the cast, even Billy Dee Williams. Also a great lightsaber fight scene. A Great sequel. And a great classic."
573,,Good the second time around.,"This one has great special effects and great scenary that even surprasses the first Star Wars. It also has great acting by Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and Billy Dee Williams. It starts with Luke Skywalker and R2-D2, fly off to a distant planet, so Luke can find Jedi master Yoda, in order to train him so more as a Jedi. Mean while Darth Vader and his crew have invaded a rebel base. Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO flee the area. But Darth Vader is one step behind them. But for some bizzare reason Darth Vader has a strange obsession with Luke Skywalker. Han meets up with an old buddy named Lando Calrissan. A great sci-fi film of its time. Truly a great classic."
574,9,"If not one of the best, certainly one of the most important movies of all time.","This movie expands upon everything A New Hope creates, ups the stakes, and adds a layer of darkness, and an atmosphere of hopelessness that is almost unmatched."
575,10,The Greatest Movie of All Time,"Empire Strikes Back is my favorite film of all time. It is a masterclass of an adventure film that also cements itself as being a mature re-evaluation of good and evil. Though some effects do not hold up perfectly, there are timeless sets and effects used in this gorgeous film to make for some of the greatest world building of all time. Empire offers some of the greatest heroes and villains of any film, making for some of the most interesting confrontations of any adventure film. This film is by far the greatest sequel ever made and my personal favorite film of all time."
576,9,The Saga Unfolds,"Star Wars instantly became en grained in popular culture when it first premiered. I could imagine the anticipation moviegoers had when the first sequel was released. Sequels rarely match or surpass the originals, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered the greatest sequels for good reason. Instead of rehashing the plot elements and formula from the first, it builds upon it, with more suspense and unexpected twists. Granted, in this case it was part of a lengthily saga that called for more than one movie to tell the entire story."
577,6,Objectively best Star Wars movie ever made,"War, Dark Times and great story line, episode 5 is all the things we love about Star Wars, from the memorable one liners to the much improved CGI. Of course we're no nerds so it's not a timeless classic, but a great fun adventure nonetheless."
578,10,True brilliance!,"This episode is absolutely the best! It roars with suspense and action, and lifts you out of your seat with the convincing special effects and inspiring storyline. From the snowy plains of Hoth through the swamps in Dagobah to the corridors in Bespin it keeps you on the edge of your seat and leaves you in anxiety anticipating the outcome to be revealed in the next episode. I remember waiting for hours in a line that twisted around the entire thater to see this when it was first released. It exceeded my expectations then, and still remains atop my list of greatest movies ever."
579,10,Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars,"The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars. They are two of the best Science Fiction Films of all time, so I found it hard to decide which was the better film. Upon reviewing both for the umpteenth time, I discovered that The Empire Strikes Back had a more rounded storyline. We also found out the mystery of Darth Vader along with better development of all the other characters in the movie. And lets not forget that we were introduced to Yoda as well. I give both films a 10, but if I had to decide, The Empire Strikes Back would win hands down. It was too bad that George Lucas sold out a little with Return Of The Jedi, but I still found that the entire trilogy is one of the best in Science Fiction. Yes, The Empire Strikes Back was much darker, but that was likely why it was the better movie, and Return Of The Jedi the lesser of the three. Still, all three are better than the newer films, but Revenge of The Sith hasn't been released yet, and it sounds real good. So I'm on wait and see mode for the final film. Here's hoping it's better than Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones. Two films that I still enjoyed, but not as much as the earlier ones."
580,10,The greatest sequel of all time,"Like the original ""Star Wars"" film, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" always finds itself inside my top ten. It's extremely close in quality to ""A New Hope,"" but I place this film just slightly below that one. This is however, in my opinion, the greatest sequel ever made. Like all great sequels, it doesn't try to be too much like its original. This film has a completely different feel to it, and it proves to be far more dramatic and intense than the last film. In this film we are introduced to one of the most well-known and most-imitated characters of the saga (and movies in general), Yoda. This character brings about not only some of the most humorous bits of the movie, but also some of the most important and challenging ones. It has a bit of a slow start, which is really the only reason I rate it less than the original. I'm not really sure why I prefer the original, but there are few circumstances when I like a sequel almost as much as the first film. The lightsaber battle at the end is probably the most intense one in the entire saga, and if you are unaware of how it turns out, watch it now and find out. This is the only perfect sequel in movie history, in my opinion. A definite favorite of mine."
581,10,Best of the Brilliant Bunch!,"Episode V is the best episode of the Star Wars Saga.Although episode III is still to be released,I don't think that it will go that high level."
582,7,"Thrilling, but it needs to dig deeper into the idea of the Force.","Well, well. Not bad at all this film. I thought that Empire Strikes Back was a good motion picture and an improvement over A New Hope which I completely disliked. What's good about Empire Strikes Back is that it is more involving than its predecessor, it is fresh, dark, sinister, emotional and unpredictable in an original and great way but what comes as a particularly interesting subplot in this film is the daring, slick, ironic, manipulative, show-off and comedic dialog shared between Han Solo and Princess Leia. We witness awesome moments whenever it is only the two of them talking together alone in what looks like a romance moment between the two of them. And also the good thing is that the romance and dialogs between them is not over-the-top as some people might expect from a part romance film. And Harrison Ford is impeccably well cast as Han Solo in this movie, both in his acting and his looks and he is ultimately an exceptionally interesting character. And Darth Vader he isn't bad either. He is perfect as a villain: he is obsessed to catch the rebels that won a victory over his Galactic Empire three years earlier and he also punishes his commanders that involuntarily fail him in his attempt to catch the rebels by strangling them by the use of the Force. And he is also beautifully voiced by James Earl Jones though to be honest his small accent bothered me a bit and it harmed his beautiful and haunting voice as Darth Vader a bit. Actually, I think I will not consider it as a flaw as a matter of fact because of his beautiful and haunting voice and I think that his beautiful and haunting voice is enough to undo the flaw. Well done on all that. And last but not least...the sound. The sound was absolutely fantastic in this movie and it arguably deserved the Academy Award for Best Sound which it won. One thing I think should have been improved in this Star Wars movie would have been to dig deeper into the idea of the Force. My rating for Empire Strikes Back is 7.2/10"
583,8,Give that man a hand....,"Ice, freezing cold, swamps, a bit of incest and severed limbs, yes its my last holiday alright and by an extraordinary coincidence some of the key points in The Empire Strikes Back."
584,8,Is it in your destiny to watch this film?,"Once again, George Lucas takes us to a long time ago in a land far, far away.  This film is a follow up to one of the biggest grossing movies of all time.  To tell you the truth, this movie was not that great.  The characters were further defined, but this film did leave enough out there to tell even the most novice of movie watchers that there was one more film to come (even if Lucas didn't tell us beforehand)."
585,6,"Star Wars, the Monomyth of Joseph Campbell and the psychopaths.","Because practically everything has been said about this movie, I am going to make a commentary out of the ordinary, in which I am going to criticize only a very important aspect of its script which I don't like. As every true geek knows, George Lucas liked the book ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"" by Joseph Campbell so much that he incorporated many influences from it into the Star Wars script. Campbell studied myths and religions from around the world and he realized that there is a story that is repeated insistently in many cultures because it seems to convey a very important knowledge about the human soul. It is what has been called the ""Hero's Journey"" or ""Monomyth"". So Lucas wrote the Star Wars script following the steps of this mythical story."
586,5,A dissenting voice,Spoiler alert! (I write that just to protect myself in the event that I reveal anything to the 15 people left on the Planet Earth who have NOT seen this movie).
587,10,Better Than Ep 4,"Empire Strikes Back is ALSO one of the greatest movies of all time. The most famous scene is where Darth Vader says ""i am your father"". Also, Han Solo gets frozen in carbonite (he is alive!) so definitly a Sci-Fi, Action, and Romance movie."
588,9,Hands Down The Best In The Star Wars Saga To This Day,"Any ""Star Wars"" fan will tell you this film is hands down the best in the saga. Kershner and Kasden created a masterpiece. The direction, cinematography, screenplay, special effects, score and acting are superlative. The score plays just as an important role as the characters as it adds to the intensity, and adventurous tone of the film. The story continues between the rebel forces and the evil empire. Luke is introduced to Yoda who tutors him in the way of the Jedi. The rebel forces are in immenent danger and Luke cuts his training short to join the rebels in their battle. He encounters the ominous Darth Vader and family secrets are finally revealed. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it is almost impossible to choose a favorite. If I had to it would be the scene where Luke must decide on accepting the truth or risk plunging to his death. The plot is crisp, insightful, duplicitous, thrilling, cathartic and has an ambiguous ending. It is an ingenious film and remains one of the very best films in the science fiction genre. This film influenced this viewer to remain a fan even after having to endure the inferior Episodes 1, 2 and 3."
589,8,As good as a 'middle' can be!,"Many people think that 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the original three, but I still vote the original higher. Still, for a film without a real beginning, middle, or end, this one is darn good."
590,8,"Best of the Star Wars Franchise, and Most Fun to Watch",Some spoilers ahead 
591,10,Sequel to the masterpiece is masterpiece,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best films ever, and is considered by readers of empire magazine THE best movie ever."
592,10,An amazing film and a timeless masterpiece.,"One of the greatest films of all time, the perfect mix of adventure, action, comedy, sci-fi with a dark tone and easily one of the biggest twist reveals that has ever been in a film. This movie will last forever and has been enjoyed for generations and will be for countless more."
593,10,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
594,10,Must see,The Best movie ever made. Perfect in every way. 10/10
595,10,The Definitive Step Up Sequel,"When talking about sequels that improved ten fold over their originals The Empire Strikes Back will always rightfully be mentioned because this is a film that takes its characters to whole new levels of intrigue and development and places them in a vulnerable position and is a masterpiece. For one this films opening is possibly the best of the entire franchise, we are perfectly re introduced to these characters and understand were they all are, we see exactly how they are dealing with the events of the first film and they brilliantly spend this first act building up to the Empires attack in Hoth which gives the battle itself a whole new level of intensity. This first battle is incredible, we feel the scale and power of the empire from all perspectives making you realise just how powerful they really are and how much the Rebel Alliance are up against. When we get past this battle the film is split into two separate arcs that are cut together and told perfectly, there's never a moment we're the audience is bored with either story as the characters along with the storytelling make both of them just as entertaining and satisfying as each other. Luke's time on Dagobah is incredibly intriguing, the way this film talks about the Jedi and The Force is extremely well done it makes them seem more deeper than mere warriors and the inclusion of Jedi Master Yoda was a very good way of emphasising this as it shows the enlightenment The Force can bring. The other arc of this movie cantering around Han Solo and Princess Leia on the run from the empire is extremely entertaining with seamless special effects and a much more intimate and character driven story than the previous instalment, the romance that eventually develops is done just right it feels natural as well as not forced and the chemistry between the two is impeccable. When we finally get to the last act of this film it's all come together perfectly to create for a nail baiting final show down. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke is absolutely incredible, not only the mental but physical war that goes on between the two is so satisfying, the famous reveal doesn't see out of field but plausible and the ending was not entirely satisfactory as it left the characters in a questionable position that sets up for a better place for a sequel. "
596,10,"Easily one of the best films of all time, and a Star Wars masterpiece.","Empire has long been known as the greatest Star Wars flick. I would say that Return of the Jedi would have beaten it for this title, if it had laid off the overdose of ewoks and buffoonery that populate the middle of the film, and lose sight of the otherwise excellent and violent epic being told. "
597,,The best of the Star Wars batch,"The Empire Strikes Back is a pleasant enough film on the whole, with a nice easy to follow story and some likable characters. It can only really be described as a kids film, but is still worth a look for adults. Why it has spawned people who worship it is beyond my powers of observation, presumably super sci-fi fans would disagree. The least entertaining aspect of the film is the laborious collection of training scenes between Skywalker and the warrior frog Yoda. They seem to go on for ages, yet add nothing to the film. For an early 80s flick, the special effects aren't too bad, whilst there is a nice twist at the end when Vader turns out to be Skywalker's dad. When he cuts off Skywalker's hand however, you will be left unimpressed, not a trace of blood! Overall, not bad, but hardly a classic as so many people seem to regard it!"
598,7,"Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday."
599,9,Best Movie Yet?,This film is very inspiational.<br /><br />The best Star Wars film ever!
600,10,An overwhelmingly awesome space adventure,"I, like so many others of my generation, grew up with this movie. I remember watching it on a scruffy VHS and being in awe the whole time. There are so many magical moments - how Luke escapes from the lair of the hairy beast, how Han realizes he flew inside a space monster's maw, how Darth Vader suffocates the admirals who keep failing him, how Yoda raises the X-Wing from the bog, how Han is frozen in carbonite, and of course the ending's Big Reveal of cinema history."
601,9,One of my favourite movie sequels of all time,"I first got into the trilogy when they rereleased in 1997 and I went to see it in the cinema and I was completely hooked. I prefer The Empire Strikes Back to Star Wars because there is a twist in the tale which shocked me to the core. The special effects are just so awesome that they just hold your attention. All the regulars return Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia etc but there are some new ones too, like Lando Clarissan. In my opinion George Lucas should have stopped at number 3 because it has become more of a money making machine. The Phanthom Menace was OK, Attack of the Clones was bad whilst Revenge of the Sith was an improvement. Empire Strikes Back was easily the best of the Star Wars Franchise."
602,10,This is the greatest sequel of all time!,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is an instant classic! It takes what the first one did and builds on it adding more lovable characters, vehicles, creatures and more! This movie is a timeless classic!"
603,10,Best Star Wars Film SO FAR!,"In my opinion this is the best Star Wars film so far, darker than Star Wars and Return of the Jedi, it also boasts even more jaw dropping effects than the original. Also Harrison Ford, Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher are more comfortable in their roles, probably because they are more confident in this films quality than the first one, because they seen the outcome of Star Wars finished product. I love this film and I hope Episode 2 Attack of the Clones can top it (fingers crossed!). Billy Dee Williams role also makes a great addition to the cast, oh and of course Boba Fett first appears in this one, and that character is the coolest of all the Star Wars characters, ***SPOILER*** just a pity he was killed so cheaply in Return of the Jedi. Maybe Star Wars films are better off when Lucas himself doesn't direct them?, I hope not what with as I write this less than a month from Episode 2. Time will tell...I give this ***10.10*** as I can't falt it in any way."
604,,great movie,Empire Strikes Back is the continuation of the Star Wars series which involves Darth Vader trying to find the rebels and to get Luke Skywalker to join the Darkside. It opens on the plant Hoth and then we are taken on different adventures. Luke and R2 go to the planet Dagobath looking for Yoda to teach Luke about the Force. Han and Leia avoid being detected by the Empire and take refuge at Cloud City. Empire is hailed as the best because the story actually takes off here. Boba Fett is the bounty hunter looking for Solo and The Empire is shown. The ending is dark and paves the way for Return of the Jedi. This is as good as a sequel can get. It has excellent scenes including Yoda and Vader and Luke's lightsaber battle. ****
605,9,my second favorite in the series!!,"Let me say that it is my second favorite in the saga. This episode is fast paced , a decent plot and cool special effects!!My favorite one is Return of the Jedi !!it is favorite for special effects though!!This movie also features an awesome score by composer John Williams!The score is classic even if you do not like all of his scores!!Look for future star Billy Dee Williams in this movie as well!!"
606,10,The Dark Side of the Universe is the finest in the saga,"I've been watching Star Wars movies since the age of 5 and though I regard Return of the Jedi as my favorite of the entire series (even topping off the prequel and sequel series), I cannot deny the amount of artistry and storytelling ability this one has. There's a lot of character development and pathos between all the heroes we love and the villains that we want them to confront. I like the fact that the heroes don't always win, gives them a greater chance for us to root for them. rather than have an invincible boring set of heroes. The show stealer here is Yoda himself. Forget the CGI versions, the puppetry and wisdom he exudes in his words are timeless, my favorite is the famous line ""Do or do not, there is not try"". Truer words never said better. When Darth Vader says the famous line, you're going to be wondering what decision Luke will have to do next. I won't reveal anything, but from all of what I have said you'll return to this movie time and time again."
607,9,"One of the best, what can i say","I always loved watching Star-wars and all kinds of Fantasy, Fiction and Sci-Fi genres TV-shows and Movies."
608,10,"Darker, better story, better effects","The Empire Strikes back defied every single expectation from viewers. How could anything be any better than the epic original Star Wars movie? It's not even directed by George Lucas, right? Wrong."
609,10,The Empire Strikes HARD,"Arguably the best Star Wars film, and once again one of the best films ever made. The Empire Strikes Back proved Star Wars a force to be reckoned with, by not pertaining to the sequels of its time and building on the story, characters, and plot. Giving us a darker, fun, adventure filled film that exceeded its predecessor and gave us even more classic film and Star Wars moments."
610,10,The best in the series,"The first Star Wars changed film forever, and the second did it it even more. The effects are better, the writing is stronger, the acting is better, the atmosphere is better. Every last thing is just done better. Unfortunately it didn't get the same recognition from the Academy as the first. The film only got two wins (for effects and score) and a few nominations. That is sad that it didn't get the same kind of recognition as the first. I love this movie. I love it from start to finish. It is for sure the best in the series, and without a doubt a cinematic piece of gold. I love the first, but this one just takes the cake."
611,9,"For me, the weakest of the Originals, but the most enjoyable...","Face it. Once you see ""Star Wars"" (or Episode IV, for all you ""Special"" Edition lovers) at least 54 times, everything sort of drags on. Once you see ""Return of the Jedi"", it kind of drags along, but, even though it is the longest, it seems to be the shortest. While ""Empire"" is VERY slow, it is easily the darkest and most enjoyable movie from the Original Trilogy, but for me, the least. As with ""Star Wars"" I'm gonna start the review with the Special Edition stuff. We don't need to see the ""VERY"" interesting approach to the Star Destroyer. The extra Wampa scene builds MUCH more tension than the original. And making Luke scream like a baby was Definitely cool. So, like the original ""Star Wars"" DON'T BUY OR WATCH THE SPECIAL EDITION! Again, I am proud to be the lucky owner of the original 3 movies unwrapped, and in mint condition after my success on ebay. I think it is obvious that The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest, including the fact that it has the stunning (MAJOR spoilers ahead!) ""I am your father!"" by James Earl Jones. As for the acting in this movie, second strongest, (Return of the Jedi has the strongest,in my opinion). Best actor/actress here- Frank Oz as Yoda. Well, he didn't really act, but oh, well. Againg, the effects in the Original Edition don't stick out like a sore thumb like in the Special Edition. The sets have gone a small, almost unnoticeable change: They don't look used! While many may argue that snow and woods can't look used (and I agree with them), Cloud City certainly can, and I think that there wasn't a scuff mark until the Stormtroopers attacked! Again, the music is GREAT! This time, my second favorite track, ""The Imperial March"" is introduced, and my fifth favorite, ""Yoda's Theme"" is introduced. Again, the DVD is fine (Luke doesn't scream), and I recommend it over the ""Special"" Edition. But, I recommend the Original Edition above all. May the Force be with you as you watch this movie!"
612,10,The best of the trilogy.,"""Empire"" is the best film of the original trilogy. Rather than remake the first film, Lucas takes the world that he devoped in the first movie and takes things even further. The story in this movie is better. There's much more character devolopment and the characters are fleshed out more. The movie takes a darker tone with the fate of Han Solo and the big revelation regarding Luke and Darth Vader. The bigger budget also helps allowing for improved special effects to complement the improvements from the first movie. Proof that not all sequels have to suck."
613,8,amazing,"This movie proves why the Star Wars series can last. What Lucas did was not just show the most advanced special effects technology at the time, build a complicated galaxy world, but truly become an epic movie. Everything you deserve: The most classic elements of insulting and cursing, rejoicing at your enemies, father and son, and apprentices and apprentices are cleverly combined. Even if the technology is outdated, the true soul of the space opera is still retained"
614,9,Amazing,Wow. What an epic.
615,10,"Wonderful, exciting, a masterwork...",This film is the living example that there can be sequels which are even better than the original.
616,8,Star Wars' Perfectly Great Sequel Deserves a Little Less Praise.,"Public opinion on popular movies has a way of snowballing towards one of two directions. A disappointing movie becomes an unholy dumpster fire and a solid sequel becomes an undisputed masterpiece. The Empire Strikes Back is certainly overrated. It's a great film, as are all the Star Wars movies (the six that count anyway), but Episode V is not a dramatic step up from A New Hope or any of the other films in the saga. The movie has become so overrated that many say it's not just the best Star Wars movie, but the only Star Wars movie that is any good at all. People are dumb. And I want to take the contrarian stance, but let's face facts, The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect sequel to the landmark movie event that was Star Wars. It deepens the mythology, lending George Lucas' world a gravity and psychological weight not seen in the buoyant original. It's also just as quirky and clunky as any other Star Wars film, so let us not rewrite history. TESB is a great film, a great Star Wars film, possibly the best of the six, but not the overwhelming triumph of the series that SO many people claim it to be."
617,5,Decent but too overrated,"TESB is a decent film no doubt, its way too overrated, the story and characters were not that too good, the dialogue was on-the-nose at times, the effects still hold up tho."
618,10,One of the best excellent films of all time!,"STAR WARS EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is just a film that shows all of the qualities of a good sci-fi movie should be made, but also, how to make the best movie that is perfection. Overall, I think this film is a masterpiece and one of the best films of all time and this is why, but first, let me explain the film's story."
619,7,A good sequel,"This sequel to ""Star Wars"" is good but not great and although a tad overrated, it still delivers."
620,10,One of the best excellent films of all time!,"STAR WARS EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is just a film that shows all of the qualities of a good sci-fi movie should be made, but also, how to make the best movie that is perfection. Overall, I think this film is a masterpiece and one of the best films of all time and this is why, but first, let me explain the film's story."
621,10,The best film I've ever seen,The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite movie of all time.
622,,Not as good as the other two,I didnt like this film as much as they other two basically because it was the middle of a trilogy.  We were left with too much to hope for with Return of the Jedi (which incidentally is why I think most people dislike Jedi the most).
623,10,"A Timeless Classic, Hands Down The Best Film Of The 80s","Guys...What can I say about ""Empire"" that hasn't already been said by countless fans, critics and film professors around the world? This is the movie that turned ""Star Wars"" from what was at the time little more than a soap opera in space into one of the greatest sagas in all of fiction. Its characters are diverse and well developed, its storytelling is magical, its effects are groundbreaking, its world-building is perfection, its allegories to classical literature and world mythology are brilliant. It is to science fantasy (And American cinema in general) what ""The Odyssey"" was to literature."
624,10,The Is No Room For Improvement....,"Not only the greatest sequel of all time, but without question its the greatest movie ever made!  Topping the first film (A New Hope) seemed impossible, but George Lucas and Irvin Kershner did it in 1980 with EMPIRE. A darker, deeper, more elaborate action packed film that skillfully tells two inter-connected stories as characters from the original movie are powerfully developed.  Luke Skywalker comes of age and realizes a terrible family secret.  Princess Liea and Han Solo try every means of evading the Empire but eventually end up in Darth Vader's hands.  The climax of the film is unforgettable and the special effects are not only impressive even by today's standards, but perfectly serve to tell this incredible story. I hope that the future of the Star Wars saga can capture the imagination and emotion that this sci-fi classic has done."
625,10,One of the best movies ever made,"Hands down, one of the best plot twists and movies in generell ever made.<br /><br />I am your father...<br /><br />Just perfect."
626,6,Not the best star wars,"From a release year standpoint this film, like the franchise itself, was ahead of its time. But there are numerous reasons it is not the best installment. The script between the romantic scenes are corny and do not feel sincere. The amount of puppetry used is almost suffocating compared to New Hope. But this is still a great film and should be regarded as a historical achievement for film."
627,10,A guys night out must watch,I don't think this needs a big intro as many around the globe has already rented or seen this on the big screen. Back then I had Empire on read along cassette with Danish narration by Peter Kitter. So famous tons of memes came by 3 decades later.
628,10,The best of the trilogy; an awesome space adventure!,"One of the rare sequels that arguably tops it's own classic predecessor, the second film in the original STAR WARS trilogy manages to seamlessly combine the cliffhanger thrills and good-natured humor of the original with a darker and more adult-oriented storyline. Producer/writer George Lucas (who also directed the first film) decided to pass the directorial duties over to semi-avant guard director Irvin Kershner (best known at the time for 1970's LOVING and 1972's UP THE SANDBOX), which proved to be an ingenious move. Kershner's dramatic background serves him well in helming the complex plot, and he pulls fully-rounded characterizations from the entire cast. The merging of Kershner's storytelling talents with Lucas' mastery of the film-making technique is the very heart of this, which is arguably the greatest space adventure ever."
629,8,The Empire strikes a home run!,"Even better than the first one, this movie is fun! Better special effects and bigger adventures and to top it all: the mother of all soap opera plots!(And I bet EVERYONE knows what I'm talking about) Unlike the first movie, this one is not a stand-alone movie and it connects directly to the third (or should I say sixth?) and final part. You still get the feeling of a complete story and it's f-u-n. Lucas is a genius. Great characters, great worlds of wonder... Wow. Oh, and make sure you watch the special edition! Just buy the special edition trilogy."
630,10,The best!,"I'm not afraid to say that this is the best Star Wars movie. A classic, with the most incredible plot twist of all. it's official: this film is timeless!"
631,9,One Of The Best Sequels Ever,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a stronger film than ""Star Wars"". The characters are stronger and more established and it is better made. This film is arguably the best sequel of all time, it expands on the original rather than remaking it. This is the best film out of all the ""Star Wars"" films though I really liked ""Episode 1"". A must see film."
632,,Perfect retaliation of A New Hope.,"The movie itself stands out as the second best Star Wars movie.  Perfectly showing a great dose of action, suspense and fun.  Yet with many kinds of tidbits of subplots like Luke's training in Dagobah, and the relationship of Han and Leia.  The Battle of Hoth scene was spectacular and the tragic fight between Luke and Darth Vader was outstanding.  One of the better films of the series."
633,10,One of the best movies of all time and the best in the saga!,"A New Hope was a very good movie, but something was missing. The plot wasn't the best, the characters could've been more fleshed out, but this movie has everything. It's one of those that are absolutely perfect. The acting, the effects, directing, plot, everything was just perfect. The acting is great and these characters were already likable in the previous movie, but here there is much more chemistry between them, they feel like they are real and you care about them much, much more. George Lucas isn't directing this time, but Irvin Kershner did a great job and directed the best Star Wars movie of all time! About the effects, I mostly think the same I thought about the previous movie. They are ahead of it's time, they aged well, and it was all practical, but it's so hard to believe. John Williams made a perfect score to the movie and here we are introduced to a theme of the Empire. There is especially that one unforgettable scene when that music plays and it fits perfectly. The plot is emotional, intense and that twist at the end will stick with you for a long time (of course, if someone didn't already spoil it to you). It's foreshadowing the next movie and sets it up in such a good way that it's impossible to top it. While the other movies have their flaws, this one is flawless and watchable over and over again. An absolute masterpiece!"
634,9,One of the Best Films Ever,"After the lighthearted adventure of the original, director Irvin Kershner delivers a darker, more thought provoking sequel that improves on everything that was in the first film and makes a near perfect movie."
635,9,I did have a review for this movie where is it?,Star Wars Episode 4 The Empire Strikes Back is a decent movie. How would Luke Skywalker have enough air to get to the planet doggybag I mean Dagobah I mean BraDacotah Sue luckrout. The Yodas are enigmatic yet sane in my opinion. Any appearance to the contrary is probably acting. As the Great Great Great Grandson of Governor Edwin Morgan a former Shadow President of America according to an American Government website I often think One wonders once ones won. To quote Joe Walsh lucky Im sane after all I've been through. The Yodas or You spasms helper? that Ugh President Attorney General Multiple Schlerosis help Elizabeth Regina and I both watch Human movies but we both sometimes cannot help critiquing the films we watch from many viewpoints like how many mistakes are there what are the funniest scenes? I often say thank God the Yodas appreciate Humor and gave we Humans that gift when they created us. Thanks to IMDb for supporting the kind of freedom of speech that Shadow President Jack F Kennedy my Great Uncle and Partial Father due to gene splicing support. Support IMDb
636,10,The Empire Strikes Back ... Again,"QUICK REVIEW SEPTEMBER 2020<br /><br />The 4K remaster is in cinemas and I was surprised how strong the movie is 40 years after its original release. The pure inspiration behind the traditional stop-motion, scale-model, and blue screen special effects, as well as the depth of practical sets, sound effects and score keep this film in the top 5 sci-fi/fantasy cinema experiences even today.<br /><br />In today's industry of movies made with the option for streaming at home, this movie stands out as something designed ... purely ... for ... the ... big ... screen (and sound system!). Everything is amplified and it is just pure epic ... ness!"
637,8,A balancing counterpart of the earlier part 'A new hope',"After Luke's and Leia's arrival the resistance gains strength, especially after the demise of the death star by Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader and the first Order do not take much time to find for the resistance who are by then placed in a cold planet called Hoth. <br /><br />This film has interesting elements like the Lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Luke; the secret romance of Leia and Han Solo that is expressed in the end, etc. A balancing counterpart of the earlier part this shows First Order on the higher side while resistance tries to gain through Luke as the last hope. Luke find his way to Dagobah where he has interesting meet with Master Yoda who begins his training but that does not complete due to the his call on saving his friends Leia and Han. Luke manages to escape after a breathtaking fight as Leia helps with his rescue.<br /><br />The turns are twisted as Luke's training is incomplete and the Jedi have not returned; First order gain strength and Vader has turned invincible. All eyes are on Luke who is thought is bring new life to the Jedi."
638,,The Best sequel ever!,"ESB is as excellent as the original if not more so. It is very creepy,and dark which adds to it. The plot is perfect. The actors are even better than ANH. It is visually stunning. A lot of good fun. We learn more about the characters,and we learn the truth about Darth Vader,which has become one of the best scenes in the history of motion pictures. We also get the wee little Jedi Master Yoda.I love that little guy,he shines in this movie. See it again,and again. You will be thrilled every time!"
639,10,Another Great Sequel In A Great Trilogy,"There are few trilogies that have a sequel that matches up to the first. The Lord Of The Rings and The Godfather trilogies are two that I should mention. Once again, the technical aspects in this film are very impressive and advanced for 1980."
640,,Probably the best,"The Empire Strikes Back continues the Star Wars saga after the original Star Wars film. The Empire is hunting down the Rebellion and subsequently tracks them down on the icy planet Hoth. Luke and R2 split ways with Han and Leia (and Co.) - Luke travels to learn the ways of the Jedi, while Han and Leia hide out from the Empire in the Cloud City."
641,10,The Greatest Film Ever Made,"In the pantheon of great movie sequels, the line stops at Empire, having all the heart of the original while also taking the story down a new and darker path as it expands over countless new worlds and encompasses new ideas and themes. There is something for everyone here, from the bombastic battles on land and in space we've come to expect to meaningful explorations of the balance between good and evil, the light and the dark; it's everything a sequel should be and more, raising the bar as it raises the stakes and leading the franchise in bold new directions."
642,9,"Better Than the First, and the Greatest Science-Fiction Film Ever...","Coming from a hardcore fantasy fan, when it comes to science-fiction, Star Wars - Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the best."
643,4,Nothing happens.,"A lot of fall out from a New Hope and build up to Return of the Jedi. But honestly not much happens. Not a lot of ""empire striking back"" for a movie titled Empire Strikes Back."
644,,Why it is the best,"It is the most well directed, most well-acted on and has the best story dynamics. At least better than any of the other SW films."
645,9,Great Movie,This is a good Movie but I rated it 9/10 because you have to see at least 1 or 2 of the previous movies.
646,9,Best Star Wars Film,"I love all of the original Star Wars films, but for me this one takes the biscuit. I have heard some people say that The Empire Strikes Back is the weakest of the trilogy, and that it suffers for being in the middle. I would dispute this utterly. For one thing, the plot has a slightly different format to the other two: instead of the old destroy-a-death-star scenario, we have the chance to learn more about the galaxy in general and to explore the characters in more depth. This is the film in which a lot of key character relationships are forged in earnest. It also includes, in my opinion, the best light sabre sequences: Alec Guiness may be a super actor, but he's not desperately nimble, whilst we do not have the same confidence in Luke as we do in Return of the Jedi."
647,10,The Best Sequel Ever!,"Luke lost his mentor Ben Kenobi,and goes to be trained by Yoda. While The evil Sith Lord Darth Vader looks for Luke,and captures his rebel allies. Little does Luke know of the connection he has to Vader. Wow this is a sequel that really out does the first! The Plot is excellent! Perfect! You'll love this exciting entry in The Star Wars saga. It also proves that Geogre Lucas can't make a prequel as good as The Original Trilogy!"
648,10,This is not a honest review,"So I decided to review the 3 Star Wars movies, all with the same review. Just because the last movies are horrible for me. So I will copy paste the same review. Star Wars is just the best movie for me. I was a kid when I first saw this... Wow... I dreamed about it, I was reading the 300+ page books, I played the video games etc. I played the music so many times... So it is not honest now to review the movie, I have no clear mind."
649,,The Standard Bearer of the Star Wars Universe,"The Empire Strikes Back, technically superior to Star Wars and dramatically superior to Return of the Jedi, still remains the best of the series. While not my favorite of the trilogy, I still am fascinated by the array of events that take place in this film.  It contains extreme contrasts, from the swampy Dagobah to the stark Cloud City, and gives the characters much more complex storylines.  Mark Hamill stands out once again as the intrepid Luke Skywalker, who finally gets a taste of the Dark Side while training with the legendary Yoda and with a botched confrontation with Darth Vader in Cloud City.  The rest of the group is trapped in space, without a working hyperdrive, and caught in the belly of a space slug.  ESB also offers a glimpse of Boba Fett, the enigmatic bounty hunter who had few lines, but unforgettable screen presence and a gigantic cult following ever since. The Special Edition of ESB is also a treat, with a enhanced and truly menacing Wampa on the icy Hoth, and great CGI effects on Bespin.  I highly recommend The Empire Strikes Back, but don't forget, this isn't a stand alone film. You have to see the entire series!  Hopefully, that won't be hard for any of us..."
650,8,Better than the first for sure!,"Although the First Star Wars movie was fun and full of action, I found that there was a certain depth that was lacking that could have made the film go a bit further. In ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" we see a little bit more character development in all the main characters. We see Luke's internal conflict with the dark side of the force, Han Solo's love for Princess Leia, and Leia's stubbornness but reciprocated love for Han Solo. We see that Darth Vader is evil, but not as pure evil as we might have expected in the first movie. Overall, the Empire Strikes Back goes one step further and not only goes into the back story behind each character, but also their psychology as well. It makes for an interesting watch, and with slightly better visual effects, also makes for a better film than the first instalment of the Star Wars saga."
651,9,An Exceptional Sequel!,"There is a reason that this movie is often regarded as the greatest movie sequel of all-time! Because this is all that A New Hope is, but times ten! There's more action, somehow more worldbuilding, and the characters are even more likable than in the first movie. All I can really say is that this is the best overall film of any Star Wars movie to date!"
652,10,a revised impression,"I have seen Star Wars probably 35-40 times and Empire about 20 but had never watched them back to back (on consecutive nights) until the new DVD versions came out. Put me in the camp of those who feel the added digital effects are a desecration; I want to see the movies the way they were released originally. I simply tried to ignore the alterations and was successful for the most part. It certainly is nice to see these films in widescreen, with outstanding picture and sound quality."
653,10,BEST SEQUEL EVER MADE (before The Dark Knight),"After the huge success of ""Star Wars"" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level."
654,10,"Character development, A shocking revelation and some romance","The best film out of the saga. A great twists and turns and an epic cliff hanger ending! Wont go into detail but the fight scene between Luke and Darth Vader was the biggest shock a young 7 year old me had in my experience in going to the cinema! The character development too is great! It shows how mature the young characters have become since their last run-in with the Empire in Episode IV. Some say the special effects are dated, to me they are way better than the prequel trilogy! Whilst the prequel trilogy looks like a cartoon, the special effects and model shorts in Episodes IV, V & VI look and feels more realistic and convincing on the eyes. 10/10 Death Stars for this one!"
655,6,Sorry not for our Generations (After Nineties),"The story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. There isn't any tension-building or climax whatsoever. The movie just stops after 2 hours. There is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. The only character that has won my sympathy is Han Solo,(Harrison Ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and no one seems to care about him anymore. Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. On the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. Unbelieve what effort George and his guys have done!"
656,8,Very perfect sci-fi movie,"Compared with current works, this film must be far from special effects. However, powerful special effects may not be able to attract audiences. I think this work is more narrative than its special effects. As a science fiction film at the time, It is very commendable to use a delicate processing method instead of just staying on the display of special effects."
657,10,"Wow, Just Wow","What can I say about The Empire Strikes Back that hasn't already been said? That's a genuine question. Star Wars V is one of the best movies to ever be made in cinema history, and I'm not just saying that as a Star Wars fan. It has action sequences you feel when you see it for the first time or if you haven't seen it in a long time. And it has one of the most quoted movie lines ever, ""No, I am your father."" Another good thing is that out of the original trilogy episode V has the least special edition changes so you can experience the original movie with just a few changes. Overall if you haven't seen this movie in a while then you should blow the dust off your VHS player and watch some good old Star Wars."
658,,Amazing movie,"Full of special effects, with a nice plot and very tallented actors. I loved the story and the it surprised me completely."
659,,PROOF that sequels can be better....,"An awesome film. Where Star Wars: A New Hope was more of a space fantasy, this one is a lot darker and goes into much more detail. Introducing new characters (Lando and Yoda), and rekindling relationships with old ones (Han, Luke, Leiah, and Chewie), this is also a film about its villains (Vader and Fett)."
660,9,So annoying and painful.,I can't imagine how painful it would have been to hear Chewbacca in theatres. Painful!
661,10,Incredible movie-making on every level.,"The characters, the drama, the comedy between Han & Leia. The special effects and of course the unforgettable introduction of Yoda. The best Star Wars film of them all and deserving of a place within the IMDb top 5. Harrison Ford establishes himself as one of the most masculine action heroes ever, setting a prelude for his amazing turn as Indiana Jones. The ending, which literally leaves the audience hanging made me love the story more and left me wanting to see more of this amazing epic. "
662,10,My favourite,"I love this film, I think it is mainly because of the sexual tension Leia and Han have which started in the first film and spilled over into this one. I love their relationship where they argue and you can see they care for one another but they won't tell the other and it is like a battle of wills between two strong people who won't admit they have deep feelings for one another. There are some tender scenes especially when Han is put into carbon freeze and Leia finally admits to Han that she loves him."
663,2,Galactic Dysfunction,"After destroying the Death Star the Empire regroups. Aboard his space yacht , Darth Vader sends probe droids that even Apple wouldn't sanction to every backwater in the universe. All while dealing with the general incompetence of his military troops."
664,,I want medical proof before I believe that you are my dad Darth buddy!,(Taken from comments I made under a different name!)
665,6,Not bad,"At first, I didn't like this film because so many bad things happen to the Alliance. Here's a few: **Spoilers ahead** 1. The Rebel Base at Hoth is crushed and a lot of them are killed."
666,9,This part proves why the Star Wars series can last forever.,"Lucas did not only show the most advanced special effects technology at the time, but also not only built a complex galaxy world, but really did it. Everything that an epic movie deserves: the most classic elements of playfulness, rejoicing against the enemy, father and son rebellion, master-student grudge are cleverly blended together, even if the technology is outdated, but still retains the true soul of the space opera"
667,9,Must seen Classic,"This title form part of the first trilogy made by lucas film, the way this movie show you a full new world its almost like a history lesson some people belive that our galaxies are full of life and some beigns are able to command and rule on it. Does not matter what you belive at the end, watch star wars saga and create your own idea about this reality that create millions of fans all aorund the world."
668,10,The Empire Strikes Back - A Timeless Classic That Continues to Captivate Audiences,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences more than four decades after its release. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, the film picks up where the first Star Wars left off, with the Rebel Alliance struggling to defeat the evil Galactic Empire."
669,10,Best in the Series----10/10,"This is the best film in the Star Wars series because it is where the most important things happen. Darth Vader tells Luke he's his daddy, Han Solo is frozen in cryptanite, we are introduced to Yoda, and more is learned about Jedi. I think George Lucas put this trilogy out first because the twists are too good to already know they are coming. He does such a good job putting all this on the screen, i can't believe he didn't win Best Director, and it's even more shocking that neither this nor it's predecessor won Best Picture. What was the Academy thinking? Anyway, most of the cast returns and the special effects, while now severely outdated, are good for it's time. The Special Edition has to be the best thing to ever come to Star Wars fans (until the highly anticipated DVDs). The sfx are redone and the picture quality is enhanced. The Battle on Hoth and the escape from Cloud City are two of the best scenes ever filmed. Empire Strikes Back is the best in the series and one the best films of all time. 10/10"
670,10,Excellent,"Some films you love because you can't separate your childhood from your view, but this is as good as popcorn entertainment gets either way. I've watched and watched and now my son loves, if only you can get hold of the untinkered version it's just brilliant."
671,3,Sadly only useful for nostalgia,I grew up a massive fan of Star Wars. I've seen every movie dozens of times and I will forever be a fan.....of the memories.
672,10,my favorite of the trilogy also,"i especially liked how the movie split to two separate stories and how everything came together for the good in the end, re-emphasizing the strength of this FORCE."
673,10,My favorite film of all time.,"I know what you're thinking. ""There are millions of movies out there, what makes this your all time favorite?"" Well the truth is this. I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. When it comes to me and film, there's no genre I don't like and a movie has to have a lot of annoying qualities for me to dislike it. So I'm quite easy to please when it comes to the cinema. I know I haven't answered your question yet but bear with me."
674,10,The Best Star Wars Film,"When the movie first came out in 1980, fans and critics weren't a big fan over the films more mature tones compared to Star Wars (1977). But since then, critics and fans, including i, have redeemed the movie as the best Star Wars movie, and one of my favorite, sci-fi, and sequel movies, and one of my personal favorites. It is alongside with Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Aliens (1986), one of the greatest sequels of all time. The movie looks better than most CGI-Hollywood films today, and this was made in 1980!, and was made entirely without CGI. The movie stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz. 10/10, totally recommend it, to every movie fan."
675,8,Good Film and has good heroic features,Ranking- 8.3 This Film had alot of heroic features that made the films seem amazing and the way the director did it just seemed to be a good film having Darth Vader fight Luke this time and telling him that he's his father just seemed to make the whole audience very into the film. This Film can be very enjoyable
676,8,Dark Force rising,"This movie will always be the best for me of the first trilogy, the graphic nature of T.E.S.B. makes me wish more of the movies had it's flavor, furthermore if only the current wave of Star Wars movies had the courage too follow suit the stories would be more likable."
677,10,"Ohhh, this best Star Wars part","Star Wars. A classic, the same space opera that you always want to watch."
678,10,The best episode of the saga,"I remember watching a Star Wars documentary called Empire of Dreams which is about how the first trilogy came to life and his tremendous success which is still going on today. During one of the many interviews George Lucas gave for this doc, he remembered the huge deal of pressure he had to bear on his shoulders while filming Empire Strikes back."
679,10,Number 1 film of all time. Simply amazing,This is the best movie of all time. Can someone please explain to me how Lord of the Rings is above this movie in the top 250 at this site. Better yet why is it above Star Wars. It is a good movie but it is nowhere near as ausome is this movie. I like this movie because I am a Die-Hard Star Wars Fan. Even if I wasnt I would still love this movie. Characters are much more developed and matured than in the first.
680,9,The Masterpiece that Defined Star wars: Deep Analysis,"As a kid I was never interested in star wars, for one reason or another i just never watched any of the movies. It was until 10 years later when i was 17 years old, that i was visiting my grandparents for the day and i decided to watch some cable, I came across a star wars marathon, it happened to be the final battle of Ep 1, where Darth maul fights Quigon and kenobi, i was spellbound. I was blown away by star wars that i didn't change the channel and i decided to watch the rest of the 6 movie saga in one night. My life was forever changed that day. Recently I decided to have a star wars marathon, and give an up to date review of the 6 movies."
681,9,The Best of the Saga,"Those not born around the time of Star Wars have no clue how Star Wars impacted cinema and created the ""blockbuster"". So much of pop culture changed once Star Wars came out it was insane, from toys, magazine articles, music, media coverage, video games (eventually), and dance clubs (disco was huge)."
682,,"It's a favorite, but it has it easy...","Of course most fans and critics like this one the best - it's got it easy! The first film set it all up, the next one would resolve any loose-ends - this gets to focus purely on the action!  Nevertheless, the action scenes were more interesting than those in the previous film, and Frank Oz gives us the most sincere performance of the trilogy through his Yoda puppet, who gets ample screen time here."
683,9,Imaginative and emotional,"Definitely the most imaginative and emotional Star Wars movie in the franchise and, with the except of Revenge of the Sith, one of the darkest entries as well."
684,8,Worst Part of the Series,"This was the worst part of the series. The acting was not very good and Harrison Ford seemed to really hate this one, or maybe he just did not have many good lines in the script. The acting was not as bad as to how boring this movie was. The Beginning and Ending were the best parts in the movie. The whole middle of the movie was completely boring. Yoda was the best character in the movie. Attack of the Clones was better than Empire Strikes Back, but that had its problems too."
685,10,Top 3 best movies of my life,"This movie is impeccable, it's impressive, it's beautiful, and it's admirable how he managed to do all that in 1980, it's crazy to think that this movie revolutionized cinema at the time, not to mention the biggest plot twist in history, I would definitely delete this movie from memory just to have the taste of watching it again."
686,10,"Not only the best Star Wars films, but one of the best pieces of Science Fiction I have ever seen.","This is superb. This is truly one of the best sequels I have ever seen, not only as a Star Wars film, but as one of the best sequels in the history of film making. Like the granddaddy of all sequels, The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back takes the original, develops it and continues with it but is not afraid to go into darker places. We have Hans Solo being frozen alive, Luke being told that Darth Vader is his actual father and to top it all of he has his arm chopped of by him. As kid's films go, this is brilliant and dark. If the first film was like the magician's trick, this is more like a Shakespearean play, a hint of tragedy taking hold of proceedings. The characters are taken on more darker paths throughout the narrative that leads to a frightening downbeat cliffhanger. There is a sense of maturity in the proceedings here. Maybe it comes with a different director using the special effects tools in a more mature manner of different writers, but the more superficial problems that the first film had are gone here. The acting is much, much better, Mark Hamill putting in a brilliant portrayal of a Luke that is finding his life taking a more darker turn than before. The chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford retains some of the more fun and light hearted aspects, but then this leads to a darker pay off and a scene of sheer emotional intensity it is almost blinding. To think, this was intended as a kid's film."
687,1,Bad,"I first saw this movie when I rented it out from my local video store, I can honestly say it is the worst movie I have ever seen! It doesn't even deserve the right to be called a movie, I am a big fan of episodes 1 and 2 and I wasn't really disappointed with 3 but Empire Strikes Back is just horrible. The acting is dreadful, the bad guys aren't scary of funny and aren't even both guys! The kid who plays Luke Skywalker is dreadful and your left hoping the bad guys actually get him and strangle him. The storyline is just stupid and why they decided to keep the same characters as the first two home alone's is beyond me. Overall I have to say this movie is a big disappointment and I only gave it the rating 1 because I had to, if I could give it a zero I would."
688,10,The Continuation of a Wonderful Trilogy,"When it comes to sequels, I strongly believe that everyone gets an empty feeling in their stomach. There can always be a misfire when it comes to the next chapter of a saga, and this one was one of those films that worried many, many fans. At the same time, however, it was very anticipated. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" ranks as my second favorite ""Star Wars"" film, following closely behind ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". Most fans would disagree with my arrangement of favorites, yet I don't believe any would disagree with this film getting an outrageous score. That's right. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is--simply put--phenomenal. Everything from the scale of the film to the sets to the acting to the writing has improved from the original film."
689,10,The Curse of ESB.,"The Empire Strikes Back will go down as one of the best sequels of all time and it gave the saga it's name ""The Skywalker Saga"". It showed that the monster Darth Vader was human after all. But as great that ESB was it was also Star Wars biggest curse cause no other Star Wars sequel could ever compete with it."
690,10,"The richest, the darkest, the most romantic and the best of the 4.","Every time I watch this movie in whatever format (big screen, video, letterbox or pan and scan) I am absolutely entranced by the feel of it. The opening snow battle (with those insanely elephantine Imperial Walkers) and the chase scene amidst the asteroids are as thrilling as any scenes in the ""quadrilogy"". But what especially draws me in is the heaviness that seems to imbue just about every frame and every line the actors speak. This is quite a (welcome) jolt from the whiz bang frivolity that wins over Episodes 1, 4 & 6. I don't know how much of this tonal change (if you will) was brought to the material by director Irvin Kershner or how much it had to do with the necessary downturn in the script that was pre-ordained to end in the Darth Vader's favor. Whatever or whoever was responsible added psychological muscle to an already hyperactive story. I also loved the deepening relationship between Princess Leia and Han Solo. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford generate some real electricity, albeit confused and awkward (until the end, of course), in the middle of all the other excitement. In fact I think that one of the most romantic scenes in movie history comes when the Princess declares her love for Han just before he gets carbonized and he replies that he knows her feelings. What could have come off as terribly smart alecky and arrogant instead resonates with reciprocation and desparation the way Ford says his line. This romance is what really carries this movie for me. Finally John William's score is among his all-time best and with or without the movie absolutely soars."
691,10,This is mine ...,"Everyone has his or her favorite movie. Sometimes, over the years, you forget why you actually named it ""your favorite"" at one point in your life, and you nurture it, defend it against evil-doers and just let it stay up there, up on the top of your best-list. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is mine, my favorite movie. It might have its flaws but I don't even want to talk about them. Nor about its greatness. It just is."
692,10,"Best Star Wars Movie, simple","Best Star Wars movie, no doubt about it. Nothing wrong with it"
693,9,"No, I am your father","Another fantastic edition to the Original Trilogy with the most famous sequel perhaps in all of Sci FI Movie history with Luke being revealed that he is in fact Darth Vader's son or Yoda's first ever appearance. Again like with A New Hope, the special effects of Empire Strikes Back and CGI has aged tremendously well"
694,9,A true classic,This movie was a true film making classic. Any story that can take place in 3 unique environments and space while telling thee classic good versus evil (with a twist Vader as the dad)is worthy of a movie this good. It is a reminder on an era of movie making when film makers took a risk with using more elaborate special effects in their shots. This movie started a flood of great 80's films that allowed you to get lost in a new world of far away people. Empire Strikes Back stands out as the best of the stories in the original trilogy as there is simply more story and more characters involved. This movie is a great family as well and is a great way to spend a family night in.
695,9,The Perfect Sequel,"There's not much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. It's a near perfect sequel and film. It's fun, it's suspenseful. It takes everything A New Hope did right and improved upon, all while keeping the classic Star Wars sense of adventure and whimsey. A must watch for everyone."
696,10,The Best of the lot,"After seeing the first Star Wars, a Sci-fi epic set in outer-space (which I loved) I was looking forward to tuning in to the second in the trilogy (the empire strikes back) on DVD, but, to be honest, I didn't really think it could get any better. The first star wars was perfect, and, usually, the first in a series is the best. How could that great film be surpassed?"
697,10,The saga continues,"I just finished re-watching all six Lucas-era Star Wars films in episode order (I-VI) with the commentary and want to give my reviews of each film. Let me preface by saying that I am a lifelong Star Wars fan who grew up with the original trilogy and literally have no memory of a time in my life before SW. As such, I am not going to be totally unbiased in my reviews, but I will try to be somewhat objective."
698,10,A truly breathtaking film,Overall I would say that Episode V is the best of the Star Wars films.
699,,Excellent Star Wars sequel,"Movie sequels are often seen as an attempt to cash in on the original, but The Empire Strikes Back is not one of them. The films could also have been made as a retread of Star Wars, but it wasn't. Instead, it was designed to move the saga along."
700,10,A stunning success!,"For some reason, the beginning of this ""Star Wars"" movie is ""messed up"" again. In the original Star Wars, the first 25 minutes is boring. The same argument does not (indeed, can not) apply to The Empire Strikes Back. It starts on an exciting note, and the excitement never slows down. What's wrong then? The beginning is just too confusing! A while passed between the two films, and Luke's voice sounds somewhat different. So for about the first 10 minutes of the movie, (where no faces are shown, and only Han Solo's name was mentioned) I was wondering: ""Is it really him? Or was it someone else?"" Omitting that confusing first 10 minutes, this movie was, to be perfectly honest, amazing. The acting really improved, I think, from the original. I positively loved Billy Dee Williams (who should've played Two-Face in Batman III) in this movie. James Earl Jones, who delivered a fantastic performance in the original, was even better here. (Darth Vader's sardonic line ""Apology accepted"" was just amazingly delivered!) He was even scarier, I'd say. Harrison Ford's character was a little more developed, as was Carrie Fisher's. Mark Hamill did a great job, too."
701,10,Long live the Empire!,"How do you top perfection? Why, you go out and you create the Empire Strikes Back, that's how. "
702,8,In my opinion the worst of the trilogies,"This movie was one of the best I have seen but in my opinion the worst of all the Star Wars movies.  The ""Luke I am your father"" is pretty much spoiled for everyone under the age of 20.. We all know! It was dark and the battle on Hoth was shot very nicely.  You should see this movie, but if you have to choose between the 3.. Return of The Jedi is the best!"
703,,Astonishingly beautiful!,"Are there enough words to describe just how wonderful this movie is?  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is undoubtedly the best film of the Star Wars series--it remains so to this day.  I can't think of a single flaw in this movie.  It's a MAGICAL film. Excellent sci-fi film!  There is so much beauty in this film and it is presented in so many ways: (1)the snow planet at the beginning (2)the eerieness of the swamp planet where Yoda lives (3)the asteroid belt (4)and the cloud city, surrounded by the orange color of a sunset reflected on the clouds.  It also has the best lightsaber fight scene of the original Star Wars trilogy--Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader battling it out, in the bowels of the cloud city, the moment when Luke learns that Vader is his father.  Furthermore, it has one of the best endings in motio n picture history....the final scene that shows Luke and Leia looking out the window of the spaceship, with a galaxy in the background is amazing!  You had to have seen this movie on a movie theater screen to really appreciate it.  I remember seeing this film in a theater when I was a little kid, too young to really understand much of what was going on in the film, but still being mesmerized by the film.  Since then, I've seen this film many times (I even saw it again in a theater during the 1997 re-release), and it has remained one of my top 10 films of all time.  But one truly remarkable thing in this film is Yoda's last line.  Obi-Wan's spirit tells Yoda that Luke is their last hope....yet Yoda replies, ""No...there is another"".  In other words, it left open the question of whether the ""lost"" Jedi, Anakin Skywalker would return."
704,9,Very exciting,"This proves why the star wars series can last forever, and what lucas did was not just to showcase the most advanced special-effects technology of the time, but to build a vast galaxy, but to truly do what an epic film should do: flirting, rejoicing enemies, father-son anti-eye, teacher-appetite enmity these most classic elements are skillfully blended together, even if the technology is old, but still retain the true soul of the space opera."
705,10,The best Star Wars film ever made.,"The first sequel is the darkest and the best ever made. (I know that episode III is still to come out but i dunno...) My own theory for the success of The Empire Strikes Back is that at the time of it's release audiences believed it would be more of the same as the first film but bigger and better, what they got also was a great storyline, developing characters both good and bad, blazing action sequences and John Williams Empire/Darth Vader score that was to return in the next movie."
706,10,"""You must unlearn what you have learned.""","""The Empire Strikes Back'' is the best of three Star Wars films, and the most thought-provoking. After the space opera cheerfulness of the original film, this one plunges into darkness and even despair, and surrenders more completely to the underlying mystery of the story. It is because of the emotions stirred in ""Empire'' that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third. This is the heart of the original Star Wars trilogy."
707,10,The best of the entire series,"I remember seeing this classic movie as a kid.  I loved it then, and now that I am grown up and know a bit more about movies (and have seen many more of them), I love this movie even more.  "
708,10,The best of the series,"A lot of people have said this before, but I will say it again, Empire Strikes Back is the BEST of the Star Wars series.  Star Wars was great, don't get me wrong.  But, Star Wars was a movie to introduce the characters. This is a movie to let those characters DO something.  When you see the battle on Hoth or on Cloud City, you KNOW the characters.  This movie gives them MUCH more to do.  Plus the special effects are very very good, and even in 2002 more than hold their own against the best of today. "
709,9,Best of either Trilogy...,"Not as historic or groundbreaking as the original, this film easily represents the 'Godfather part II' of science fiction sequels."
710,8,"Darker, but...","This is a lot more dark in comparison to Ep IV, but doesn't seem quite so much of an adjustment with consideration to prequel elements, both dark and light. This one has lost a little of it's edge in light of moods that have proceeded it in later prequels. At the time of release, an easy 10/10, on account of the dramatic shift, however it's lost some of that punch in the wake of new material, which is a shame. It's still however an excellent movie, and one of the best in the whole franchise. We got a better lightsabre battle this time around too, towards the end - beats the Obi Wan v Vader sequence in the last movie, by a long way!"
711,6,Not exactly the best of the Star Wars flicks,"I can only speculate in Episode IV that because Vader realized that his Imperial battle station was destroyed by the rebel force, his own ship went back to one of the Star Destroyer ships. This is because at the start of Episode V, you see Vader on one of those Star Destroyers."
712,10,One of the Best,This is one of my all time favorite movies! My kids are also lifelong fans of these movies!! Thanks For Making Some Great Family Films
713,10,Diving deeper into a wonderful universe,"A decidedly slower paced chapter in the Star Wars saga, but also an incredible sequel. Everything from the thickening plot to the lovable characters, the incredible set piece moments to the sweeping and epic original score that accompanies them, Ep. V sets the bar for sequels. It's entertaining, fun, wild, and intriguing. Exploring deeper into a universe is always fun. It's Filled with famous lines and scenes, memorable battles and epic flights through space, Star Wars Episode V is nothing short of incredible. The are, like all of the Star Wars films, a little weird A classic, only to be followed by another classic!"
714,7,A good but boring sequel to A New Hope,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is often described by movie critics and fans as the best Star Wars film of all time. It is undoubtedly a film of its own class.
715,8,Great,"This is a Hollywood sci-fi film that really shines. Multi-line narration, special effects blasting, character contradiction shaping, father and son fighting, love, inspirational and so on are not the original film, the film is more to learn from the wisdom of the film workers in a film, make the film wonderful and good-looking, and even affect the development of the film is the most desirable place. As a transitional work, the film has the advantage of an open ending, which arouses the appetite of the third sequel. A few details are handled although rough, but also do not affect greatly hinder."
716,10,I love this movie. It sure is awesome.,I grew up watching Star Wars since I was a kid. It is always full of nostalgia.
717,10,The Diamond Standard for Sci-Fi Epics,"The film that solidified Star Wars' place in popular culture as a timeless franchise and shattered audience expectations like never before. Beginning the long-standing trend of a sequel darker and more mature than the first, the Empire Strikes Back takes everything the world adored about the first Star Wars (characters, story, score, themes, world building, etc.) and builds upon them in every way to craft a smart, daring and beloved improvement over its predecessor. Whatever has been said about this film already deserves to be repeated, because this film should and will stand throughout the ages."
718,7,Impressive,"Visually, this is easily the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. There are reasons for that. For instance, the ridiculous little puppets meant to act as alien creatures. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" uses them the least. And one of them is so surprisingly good in both how it looks and how the plot handles it this creature with big ears feels real and is a great addition to the big picture. Then there are the special effects and the sets that, obviously, were made in a time when making them was a much harder process than in the twenty-first century, but they look real. All this physical material ages well. Even the ""special editions"" are not an obstacle."
719,9,A great sequel!,"I am not the biggest fan of A New Hope, but The Empire Strikes Back took me completely by surprise! I loved the action and twists and new settings featured in this one, and was surprised when the full length of the movie flew by. Han and Leia's romance is definitely a little dated (still iconic) but overall I don't have any real complaints with this movie. A great time!"
720,10,By far the best and darkest of all Star Wars films,"When we all sat down to watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for the first we figured we knew what would happen in the rest of the trilogy. At the end of the second film we assumed Darth Vader would beat Luke in a lightsaber duel and then at the end of the final film Luke would finally kill Darth Vader. But then in what is still one of the biggest one-two punches ever aimed at an audience Darth Vader cuts off Luke's right hand and stuns the audience with the revelation ""I am your father."" Suddenly the idea that Luke was going to kill Darth Vader went from absolute metaphysical certainty to something very much in doubt. The thought that it would be three years before we found out how this would play out drove us absolutely crazy (remember the wonderful speculation that Boba Fett was a clone of Obi- Wan?)."
721,9,The best sequel of the Saga,"Even though the first Star Wars film of 1977 is my personal favourite, The Empire Strikes Back is one sequel which almost surpasses the original."
722,10,"Bigger, Better and Darker Star Wars","After the huge success of the first ""Star Wars"" a sequel was inevitable and this time George Lucas stepped down and sat mostly in the producers seat and co wrote part of the script while he handed the directors reigns to his former USC professor Irvin Kershner. Unlike Lucas who was a special effects visionary, Kershner instead focuses on story and characters, most notably the human face."
723,10,the empire kicks butt!,"Star Wars episode v-the empire strikes back is the critical darling of the six films, they loved its darker tone and serious plot twists and the FX is superb. Under pressure to write a full story for a movie he wasn't sure he'd make Lucas turned over directing to Irvin Kirshner, who does a fine job. Luke, Leia and Han have been pursed by the EMpire and specifically VAder who is obsessed with Luke, to the ice planet of Hoth. Amazing miniatures and FX lead to a terrible beating for the rebellion and they are on the run. Luke, advised by the spirit of Ob-Wan journeys to Degobah to meet Yoda, a JEdi master, while Han and Leia end up in Bespin to call on Han's old friend Lando Calrissian."
724,,"What a Thrill Ride, coming from a Non-Star-Wars Fan!","I am no Star Wars fan and over all think the franchise is quite overrated, but that doesn't stop The Empire Strikes Back from being one of the best movies of its decade. This is just story telling perfection, creating with one bit worlds, stories and themes, putting them together so perfectly and than.. We are nearly 2 hours in, everything seems impossible and than BOOOOM One of the biggest twists of all time. This is it. A perfectly laid out storyline, with twists and creative psychology. Outclasses every other Star Wars movie and makes the whole Franchise watchable: "
725,9,Childhood meets Nerdness,"I think I'm not the only one who's flooded by nostalgic childhood fantasies when watching the good old star wars trilogy. But never less I have to say, this is a great movie. The sheer amount of effort which is put into the details of costumes, sets and models is just amazing. In every shot you have a whole world to explore and who does will always be rewarded by this movie. I won't talk much about the story since I expect most people to know about it. It's a classic tale about good and bad but with the right depth to make it not to flat. Compared to the Disney movies this one's got a soul you can feel the heart that was put in this movie and that makes it so enjoyable.<br /><br />Great Movie. Great Trilogy. Great Times."
726,5,What a silly movie,"Other than a few good battle scenes this movie is silly, the plot is dull, the movie has a lot of filler of people running around shooting pretend lasers at each other there are so many instances where the movie has filler in it to drag it out to 2 hours. Mark Hamill is a B actor and was lucky to get the part. I could never understand what all the hype was about around this movie."
727,10,"The force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.","It's often said that The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest Star Wars film simply because it's dark. You've heard it before, people telling you it's the best because ""the ending is so dark"". While I do think this is the best film out of the series, I don't agree with that reason. I think the movie is dark as the result of what actually makes the movie so great. I will attempt to explain my point of view."
728,,The empire is on a rampage folks!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the strongest film of the three.The story is much more well developed then the first film.The charcters are fleshed out more.Luke,Han,Leia Chewie must face the wrath of Vader.The film is the best of the orginal three.Music,effects,sound are topnotch.The only drawback is I wish there was more of Fett.I think Lucas does this on purpose.He gives us villians like Fett,Maul,Vader and lets are imagination fill in the blanks.I think Maul would take Vader any day."
729,10,When Lucas was still a visionary...,"I am always amazed at the creativity of artists. When Lucas first proposed ""Star Wars"" the board at 20th Century Fox probably thought he was mad, especially since special effects were primitive at best. Who could have envisioned what he had in mind when he first made the original? Who could have imagined what a light saber was? "
730,,One of the Greatest Film Battles Ever,"Enough has been said about what makes this the best of the Star Wars Films, but the truly stunning and exciting sequence is the battle on the Ice Planet Hoth. The set up is great - a desolate planet and a far-flung outpost seems like the last place the rebels would be found. When they are, we build up anticipation of a standard looking battle and then through binoculars we see - the Walkers. These enormous armored vehicles are absolutely shocking and frightening at the same time. The battle which ensues is thrilling and unique, with Han Solo making a thrilling getaway. "
731,9,the saga continues,"Director:Irvin Kershner, Script:Leigh Brackett, Lawrence Kasdan, Story:George Lucas, Cast:Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Alec Guinnes"
732,9,The best of the original trilogy and of the entire franchise,"After the seccsess of the original movie in the series empire was next and with it came a expansion of the lore of the series and a plot that has been since one of the best of the series. After the distruction of the first death star the rebellion celebrate but for the evil empire it was time for them to strike at the rebels and being lead by the evil darth vader the empire will test the strength of the rebellion and our heroes and they will find out shocking truths. the returning cast from a new hope are Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher,Anthony Daniels, David Prowse,Kenny Baker,Alec Guinness,James Earl Jones and introducing Billy dee williams and Frank Oz. The cast is outstanding and they have since been credited for being the best in the series.<br /><br />Personally Empire strikes back is one of the greatests in the star wars series and one of the greatest movies of all time and since has a timeless story and a legendary sci-fi movie."
733,10,"""No. Try not. Do...or do not. There is no try.""",Three years after George Lucas changed cinema with his 1977 mega hit STAR WARS its first sequel came out. To me this is the best of the whole series of films so far containing both secrets and the introduction of a few great characters to be added to the list of STAR WARS cast. To me as well this film sits only behind Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in space stories put on screen.
734,10,A powerful followup to the original Star Wars,"This is rated a scoutch lower than the 1st Star Wars flick, although it is right behind Aliens and slightly ahead of T2 as the best sequel ever. It loses 0.3 because of the disjointed forced emotions of Han and Leia, who have great repartee but romance is just not there. I didn't buy it anyway."
735,10,The Greatest movie of all time!,A cinematic masterpiece and a complete Triumph!
736,,Second Act's the best!,"Empire is definitely the best of the three SW films, and that's the general concensus, not just my humble opinion.  The plot in ESB is much more complex than in SW, which was basically much running around and shooting the bad guys.  The light saber battle between Luke and Vader is unparalleled, as is the Moment of Truth when Vader 'fesses up to fatherhood.  The suspense builds here like in no other SW movie.  We also care about the characters and what happens to them; that is the key to creating a good movie.  Action sequences miss their mark if we don't mind if the guy fighting gets sliced or not.  Here, Han and Leia *finally* get together, Luke begins to act like a man and not a high-flying whiner, and Alec Guiness is thankfully back as the ghost of Obi-Wan."
737,,"The only feature in the series worthy of ""blockbuster"" consideration","Brilliant story and action sequences are the result of everyone doing what they're supposed to. Lucas is handling set and story, not meddling in the dialogue or direction. Instead, he steps aside and allows a truly expert sci-fi screenwriter Leigh Brackett (with only minor help from more run-of-the-mill Lawrence Kasdan) and little-known but sharp director Irvin Kershner to deliver this absolute masterpiece. Take the film's dark tone for one. Every moment is a struggle against death for all of the protagonists, without the eager farmboy yearning to battle in the cosmos nonsense of its predecessor. And Yoda, good god! If there is one character that defines 80s cinema, who else could it be? ""Great warrior, oh, wars not make one great."" Adventure is certainly never in short supply here, demonstrated by some of the finest pursuit and dueling scenes ever to grace the screen. What really sets The Empire Strikes Back apart from its kin is its ending, where after being through what can be described without exaggeration as a living hell (even for the robots) the rebels take some time to recover and then prepare for the daunting challenge that faces them: rescuing their imprisoned comrade and defeating Vader and his emperor."
738,10,By far the most imaginative part of the Star Wars trilogy,"In the glory days of science fiction, critics wrote about the ''sense of wonder.'' That's what ''The Empire Strikes Back'' creates in us. Like a lot of traditional science fiction, it isn't psychologically complex or even very interested in personalities (aside from some obvious character traits). That's because the characters are not themselves--they are us. We are looking out through their eyes, instead of into them, as we would in more serious drama. We are on a quest, on a journey, on a mythological expedition. The story elements in the ''Star Wars'' trilogy are as deep and universal as storytelling itself. Watching these movies, we're in a receptive state like that of a child--our eyes and ears are open, we're paying attention, and we are amazed."
739,9,this is a good movie.,"For the 1977 film, see Star Wars (film). For other uses, see Star Wars (disambiguation). Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas. The film series, consisting of two trilogies (and an upcoming third), has spawned an extensive media franchise called the Expanded Universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe, keeping the franchise active in the 16- year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as ""far, far away"" in the distant past, and commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture. The franchise's story lines contain many themes, with strong influences from philosophy and religion. "
740,9,Another Classic,While I did not like this one as much as a new hope this one is probably the most iconic out of the bunch. Music is once again beautiful. Characters are really good. Just rewatch this if you haven't recently.
741,9,"Star Wars Month #2: An Dark, Interesting, and Outstanding Sequel","After Star Wars was a smash hit in 1977, a sequel was put into the works. The Empire Strikes Back is one of those sequels that is equal to the original, while still being its own film. While I can't personally say it's the best film of the Saga, it comes pretty darn close."
742,10,A sequel done right.,"Following the massive success for the first Star Wars film, George Lucas had hoped to become independent from the Hollywood system in choosing to finance the budget from the other two sequels himself. To develop the story for Empire Strikes Back, Lucas brought on sci-fi writer Leah Brackett to write the screenplay. In the first draft, Brackett would have Luke's father appear as a spirit to Luke thus tying into the backstory provided in A New Hope. Upon reading Leah's screenplay, George was less than pleased but before he could meet with her and fix the script, Brackett passed away thus leaving Lucas to write the next draft himself but he brought on Lawrence Kasden to reanalyze the screenplay. Unlike A New Hope, Lucas chose not to direct Empire Strikes Back because he was focused on running Lucasfilm as a business, overseeing the VFX company Industrial Light and Magic, and financing other Lucasfilm projects. George then offered the director's chair to his old film mentor, Irvin Kirschner. Known for more character-driven films like The Eyes of Laura Mars, Kirschner had never directed a blockbuster before and he originally rejected the offer, fearing the sequel wouldn't match the standard of the original film. When he called his agent, though, he later accepted the job at his agent's behest. Shooting for Empire Strikes Back began in Norway in early 1979 where they encountered the worst storm in 50 years with temperatures of -20 degrees and 18 feet of snow. On one occasion, the crew were unable to leave their hotel to shoot a scene of Luke escaping the Wampa cave so Irvin was able to achieve a shot involving Luke's exit of the Wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming Mark Hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside. When the film opened in June of 1980, it did incredibly well at the box office and with moviegoers, but critics were mixed on the film, but over time, the film has been received far more positively and is now considered by many to be the best out of the entire Star Wars saga."
743,7,The Quest Begins,"The quest begins for this 2 hit wonder. The movie is about Luke Skywalker beginning his quest to become a Jedi knight, where he has to struggle with his emotions, and learning a dark secret of his family history, and to the man who murdered his father (as mentioned in the original Star Wars)."
744,10,What is it about this movie that makes it almost better than the almighty Star Wars?,"I remember the first time I saw this. I saw the end. I thought it was so pointless. I watched it again. The whole movie blows you away. It's not often that a sequel lives up to a really great movie like Star Wars. Aliens is an example. This movie had great f/x and one really great script. Never see that in a sci/fi movie to often do you? The only boring parts are on the Hoth planet. And I love that part! The action scenes are put together very well. This is one of my favorite movie sequels. If you love Star Wars or sci/fi's or movies period, you should have this in your movie collection very soon. It's just one huge thrill ride. Take the ride too. The Empire Strikes Back: A"
745,8,The Best Star Wars Has To Offer,"This is by no other word, the best star wars movie ever. The movie does a excellent job at expanding the star wars universe while also developing its central characters and their relationships to a fine degree. Everything the first movie did, this movie does that and so much more. But the icing on top is Darth Vader and you will learn why he is regarded as one of the best cinematic villains in history from watching this. You are truly missing out by not watching this."
746,10,"Everything Star Wars was, is and needs to be!!!",The sequel to the film that changed filmmaking is hands down my favorite film of ALL time!!!! I love this movie!!!
747,9,One of the best originals,"I actually thought ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the best movie made in the original Star Wars trilogy, even better than the first Star Wars movie."
748,10,A truly masterpiece and the best film of the original trilogy,"The Empire Strikes Back, sequel to A New Hope, is fairly considered by many as the best movie of the Star Wars saga, because the film presents exciting fresh ideas, a more mature tone, it's mindblowing, fun as hell and is presents everything what makes people love Star Wars."
749,,Empire Strikes Well,"I thought this movie was great, especially the opening battle on Hoth. Acting was great as expected and pace throughout the movie was excellent."
750,10,Best star wars movie ever!!,"Greatest of all star wars movies hand down!!! Change my mind, I bet you cant.... the second greatest star wars movie is Rogue one. These are the two movies that are the backbone of the star wars movies."
751,,WOO HOO!,"I just saw EMPIRE STRIKES BACK for the umpteenth time and although I have given up all hope of EPISODE II being anything other than Disneyfied dreck, I am hoping that the coming third (and final installment) of the series will bring back pleasant memories of this exceptional sci-fi classic. In the meantime, I will revel in what is one of the greatest films ever made and indisputably the best sci-fi movie. I like EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE less and less each time I see it. I feel as if I outgrew it somehow. I still enjoy RETURN OF THE JEDI every once in a while but more on the strenght of individual scenes rather than overall. I never could stand PHANTOM MENACE because it was Disneyfied dreck. There is no doubt in my mind that ESB is the best of the four films released so far. It stands alone as a great film (although it does need much needed closer which the sequel provides) and the special effects are phenomenonal for their time. I can't wait for the DVD special edition! I've preordered it and the studio hasn't even made any plans to release a DVD yet. And finally, there are those who characterize all who love this film as action figure collecting, pimply-faced fan boys. </S>"
752,,great,"The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion. While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda. However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large"
753,10,"Darker, grittier, romantic, the best Star Wars!","This is in my mind the best Star Wars...Whereas the first is called ""A New Hope"" this one could be subbed ""Without Hope, We Survive""."
754,10,The best movie,"After receiving a vision from Obi-Wan Kenobi and fleeing the ice world of Hoth with his friends after an Imperial attack, Luke Skywalker travels to the marsh planet of Dagobah, where he is instructed in the ways of the Force by the legendary Jedi master Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princess Leia make their way to planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han's old friend, a shifty gambler named Lando Calrissian."
755,,Excellent,"The Empire Strikes Back is just a notch down from A New Hope, but still an excellent film in the trilogy. After the Death Star was destroyed, the Rebellion was chased from their secret base and relocated to a bunch of different planets over three years, until they're finally settled down on the ice planet of Hoth. Darth Vader, obsessed with finding Luke Skywalker has sent probe droids across the galaxy in order to find him and his friends. This film is very action packed, ranging from the AT-AT battle to the chase in the asteroid field. The acting is quite better than the first go around, especially from Mark Hamill, and the love scenes between Han and Leia are excellent. Darth Vader is at his most evil in this film, choking people to death who fail him. His lightsaber duel with Luke at the end is ten times better than between him and Obi Wan in the original and the point where Darth tells Luke who he REALLY is is shocking, even when you know what happens. To sum it up: The Rebellion is defeated, Luke abandons his training, Han is captured and taken to Jabba The Hutt and Luke gains a daddy and loses a hand. Excellent film in the series."
756,10,A taste of film and imagination heaven.,"""The Empire Strikes Back"", if not the best film ever made, is merely the best Star Wars film ever made. I seriously doubt Lucas will top this. Ever. The way the story is told continues to astound me. The darkness of it all. The adventure, danger, and drama that consists in the film's universe has yet to be paralelled (I don't it will be). In terms of acting, its pretty well orchestrated. In terms of special effects, it's amazing. In terms of music, it has some of Williams' best. In terms of script, it's wonderous (at least after the ""laser-brain"" scene). In terms of story, it's the best. In terms of characters? Well, lets just say it's uncanny. The way the characters unfold in their adventures and the true revealing of Vader's mind is fascinating. The film won't please impatient kids all that much. It is a mature movie through and through. Not in terms of content, but in terms of understanding. There's no Jar Jar, Jawas, or Ewoks in this one. The title explains it all and the end result leaves one in a semi-depressed stupor while also giving the viewer a sense of hope. Everything works in this one somehow, whether it's the story, locations, characters (Boba Fett and Yoda, for example), music, or awesomesness of the villains. It all accumulates into one word: fantastic."
757,7,LemonKnight: The Empire Strikes Back Review,"In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is Star Wars at its best and is a groundbreaking movie and a near perfect sequel. It is very enjoyable to watch but is also incredibly overrated. The Empire Strikes is no where near perfection and definitely not the best film ever made like many people said. Although, I do agree that this is George Lucas Masterpiece. "
758,10,Was I privileged to watch this one first?,"The first time I got to set my eyes on this movie, back in 2000, was on an old TV record that we had somewhere here... I didn't know what to expect. The only thing that I'd ever seen of Star Wars was a vague memory of Yoda that was invoked by the word 'yoga' and I believe a poster of The Phantom Menace, so I didn't really know much about this franchise. So I placed the record into the VCR and started watching...and I was blown away."
759,10,one of the only very worthy sequels,"This is a great sequel. This movie could actually be proven to be better than its original but then again there is no movie more original than star wars plus it made more money in theaters than the sequels but this movie is definitely worth watching and to anyone who hasnt seen it ""youre missing out"". This movies contains the best scene in the series which includes the part with the AT-AT walkers. The planet Hoth would never again be visited. Hopefully in the prequels to be we will see more of this but above all this is a great movie everyone should enjoy."
760,8,Better than the first one?,"Star Wars Trilogy Notice: watch the original theatrical version or don't bother at all. I'm not even a big fan of Star Wars, but even I can see that Lucas's ""Special Editions"" were a travesty."
761,10,Flawless,"Absolutely flawless , there is nothing i don't like about this film. Nothing more to say."
762,,The biggest and best of the Star Wars trilogy!!!!,"Not since The Godfather Part II, has a sequel lived up to its name and then some!!!  The Empire Strikes Back has got everything going GREAT for it...special effects, sound, acting, and score.  The best way to view it, of course, is in the theatre.  Much of the awe is lost on television.  The film picks up where the original film left off.  The Empire plots certain revenge for the band of freedom fighters on the icy planet of Hoth.  When all hopes for establishing a hidden base fails, the Alliance disbands, and so do the characters.  Luke hooks up with Yoda, who teaches him the way of the Force. Han and Leia spark a love affair.  C3PO and R2D2 add humor.  Darth Vader reveals a nasty secret to Luke.  The film climaxes in a Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker match...breathtaking if you're seeing it for the first time in a theatre.  John Williams' score is a masterpiece."
763,10,My favorite Star Wars film ever!,"The Empire Strikes Back is an excellent Star Wars film. It is my favorite Star Wars film in the original Star Wars trilogy, and is my favorite Star Wars film ever. However, I prefer the theatrical version more than the special edition."
764,10,Empire strikes back,Went to go see this in theatres for the 40th anniversary and it did not disappoint I would argue that yes it doesn't all look real but for 1980 it is very impressive. The score for the movie is incredible on big giant speakers and I don't think I can really say anything that has already been said other then this movie is definitely worth going to spend some money on
765,7,Improved but not perfect,"i wanted to see the star wars trilogy and look at it with a critical eye. so when i watched this movie i expected anything. the movie was pretty fine and definitely an improvement over the previous one. though i don't have too much to say about this movie. i'd mostly say the same that i said about the first (fourth) one. so this review will be more or less minimal 1. the story: what i appreciate is that this is a ,,good'' sequel. it's what a sequel should be: a continuation. this is a pretty good continuation. it's not a rehash of the first one and the story itself is quite decent. also the most iconic star wars moments come from this movie. 2. the characters: the characters are for the most part. just like in the last one (especially the best character Han solo) but in this part Luke's character has actually grown a bit as he was learning to become a Jedi and use the ,,force'' or basically to become an omnipotent space wizard. Darth Vader and Chewbacca got to really shine in this movie and were infinitely better than in the predecessor. also Yoda was introduced and he was fine i guess. 3. the action: thankfully this movie didn't have a lot of storm-trooper shootout scenes. this is probably the biggest improvement over the last movie. the last movie had very boring action with no stakes since the storm-troopers literally miss every shot they take. here we only had one storm-trooper shootout and it was pretty quick. summary: fine movie. better than the last one but still grossly overrated. the biggest problem with these movies is that they are in the middle of kids movies and adult sci-fi"
766,8,Star Wars Gets Dark,"I'll admit to not being one of the ""cool"" people (as in cool nerds) who like this installment of Star Wars better than the first because it's darker and takes itself more seriously. Escapist movies such as Star Wars and Raiders shouldn't take themselves too seriously, and it hurts Empire a bit..but just a bit. This is still a fun ride. "
767,5,Hated it then; hate it now.,"I saw this dog when it first came out. During the opening scenes on Hoth, I turned to my friend, and said, ""Get me in space!"" Running around Antarctica with Yeti, was the worse.<br /><br />Billy Dee Williams is a joke.<br /><br />The smouldering love interest between Solo and Leia pathetic; everyone knows Luke loves her (oops, Lucas made her HIS SISTER after the success of I (Oh, excuse me IV). Oy vay! 5 stars for Special Effects, sound, and effort. Folks, the 1977 original was nominated for Best Picture! Lucas said everything he wanted to say in it! Sequels are made for one reason; filthy lucre."
768,10,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980),"Improving on almost every aspect of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back manages to be the rare sequel to undeniably top its predecessor in both quality and entertainment value while still not feeling rehashed. This was the Star Wars I wanted with the original, and it was extremely satisfying. In The Empire Strikes Back, the Galactic empire is on the hunt for Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Darth Vader is chasing Han Solo, Princess Leia and others across the galaxy, Luke studies the force under Jedi Master Yoda. Structurally, the film isn't as controlled as A New Hope, featuring long action scenes intertwined with dialog-heavy scenes of characterization, but that's an easily forgiven issue. The intense action scenes and darker plot make this a more involving film than its predecessor, and the young actors seemed a lot more confident in their roles. The Empire Strikes Back is an exciting film from start to finish, especially during the final thirty minutes when Luke faces off with Darth Vader. George Lucas really knows how to make a memorable climax. Although it does get a little cheesy right at the end, The Empire Strikes Back is a great improvement to its predecessor, and it set a high bar for movie sequels."
769,9,The best of all Star Wars movies,"My favourite one of all Star Wars movies. I like the plot and its facettes really much, the construct of the character involves with the movie and I definitely sympathize with Luke."
770,9,The Best one,"This one might of fallin short with the space battles, but it more than made up for that with the Lightsaber Battles and the plot twists(you now what I'm talking about) and the cliffhanger at the end was a great Idea. the best one."
771,8,Great successor,"'Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' has it easier on the one hand, since the basic characters and the basic story can be taken for granted. On the other hand, the sequel is automatically compared with the predecessor and the pressure of expectation is high."
772,10,"Star Wars, The mother of Science Fiction","I am a chain si-fi movie watcher. What ever I can remember, Stars Wars is the base of all science Fiction movie from Hollywood. All of these things come into play in my position, but I'm mostly analyzing my picks on the effect they had on me, both when I actually formerly viewed them and today. As always, I actually appreciate your feedback in the section below, but most of all, would want to see your rating of the films. With out further delay, on to the list"
773,4,The least imperfect,"Quite like this one. Good director, even better script doctors. Annoying robots have their uses as comic beats, kept mercifully to a minimum."
774,10,Even better then the original!,Empire is a deservedly a masterpiece of cinema all by itself. Let alone as a Star Wars film.<br /><br />It took the world of Star Wars into a fittingly more dark and intense direction. Filled with character depth and gorgeous new landscapes.<br /><br />Empire is the definition of smart filmmaking. It had to live up to an insane amount of hype and it made it look easy.<br /><br />We must never forget this films brilliance.<br /><br />The actors are at their best. The effects are great! They still hold up today.<br /><br />It's plot takes riskier turns and ends up so much more rewarding.<br /><br />It's no Episode V. It's a classic piece of history.
775,10,best of the trilogy,"STAR WARS, obviously the most inspired, barrier-breaking science fiction/adventure movie ever made (thus far), showed us that you could fit your three acts in three separate movies. I think the first one was spectacular, an invitation to a fantasy world unlike any you have witnessed before or since. A very good first act, a very good introduction."
776,10,The one that got us hooked,Along with Revenge of the Sith this is the fastest film in the trilogy. It builds on what we see of the Star Wars universe in the original film and probably got most of us firmly hooked to Star Wars for the rest of our lives.
777,8,a brief evaluation,"After the death star was destroyed, the evil sith Lord darth vader led the army of the galactic empire to search the entire galaxy for rebels, finally defeating them on the icy planet of hoth. Guided by obi-wan's spirit of the force, Luke skywalker went to dagoba to find and train yoda, the jedi master who had lived there since the fall of the republic. Pursued by the imperial fleet, the millennium falcon's captain han solo, his partner chewbacca, and princess leia had to flee to bespin in the cloud city, where they were betrayed to the silver empire by landau calrissian. Vader tried to use them to trap the young skywalker in the cloud city to lure him to the dark side. After a great battle with the sith Lord, Luke is surprised to discover a great secret about his origins..."
778,9,Darker and more mature,"The second 'original' movie proved that you could make a high-budget film with puppets that had heft, tension and substance. It has only gained in beauty with time, and its visual effects are still impressive, despite being over 40 years old. Co-written by Lawrence Kasdan, the script is full of humour and drama. Kasdan would then go on to write several good Star Wars movies."
779,6,Fall of the galactic empire,"Well, many people tend to praise this sixth installment of the archifamous franchise, although analyzing it coldly, it is the weakest of the first three."
780,10,Impressive... Most impressive...,"There's a good reason that the Empire Strikes Back is the movie that is most commonly referred to. It is quite possibly the best movie in the series. It has what could possibly be Hollywood's most famous line (""I am your father.""), and introduces the character EVERYBODY knows and loves, Yoda."
781,9,Almost Perfect. Almost.,"I am sure that it goes without saying, but the Empire Strikes Back is quite simply the best film in the Star Wars franchise. If not, one of the best films ever made. Simply because it does not try to be flashy, it is film-making done at it's finest."
782,10,As good as it gets,Back in 1977 Star Wars was a huge surprise and an excellent film in its own right but The Empire Strikes Back managed to go one better than a Ten!
783,10,You can see it here,that Lucas was starting to lose his touch.
784,10,The best sequel ever made,The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that respects the original film while going in a deeper and darker direction. It isn't something that's easy to achieve but Irvin Kershner was able to do exactly that with this memorable and powerful sequel.
785,,The best of the bunch (sorry Phantom Menace!),"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is one of my favorite films of all time, and was the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. The relationships between the characters is better than ""Star Wars"": I had great fun watching the love develop between Princess Leia and Han Solo. When he was about to be frozen in carbonite, you could feel her pain as she watched him helplessly being lowered into the pit."
786,10,Quintessential Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"In 2002, science fiction can only be described as laden with special effects. Quality stories are few and far between, with a return to the fantasy genre as a last refuge for the scoundrel. The two Star Wars prequels further illustrate this weakness in science fiction. In other words, we are always making comparisons to THIS film, the grandmaster of all modern science fiction films, ""The Empire Strikes Back""."
787,9,A well earned reputation,"Empire Strikes Back delivers a larger scale, more mature sequel that ticks every box. It's darker but still a lot of fun, it's upped the scale and quality of everything it delivers. Planets like Hoth, Dagobah and Bespin have stuck in fans' memories ever since. The main cast all return, just as good as the first time we met them, this time joined by Lando Calrissian, the smoothest man alive, and Jedi Master Yoda who I'm sure needs no introduction. On the villains front, Darth Vader is joined by Boba Fett - a brutally effective bounty hunter of few words."
788,10,The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars Film,"Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, directed by Irvin Kershner follows the incredibly successful Star Wars: A New Hope. This movie is directed perfectly, and is accompanied by such an excellent screenplay. The film starts on a high and progressively builds with even more excitement in every scene. The fact that the characters and storyline had already been established in the first film, it allowed for much more entertaining character relationships and action sequences. The visuals in The Empire Strikes Back are even more impressive, and till this day certain sets are jaw dropping. Also the music by John Williams is outstanding, introducing the iconic Imperial March added a new level of darkness to Darth Vader and The Empire. This film fleshes out its main characters, giving them so much more depth. Luke's training with the incredible Yoda, allowed him to learn important lessons and wisdom. Also learning more about Darth Vader and who he is controlled by makes him so much more complex and compelling. The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars Film. Every person working on this movie was at their creative peak, so therefore I must give it a 10."
789,10,What can you say?,There is no real point commenting on this film so i dont know why i am bothering. Its like reviewing Air or Food. 
790,10,The movie that(in my opinion)is the best ever.,"The plot:Luke Skywalker is now with the rebellion against the Empire and is present on the planet Hoth, an ice planet that Darth Vador has decided to attack in an attempt to capture Luke. Luke is near from death and he sees a vision on Obi-Wan telling him to go to a planet called Degobah to meet a Jedi called Yoda."
791,10,The best of the series,"Pros: Script, story, special effects, characterization, costumes, duels."
792,10,The greatest Star Wars of all!!!!!!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the absolute greatest Star Wars in the series. I am a huge Star Wars fanatic, and TESB has so much in it that makes it such a marvelous movie. It has the best action scenes (the excellent fight scene), the best story (Luke's training, the romance between Leia and Han), the best secrets revealed (""Luke, I am your father""), and the best suspense (Luke dangling from Cloud City). Everything about this movie is gold. It surpasses everything from the others (besides special effects of Ep. 1 and the fight scene from Ep. 1). I cannot find one thing bad or even mediocre from this film. Well, I actually can't find one thing bad about the others, except some scenes from Ep.1 and that huge sphere with the needle sticking out used to torture Leia in the Death Star in A New Hope. All in all, TESB is a magnificent movie which adds another plus in the phenomenal series."
793,10,An Irvin Kershner film based on George Lucas's characters,"Indeed, this is the best film in the original STAR WARS trilogy, but it is not really a George Lucas film, but rather an Irvin Kershner film based on George Lucas characters. Irvin Kershner proves that he is a master at telling someone else's story, yet having time to give his own contributions-- a darker tone, a higher level of character development, and a sense of professionalism. While we must still credit George Lucas for helping with Yoda and the visual effects, Irvin Kerhsner has the highest credit for bringing this story to life! Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriters, creates a screenplay with a darker tone, which in turn gives more depth to Luke Skywalker and other characters. By far the best film of 1980! Bravo, Irvin Kershner!"
794,10,The old starwars trio,"In my opinion the 3 original episodes IV, V, VI are a masterwork, i do see them as the first second and third episodes. I really can not compare them to the newer episodes."
795,10,"""Do Or Do Not. There Is No Try.""","The best science fiction film of all time has its story continued in this just as excellent sequel. By now, I'm sure most people have either seen this or have at least seen scenes from it and you probably all know the story and that it was a huge success. For those of you that have not had the pleasure to view this film, I shall do my best to persuade you to seek this one out. Of course, if you haven't seen the first film, and by that I mean the original 1977 entry, then get that under your belt first so you aren't completely lost."
796,9,The darkest Star Wars movie,"""Empire Strikes Back"" is definitely the darkest and possibly the best ""Star Wars"" movie. It has a spectacular atmosphere, a very well developed characters and stunning - even now after two decades - action scenes. The movie is interesting, breathtaking and very cool. Darth Vader is very evil and ruthless in this movie, Luke is almost desperate and the Empire seems invincible, unstoppable. The final battle between father and son (sorry for the spoiler, but I don't think that anybody is unaware of that) is one of the greatest moments in cinema and very well shot too - the young, almost fragile Luke against the menacing, dark figure of Darth Vader. Truly a great movie."
797,9,A Sci-Fi Epic,"The Empire Strikes Back, the second installment and 5th chapter of the Star Wars Saga,is easily one of the finest Sci-Fi Films ever made. From Darth Vaders epic battle with Luke, to Yodas training, The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest Chapter from Star Wars."
798,9,Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back-Special Edition,"The Empire Strikes Back: Special Edition"" is the second motion picture in the ""Star Wars"" set of three to be re-aced and re-discharged in 1997. The Special Edition incorporates an enhanced soundtrack, better advanced impacts, and a couple of additional goodies of included film."
799,10,One of the best in the history of film sequels!,"I liked this film a lot over other movie sequels, and among the Star Wars films this one is the second best to The Phantom Menace. With a huge success like A New Hope, making a sequel worthy to it was very tough...unless the makers put their mind to it...and they did. George Lucas did not direct this and he found a great direct with Irvin K. who made this film more human in nature than the first film. In fact, character expression here is the best and so is the character development...both the best in the series. You get to see just how natural the relationship of Leia and Han develop, you get to see more emotion, feel pain (like when Han got tortured or when Luke learned who Darth Vader is), and so much more. This film is definitely worth striking back for! Go for it!"
800,7,Very good but...,"Very nice, the plot is very interesting followed by an equally excellent direction. The story intertwines well with the two parallel streaks within the film, however the script sometimes fails to convey the iconicity of the moment as it is one of the most epic fantasy films ever shot."
801,10,"If Episode II is this good, I can't wait","This one will always be my personal favourite of the original Star Wars Trilogy, mostly because it is the best. Everything really came together here; so much so, that even George Lucas didn't change that much for the Special Edition, and what he did change only served to enhance the greatness that was already there. Probably the most notable difference between this one and the original Star Wars was in the writing, by the late Leigh Brackett and the then-neophyte Lawrence Kasdan. Brackett had a great way with a putdown, but not to the point of simply being snarky. Lines like ""I'd just as soon kiss a Wookie!"""" I can easily arrange that; you could use a good kiss!"" serve as punctuation, and not the entire point of the film. This is why irony is dying its currently slow and painful death: a lack of skill and judgement in the use of insults, sarcasm, and other putdowns. This film has the great banter of an old Bogart-Bacall film, which also gave it an edge back in 1980, when so few intelligent films were being released. When the best banter of the year is coming from a space opera, that's pretty dire, but I digress. To critics of my point of view, yes this film is a downer, but that's what makes it so great. As the middle act, it shouldn't have a happy ending, and that's what will be so cool about Episodes II and III. We know the new trilogy is going to end on a down note, but like Titanic, we can't help but watch. If the plot mechanics operate in any way like they did in Empire, it's going to be a good time at the movies."
802,10,You Can't Beat Empire,"Declaring The Empire Strikes Back to be the best of the Star Wars Trilogy is not a unique opinion.  But then it clearly is the best, even allowing for the fact that without episodes 4 and 6 the whole thing would make little sense."
803,8,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980),Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
804,10,A pop culture phenomenon,"Perhaps the best science fiction movie ever made. This movie defines sequels as it is know today. The movie goes light years ahead from the first in every way; special effects that to this day even look better those modern sci/fi movies of today. The characters are defined and the saga really begins in this epic story. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia suffer difficult and effective changes though out the movie. The introduction of Yoda as the tinny Jedi master was amazing, the former smuggler, and Solo's best friend Lando as a two face allied was perfect. The fearsome and imposing Darth Vader with his deep voice is for me the best performance of James Earl Jones ever. The light saber duel between Luke and Vader was dramatic and surprising. And the revelation ""no, I am your father"" it has become a pop culture phenomenon. Empire is the best of all the 6 film succeeding where others have failed."
805,8,A unique point of view.,"I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but, to me, I found Empire to be the, shall we say, least appealing of the trilogy. I know that this sounds bad, but hear me out before you judge me; I have an explanation. I know that most people consider Empire to be the best in the series, but I always found it to be the, for lack of a better phrasing, least appealing. Better than the spinoffs (Solo and Rogue One), which I mostly found to be unnecessary cash-grabs, but still last place in the nine movie lineup. I still love this movie, but there were some key factors that kept it in the lowest position."
806,7,A kids' movie! Whatever.,"Well from the 1977 one, which ofcourse I loved a lot and was trying to convince myself it to be a grownups' movie. But with this one, that came crashing down. It is a kids' movie. But that doesn't matter. I still like that. May be being a kid aswell sometimes is good. I wonder about the chidhood of those baby boomers. It must have been terrific. Nowadays kids' movies are nowhere close to this one. And if it is liked by kids and adults alike, then it is one serious contender."
807,7,Not as good as everyone claims,"Plot wise... well, it's full of holes, like every Star Wars movie. Full of ridiculous ""how convenient"" moments. Full of inconsistencies with the previous movie. And still awful awful dialogue that's just not how people speak to each other."
808,8,Great sequel,This movie made Darth Vader one the most iconic evil guy ever. Rewatching it after Han's Solo movie I was happy to see what happened to Lando. The battles were cool and led to many videogames. Han's romance with Leia had nice progress. Yoda was awesome as a teacher. I would prefer just a better training to Luke. It felt rushed and the results were bad because of it. A great movie anyway that makes you want to see how the trilogy will end. If the purpose was to make the heroes seem in a very bad situation with no hope of winning it succeeded its course. For some reason I enjoyed New Hope more. Maybe I don't like bad guys winning idk
809,10,Good movie until the ending,"Why does the Millennium Falcon fly straight towards Darth Vader's star destroyer after leaving Bespin? In all the vastness of space. And what takes so long to turn on the tractor beam? Why didn't they have it ready before instead of waiting till the last second to prepare to turn it on? Like that scene in Spaceballs: ""Prepare? What prepare? You're always preparing. Just go!""<br /><br />Darth Vader should've choked his whole crew after that blunder"
810,10,The definitive Star Wars film and best of the OT,"The definitive Star Wars film. When one says Star Wars, this is often times the movie that comes to mind. Lucas proves himself to be the master of story once again, and the performances are all classic: Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, James Earl Jones, Carrie Fischer, and many others are all classic portrayals now. The romance is well built, the action holds up well, and the stakes feel real in a gripping third act. The dark tone boosts the gritty aspect of the film even more. Unfortunately the pacing is not perfect as it does drag quite a bit in the middle act, but this film lives on to be one of the most memorable and quotable movies of all time."
811,9,brilliant,"A film made in 1980 with such special effects and sound effects is very attractive. The story of saving the planet is always my favorite. The duel between conspiracy and justice, and cooperation between teams can reverse the outcome and win. The words 3po and dumb R2 are my favorites and a highlight of this film. The plot is divided into two main lines, compact and tense, and more puzzles are revealed, including the big stalk of ""I am your father"" from which. AT-AT the real behemoth and the amazing snow battlefield, etc. Shocking, continued to write Star Wars brilliant!"
812,7,One of the best sequels in the history of cinema,"The incredible, universal success of ""Star Wars"" in 1977 was a big incentive for George Lucas and his squad to deliver a sequel that could cover them in money just like the first did and that could satisfy fans and critics. The final result was (and is) a fantastic movie, arguably the best sequel ever in this kind of cinematic experience. As Lucas left the writing job to his fellow storyteller Lawrence Kasdan (very possibly the real mastermind behind the most amusing lines, considering the awful job Lucas did all alone with the prequels), the adventure is just as iconic as ""A New Hope"", but with a darker and somewhat more mature mood, as the title suggests. If ""Star Wars"" was an epic poem, and in some ways it is, this film should be considered its ""discentio ad inferos"", that is the lowest moment for the hero, who then rises from its ashes and manages to win once and for all (""Return of the Jedi""): both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker find themselves in great danger at the hands of Darth Vader, a character that immediately grows in depth after one of the last scenes, which is also one of the most famous scenes (and worst quoted lines) in the history of cinema and possibly the best idea to come from George Lucas's mind. One possible mistake could have been to recycle our beloved characters in cheap fashion, but instead everyone of them grows and gets more defined through the story and we are introduced to yet some other iconic members of this wonderful universe, like Master Yoda, Lando Calrissian and the baddest bounty hunter ever, Boba Fett. On top of all that, John Williams's music is just as fantastic as the first time around, modelling itself to the more grim atmosphere."
813,10,Empire Strikes Back,Again what can I say about this film other than it's pure genius. This one tells a lot like Luke meeting up with Yoda and finding out that Vadar is his father. The battle scene between Luke and Vadar is fantastic! Great movie I give this 5 ***** stars all the way!!!
814,10,"""No, I am your Father.""",-Edited on 2/5/12- 
815,9,Star Wars Strikes Back...Wonderfully,"The second Star Wars movie ever made, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is on par with the franchise's first installment as a piece of cinema, but it simultaneously sky rocketed the universe to new, fantastical heights."
816,9,Superlatively masterful,"Darth Vader may indeed be the greatest ""bad guy"" in all movie history. This part of the story is his chapter, his finest hour. Everthing goes his way. If you're a betting man, lay your money on the Dark Lord of the Sith."
817,10,Best film in the trilogy,"After I've watched Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, I started to watched the second movie of the original trilogy and it's considered the best film of the series, its Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back."
818,10,great,"The Empire Strikes Back has everything great about Star Wars and then some. It's the best Star Wars movie ever, not to mention one of the greatest movies of all time. It has all the good points of the first movie - action, suspense, comedy, romance, drama - and improves upon them with slightly better effects and a deeper and darker plotlines. Perfection attained. Everyone should see this movie. bye."
819,10,Ups The Ante In Every Way Possible,"Following the monumental success of ""Star Wars,"" this opened up the opportunity for George Lucas to release the final two movies in the trilogy he set out to create. That's not saying that ""Empire"" didn't run into its fair share of problems, but regardless, this feels much more polished than ""Star Wars,"" and that is saying a LOT."
820,10,"""It's like something out of a dream.""","As Luke Skywalker sits in a swamp on an alien world talking to his droid companion R2-D2 he unwittingly gives that most accurate of all descriptions for this movie. The Empire Strikes Back does indeed seem like the stuff of dreams. The images, the music, a beautiful princess, a city floating in the clouds,...the atmosphere is surreal and unearthly. One critic aptly stated that it was hard to believe this movie was even filmed on earth. This epic battle of good versus evil in a galaxy far, far away has elements of all your favorite space, fantasy, and swashbuckler stories. It strikes a responsive chord somewhere deep in your memory. Again Luke says it best with his observation that ""there's something familiar about this place."""
821,9,An all time classic,"The Empire Strikes Back had an extremely difficult task to try and create a film as good as the one before, but it certainly delivers. With a memorable battle in snow to duels above the clouds, it has it all. The pace begins great and never drops."
822,10,Darker and More Interesting Than A New Hope,"This is said by many fans to be the best movie of the original trilogy and yeah I definitely agree with that. The Empire Strikes Back is a much darker, more interesting and more action-packed version of A New Hope. The lightsaber duels are much more intense and interesting. It's much more of a sword fight than tapping lightsabers like the last movie. I also love how threatening the empire was in this movie. In the last movie, they weren't all that intimidating. Here however, they were a little scary! All the new characters are just as amazing as the characters introduced in the last movie. Boba Fett is memorable, the emperor is awesome, Lando Calrissian is interesting and Yoda is a classic character. The old characters are also very well developed. Luke is learning more about the ways of the Jedi, a romance is blooming between Han Solo and Leia and Darth Vader is much more intimidating. The scenes with Yoda and even Obi Wan teaching Luke the ways of the Jedi are extremely interesting to the audience. It's some really clever world- building. I won't spoil the huge twist in this movie for the 3 people who haven't seen this movie but I will say that your mind will be blown! This is a somewhat short review because at this point, I'm just gushing. Just go see the movie you fools!"
823,,It just keeps getting better,It's 1980 and here I am 9 years old and enjoying for the first time a true masterpiece. George Lucas does what no one thought possible. He made a sequel that was better than the first. Ad who can forget the music of John Williams? every time I hear that oh so familiar theme I feel just like a kid again. Thanks again Mr. Lucas.
824,10,The 2nd best Star Wars movie,"It is a fact that this one is the best. But, I disagree with this fact. I think this is the second best. This is my 4th favorite movie. The only Star Wars movie that is better then this is Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. In my opinion. But this is a great film. I love this film. This is the best sequel of all time. In my opinion. I think it is almost as good. I think that the only reason that you guys think this is the best is because Lucas did not direct. But this one has great dialogue, and some of the acting is better. It introduces a lot more of unforgettable characters like Yoda, and Lando, and the emperor. Yoda rocks. So does the emperor. and Lando. It is the darkest of all 6 films in my opinion and the most mature. So, It is a great movie and the greatest sequel ever. MPAA Rating:PG. My MPAA Rating:PG-13. I think this is even darker the Revenge of the Sith. It has some romance. A great lightsaber fight. and don't forget the infamous line. Darth:No, I am your father. I am pretty sure that everyone in the movie theater was shocked from that line. 9 out of 10 stars."
825,9,One of those rare sequels....,The Empire Strikes Back is a large improvement over the original Star Wars in terms of drama and suspense. The special effects are more consistent and more impressive (but this is because of the obviously larger budget).
826,10,To describe this movie. One needs only to describe Lando,"It's smooth, the dialogue is excellent, there are twists, and it's all around an amazing time that can united film buffs, nerds, casual viewers, and snobs alike."
827,9,Flawless,"Hands down, this is the best piece of commercial art ever produced. All the stars must have alligned for this one, because this toy catalog of a movie is also a masterpiece of adventure story telling. It's a damn shame this movie failed to get a nomination for best picture in 1980 though Star Wars got that nod in 1"
828,10,Greatest Sequel To Grace The Screen,"It has been echoed an infinite amount of times before. It has been chanted from the highest hilltops and the most well known critic sites on the internet. It has been said time and time again. Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars movie, but the best movie sequel ever made, and a prime example of how follow ups can match up and even prevail over their predecessors. While I like the prequels and the film that started it all in 77, The Empire Strikes Back has always been the SW film that glowed the most for me and had the best scenes out of the entire saga. It also introduced my all time favorite Star Wars character and my favorite movie character in general, brought to life by a man who based the character's look and facial expressions off his own. The Empire Strikes Back is the ideal Star Wars film for me, and although it received a mixed reception when it was first released, it has garnished a monstrosity of a following these last couple decades and it shines as one of the greatest sci-fi thrillers with loads of twists and turns to quench your thirst. "
829,8,"The Empire Strikes Back, And They Strike Back Hard","Out of the four Star Wars films (Only Episodes 1,4,5,and 6 existed when this was written) I feel that this is the most philosophical of the group.  The scenes with Yoda and Luke remind me of those old kung fu movies with the wise, old master teaching the Art (or in this case the Ways of the Force) to his young and inexperienced disciple.   Those scenes and the battle between Luke and Darth Vader are pure classics."
830,9,Act Two In The Art Of Entertainment  The Search For Skywalker.,"This movie achieved an extremely rare accomplishment in cinematic history  the sequel surpassed the original in all departments. Other examples of this are The Godfather' and The Terminator'. Star Wars' and Godfather' were the next chapter in a trilogy and thus were the continuing story rather than the beefing up of an original high concept movie conceived with the sole objective of cashing in on the appeal of the original. The Terminator' was not planned as a trilogy, but rose above the production company cash in norm by delivering a developed story and limiting action sequences to fall into the context of the story. These movies indicate to us that good stories are fundamental to the long  term audience acceptance. Lucas certainly had this in mind."
831,,The darkest in the series...,"Empire takes us from the bright colors of ""Star Wars"" to the desolate whites and greys of ""Empire"". The film takes place a few years after the first, where the Rebels have been forced to evacuate their jungle planet fortress for an icy hide-out. However, things get complicated when the Empire forces them to escape. As the base evacuates, Luke journeys on a quest to learn more about the force while his friends in the Millenium Falcon become hounded by an Imperial fleet directly under the command of Darth Vader and aided by a group of skilled bounty hunters. This all leads up to one of the most stunning conclusions in motion picture history. Although ""Empire"" is, when you come down to it, a chase movie, it manages to rise above it with stunning visual FX(The effects are so good they were hardly touched up at all for the special editions) and direction by Irvin Kershner. Even Mark Hammil gives a powerful performance as Luke."
832,10,The best one,It's definitely the best one of the saga. It shows how the Jedi are up and coming and the dark side shows signs of decline
833,10,Oh yeah. (Masterpiece's masterpiece.),"TESB is watchable even if you didn't see the previous, first episode (meaning New Hope). That's how I watched it first. Dropped straight into a brutal fictional world of fantasy, cosmos, revelations, philosophy, betrayal, mutilation, loss, love in war, snow, monsters, heroes, dreams."
834,8,"Do, or do not. There is no maybe to watching this movie.","This is definitely better then A New Hope (the first Star Wars for those of you who don't know its name). I think the thing that really made it stand above it was the appearance of Yoda. Also, I think the effects were better(just look at the battle of Hoth). "
835,,Brilliant,"STAR WARS EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is an excellent sequel to the original movie. It is a lot darker than the first Star Wars movie. The story sees Luke Skywalker train to become a Jedi Knight. Also in this episode, Skywalker finds out that Darth Vader is his Dad. I give The Empire Strikes Back a 10/10."
836,9,Worth watching,"Sympathy is induced when we see the back of Darth Vader's scarred and pasty head. When he tells Luke of their blood relationship, some feeling is allowed to creep in, telling us that he is not just some maniacal killing machine, but a human, fallen from grace, yet able to retain some sense of love, however twisted it may be."
837,7,mature sci-fi,"The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars - Episode V, is often hailed as the best of the films. This rests on that it is the least action driven of the 6 films and instead relies on story and dialogue. Yet it is definitely not a s good as Star Wars or Return of the Jedi. It looks likes it will be the most mature work. But it suffers from lacking th e freshness of Star Wars and doesn't the sense of conclusion that Return of the Jedi has. "
838,10,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes.
839,10,"An excellent follow-up, for a cinematic achievement","After Star Wars was released, madness came and invaded George Lucas' professional and personal life. Suddenly, a self-avowed abstract filmmaker was the center of media and fan attention. Star Wars became a hot name in cinema, so a sequel was demanded by almost everyone."
840,10,One of the few times the second picture is as good as the first,"I went to see Empire in an ""Enclosed"" theater this time, drive-in were slowly starting to vanish at this point and just were getting less popular."
841,10,Empire Strike Back Big,"The original was perfect, this sequel out did the original and is by far a masterpiece among science fiction movies. The story brilliant, the acting superb, Lucas at his best, and plenty of Darth Vader and Yoda. I first saw this movie long ago when I was four, and in amazement I became a loyal fan of the STAR WARS movies. The Yoda we see here is a wise mystic who lives on a far off planet and teaches young Luke Skywalker to be a Jedi. Unlike the Yoda we've seen in the recent prequels, this Yoda is far better and is believable that he is a true Jedi Master. Over the years, the original STAR WARS trilogy has been re-released with deleted scenes and still to this day Empire Strikes Back remains to be my favorite with or without the deleted scenes. This Empire Strikes Back BIG."
842,10,Better with perspective,"I believe films that are really worthwhile are proved out by the test of time. One can really enjoy a movie upon it's first viewing, but over the years it may feel dated, or  not as moving or exciting, when put up against both older and newer films in the same genre. Episode V is 23 years old as of this writing, and it's holding up pretty well in my mind. So as we're closing the LOTR trilogy this season, I was reminded of another trilogy - one that sparked the imaginations of many filmmakers to come, and really made films like RETURN OF THE KING possible. After all, if the second Star Wars movie had bombed, trilogies in big budget filmmaking would probably not have been a popular consideration afterward. And so would we have seen movies like BACK TO THE FUTURE with arcing storylines through three films? Perhaps not."
843,5,A flawed classic,"Set nostalgia aside, here are my main criticisms of the film after watching it now as an adult: "
844,7,Disappointing German voice acting in Special Edition (DVD),"One of my favorites of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and I know every line by heart in German and English."
845,9,My favorite Star Wars movie of all time,Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a sequel based on Star Wars: The New Hope and many people say that this film is known to be one of the best Star Wars sequel and one of the best of the Star Wars Trilogy.
846,,The Empire Strikes Back,"For the sequel to his highly successful 1977 space opera Star Wars, George Lucas decided to forgo writing the script and to hand directorial duties over to his friend and professor Ivan Kershner. This is widely regarded as a pretty good move: As with its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back contains many moments of dialog and acting that are highly, uh, stylized, but an effort is clearly being made to bring some humanity to these characters. To give Lucas credit, he continues to do some truly excellent model work and costuming, and his story work on this film expands the Star Wars universe in a number of crucial ways, including the additions of Emperor Palpatine, Vader as (spoiler!) a human and a father, and a batty little lunatic named Yoda. Empire's sense of expansion is sometimes packaged in flashy spectacle--the revelation of the space slug is a particularly great moment-- but often in its more serious tone: as explained by Yoda, Jedi are not just magical flying swordsmen, they are people with a fairly interesting philosophy and worldview as well. For its character and thematic work, it is a crucial step in the series's evolution. Whatever our culture owes to the Star Wars franchise, Star Wars owes to Empire. -TK 8/25/10"
847,9,The best sequel I've ever seen!,"Movie sequels do not often improve the original film. In the science-fiction genre, there are however some exceptions. Movies like Aliens, X-men 2 and Bride of Frankenstein improved their already great predecessors (Many would add Terminator 2, but I won't, because I prefer small budget action-cyber-thrillers to big-budget bonanzas). The greatest sequel (I haven't seen Godfather II and I do not count Return of the King as a sequel) of all time is none other than the Empire Strikes Back."
848,8,The Famous second.,"Well, so many things had been written through the years about this. Gonna keep it moderate."
849,10,THIS is cinema,"I think every movie should take some inspiration from this. Its compelling characters, its love arcs, its perfect structure. This film builds on sci-fi like very few others will. Its climax isn't about the end of the world. It's about our main characters in danger. This film will always hold a special place in my heart, and will inspire generations to come."
850,,fantastic,"Rather then going into how good this film is, I'd like to mention how great a SEQUEL it is, what a great way to set up the 3rd film, this is when sequels were good. If there's a movie better than Star Wars....this one's it, it's perfect."
851,4,Perfect movie soul,Yes I'm born after 2000 but this movie much better then today's star wars . Graphics and visuals are according to 1980s . This sequels story thriller perfectly awesome
852,8,My favorite movie and its AWESOME!,"I watch this once per year, and it never gets old, its just amazing and it is the perfect definition of STAR WARS"
853,10,Amazing follow up and a master class in how to make a sequel,"Although, if we're being fair, this is definitely the movie that made me fall in love with the saga. True, I'd already seen the original Star Wars and even though I'd quite liked that movie, it wasn't until I'd seen this one that I really fell for the saga. And all of this, mainly because, in almost every level, this movie is clearly superior to the original. The tone is darker, the characters' story arcs are better developed ( the love triangle only hinted at in the first movie is finally resolved, Luke's path as a Jedi and his ultimate and painful discovery of his origins), and the multiple twists and turns of the plot takes the story to very interesting places. It's this journey of love and self-discovery, coupled with the amazing use of its visual elements ( production values on this one were clearly taken up a notch) that makes this, not only the ultimate Star Wars movie, but also the ultimate sequel. John William's score is ,once again, astounding. Due to, not in small measure, a very well written script by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, George Lucas's involvement only being in the general plotting of the storyline, the movie gains a level of mastery sadly never achieved with the following sequels. Of special significance are the Planet Hoth battle, the Millenium Falcon chase by the Imperial Fleet through an asteroid field and the ultimate confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Cloud City of Bespin, where it takes place one of the most shocking reveals in cinematographic history.<br /><br />This is clearly an example of the sequel being quite superior to the original. I put it up there with The Godfather 2 and Terminator 2, to name just two of the most popular examples. Great movie and an absolute blast of enjoyment."
854,10,Magnificent Space Opera,"Stunning. ""Empire"" is a magnificent space opera with soaring visuals, enthralling music...and a magnetic spiritual compass. I must agree with those who find this the best SW film. And also agree with those who believe it is one of the BEST FILMS of any genre. It is the SW film that is most watchable over and over, for the sheer beauty and flow of the story. Without ""Empire"" the Star wars saga would be nothing but an over-hyper sugar ride video game. Admit it. This film IS the depth in the series."
855,8,Star Wars,"Totally believable, action/adventure flick, except maybe for the worm in the asteroid and the Imperial Walkers. But what the heck -- you can't have everything. Besides, those Walkers were just another form of tank, and we all understand tanks."
856,,The original trilogy's best,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK C4min****(1980)D:Irvin Kershner.Mark
857,10,"The force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.","This is by far the best Star Wars movie. It's so enjoyable and every part of the movie is great. I do find that most ""middle"" movies out of a trilogy are the best as you don't have to introduce the main characters and you don't have to tie anything up.Han and Leia's romance is lots of fun;it's snarky and flirty and they have tons of chemistry. Darth Vader telling Luke he is his Father never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. You do see Luke becoming more mature in this movie,Mark Hamil did such a great job with him.Even after all these years the effects are still great,they don't look dated and never takes you away from the story. Something I think many filmmakers could use a lesson in,effects should be used to enhance a story,not be the base of the story. While the effects were cool,that's not what I remember about Star Wars. It's about the story and these characters. I truly believe that is why these movies are still so popular and will continue to be for many years to come."
858,10,Darth Vader is my favourite character of all time!,Here's my Review for the Trilogy
859,10,My favorite,I know the rebels lost in this one but still I love this one.
860,10,The best of the series,"This movie is one of the best of all time, and definitely the best Star Wars film. It has it all, great story, space fights, adventure, awesome lightsword fight sequences, drama, comedy and even some romance."
861,10,The Star Wars Saga continues...,George Lucas does it again with The Empire Strikes Back.  The full cast returns for a sequel that is better than the original.  The acting is great the effects are outstanding and story is wonderful.  The special edition is just as good. 
862,6,Empire rocks!,"Episode V is my second favorite in the series,next to III.The Empire Strikes Back covers the Rebels camping out on the icy planet of Hoth,undetected by the Empire.Luke is continuing his training as a Jedi,no longer with Obi-Wan.Finally,the Rebles are forced to flee after being discovered and having an epic battle with the dreaded Imperial Walkers.The voice of Kenobi tells Luke he must go to the Dagobah system to seek training from Yoda.Meanwhile,Han Solo,3PO,R2-D2,and Princess Leia and Chewbacca flee the Empire on the Millennium Falcon,seeking refuge on Bespin,city of the clouds,where Han's friend,Lando Calrissian,betrays them to the evil Darth Vader,who is intent on finding Luke.Luke,meanwhile,trains with Yoda,getting in touch with his Jedi powers.He soon leaves when he sees a vision of his friends dying.He promises to come back.Yoda tells him not to go.Vader then traps Luke on Bespin and they engage in a fierce lightsaber duel,in which Luke learns a terrible secret.The best in the original trilogy."
863,10,The Best of the Series,"Stuck right in the middle of the revolutionary opening chapter, ""A New Hope"" and the action-packed finale ""Return of the Jedi"" came this much darker, more involving tale.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" takes a slower and more thoughtful approach as young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is told by his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi to travel to the Dagoba system, in the far reaches of the galaxy, to find Kenobi's own Jedi master, Yoda. "
864,9,A masterpiece after the first 35 minutes,"This is a great movie, especially for it's time. I think the overall character line up of this film was nearly as good as A New Hope, as whilst Obi-Wan still made some appearances he wasn't in this nowhere near as much as A New Hope, though Yoda in this film makes up for that a lot. The lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke in this was much more better than the duel between Obi-Wan and Vader in A New Hope so it's definitely far better than a New Hope on that. This film has many great parts such as the Dagobah part and some of the spaceship parts in this (particularly the asteroid field part) were pretty entertaining."
865,9,Simple Review,Plot: 9/10<br /><br />Cinematography: 8/10<br /><br />Pacing: 8/10<br /><br />Acting: 8/10<br /><br />Music:9/10.
866,10,"More Like ""George Lucas Strikes Back... With Another Masterpiece!","Yoda once said ""Do or do not. There is not try."" Well, I DO love this movie! The lighting, the costume, the sound effects! Pretty much EVERYTHING is improved upon! And it all leads up to one of the best plot twists in movie history ever!"
867,5,What would you fight for?,Empire Strikes Back takes everything done by A New Hope and improves upon it and it's during these two hours we see the most development for our main characters. All the substantial characters go on a journey in this film where we see just what they'd fight for and why. But more on that later.
868,9,Disappointed in theater but grows to be one of the best,"I remember watching Episode V in the theater back in 1980/81 and i walked out with an uncomfortable feeling that this was just a moneymaking episode and simply not finished. In fact it wasn't, since it was designed to be the dramatic middle-part of the trilogy, which i did not know at the time - i was 14 and had no idea about the trilogy."
869,10,"Now, this is a movie","Made almost 20 years ago this timeless classic holds its own as the best movie off all time. It's not hard to describe this movie, it has everything you want, Action, Romance, Drama, Fear, etc. The story is very well written and you are drawn into it right away. The Special Edition Rocks!!"
870,10,Luke I am your father,While I have not seen this movie in along time I still think it's amazing movie to great classic. people say this is their favorite film and the best in the series well I have to agear on that. The romance between Liah and Han sola was beautiful much well done then in episode 2 Attack of the clones. C3po getting blown up was very funny and seeing him get put back together was also funny as well. This movie gave us best line in movie history and has been remembered since this movie came out to theaters in 1980. 
871,10,The Best-no question,"This is the truly dramatic meat of the trilogy-the one that pulled you into the lives of the rebels. The one that made their cause seem so desperate and so necessary that you just had to see them topple the Empire. An unseemly puppet named Yoda helped put this elaborate saga in historical perspective and brought depth  and mystery to the concept of ""The Force"" that was only touched upon in Star Wars. The genius of the trilogy(yes-it remains a trilogy until Lucas makes up for that Phantom Menace crap) is the way it effortlessly draws you in and immediately makes you forget you're watching a mere""movie"".  The Empire Strikes Back, more than any of the others, is responsible for bringing the whole drama of the saga into people's minds."
872,1,Most overrated movie ever,Its not that good get over it it's not that good get over it just stop
873,9,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) Review - 9/10,"Although it isn't my favorite film of the saga, The Empire Strikes back is an absolute classic, and is known as one of the greatest sequels in cinema history. And I admit that it's better structured than my favorite film in this movie series, A New Hope. I believe this is the movie that best showcases Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford's chemistry, as well, obviously, the best movie reveal of all-time (after Snape being revealed as the Half-Blood Prince, lol)."
874,9,A bit improved,The Empire Strikes Back is a bit more improved from the original.
875,10,The Best of Them All !!!,"Without a doubt the empire strikes back is the best star wars film out of the lot, even the new ones which in my opinion devalue the saga. From beginning to end you watch Luke learn to use the force and become a jedi, you also see the return of a very significant character in obi-wan kenobi. To learn the truth of Luke's father and who he is, is the shock of the decade. From the swamps of the degobah system to the sky's of cloud city this film is an adventure of mass proportions with an ending to rival any film, old or new. Lukes quest to become a jedi takes a twist when he faces darth vader for the first time, when vader breaks him mentally and physically you cant see a way back for our hero. Smuggler han solo is frozen in carbonite and taken to jabas tower on tatooine where we await the next instalment. All in all this is one of the best films ever, what makes it good is the shock of some unwanted news. This film doesn't fail to deliver and is a work of magic.!!!!!!!!!!!!"
876,10,Movie Review By MsClashKing YT,"Empire Strikes back is a great sequel to the original star wars . Empire is a much darker movie and expands a lot of its characters and gives them extra layers . The movie ends on cliffhanger wandering what the hell will happen next .9,5/10 A+"
877,10,Best sequel ever!,"""Star Wars"" broke all the rules for cinema and provided the entire world with a new way of making and watching movies. It also left everyone wondering, how are they going to top that? With ""The Empire Strikes Back"", George Lucas delivered one, and arguably the most successful sequel of all time. ""Star Wars"" was, with the exception of ""Jaws"", the first real blockbuster film, and Empire was without question the first blockbuster sequel."
878,9,Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,"By far, the best of the Star Wars saga! The film surpassed Star Wars fans' expectations in 1980. It surpassed my expectations, too. The classic scene that includes Luke Skywalker battling Darth Vader. But he is clearly no match for Vader. Vader forces Luke to believe that he is his father, ""No, I am your father. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy together as father and son!"" James Earl Jones fits the voice of Darth Vader very well. Mark Hamill fits the role of Skywalker very well, also. The Empire Strikes Back has a lot more Darth Vader scenes than Star Wars did. It featured a lot more action including more light-saber fights."
879,10,My favorite movie,"The story, the characters, the music, the situations, the special effects, the visuals-- Everything in this movie was pure genius! Every single second, every single frame of film is just stunning in my eyes. And with the Special Edition came a few new things that add to the magic."
880,10,This is what movies were meant to be,"I love the empire strikes back. Because of four words, ""I Am your Father"". Not only unexpected, but totally surprising and apalling. It just draws you into this film, you forget you are watching a movie. There's really no word to describe such an experience. It is so amazing that movies become such perfect masterpieces sometimes. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is jammed full of character growth, drama, evil. The best part is... this is a cliffhanger movie. What will they do? How will they escape? Will they survive? Perhaps it's a great film that can leave you wanting more. But while leaving you wanting answers, you will want to watch the movie over and over to re-experience the pure darkness and discoveries. So many backdrops in this film personify this movie. The Matte paintings and/or sets of Dagobah seem very dark and almost ominous. Just a hint of the sublime add a lot to what was not there before. if anything, the movie is unparalelled in it's mastery of what the cinema was originally intended to show. At least, it is still a damn sight better than phantom menace."
881,,Still the greatest Sci-fi movie I have ever seen,"I will admit that I have missed the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I will also admit that I fell asleep after 45 minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey before I turned it off.  That being said, this is still (by far) the best sci-fi movie I have ever seen.  The slower, more methodical and more pleasing pace that was missing in Star Wars is on full display here and not one second of this movie stinks.  From the rugged and thrilling intro on Hoth to the awesome space pursuit of the Milennium Falcon to the wonderous Cloud City and all points in between, Empire has drama and heart that many sci-fi movies tend to lack.  Harrison Ford as Han Solo steals the show with an incredibly romantic performance and the other actors get great chances to stretch.  The plot is deep but also very wide open at the same time with rest periods that Star Wars lacks.  The same gripping intensity from Star Wars is still onhand however.  The visuals are beyond stunning and run the gamut.  Indeed the movie feels like it lasts years instead of hours.  The cosmic drama continues between Luke and Vader while the other characters fill in the rest of the pieces.  Yoda is possibly the most beloved character in film history while Darth Vader is one of the most reviled.  Incredible and the best in the genre that I have seen.  Maybe I'll give 2001 another shot when I'm not so tired."
882,10,My favorite movie of all time!,The empire strikes back took everything from it's predecessor and made it even better. This movie has the characters from the last movie and vastly improved them while introducing new characters. The empire strikes back has a lot more iconic momments and an iconic twist. And the empire strikes back is hands down My favorite Star Wars movie and my favorite movie of all time!
883,4,Very Disappointing Sequel,This may contain spoilers.
884,10,Best of the Series.,"There's not much to say about this film that wasn't said in ""Clerks"". But I do have to say that it is very difficult to make a sequel better than the original and Empire surely did that. In many ways it is the very example of what a sequel should be; something that carries the characters further and in a more serious direction without loosing the feel of the original.  That is, of course, the main problem with The Phantom Menace. It completely looses the mood of all of the previous films.  Empire is dark, rich, and a wonderful piece of work to watch."
885,9,"The pinnacle of the ""Star Wars"" saga","The year is 1980.  With ""Star Wars"" already engrained into popular culture shortly after its release (much like ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is today), fans were left to ponder what the sequel could offer. Three years after the release of the original, they found out.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" delivers a strong emotional punch.  Unlike its predecessor however it is not an uplifting and feelgood film.  Far from it in fact. ""Empire"" is a dark, brooding and somewhat surreal film, bristling with conflict and drama.  As a result it stands head and shoulders above its prequels and sequel."
886,10,Best of the trilogy!!!,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is about as close to perfection as a movie can get. Along with ""The Godfather II"" and ""The Two Towers"", ""Empire"" is perhaps the greatest 'part 2' in movie history. Better story, better action, more humor and one of the greatest shockers ever. Who can ever forget, 'Luke, I am your father'. This is one those movies that can be watched over and over and over again. If only the new trilogy could come anywhere close to this."
887,10,"My favorite Star Wars movie, and one of the best movies of all time!","Almost after every classic which has been fortunate enough to top the box-office, collect rave reviews, and be beloved by so many fans as well as common movie-goers! The thing that follows almost every time is a sequel! And 80 percent of the time it sucks... 15 percent of the time it's alright... And 5 percent of the time it's awesome and arguably better than the original! For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of those 5 percent! And for me it is slightly better than the original, and one of my all time favorite movies! Following the worldwide success of Star Wars, Lucas quickly published that he would be writing a sequel, using ideas he couldn't fit in the original movie. This time Irvin Kershner would be directing the Star Wars flick. It went on to gross about as much money as the original, and it preceded the expectations for a Star Wars sequel! "
888,7,Very good,"Very well done film with some great directing, likeable characters, and the most famous plot twist in cinema. Only problems were that some of the acting wasn't very good and while as said, likeable, the characters could have some more development. I would say that I recommend this film if everyone in the history of the universe hadn't already watched it"
889,,The best Star Wars Film,"""The Empire Strikes Back was not directed by George Lucas, but by Irvin Kershner and he has indeed directed a masterpiece. If you can say that any of the Star Wars films were underrated, its this one. If you get pass the special effects, you will find a wonderful love story and a story of a boy coming of age and finding out who he truly is. "
890,1,One of the worst in the history and OMG so much overrated,The Star Wars movies were the worst movies of all time. 
891,10,The greatest sequel of all time!,"""Star Wars: A New Hope"" was above and beyond the best movie of all time when it came out. And it is known that sequels are not often worth the tape they're printed on. But ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" proved that wrong."
892,,The greatest of the saga,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an astoundingly good movie that holds up well to repeated viewings.  Although I consider myself a ""Star Wars"" fan, I feel that this is the only GREAT movie in the saga.  The cast was excellent with Mark Hamill doing a good job as the conflicted Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as the wise-cracking Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as the take-charge Princess Leia and Billy Dee Williams as the suave and treacherous Lando Calrissian. Also along for the ride are Frank Oz as the wise Yoda and Peter Mayhew as the lovable Chewbacca.  However, Darth Vader COMPLETELY steals this picture. This is one of, if not the greatest film villains ever.  David Prowse has remarkable presence in the Vader suit and James Earl Jones is positively chilling as the dark lord's voice. I give this movie 10 out of 10."
893,10,The perfect Star Wars movie. The perfect action adventure flick. The perfect film.,"It's now an accepted fact that the first Star Wars is regarded as one of the most, or amongst some communities, the most successful movie of all time both in terms of critical acclaim and box office gross. Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe."
894,,Best of the trilogy!,"I can remember seeing The Empire Strikes Back back in 1980 when I was about six years old.  I went to see it with my family and they sat through it a second time because I wanted to see it twice.  They were all asleep by then, but I was faithfully awake, being completely blown away by the heroics of Luke, Han, and Leia.  The visual effects in this film were outstanding. Like the Millennium Falcon being chased through he asteroid field.  The attack of the AT-ATs at Echo Station.  And the Millennium Falcon flying towards Cloud City.  As a child, I always wondered how they created that remarkable location.  Cloud City was the highlight of the film for me and remains until this day.  George Lucas has a brilliant mind and will undoubtedly make Attack of the Clones (still trying to get used to that title) a must-see film for next summer."
895,10,I don't think I'll end up calling this one the best in the trilogy. I used to.,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is brilliant. Never has a sequel so elaborately outbeaten an original in quality! I rank this one up there with the greatest films of all time. Original version: 10/10. Special Edition: 10/10. I shall never forget this one."
896,10,The best movie I have ever seen.,"I think that it is the best movie out of the trilogy and it is the best movie I have ever seen. All of the main actors are excellent in their roles and it is the movie that expands each of the charactors. The plot is well structured and leaves you  wanting more, I enjoy it every time I see it."
897,10,"the best , and this coming from a trekker and new dune fan","are you kidding : one word : perfect . the Empire Strikes Back did just that when it came out :) Harrison Ford was at his best , Carrie Fisher never look more beautiful , Anthony McDaniels was funny , R2D2 was great and as well as Chewbecca , Mark Hamill was perfect as Luke Skywalker ; too bad for the original cast it had to end so soon . Revenge of the Sith came close to being perfect , it had flaws ."
898,7,honest account,It really does seem that over time some movies do tend to take on an aura that is not worthy of them. The fact that the Empire Strikes back has gained such a following is evidence to this. The film has holes in its story the size of its budget and many of the roles are painfully one dimensional. If this movie was released today it would receive the same rubbishing that the two newer installments received and it would be well deserved.
899,10,The Best Episode,"This one is as good as episode 4, but in a different kind of way. The adventure is there, the action also, the comedy too, but this time around the plot contains a lot of tragedy, that's a new one, and it leaves you with a nostalgic feeling, because it doesn't have a happy ending."
900,10,The Best of the Star Wars franchise,"This film is the Star Wars film that will always serve as the bar to which all Star Wars films that are released must strive to reach. The story is darker than the first, more interesting than the first, and has so many iconic moments that it is impossible not to think of them when you think of Star Wars. Amazing acting, characters, set pieces, effects, new worlds, arguably my favorite lightsaber duel in Star Wars, and plenty of great plot twists, this film is a truly legendary film."
901,10,By far the best Star Wars movie,"""Empire Strikes Back"" is a wonderful example of how much better a movie can be when it's not directed by George Lucas.  Lucas, as witnessed by most of his movies, including the latest ""Phantom Menace,"" is a genius at creating astonishing imageries and forming a spectacular visual setting for the storyline to work through.  However, as far as storytelling goes, Irwin Kershner does so much better."
902,10,This is not a film. This is a fantasy.,"In 1977 when Star Wars came out it was the biggest thing to happen to movies in a very long time.  Star Wars was a science fiction film that focused on escapism rather than scientific lore that usually weighs down other sci-fi films.  Instead of explaining everything through the actors dialogue Lucas just showed us with sophisticated direction, set designs, and special effects.  Still if it was not for Empires Strikes Back the Star Wars saga would not have achieved the level of pop culture status that it now enjoys, for if it was Star Wars that introduced us to the worlds and the main characters of the original trilogy it was Empire Strikes back that gave us the entire theme of Star Wars saga.  It clearly showed us the struggles of the good and power of the evil.  The empire is just not a government body to be despised but to be feared as well.  The Empire is a collected evil who iss everywhere.  The story also reveals much more in terms of who Luke actually is, of his gifts, and how he could be a candidate for either good or evil.  As well it hints at the connection between Luke and Leia and of course reveals the Luke and Vader connection.  "
903,10,Just wow!!!,"Don't know how they did it, especially with the sequel curse, but I would say this is even better than the first movie! The acting was stellar and there were more jokes tossed around. The Hoth battle was fantastic and is one of the best scenes especially from the time frame the movie was made in. New characters were introduced as Han and Leia's love grew. It was especially hard to say goodbye. But then the ending Darth Vader being Luke's father was just an amazing plot twist!! Highly impressive!!!"
904,9,The Best of The Trilogy,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes 4-6).  The characterization is exceptional, we've all come to love and hate, Luke and Vader. The twist at the end was widely talked about during its release."
905,,The Best the 4,"This is the best Star Wars film made because it is the only which covers the emotional side which film should.  ""Star Wars"" and ""The Return of the Jedi"" were well done and somewhat emotional, but this film has far better character development.  Harrison Ford dominates this film and it is his ""Han Solo"" which makes it what it is.  His humor, his loyalty to Luke, and the relationships which are developed with Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca are superb.  His descent into carbonite is the only point in any of the four films, with the exception of the death of a major character, when I feel the sense of loss.  We are meant to feel loss only when Jedi die but Solo's freezing is the most powerful moment of all three films. This is truly the greatest film of the greatest trilogy ever"
906,10,Strong is Vader...,"The story is very dark, far darker than the first.  This film introduces many new exotic locations as well as a few new characters such as the Jedi Master, Yoda.  The film has one of the finest climaxes of any film I've seen.  The movie shows the true power of the dark side and the evil of Darth Vader.  The music is just as good as it was in the first, here we are introduced to the notorious Imperial March.  More is done with stop motion animation but other then that the special effects are just as good as the were in the previous film.  Do yourself a favor and watch this classic."
907,10,"Simply my favorite movie, ever. (SPOILERS)",(SPOILERS)
908,8,Simply the Best,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" belongs to that rare breed of sequels being better than their hailed forerunners. There is more suspense than in ""Star Wars"" (1977), there are deeper developed characters than in ""Star Wars"" and it is better written (Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett no less!) than ""Star Wars"". After all, and especially after that computer animated waste of anyone´s time called, among other things, ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999), the suspicion that George Lucas might have invented the Star-Wars-Universe but isn´t its major artistic force is rooted in evidence."
909,10,Part of the Greatest trilogy of all time!,"This movie is Together with Star Wars (1977) and Return Of The Jedi (1983) my favorite movie of all time. These 3 Films have great Music, great characters, Great special effects that still hold up today, great story, great action and great world building. Now let's talk specific about this movie. The opening of this movie is spectacular. And in this movie we're introduced to Yoda who is one of the best movie characters of all time. We also have the greatest plot twist of all time. And this movie just does exactly what a sequel should do: Raising the stakes for our heroes and battle them to their lowest point. So then our heroes had battle their way up again making the ending of Return Of The Jedi all the more satisfying. So this movie also makes the movie coming after it look better."
910,10,One of the great sci-fi films of all-time,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is not just the best installment so far in the ""Star Wars"" saga, it is arguably one of the best sci-fi films of all-time. This is what science fiction and fantasy films are all about."
911,,"Star Wars was Japanese, Empire Strikes Back was Greek.",Sometimes there is so much beauty in this world that I feel my
912,8,George Lucas strikes back,"After the classic Star Wars (as it was originally called in 1977) he knew that there would be a chance of a sequel that could outmatch it,but the Empire Strikes Back did just that with skill and the intensity of the suspense that was put into the audience and even the greatest turn of events in movie history ever,just the plot of this film put me onto the edge of my seat for most of the film. I still imagine putting myself in the action at the Battle of Hoth and meeting the cool and lovable Yoda that many even non star wars fans have come to adore and just the intensity when Luke fought Darth Vader and found out he was his father changed the way I looked at films made me want more and I still find this better than the first and will ever praise this film."
913,10,Now my fav. of the trilogy and maybe of all,"When I first saw this movie as youngster, I thought it was good, but i was into the Action Packed Star Wars and Return of the Jedi better, but now i have a different outlook of it. Now it my fav of the series and probably of all movies. It has deep meaning to it. The scenes with the all-knowing Yoda and Luke. There also were some good action sequences on Hoth, the Icy planet. But the duel between Vader and Skywalker is one of the best sword fights EVER! If there is anyone out there who is reading this and hasn't seen this movie or Starwars, then see them all NOW. As a matter of fact, u can probably bye them for a cheap price as a set at your local Best Buy or where ever."
914,7,"7.4/10 Easily Irvin Keshner's best film, even if it isn't as good as the original, or as innovative","The Empire Strikes Back is often viewed as one of the greatest films of all time, just like its predecessor, and even better than Star Wars, but I personally prefer the first one because the action is much better. The cinematography is not really impressive, which makes the action hard to see."
915,9,good film,Its a really cool film I can recommend it to you If you like smth like that.
916,10,The best of the trilogy,"I like this one because it has the best plot of the three. I specially like that since its the second of a trilogy it has a dark ending. This movie develops the relationships between the characters very well. And like all SW movies it has great Special Effects, that is amazing after almost 2 decades. The introduction of well known characters (Bobba Fett and Yoda) and many other things that are already mentioned in many comments make this one a must-see for anyone who hasn't seen it"
917,10,Still holds up,"Just saw the special edition of this movie again last night after a few years, and I'm still amazed by it.  Easily the darkest and most dramatic of the star wars films (and the best), highlights include the opening hoth battle, the asteroid belt chase and the final lightsaber dual between Luke and Vader.  The special edition actually adds to cloud city, making it seem much larger and open and enhances its feeling.   The added wompa creature scenes are not as effective, but do not really detract from the film."
918,10,The Perfect Sequel,"The Empire Strikes Back is the definition of a perfect sequel does everything a great sequel does while also making it unique and different from the first one. It expanded the world of Star Wars giving us new planets and new ideas to explore and also made the characters more interesting by adding more layers to them and adding new characters who are also interesting. It also expanded the Star Wars universe more by making the villains more interesting and relatable as well. The action and music as well is step up from the first giving you so much more in this amazing universe. Overall it's not just a perfect sequel but a perfect film as well with nothing wrong about it's perfectly paced, perfectly acted, perfectly written, and just perfect that's really how I describe this movie and it's one of the best of all time. Overall grade= A+"
919,,Another Great Star Wars Film,"The Empire Strikes Back is another great Star Wars movie. It has great action, great story, and more. It's great to see Harrison Ford (one of my favorite actors) in a great movie."
920,10,Perfect blend of sci-fi and fantasy. Light years above the other Star Wars pictures.,"How do you follow up the most successful science fiction/fantasy film of all time? Make a sequel that's bigger and better than the original. Not only is The Empire Strikes Back better than A New Hope, but it completely blows it out of the water. The first Star Wars film started it all and paved the way for the second installment, but essentially it was a fairly bland and simple space adventure with great special effects. Return of the Jedi, which followed The Empire Strikes Back, was also a weaker film. Empire is clearly the best film of the original trilogy. So much in fact it transcends the other films and it's easy to appreciate the film out of the context of the Star Wars universe. While the first film was too cartoonish and the third too unbalance, the second hit exactly the right note. The story picks up several years after A New Hope. The Death Star is destroyed and the rebels are hiding at their base on the ice planet of Hoth. The Empire is hot on their trail with a zealous Darth Vader combing the galaxy in search of them. From the very start of the movie it's one big giant chase. Unlike the other two films, Empire gets the big battle out of the way in the beginning so that it can slowly build down until the climax. It's a reversal of the typical adventure film arc and it works perfectly. In Empire all of the characters are fleshed out and become as real people, whereas in A New Hope they just served the storyline. There's the classic Greek mythology pathos going on with the battle between good and evil. There are also many shades of gray in the film, as the characters drift in out and of good and evil, and face difficult decisions. Out of the entire trilogy the middle film also features the most impressive and elaborate sets. Over the course of two hours we are taken into four different worlds, the ice planet Hoth, the swamp world of Dagobah, an asteroid field in space, and Cloud City. All four locales are entirely impressive. The lighting is another key factor in the film's vibrant look. Lighting becomes the most flamboyant towards the end of the film during the dusk looking scenes at Cloud City. Finally something must be said of the epic lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader that makes up the film's climax. It's the best duel in any of the films. Storywise there's a lot on the line, but it's choreographed and filmed so well it wouldn't matter how it ties into the story. It's the dirtiest and grungiest of all the duels. It's nice to actually see the physical effects of fighting for a change. In the other films the characters are pretty much stoic but here we get to see Luke grow out of breath, tire, bleed, and have his cloths torn. He stumbles around, expresses emotion, and even gets a few nice on-uppers on Vader when he's underestimated. Ultimately it's a wonderful way to finish a great film. Also I should mention the good performances from Billy Dee Williams, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford."
921,8,A fantastic epic,"I am a Star Wars fan since I was a kid and it's very hard to watch this film critically after all these years. What I was wondering throughout this viewing is why does this movie work as well as it does. It really shouldn't... The dialogue and acting is average, the special effects aren't picture perfect, the plot is as old as plots come yet I felt compelled to watch and be entertained. I was enthralled with this movie once again. Perhaps, its the simple cinematography that doesn't really try to do anything special but just works, maybe its the simple hero story of growth and learning, maybe its the chance to live in this entertaining and strange world where meeting a green little creature can change the tide of the film. This movie instills a sense of hope to the viewer. We somehow know everything will be OK, the heroes will live another day, which is really strange as the plot of this Star Wars is all about the failures of the heroes, the failure of Luke, the failure of the rebels... but the movie leaves a slight glimmer of hope that makes all the difference. This film hearkens back to a simpler time, where films were simple and enjoyable and people liked that with a childish sense of naivety, but hey, we should all be children once in a while."
922,,Best of the saga!,This is my favorite Star Wars film. 
923,10,"Writer talks about Star Wars movies influence, Joseph Campbell and new myth","All, Like many of you, I'm a fan of Star Wars. Since I was born in 1977, I'm what you might call a Star Wars baby. At least that is what my mother told me. Star Wars has been a part of my life for years."
924,10,The most anticipated sequel of all time.,"The movie that flipped the cinema world on its head. The most anticipated sequel of all time. Everything about this movie is bigger and better than the first. We go deeper into the galaxy and the characters that live in it. So many memorable scenes and lines that will leave you with a warm and broken heart. Empire proves that a sequel can be better than its predecessor. Although darker in tone, it never loses its sense of adventure and thrill that fans got in the original. And lets not forget the greatest twist in cinema history."
925,,A link between Ep 5 and order of the phoenix.,Right this might seem a little left field but bear with me. If you have read Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix and seen the movie then see what you think of this.
926,10,1000000/10,"Not just the best star wars film ever made, one of the best films ever made"
927,7,I'm your father,"I am a stubborn person and I do not understand the first time. Trying to comprehend the popularity of Star Wars, I sat down to the second part, which is actually episode five. So, the characters are still the same, special effects are still made of plasticine and cotton wool, meaningfulness and psychology are zero. Well, maybe they will reveal the inner world of Luke Skywalker to me? Or depict the love story of the princess and the rebel pilot Han Solo? Or will Darth Vader finally take the bucket off his head?"
928,9,The greatest story ever...gets better,"Arguably the best of the Star Wars trilogy, Empire Strikes Back continues the trend of Star Wars: A New Hope with more of the same hit specials and story.  Without wanting to give away spoilers, this film simply has all the twists and turns one would never expect. However, make SURE you have seen the original before you get to Empire Strikes Back, or you won't have any clue as to whats going on."
929,10,The greatest blockbuster of all time.,"Simply put, The Empire Strikes back is virtually flawless, and easily my favorite film of all time. Combining the epic story, iconic characters, and wonderful imagination of the original Star Wars trilogy with the masterful character driven direction of Irvin Kershner results in a breathtaking cinematic experience. It can be considered a masterpiece all on its own, and this is in large part to the superior storytelling techniques on display."
930,10,Who says the sequel is never as good as the original?,"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the films that breaks the rule about sequels. This film is just as good as Star Wars, and many people think it is better. I think Yoda is the key to the success of this film. You gotta love him. This film has more action in it as well as more humor. An absolute triumph. "
931,10,The Dark Side compels you to see this movie!,"Most sci-fi fans, and just plain ol' SW fans agree:  This movie is the best of the original trilogy.  I have yet to see attack of the Clones, but if TESB is any indication AotC will be the best of the prequel trilogy.  The Empire Strikes back provides much more action than the first, and provides some much more interesting landscapes than Tatooine did.  Bespin provides a nice look into the technology and spledor of the SW universe.  The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian pays off big, as the audience is given a better development of Han Solo.  In addition, the character development continues, and gives more insight into the desperation of the Rebel Alliance.  The Battle of Hoth is very well done, and easily outdoes the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.  If, for some reason you have been living on the moon for the past 22 years, SILENTLY get a copy and watch it, for the ending is one that no man should be told in advance. I unfortunately was born in 1984, and so by the time I was old enough to watch ESB, i knew of the ending's shocker.  The best SW movie is feinately one to cheerish and will live on forever in the SW saga."
932,10,The best movie of the trilogy!,Don't ask me why I liked this movie better than the others...
933,8,the love impulse very frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict,"For a generation that grew up in the 80s and 90s, here is the nightmare of childhood and the emotional scar upon the life of many a middle aged adult. The gulf between good and bad, the black and white of youth and innocence has been riped apart in a moment of time and all that is left are the shades of grey. ""You killed my father"" shouts Luke as he battles Darth Vader ""no Luke Skywalker"" he replies ""I am your Father"" So the enemy is not with out, but within."
934,9,Excellent,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."
935,5,"Sequels are hard, aren't they","Was really excited to see this after seeing the first one and really wanted to like this... But sadly it's deminishing returns with retred elements from the first movie and relying too much on you having seen the previous one (a movie should stand on its own, that's why we have movies, tv shows and mini-series). The puppetry is amazing and practical effects are good, but the action is so lacklustre and definitely doesn't hold up. Too bad the movie is mostly dumb slapstick comedy and action."
936,10,How do you follow a classic? By making another classic,"""Empire Strikes Back"" took what ""A New Hope"" had started and completely blew it wide open, a film that is equally as good as its predecessor, if not better, and that is some feat for any sequel."
937,3,The most overrated movie in history,"After a strong start at the Battle of Hoth, the entire movie takes a turn to extremely boring."
938,10,Praise for The Empire Strikes Back,"The Empire Strikes back is the second film in the renowned Star Wars trilogy.  Being the second part in a three part saga, it was naturally the darkest of the films.  But, that does not make it any less a part of film history. It was one of the most successful sequels ever, continuing the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo.  It also included many key points in the story. In this film, Luke Skywalker truly begins his Jedi training, and cuts it short, something that will plague him for years to come.  Luke also confronts Darth Vader, and finds out that Vader is his father, the most dramatic moment in the film, and when he loses his hand. Princess Leia and Han Solo finally fall in love, only to be captured and separated when Han is frozen in carbonite. Leia is driven by her love for Han for the next year, unable to let him go.  Han is frozen, unable to move, in the clutches of Jabba the Hutt.  This is the beginning of a wonderful romance. This movie has done a superb job of continuing the Star Wars saga, and deserves every ounce of praise that has been thrown at it.  Then again, I'm probably a little partial."
939,10,AT-ATs ROCK...,"The Imperial Walkers approaching the Hoth Base is the greatest opening scene in the history of sci-fi/action/epics. Empire is nearly as good as the first and the score is equally good. It remains my 2nd ""most watched"" movie and probably always will. This, in my opinion, is probably the only one of the 3 originals to benefit from the ""special editions"". The ""Wampa"" scenes are much improved. Incredible on the big screen. There should be a movie house somewhere that only shows Star Wars movies...all day...every day. Maybe Lucas could put that in his will? What do you think? I give it 10/10."
940,10,Almost as good as the first.,"This one is exelent and almost as good as A New Hope.  The only thing that brought it down for me was the fact that it was so depresing. In this one the Rebles have been driven onto a remote planet called Hoth. The Impeials find the base and lay seige to it.  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammiel) gose to Dagobah to complete his jedi training by master Yoda (Frank Oz), while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mahew), and C3P-O (Anthony Daniels) flee to Cloud City which is owned by an old ""friend"" of Han's, Lando Calrision (Billy Dee Wiliams).  The climax much more intense than the last (so is the rest of the movie). Again exelent preformances by Mark Hammiel, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams, along whith the rest of the cast.  Again George Lucus is an exelent story-teller. This isn't as good as the last just because it's so dark.  I give Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Striks Back 10/10"
941,10,The best movie ever made!!!!!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best movie of all time. Star Wars (A New Hope) and Return of the Jedi are both amazing but they don't match up to this masterpiece. First of all, The Empire Strikes Back has the best acting of any of the three. Harrison Ford is perfect for the role of Han Solo and creates most of the character atmosphere. Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher also give out solid performances as their characters change through out the entire movie. I also believe that Darth Vader's part in this one is a bit bigger then the other two."
942,10,My favorite Star Wars episode,"This is my favorite Star Wars episode.  This is like the most important episode in the trilogy because this is when Luke Skywalker begins to train in becoming a jedi.  Also because it first introduces Yoda and he tells you about the force.  What it is, and how to use it.  Without this episode, a lot of people will be lost.  They would be like, ""What's going to happen if Luke get's mad?""  Obi-Wan tells him to never use/get hatred because that leads to the dark side.  "
943,10,The Most Absorbing Fantasy of All Time,"The Empire Strikes Back is that rarest of films, a sequel that is superior to it's predecessor.  Thrilling, eiree, magical, funny and involving.  Fans of fantasy/adventure simply cannot ask for more than this. Director Irvin Kershner creates a modern day mythology that lingers in the viewers mind long after the credits roll and the lights come up. The upcoming LORD OF THE RINGS films are building up alot of anticipation, but I doubt if any film in that much awaited trilogy can live up to the towering acheivment of Empire.  This film is quite simply the best of it's kind."
944,8,2nd Star Wars movie is the best of the lot.,"It's the 2nd Star Wars movie far as I'm concerned, don't care much for the creator George Lucas re-jigging the order of the movies nor re-jigging some scenes in the original 3 movies decades later. It's the best of the lot, including all the new movies in the extended Star Wars world. It's a great story and has this intimate but epic quality to it that makes it feel real yet mythical at the same time."
945,8,One Of The Best Sequels All Time,"Dark, potentional, pure and exciting, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best sequel of all-time, or better, it's the second or the first best sequel."
946,10,Star Wars V The Empire Strikes Back,This is very dark. I like dark-films. Plot is very good. Effects good. Actors are great.
947,10,Highly re-watchable,Ahahaha the early days of star wars were gold and this one is surely it's highlight
948,10,A darker tone - epic plot twist,"This sequel to the first Star Wars - (whoops, Ep 4) was even better. Again I don't consider Star Wars original, there are SO many sci-fi tropes its ripped off. But it made science fiction go mainstream and the rising tide lifted all the boats - too bad they were mired in the ""New Wave"" and didn't know enough to get out of it in time to feed the public wanting Adventure sci-fi."
949,8,Do... or do not. There is no try.,Everything that could be said about this movie has already been said.
950,10,Empire,"My favorite star wars movie to date, have to wait till December if it's the best ever in the star wars universe, loved it from beginning to end"
951,8,"A Slow Burning, Character Driven Film That Puts The Heart In Star Wars","Star Wars - Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is a slow burning, character driven movie that really puts the heart in Star Wars. There's not too much action present, but that's lots of romantic moments, and amazing dialogue showing the characters grow and mature. The musical score is some of the best in the franchise, with the themes really hitting hard in a lot of moments. Han and Leia's relationship really grows in this film, as their stranded in space on the heels of the Imperial fleet. Luke finally gets some proper, though unfinished, training. Yoda is back in this film, cleverly testing Luke's patience, and finally deciding to train him. It's overall a great film."
952,9,The best Star Wars movie EVER,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars film ever. It beats out all of them. The only reason that I pick Empire is because it is so dark. Until Esipode 3, Empire was the darkest of all the Star Wars films. Empire has it's own style, Darth Vader is badder than ever and Luke learns that Vader is his father. Out of all the people in space, why does it have to be this guy? It has all the great music that every Star Wars film has, and it also has some love in it too. Yes, yes Han Solo and Princess Lei fall in love. Who would have thunk it? And another thing that adds to this great film....the GOOD GUYS LOSE! YES! They lose. Vader is the king of the hill when the movie is over, Han Solo is frozen, Luke has only one hand, and Lei...well nothing happens to her. Empire is the SW film you need to see."
953,9,The definitive sequel to a modern classic.,"The first Star Wars was a film about adventure - the wishful desire and the rushing excitement of it. It provided the audiences with a sweeping cinematic experience, as they experienced the galactic adventures alongside their iconic characters: Luke the Hero, Han the Renegade, Leia the Princess, Obi-Wan the Wise One, C-3P0 and RD-D2 the comedic duo. The characters were nothing more than archetypes, but this enhanced the immersive nature of the story, because the audience could see their own traits reflected in each character in a galaxy far far away..."
954,10,Also perhaps the greatest movie ever made....,"A New Hope set the standard in movie storytelling and special effects.  The Empire Strikes Back blows that away.  A New Hope and The Empire Strikes back, to me, are about equal in their greatness, but for different reasons. While A New Hope was great because it was the first that broke new ground, The Empire Strikes back is great because it broke new ground while having an almost entirely different story, mood, and flavor than it's predecessor."
955,10,MY ALL TIME FAVORITE !!!,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best movie I have seen of all my life ! It has an amazing story, great actors and jaw dropping special effect. Irvin Kirshner did an outstanding direction !! The scenery is an eye candy. This movie has one of the most reminded ending ever : ""Luke, I am your father"". It is full of fantasy and imagination. Who said that sequels sucks ???"
956,7,"The worst of all four movies so far, but still OK. I'll tell you why.","One spoiler for The Phantom Menace here, folks; same one as on the back of the soundtrack, but less precise."
957,,Anchor of the saga,"A movie viewer is treated to the full emotional spectrum with this masterpiece. Much more so than the other movies, it has an incredible cliff-hanger appeal. Lucas, in the Malten interviews, explained the nature of the ""middle film"" in a trilogy. This movie serves to take the protagonists and throw them into the most desperate situation imagineable. For this reason, this is the darkest movie (as of yet--look for Episode III to be the ""Empire"" of the entire saga)."
958,10,"R2D2 didn't activate the hyperdrive, Vader did","Although R2D2 was told that the hyperdrive was deactivated, it was made clear by C3PO that R2D2 had ""illusions of grandeur"" in thinking it could reactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. Also, notice that Vader was trying to reach out to Luke (on the Millennium Falcon) showing signs of a ""father/son"" bond. The clincher is when Vader is looking at the Falcon and the hyperdrive is suddenly activated. Shortly after, the Admiral, who was to have deactivated the hyperdrive, is taking one big gulp awaiting Vader to punish him for this screw-up. However, Vader solemnly walks out of the room with no show of anger."
959,10,The best sequel I've seen thus far...,The Empire Strikes Back has got to be the best sequel film thus far in motion picture history. The main thing that makes it stand out is the fact that it is very dark and different like Citizen Kane. Han & Leia's love/hate relationship is a great detail among the many other great details in the film.
960,10,quote from clerks,"Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."
961,3,game,"As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away."
962,,LOOK OUT!! PRETENTIOUS REVIEW BELOW.,"To many, this is the best of the saga, mainy because it concludes aspects of a New Hope and sets up the action for what commences with Jedi. But it feels like the coldest (yet is also the most mature) of the saga. It easily betters Jedi (although it's not quite as complete) but rejects the niave charm of a New Hope in favour of operatic grandeur. It is easily the most serious, even including some bizarre Freudian imagery (the dream sequence when Luke chops Vaders' head off, the mask dissappears, and Lukes' face appears underneath) and some genuine wisdom from a little green thing called Yoda (Do or do not- there is no try'). The humour is almost completely absent and lacks the leisureley pace of the first film, and the sense of drama doesn't meld too well with some of the wooden one liners. But what does make it a very near standout of the saga is the levels to which it brings the good vs. evil' concept to- here, Luke is seen as a confused figure of identity, and the revelation that Vader is his father (I presume all of you have seen this anyway- no spoilers here) is completely devastating to someone who believes that goodness, purity and heroism manifests itself so strongly within him that something as evil as Vader couldn't possibly be his father. The fact that Vader tries to corrupt Luke the same way he himself was corrupted, but Luke manages to refuse the temptation of power- shows that evilness is a form of corruption rather than something which we carry in our blood. And did you see any of these valuable issues raised in the Phantom Menace? No. Do you know why that particular film sucks when compared to this one? You should do by now. This is the adult, more grown up interpretation of what Star Wars is all about, and is whithout a doubt the least compromised  9/10."
963,10,Best movie ever,"The stakes are super high, it's super fast pace, the duel in the end is Well made and looks beatifull, the soundtrack is one of the best things John Williams have made. Yoda and Han is so funny! The movie has several iconic Lines, Hoth Dagoba and Skycity is very cool locations. The story leaved many good questions and expanded the universe."
964,,"Sure it's great, but as good?","For me this will always be the 'tease' of the original trilogy. Starting with a spectacular battle, then slow middle (even though Yoda is introduced) and killer ending(laying the foundations of the star wars saga for the next 20+ years). It's a great movie don't get me wrong. But out of the trilogy I feel this is the weakest as there is no payoff. It is totally dependent on what is apparently according to many, the weakest of the trilogy, ""Return Of The Jedi"". I know so many who say this is the best simply because of the style. But is style any substitute for story? Which is where the problem of Empire lays. A story where nothing is realised. That doesn't begin for 100 minutes where we finally learn 'the truth'. Don't get me wrong I love it, but not as much as Episodes 4 and 6. I think people have forgotten their initial reactions to it due to the fact that we now have a conclusion with 'Jedi'."
965,9,The Golden Middle Child,"There's a reason that sequels of a certain breed are complimented as going the ""Empire Strikes Back"" route. Often described as 'bigger, better and darker', it's certainly an appropriate description of Empire. It succeeds by taking the most successful elements of A New Hope and minimising its weaknesses, while expanding the world."
966,8,"great movie, but still overrated","There's no doubt that this is a great movie and was revolutionary for its time, just how every Star Wars has been, even Episodes I-III, but definitely overrated. Least appealing action, no great up-close one-on-one battle, and definitely does not meet the standard of Return of the Jedi. It was a necessary aspect of the trilogy and can't be left out because of many necessary plot lines, but similar to Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers, drawn out. I don't even believe it would rank second in the new episodes that have been released in the past ten years that are far more revolutionary. They were part of the first movies to be filmed digitally and bring the most character development and bring the story full circle. Out of the 6 released Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back finishes in a dismal 5th."
967,10,Luke Skywalker is trained to be a Jedi Knight and must finally come face-to-face with Darth Vader where he will find out that nothing is as it seems.,"I consider that Empire Strikes Back is the best movie in the Star Wars series (well, at least from the 5 episodes that have been released up to now). It has all the elements of a great movie: great performances (surely better than the previous Episode IV Star Wars), a good story, suspense and more..."
968,10,My favorite of the original trilogy,"This is one of my favorite of the old Star Wars movies. The fight scenes are brilliant and the characters are well acted. Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2, Han Solo, and Chewbacca are all back a -gain, and better than ever! There is only two new characters- Lando Calrissan and Darth Sidious. (You only get a glimpse of him)."
969,10,Maybe Obi-wan didn't tell Luke because there was a gag order on the results of the paternity test,"My personal favorite of the original Star Wars trilogy -- in fact, it's my favorite among all six films -- The Empire Strikes Back is one of those near-mythological sequels to best the original. This is all the more remarkable because it is the sequel to Star Wars: A New Hope, a classic in its own right."
970,10,Best of the original trilogy,"Among all the Star Wars films to date, you can't beat ESB for suspense and chills.  Impeccably written & shot.  Also, this film's lightsaber duel improves tremendously on the original's - go back & watch A New Hope, you'll be surprised at how awkward the Kenobi/Vader duel seems.  This film's duel is the first multi-level one, and the effects flow better.  Bring back Kershner to direct Episode II!!"
971,10,Lucas is some kinda genius in the world,"In a new hope, the wizard behind the scenes capable of using special effects tricks on a lower budget to create a mythological world from his mind was a suspected genius. Well, Empire confirms that Lucas wasn't a one trick pony and confirms he is a genius in the cinematic world through vision and special effects. This time with Empire we get to see more of the rich galaxy from Lucas's mind and a better emotional tone than the first film which i felt was too lacking considering the genocidal actions of the imperial forces. While some people defend the lack of better emotional reactions in a new hope i argue that emotional reactions validate cinematic hardships. Well, In a new hope, Luke had begun to develop a bond (he wanted to be a Jedi like his father) or tie to his father who had fallen but he doesn't know the revelation ahead of him. Obi Wan the only person to truly help Luke understand who he is and where he comes from has died but his tie to Luke is still there helping him early before Han rescues him. We begin to see more of what the force is and Hans character development too in the rescue. The musical score also adds to the films tone which is something the first film didn't have enough of..i know for some the beautiful music as luke looks toward the sunset was enough in a new hope but since the emotion was off everywhere else i thought a musical score could have helped out or even a pensive stare later lol In empire strikes back we have the dreaded empire theme preceding Vaders 1st appearance in the film. Iconic music!. Before Luke uses the force in the beginning we hear soft music that precedes Lukes force use in a life or death situation.its actually emotional..we begin to see the force is about feeling. Later on Yoda hints to young Luke of the force, all of it and how scary it can get. Force users can succumb to darkness. Vader was once a decent person. Yoda tells luke you will..you will be.. (afraid)..Yoda warns naive Luke basically to help him on his journey because the road ahead is extremely arduous, physically and emotionally. Every force user faces fear..yoda trains luke as much as possible given the time..luke knows his friends are in danger yet despite all warning luke chooses his friends over yodas and obi wans warning. Luke is actually seen as reckless but imo he is facing fear and runs to it actually. I can go on and on how empire strikes back is a fantasy masterpiece in space..everything has been said about this film and why it is historic. There are cinematic moments the world will never see or hear again. Period. Yes the plot isn't perfect, but it is how the story was told..even better than the first film mind you fantasy films are difficult to pull off..The only fantasy world that i can think of off the top of my head with decent characters was the earlier seasons of game of thrones. Fantasy films are not easy to pull off given the 2 to 3 hours time given. Lucas created a masterpiece in over 2 hours.<br /><br />With all being stated, Empire strikes back revealed that at his best George Lucas is a visionary genius and the world will likely never see such an original story told on the big screen like this one."
972,7,A great Star Wars film but a misunderstood legacy and impact,"The film is really good but i have some mixed feelings though. The fights are based part of this film, but the worst part is the romance like agh George why can't you make a good romance? I know this has a great reputation in the Star Wars franchise I could say the same for me but, the pacing and it tries to be too big of worldbuilding. I<br /><br />would rank this a 7 but it's still a god movie."
973,10,Thank god this came out on DVD,"I grew up with this movie. This movie was my favorite movie for almost all of my youth. Star Wars was it when I was a kid. Everyone had the toys, costumes, everything. Empire Strikes Back was huge because you had already seen great characters and a really cool villain, and you really wanted to know what was going to happen next. Sometimes you don't care, but this, you waited and anticipated and when it came out, it didn't disappoint. I thought it would blow my mind and it did. The Hoth planet was my favorite part of the movie. You see Luke training and of course Yoda. I don't like fantasy movies (I don't think you can call this sci fi) but every now and then I can handle a little. Looks great on DVD. I like it even more now."
974,10,favorite movie ever.,"I will be the first to say this isn't a perfect movie but it's very close to it. This one follows up Star Wars which was so great at the time that it would be hard to follow it up. But by god they've done it, not only a good sequel but better than the original. Yes there are a few nitpick moments but they're overshadowed easily by all the great things in this movie."
975,10,What a Twister!,"Nobody expected The Empire Strikes Back to live up to the quality of the original Star Wars. But surprisingly, its as good as the first (or forth)"
976,8,"Leigh Brackett is what made this movie good, not Lawrence Kasdan.","I think the real reason The Empire Strikes Back is such a good film is because it was written by Leigh Brackett, not Lawrence Kasdan. I believe all the major story ideas and plot points of Empire came from Brackett's draft and were later adapted, by Kasdan, into the final screenplay. Had Brackett survived and continued working on Empire, it probably would have been even better."
977,10,Quite simply the best movie ever made ...,For 10 good reasons ESB is the best movie ever:
978,10,Can't get much better than this,"As far as movies go, The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars film. It's arguably the most important one, as it builds up the story arc with all its little plot twists, including a surprise ending that ranks right up with Usual Suspects and Sixth Sense. Of course, everyone in the world knows about Luke and Vader now, so I can only hope people can keep Keyser Soze's secret a bit more secret. Anyway, it's really kind of a letdown that Star Wars was nominated for Best Picture but ESB wasn't (just try and name the 1980 winner, go on). This is the finest sequel ever made, much better than Godfather II, and it deserves not only a few Oscars but a lot more money too...it's been knocked out of the Top Ten, a fate that no Star Wars film deserves, especially the best one."
979,1,Bad one.,Worse dead movie it is. Unsatisfactory unethical things it does to your feelings. Not a good realization of science fiction. Dumb characters.
980,10,Awesome! But not the Best,"Well I better get this off my chest. I do not think this is the best Star Wars, It's more like 3rd best. Nothing to sneeze at. I love this movie but I shall not give out any spoilers. One of the bad things about Star Wars is, you already know the plot because it's been parodied so much. If I have to name what the best thing this movie did it's definitely Yoda. Worst thing this movie did: That tiered out ""I am Your Father"" cliché. Which has became soooooo annoying now it was funny 20 years ago not any more!"
981,10,Best movie ever. No contest.,People who know me ask me what my favorite film is. They expect me to say Star Wars knowing what a big fan I am. While Star Wars remains the movie that made me love movies in the first place it is Empire that cemented them.
982,10,The Movie That Made Star Wars,"In 1977 Star Wars Episode IV, the revolutionary sci-fi fantasy film, played on screens all over the world and changed the word cinema as we know it today. Star Wars gave new meaning to visual appeal and opened an entire galaxy of aliens, heroes, villains, soldiers, and legends to everyone everywhere. With inflation accounted for, Star Wars still stands as the best box office hit ever. But despite all the accomplishments of Star Wars Episode IV without the success of Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back the Star Wars series would never have reached the longevity and greatness it has today."
983,10,The peak of filmmaking,This film is truly a masterpieces. It deserves all the praise it already receives and should continue to receive praise.
984,9,CGI Jabba in new edition,"Doesn't REALLY contain a spoiler in terms of plot, just image, in case anyone hasn't seen updated version (is that POSSIBLE?)...."
985,10,My absolutely favorite movie of all time,"Not just the best Star Wars movie, it is the best movie of all time. This movie is more darker than ANH and ROTJ. Yoda and Vader arr the best characters and my second best lightsaber duel is in this one. And not but definetly not last. Luke i am your father beats everything else."
986,10,"This film is no less spectacular than ""A New Hope""","Of all the movies that have had follow-ups to the original, many just had sequels made only because the first was successful enough for it.  First thing to know: ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is NOT a sequel.  A standard ""sequel"" is simply the same or similar characters from one movie put in the same or similar situation to the one of the original movie, which is complete without any sequel (Jurassic Park, Speed).  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was pre-planned, and while ""Star Wars"" did seem like a complete story by itself, that was a result of creator George Lucas' uncertainty of whether or not they'd be given the opportunity to complete his saga of stories. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did an excellent job as the film following ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", because it strived toward the same excellence the first one achieved, while the mood of this chapter contrasted that of the first entirely.  The first one definitely had a lighter sort of mood to it, as far as the action among the rebels.  This film concentrates more on the war itself, and how tough it is on the rebellion.  It also has more establishment of the imperials and their ruthlessness, which definitely adds a darker tone to it.  Score composer John Williams helps give this feeling to the film, with the now famous Imperial March that is so closely associated with villain Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  For a mood this dark, there sure is a lot of really nice scenery in the film, from the glaciers of the planet Hoth to the spanning cloudscape of Bespin.  The special effects remain as amazing as those in ""A New Hope"", and have been re-done with a ""Special Edition"" as well as the first one, although not as much has changed in this film.  The acting is also just as good as it was in the first one, with the addition of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).  The emotion of this film definitely surpasses those in ""A New Hope"", with the characters' personalities and relationships explored more deeply, such as between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and even Luke (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader, who for the first time have an actual face-to-face confrontation with each other in the unforgettable lightsaber duel.  This film is even more suspenseful and action-packed, with an incredible climax and other very high points as well. Of all the intense and breathtaking aspects of this film, the one that everyone has remembered since, and will be remembered for as long as ""Star Wars"" itself, is the revelation by Vader to Luke, which most people already know by now.  If you are one of the very few who don't, don't do anything until you see this film (and the first one, too) and find out from the movie, not from some loud-mouthed friend, the way many of us did.  As hard as it would be to make a film as great as ""A New Hope"" after it changed the standards of filmmaking forever, this film definitely meets and surpasses the first one.  It will also leave you hanging for the trilogy's final film, ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), which also does not disappoint in any way.  A SECOND must-see for science fiction fans, or movie fans in general."
987,10,"Oh where, Oh where has my Star Wars gone.","Well...here we are 30 years ago to the date. This film is every bit the masterpiece it was when I was 14, & it still keeps me entranced at 44. It also bears some very unhappy truths as to where this franchise has gone over the years. This was the film out of the original trilogy that Lucas had very little to do with and it shows. It shines above all the rest as the fans favorite of all favorites. One of the main things that are forgotten about the original trilogy is that these films had very wonderful characters. Those cardboard creations of so called characters in the new films cannot stand up to the band of ragged rebels struggling against the oppressive Empire. The action is brilliant & helps the story instead of being pointless & an excuse for CGI overkill. I can only hope that once the Lucas legacy is passed on, new blood will continue on to breathe fresh air into this awesome vehicle of fantasy. That the directors of tomorrow won't be so self gratifying & think of the responsibility to fans foremost. Every time I see another Clone Wars rehash I wonder what happened to X-wings, Tiefighters, the Millennium Falcon. Han, Leia, Chewie & Luke. Where are MY characters? How long do we have to be tortured with stories about a self absorbed brat who becomes a tyrant, & a bunch of substance-less clones & goofy comedic robots(totally absurd). Get out from behind that pile of money Lucas & give us back OUR STAR WARS!!!!!!"
988,9,Amazing movie!,"Movie is just very great, i don't have anything bad to say about it."
989,10,Shadows of the Empire,"Star Wars, having barely entered the world's screens, became a classic of cinema. The history of the confrontation between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire has captured the imagination of millions of people. The audience simply demanded that the creators continue."
990,9,The Best Star Wars Movie,"This is the best of all 5 Star Wars movies.  With this came the rare sequal that isn't just a redo of the previous movies, but brings something new and different from the first.  In this, we get a startling revelation (well, at least in 1980 it would have been startling; that thing's been so spoofed, you'd have to live in a hole in the ground to miss it; but anyway, I digress), a question to tickle us for the next sequal, the best battle in all of the Star Wars movies, and a love story between Han and Leia.  This was more of an original story than the other sequals, since the story line revolved more around the individual characters than a great threat to the galaxy or a planet(Ep. 6:  A Death Star, how original; Ep. 1:  Naboo under attack).  The acting was good and the special effects were good even for an '80s movie (especially for an '80s movie).  Overall, best of the 5."
991,9,The Saga Continues,"Not only is 'Empire' as good as the original 'Star Wars', it surpasses it by light years."
992,10,"The best of the three (really, the best of the six)","What a movie. I remember crying when I found out that Vader is Luke's father (Granted, I first saw this when I was six, but still). It is easily the darkest of the original trilogy - nothing good happens to any of the heroes, but plenty of bad things happen. On the plus side, the rebellion lives to fight another day, and certain relationships are enhanced, and our main protagonists characters are further developed."
993,10,Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back,"The rather dark of the original trilogy starts on the planet Hoth, an icy, cold planet where the Rebels have set up their base camp, and the Empire goes to destroy it.  After a really cool Snow Speeder vs. Imperial AT-AT and AT-STs, the movie takes an entirely different course from the first, and at the end, revealing a secretthat would rock Star Wars devotees worlds (as to what the secret is, we know it's that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father). This ""episode"", not written by Lucas, but by Leigh Brackett, is, what some may call, the one that broke the rule.  That rule being that ""Sequels are never as good as the original.""  I'll admit, I differ from them slightly.  Toward the end, I found myself anxious for it to end (probably because I had to use the restroom).  Upon further viewing (and time alotted for restroom breaks), I found it much more enjoyable. The enstallment offers a lot more than the forementioned surprise, but it introduces several characters, a small, swamp dwelling Jedi Master named Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz), the sleazy ruler of the cloud city of Bespin, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and a faceless bounty hunter, hired by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo, named Bobba Fett.  This is truly a worthy installment in the Star Wars Trilogy. A"
994,10,The Best Movie,"The Empire Strikes Back is quite simply the best movie that I have ever seen.  The acting is well done, the story is captivating, the scenery is amazing.  The Empire Strikes Back begins after the original Death Star has been destroyed.  The Rebel Alliance is still, however being chased across the galaxy by the evil Galactic Empire.  In this episode, the relationship between Han Solo, the coolest freighter pilot ever, and Princess Leia is beginning to evolve into a love story, Darth Vader's master is at long last revealed, Yoda, the wise Jedi master is sought out by Luke Skywalker at the instruction of Obi-Wan, and Darth Vader makes an announcement that will forever change young Luke's life.  The lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke is one of my personal favorite action sequences in the Star Wars universe.  The Battle of Hoth is another memorable action scene where the Rebellion must defend their base against the Imperial forces.  I gave this movie a perfect 10, and hope that everybody goes out and rents it hundreds of times."
995,10,"""Only a fully Trained Jedi with the force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor""","The sequel to George Lucas' fantastical Science Fiction story ""A New Hope"" has a dark and excellent follow up in ""The Empire Strikes Back""- my favourite film of all time. Who could ever imagine that Darth Vader lord of all evil, was once Annakin Skywalker soft-spoken, noble Jedi Knight and most of all Luke's father. We have the debut of Master Yoda, ostensibly a comical character but in truth a deep and thoughtful Lord of the Force If you Haven't seen Empire with it's dark battle between Vader and Luke at the Climax, and the opening for the sequel at the end then my feeble minded friends you simply haven't lived."
996,9,An even more fluid and fun ride than the first one.,"Tomorrow night at Midnight I will see the next chapter in the saga that is Star Wars.  Tonight I watched them all again to refresh my memory of what it is all about to give a better viewing of Episode II: Attack of the Clones tomorrow night at 12 am. 	I initially saw Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on its opening weekend in a small theater in Crescent City, CA as a touch more than a neophyte movie aficionado.  Hitchcock flicks were my favorite at that time.  Hitch is still one of my favorite past filmmaker with Hawks and Capra close seconds. These days my tastes lean to Scorsese, Aronofsky and the Coen Brothers. Coppola, Speilburg and Lucas are very good, but to me are more great craftsman than great artists.  All have had artistic successes (The Godfather, Schindler's List and THX 1138), but I think they are better craftsman than artists over all. 	Lucas is by far one of the greatest producers and craftsman of all time and has done more for true independent film than possibly any director/producer since Chaplin.  I also feel strongly that Empire is a far better film than Star Wars with tighter pacing, dialog and performances all around.  The was a fluidity that the first one lacked and feel that was built in was not only what was ""tight about it"". 	The ""weaknesses"" of Star Wars as a piece of ""art"", or even craft is dwarfed by its emotional impact and timing of release.  I was ten when I saw it the first time (several weeks after it was released) and I had to share a seat in the front row with my younger brother who didn't like me much at the time.  Once the music started and the words rolled up the screen we didn't care and loved every single second!  All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was ""can we see  it again dad, can we see it again dad..."". I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day.  This is amazing since my town had only one theatre/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I  did.   The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85). 	My point is that emotional attachment, or detachment to a film is equally important to what a person may think of it critically as a piece of art, or entertainment.  I have loved all the Star Wars films and have seen them all except for the first one on its opening day and even the first show of that day with the last two!  All that said however, I wouldn't call any of them ""great films"".  Important and amazing films, ""Hell Ya!"".  Some of the best rides I have ever had, ""Hell Ya!"".  Worth watching all in a row every now and again, you bet. 	Episode V is more of a love story and character developing episode IV which is why it tends to be many folks favorite thus far.  Knowing it will be a blast and finding out that Vader is really Luke's dads only bolsters it.  I think Jedi is the best still and part of that may be the fact that I knew that Blue Harvest was really Star Wars III (episode VI) when they shot all the wonderful ""forest"" scenes.  I didn't watch them do it, but knowing it was happening and that the speeder chases were truly impossible (since I lived and played Star Wars in those woods), yet there they were right in front of my eyes. This may be why it still has the strongest hold on my heart!  I don't think that the story of Jedi significantly better than Empire, but I am more into temptation, redemption and what is and is not destiny which is more deeply explored and acted out in Jedi. 	Love one, love them all it is tough to chose."
997,5,Overrated,"Same weapons used to open a massive hole to escape are barely doing any damage when shooting at each other. Sword battles what you expect to see when you give kids sword toys. Dialogue almost nothing. Story predictable. Falling from higher than a skyscraper, not even a scratch. This is poor writing with no complex characters or complex history. Even GOT season 8 has better writing than this. The animal froze to death but skywalker survived despite laying done with nose/mouth exposed. Empire soldiers miss about 99.9% of the time. 8.6/8 7 for this looks more like nostalgia rather objective scoring of a screenplay, dialogue or action scenes."
998,10,Best Star Wars movie,Empire strikes back is a masterpiece of a movie great action scenes great plot and the greatest movie reveal and the coolest villain in darth Vader who literally defeats the heroes rather easily And also introduces yoda and is easily the best of the original Star Wars trilogy
999,10,An improvement in every way,"Pros: this movie is better than the original in everyway... the actors show more, the action has tension and suspense instead of being fun and fast paced, The music is the best in the franchise, every character from the first is expanded upon and the new characters are fleshed out really well too.<br /><br />It's dark, sad and better than the first"
1000,7,Star Wars V,"A fun, slow, action-packed sequel that makes fans fall in love with the Star Wars saga again. This was a very good, and perfectly made film if you compare it to other films that were released around its time. The movie was one of the most loved Star Wars films ever... but I can't really agree on that. As I mentioned before it was kind of slow, but still surprisingly enjoyable."
1001,5,The Empire Strikes Back,"It's a good movie.. I can see that, I'm just starting to think star wars isn't really my thing, I'm not really interested in the characters. I'm sure for the 70s/80s it was pretty revolutionary but now I'm not so sure, I think nostalgia very much clouds the reviews of the first trilogy. However I'm still gonna continue the series and finish all the movies."
1002,,Achieves a strong overall mood.,"Of all the Star Wars episodes (#3 yet to be seen), this one achieves an overall mood.  Despite the wide variety of settings and worlds, there is a certain Je ne sais quoi about the whole film, in every scene.  You really feel that space is vast, stronger than all the other Star Wars films.  The good guys are helpless from the start, and there isn't really any contrived plot twist or fluke circumstance that saves them.  The story is made believable by the variety of conflicting agendas between (and within) the empire, the bounty hunters, the rebels, and the director of cloud city."
1003,10,Worthy successor,"I must imagine that making a sequel to 'Star Wars' must be like trying to follow Johnny Carson in the Tonight Show. How do you follow up an act that was so well received and set the standard so high? There is a such thing as warming up an audience. It's a totally different matter when you blow them away. In these days, when it is customary to believe that sequels have no chance to equal their predecessor, all one has to do is point to 'Empire Strikes Back' to reject that notion."
1004,9,"It's the story, stupid","Disney-led, CGI-rich episodes hit the bottom since they missed the point."
1005,,Gives sci-fi a good name...,"""Empire"" bypassed the cheerful adventurousness of the first film to where the forces of good suffer dearly and the ultimate force of evil in the film is discovered to have personal ties in the life of the hero. This is ""grown up"" Star Wars and the best written. With the personal and relational battles we as human beings face in life, it's disheartening when evil triumphs over good and when the bad times outweigh the good ones. But that sort of thing is a reflection of how real life works sometimes. This film mirrors that fact effectively. "
1006,,The installment that all Star Wars movies should be judged by,"The original Star Wars was a great movie in it's own right, but the sequel blew that out of the water!! Empire was and still is, so far, the best Star Wars installment to grace our big screens. The plot line was superb and really made for a hell of a ride for us to enjoy. The character development in this movie, from Han to Leia, Luke to Vader, Lando to Han, etc. was perfect. The special effects were taken to a all new level of intensity (the Hoth battle is still one of the best battle sequences ever--real or not). And John Williams' score is phenomenal."
1007,,The darkest movie in the trilogy,"This was the darkest and weakest movie of the trilogy. It was a great sequel, but Return Of The Jedi was even better. It was a fall for the Jedi. That's why they called the third movie Return Of The Jedi because the Jedi ""struck back."" You should see this if you have seen the first one, but it's not the best. A ** out of ****."
1008,10,Best of the trilogy,"This movie is the best of the three. Better lightsaber sequences, and better effects. The realtionship  between Luke and Yoda, especially when Yoda tells Luke not to leave, but he leaves anyway, was great. Han and Leia get a little bit of action, and C-3P0 gets pushed around. The ending was a complete shock for me. I never thought a sequel can be better than the original, I was wrong. A great film, I suggest for everyone to see it. 11/10."
1009,1,There version of The Empire Strikes Back,"This two hour version is a terrible war movie, very violent and I wouldn't want my kids to go through what we went through watching these six piles of garbage. The Empire Strikes back 30 minute version that Garry Hixon put in his files after Innerspace, is really really a masterpiece. Unfortun- ately Disney would not allow it to actually be released. I only get about 30 hits a day on my 4 videos and im sorry to say, don't have the money to release too many more, but there's always hope. I really enjoyed the exp- erience in 1980, but I was a dumb kid, stoned on marijuana and acid. The computer graphics were very avante-garde at the time. Its definitely a love story compared to my version, but is is very long, and very boring. There version of THE FORCE is levitation, which is not the force. The force is feeling it, feeling it, and not using the ability too often, then levitation is possible. Thank you Disney, love Cinderella."
1010,,The Empire of Star Wars Strikes Back Once More!,"What could possibly be criticized in this movie, great action scenes, fabulous story, outstandingly funny dialogue, basically everything a Star Wars movie should have,"
1011,10,**** out of **** / 10 out of 10,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" may be my favorite film of all time. It is certainly the greatest science fiction film ever made. This film has every thing going for it. It has a wonderful and complex story line, brilliant special effects, and wonderful music from John Williams. The imperial march score is one of the greatest film compositions in the history of film. The acting in the film is excellent as well. It is significantly better than the acting in the two most recent additions to the Star Wars saga. The characters in this film are delightful, particularly Yoda as the great Jedi Master. Every scene he is in is extraordinarily interesting. If this film isn't my favorite film, it is certainly in my top three alongside ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and ""Jaws."""
1012,8,The best of the whole trilogy,Darth Vader beats Luke and everything seems to work for the Empire in its quest to destroy the rebels.  Prehaps the best of the whole trilogy. Definitely worth the praise.  Special effects are amazing and even the script works.  Yoda jedi master is introduced and the puppet is the most endearing character in the whole trilogy.
1013,,Man's Finest Achievement!,"In 1982, when I was the lowly age of four, I was introduced into the world of movies. The first film I saw was to have a profound effect on my life: The Empire Strikes Back."
1014,10,"The Greatest ""Star Wars"" film of the all","The original ""Star Wars"" was, without a doubt, one of the most important motion pictures in the history of cinema and still holds up well today as light entertainment. However, its sequel, ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" goes beyond the fairy tale cheeriness of the original, choosing a much darker in depth path. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca are all back in this installment and in top form. Lando Calrissian and Yoda make for some welcome additions to the series. The plot keeps the audience of edge the whole time as the Rebel Alliance is dealt a devastating blow by a vicious attack by the Galactic Empire. While Luke Skywalker furthers his quest to become a full fledged Jedi, his friends Han and Leia are desperately trying to out-maneuver the scheming Darth Vader who holds a dark secret in Luke's past. THe cliffhanger ending will have you pumped up for the next installment, the lesser ""Return of the Jedi."" This is more than just a ""Star Wars"" movie, this is a great motion picture."
1015,10,"Best of the Originals, 3rd best of the Saga","You might have read my previous reviews on Star Wars movies and that The Empire Strikes Back is behind ""Jedi"". However after watching all of the saga in this past week I have concluded that this was better than ""Jedi"", but still not as good as Episodes II and III."
1016,10,The greatest sci fi film of all time,"Empire Strikes Back is the prime example of how to do a movie sequel; it furthers the story,raises the stakes, expands the characters and universe, goes in daring new directions, improves the technicals and fixes any of the flaws found in the previous film. Empire is a lot darker than its predecessor and this helps to heighten the drama and make the story more compelling as now we truly see the threat the empire can impose. It becomes more though provoking as a philosophical side to the force is introduced. New, equally iconic and beloved characters are introduced, characters like Yoda, Lando and Boba Fett. This is also the film that truly defined Darth Vader as one of the greatest villains of all time as not only is he made more intimidating but also more complex thanks largely to the infamous twist. Yet the film still manages to be just as fun as the original as we have great space battles and the greatest lightsaber duel of the entire saga. Yet what makes these action scenes so cowling and exciting is our emotional investment we have with the story and characters, you will laugh, cry, feel tense and cheer, once the end credits roll you'll be emotionally drained."
1017,10,The greates Epic ever banned on Film!,The problem with this picture is that it is nearly impossible to top it.
1018,10,More Powerful Than You Could Possibly Imagine,"Who'd have pegged Irvin Kershner as a likely candidate to take over George Lucas's trashily popular STAR WARS franchise? Luckily, the decision was made and Kershner turned in what is, by a long stretch, the best of the series. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a breathless chase movie but, unusually for this series, plot is allowed to intrude on action and the actors seem to have suddenly found some character. The whole thing is infused with a wonderfully dark operatic quality, greatly assisted by the rich and imaginative visuals. Movies like this need a good hissable villain and Dave Prowse and James Earl Jones as (respectively) the body and voice of Darth Vader turn him into a truly frightening nemesis (rather than the cardboard cut-out he is in the other films), all of which serves to give the whole enterprise a weighty centre that was completely absent from its predecessor."
1019,,BRILLIANT!!,"Why are some people so hard on this movie? Sure, when (spoiler"
1020,10,Flurry of Visual Poetry,"Without a doubt the best of the Star Wars trilogy.  It almost goes without saying.  Even if you like another of the Star Wars film better for whatever reason, you cannot say that artistically and technically that those movies are better.  That would be on the level of saying that the Goodfellas (which is one of the Master's best films)was better than the Godfather(I or II)."
1021,8,Hoth is really fun,"The Battle of Hoth, which the movie begins with, is tremendously well done. The effects used for the creatures and the war machines don't hold up but the setting and story more than makes up for it. This movie is so much better than the first. The characters are great, and it just feels a good aftertaste. Great twists. Unlike in the new movies (I don't mean the prequels, but the new movie trilogy) where character arcs just jump ahead whenever it's required by the story, in this movie, you see the characters progress and become different. It's a must-watch. Really great, despite its aged appearance."
1022,,Best Movie Ever Made,"Continuing where Star Wars: ANH left off, TESB is a nonstop ride.  The characters are at their best, the settings are the best of the trilogy, and John Williams' Imperial March Theme (perhaps his best work) is introduced. Who can ever forget the Hoth attack or the duel between Vader and Luke on Cloud City."
1023,,short reviews,"DIRECTOR:IRVIN KERSHNER CAST:MARK HAMILL, HARRISON FORD, CARRIE FISHER, BILLY DEE WILLIAMS, ALEC GUINESS, AND THE VOICES OF JAMES EARL JONES AND FRANK OZ."
1024,10,Do or Do Not. There is No Try,This movie took the the first movie and amplified it by ten times. The budget was bigger. The actors where better. The Special Effects were better. And the fan base was established. George Lucas did not direct this one. Maybe that's what made it good. Some one else had delivered his message.
1025,10,I know,"Bom bom bom... bommmm bom, bom bom bom... bommmm bom! Has to be one of the most iconic, if not the most, iconic entrance theme tunes of all cinematic and tv history! Everyone knows it and if they don't then they would've been under a rock their whole lives. Star Wars has had such an impact on the cinematic world! I'm sure Mr Lucas had no idea how much it would change the world either. Ever since a new hope came out people began to dream of the stars and picked up sticks to become Jedi."
1026,10,not so comic book styled after all...,"The reason I love ESB the most is because it is the most humanistic of the whole Star Wars universe.  That's not to take anything away from the others (which i totally love as well!), but they all strike me as more comic book styled.  The whole Han and Leia interaction (and perhaps this may have been due to Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and their 'alleged' relations) just comes across as sincere and real. So go the mighty sequel and here's hoping the characters in Episode II are not as wooden as in the Phantom Menace!!"
1027,9,Best Star Wars Episode,Probably the best best movie in the Star Wars series so far. The pieces all comes in to place as Darth Wader reveals his true identity as Luke's father and for the first time Luke acts like a man more than a boy scout.
1028,10,The Life of Star Wars,"I miss the old SW, have so much soul SW<br /><br />creative and bold SW, real subvert expectation SW<br /><br />I hate the new SW, the bad script SW<br /><br />Trilogy didn't plan SW, tell off the fans SW<br /><br />I miss the sweet SW, have so much soul SW<br /><br />I gotta to say at that time I'd like to watch SW<br /><br />See inspire by SW, it wasn't any SW<br /><br />And now I look and look around and there's so many SW?"
1029,10,Great sequel to episode 4...,"Episode four Star Wars was a great movie. This sequel made Star Wars even better. It seems that the longer this series goes on, the more action in the movies! Once again, this movie was classic Star Wars. The newer movies got boring because there was to much action and violence. The old trilogy actually has some suspense and action both. The thing that everyone was surprised by was when Darth Vader said ""Luke, I am your father."" Everyone loved this line, and it will probably be repeated for many generations to come. We'll never forget it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action or suspense in movies, because this had plenty of both. That's all folks..."
1030,9,cool,"This is a pretty ok sequel i quite liked it, the scene with the taun taun guts made me really hungry for hoth rations though.... anyway i really liked the relationship established between chewiebaka and c3p00, could there be romantic undertones? my main gripe with this film is that everybody is mean to the robot c3p00, he is the only smart one in this film. ;) anyways i really liked the fact about dantwoeeen being in both movies and it brings it very GOOD touch and i also like the untouched relationship between dart vart and the luke skywalaker in the near end of the film, lots of tension but you know what kind ; ) since he revealed himself to be luke's lover after chopping arm off other than that it was an already ok movie and great follow up cheers : )"
1031,10,Generation X-Wing's introduction to angst,"One of my earliest memories was seeing Empire (the original release) on the big screen when I was five years old.  I remember feeling all the peaks and vallies of the perils of the heroes, as vividly as I do when I watch it now. That is the definition of a timeless classic."
1032,10,A perfect sequel to a perfect movie.,"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope was a tough act to follow. However, Lucas did it with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Without a doubt, it is the darkest of the Star Wars films (until Episode III comes out anyway) giving it a real dramatic feel to it. It also reveals the true fate of Anakin Skywalker. One that had audiences around the world gasping in surprise. Also contains one of the greatest sword fights in movie history."
1033,10,The greatest of all known movies,"I am what you call a ""star wars nerd"". i love the movies, i have their merchandise, and, i can't wait for the flicks to come out on dvd, so i can make george lucas richer than ever. but my favorite one of all is ""the empire strikes back"". Boba fett could nuke anything cross-eyed, and in this movie, he plays a big role, so, naturally, i love it. the story was great, it was longer than ""a new hope"", and a smidgen better than ""return of the jedi"". Indeed this is the greatest of them all."
1034,8,Easily the greatest Star Wars movie.,"Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review."
1035,10,The Greatest Film Of All Time,"This takes the cake.  It runs away where it's prequel stopped.  We find out who everyone is, we see the dark side a lot more, and of course Yoda, Boba Fett, and the greatest uses of color ever in a film.  Amazing ending. Never ending entertainment, and most of all, a dark ending that leaves you begging for more.  The greatest."
1036,9,This would have gotten ten stars if it wasn't for the end,"This would have gotten ten stars if it wasn't for the end I hate stories that end on cliff hangers. Otherwise the entire story was great when I first watched it and nowdays. If you are watching the orginal trilogie you will probably like this movie a lot and be eager to watch the last of the trilogie. I simply must get into spoilers. There is a weird love triangle between Leah, Han, and Luke which was killing me the first time I watched it. How is the story writer going to pull this off. And there is of course the famous ligne of Vader (if you don't know the one I'm not telling you) Sorry for breaking the no spoiler rule but this is too good of a film."
1037,9,"Excellent movie, and the best of the Star Wars series.","Good Points:  Everything that made the first Star Wars movie great is in abundance in Empire Strikes Back.  The mood is darker than the first film and not quite so fairy-tale-ish, and it's nice to see the good guys get their butts kicked for a change.  Also, here the characters develop further than in the first film which shows that Lucas was pacing things nicely for what was to become a trilogy.  And who could ignore the special effects? Those wizards of eye candy, Industrial Light and Magic, which formed out of the first movie, deliver some incredible visuals that are still fun to watch even today."
1038,9,Star Wars in it's Prime,"This is the (in my Opinion) the the best of the Star Wars franchise ...... Love, Hate, Death, Rebirth .... it encompasses it all ... As far as the other movies are concerned (they have to FIX or manipulate) ... MEH .."
1039,10,The best most imaginative films of all time.,"The star wars films are such hope invoking and awe inspiring films to ever grace me, i have watched them several times since i was young, and have read over a hundred books 2 or three times, perhaps more for some."
1040,10,One of the greatest movies of all time,"Words almost fail me at writing a review of this, the Holy Grail of Star Wars movies. It is not just a living legend and a cinematic masterpiece, it is the sacred text of the mythology of Star Wars. A New Hope introduced us to the Star Wars galaxy and gave us a hint of its mythology, but The Empire Strikes Back created and entire mythology which ranks as the greatest imaginative exercise in the history of cinema. "
1041,,Too many pros not enough cons (none that I can find anyway),"The Empire Strikes Back CLASS-drama, action, fantasy, sci-fi PROS-Classic musicical score from John Williams was at the right places and times,lots of famous last words, excellent sequences (astroid field, was my top favourite), spectaculor f/x everywhere, superb acting and characters, very original idea, this movie doesn't rip off of any movie (except maybe star wars but ""no duh"" it is the sequel) movies rip off it such as independence day. CONS-Cons?!!,what cons? RATING-10/10"
1042,10,Best movie ever,Best movie of the best series of movies ever.  I challenge anyone to find a better villain in any movie than Darth Vader in this movie.  And it was the birth of Boba Fett.  Classic scenes between Han and Leia.  And C3PO comes out from R2D2's shadow.  Best movie ever... I think.
1043,,The best of the series,"Despite for the special effects that defined many things in episode 4, episode 5 is my favorite.  It is the only Star Wars film that is in my top 10 films.  This is the most dramatic film in the series.  With great fx (cloud city, battle of Hoth, asteroid storm), a more complex story line, and cool enemies.  This film has it all, including Lucas's great tradition in Saturday Matinee Cliffhanger serials he watched."
1044,9,The Best Of All The Star Wars Movies,"The most accomplished film of the whole Star Wars series. Not only is the plot more interesting-darker and technically intriguing-but for once in the Star Wars prequels, the performances are interesting and have at least enough depth to complement the plot."
1045,9,"Mystical, darker expansion on original Star Wars, and emotional rollercoaster at the same time.","This movie is pure magic, grim and mystical compared to it's predecesor. It manages to glue your eyes to the screen with atmosphere and all characters' plots. And that's all I have to say."
1046,9,Emotional rollercoaster that expands on the story and universe,"This movie is pure magic, grim and mystical compater to it's predecesor.<br /><br />It manages to glue your eyes to the screen with atmosphere and all characters' plots. And that's all I have to say."
1047,9,The BEST of all the Star Wars,"What makes this film great for me is the lightsabre fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, Brilliant 10/10 for that."
1048,10,By seeing the fourth one you know they had to have a continuation,After seeing the first one you knew they would have a continuation.  So far they have kept up with the latest installments of the starwars episodes. Empire strikes Back is in my book the greatest continuation of any sequence. Of course other sequences got tens but this over excels in everything. The special effects in the movie seem like they could have been made in the 90's. One things for sure this series of movies gets more publicity than any other movie events.
1049,,I am your father...,"My first memory of watching this film was hearing this line and thinking like Luke, that Vader was playing mind games. Turned out I was wrong."
1050,8,"""Luke, I am your father""","Thats right. The legendary movie dialog is in this film.""Luke, I am your father!"" I have to admit though, i didn't see everything in this movie. Only a few parts i missed and i think i got the just of it. The introduction of yoda (in the original trilogy) was awesome."
1051,10,Why tropes don't matter in the hands of a master.,"A boyish perspective of the moments in life one must take to overcome grief, loss, and the thoughts that push us to be better people. Power corrupts youthful passion but is unable to stamp out hopes flame. Great film for anyone finding it difficult to find a purpose in life or something/someone to fight for."
1052,9,Some films age very well; this one simply doesn't!,"The film was made in 1980. You would think you have to watch it with a different perspective. Think about the limited resources they had at the time. Well you need not. It can be compared to any contemporary film sci-fi or otherwise. True, people who cannot watch sci-fi movies won't appreciate star wars to its true value. But then, can they appreciate cinema as a whole? Casting this unsolicited attack aside, those who are not experts in the field and I would include myself as one, should start with star wars series. Star Wars IV a new hope was a very good start but the special effects and plot was not as refined. You could see the lack means as a first major project for George Lucas. But it is easily forgiven since Star wars V is the gem in the crown. I have to rate this film as a masterpiece, if not by its incredibly credible special effects (even by 2009 standards), but by a story which keeps the mystery till the end. The epic fighting and tight situations keep us on the edge of our seats throughout. It is fast paced. But I watch this film at least once every year. And every time I know I am going to watch it again. I know the story, I surely remember almost all the scenes of the movie. It is the atmosphere in which we are cast from the minute the small written resume rolls up the screen with the background music, that doesn't leave us. George Lucas, as confirmed Steven Spielberg is a master at story telling. He adds the spices to an already good sauce to make it sublime. Hans Solo is in the same vein as Indy in Indiana Jones, but we just never get tired of it. The two droids add an uncanny sense of humour; the unity of the whole rebel group; the love hate relationship of Hans Solo and Leia, all very simple ingredients mixed together by the genius of George Lucas, whether he did it purposely or not. We are projected in a well oiled machine working at optimal capacity, and all we can do is follow, no questions asked. It goes without saying that I recommend buying the collection."
1053,10,Best of the Star Wars epics,"The best of the Star Wars epics! When I was younger I use to like Jedi the best because it concluded the trilogy, but looking back this is the best of all 5 in the series. Great new characters introduced, secrets revealed, a darker tone, and great direction by Irvin Kirshner."
1054,,Best of the original trilogy,"I write this partly as a review of the movie itself and partly as a review of the DVD version. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is simply the most ""adult,"" emotionally resonant and dark-tinged of the original trilogy--and for that matter, of the five ""Star Wars"" movies now extant. (We'll have to see what George Lucas comes up with for ""Revenge of the Sith."") There are no easy victories here; in fact, the movie ends with pretty much all of the main characters (even, to an extent, Darth Vader) in defeat. And for the benefit of those who have never seen it, I won't reveal the jaw-dropping plot twist near the end--suffice to say that I vividly remember hearing an opening-day audience (in 1980) of 1,000 moviegoers gasp as this plot turn was revealed. At the same time, the movie's sense of wonder and fantasy keeps ""Empire"" from turning grim."
1055,9,Better than the original,"As we already know, sequels are rubbish. They are nothing more than someone taking the characters from the original and putting them into a new setting that no one really cares about (see Men in Black 2, Neverending Story 2, etc). But every so often a sequel comes along that is just as good, if not better than the original, such as Aliens, Termenator 2, X-men 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But the Empire Strikes Back is the GREASTEST sequel in film history."
1056,9,Masterful,"Wonderful movie, powerful emotional moments and a great reveal. Great cast with awesome chemistry. Wonderful music as well. Iconic. The emotional setup for the rest of the movies."
1057,,"The best of the Trilogy, and perhaps the best movie ever?","This is the best of the Star Wars Trilogy. Want to know why, in my opinion? Because the good guys get their asses whipped, and that's how life goes sometimes. This one isn't as joyous and cheery as the 2 other ones. No Death Stars blow up also, which is a plus for me. Hoth is just so cool!"
1058,9,Best of the Star Wars line.,"Better than Star Wars. Better than Return of the Jedi. And do you know why? Because it spends more time on character development and dramatic buildup than either of its siblings. While The Empire Strikes Back does include its share of space battles and lightsaber duels, the big focus isn't on special effects, but on relationships between characters. The heroes and villains are both developed in interesting ways, plus there's that surprise twist which you probably already know about, but which I won't risk spoiling for you."
1059,10,The Best of Them All,"Well I watched the whole trilogy over the weekend just to get a better feel for things.  I must say that this was the best of the three.  Lucas touched on every subject and more within the Star Wars universe.  This story actually leads directly into The Return of the Jedi.  Unlike Star Wars which basically could have stood alone and gotten its point across.  The movie needs Jedi as a follow up or it just doesn't work.  But that doesn't diminish from the quality of the movie.  And I must also say that even though I was watching the Special Edition.  The ORIGINAL effects were superb.   So to sum up, if you want to see the best out of the four Star Wars movies, please watch this one.  It's definately(sp?) worth it."
1060,9,Best Star Wars film made,"Although it is argued that 'A New Hope' was more original and revolutionary (Which it is), I believe that 'Empire' is a better film. While the first film touches on Luke's destiny, in 'Empire' Luke begins to see the potential of his power, and also sees the temptation of the dark side. Where this film succeeds where the others fail is in the psychology of the film. Luke realises that his own worst enemy is himself, not Vader. Vader too is given far more scope in this film. We see his full range of his powers, his relationships with Imperial Officers, and more importantly with the Emperor. The climax of the film (Which I won't give away, just in case you've been living under a rock since 1980), ties up a lot of loose ends and intertwining stories from the film. Ultimately it sets up a great start for the final part of the trilogy (Unfortunatley it wasn't lived up to). A very solid 9/10"
1061,10,The Best Film I Have Ever Seen!,"What can I say about a film I've seen more than 30 times? This is my favourite of all Star Wars films and as I'm a huge SW fan, it is also my favourite film of all time. It has my favourite soundtrack of any film. I especially like 'The Empirial March' and the Han and Leia Love them which ends the film so beautifully, it brings tears to my eyes."
1062,,As the story continues,"Luke and the gang are back, this time with a little more help. In this outing as Billy Dee Williams joins the cast as Lando Callrisian, the Rebal alliance is on the run with the empire hot on there trail. While not as good as the other 2 in the original trilogy this film still packs a punch and you really have to see it to understand everything that happens after, and that includes episodes 1,2,and 3. I give it 10/10"
1063,10,Best Space Opera Ever!,"'Empire' truly ranks as one of the sequels that surpasses the original and leaves us hanging for another. My mind goes back to when I saw this at age six, being totally mesmerized by the battle of Hoth that found my hands in a continuous rewind/play cycle. Kudos to Phil Tippett for excellent work on the AT-ATs. My only disappointment with the film was that little of Dagobah's ""massive life form readings"" were shown other than snakes and lizards. The Empire keeps striking back!"
1064,10,B.E.S.T,"Best star wars movie of all times, i cannot see this movie and think of how disney permited itself to ruin the continuity of this saga."
1065,9,Better than the first,"First time watching Star Wars I enjoyed this one more than a New Hope. Was cool to see one of the most dramatic movie moments in history and understand it and not just as a clip on YouTube. Luke, Mark I should say, definitely sold it."
1066,9,"The best Star Wars episode, but why Mark Hamill?","This film was a part of my childhood. Therefore, it is especially difficult for me to review it."
1067,10,The greatest movie of all time.,"I consider Episodes I-VI to be one long movie that just happens to be released in parts. Since the rest of the movie-going community does not share this opinion, I will rate each installment the same. This movie is the greatest movie of all time, no matter what anyone says."
1068,7,was OK but wasn't the best star wars film,"I have to admit, I never read the novel this is based on. But I'm guessing the people who don't like the movie at all (which is fine), either haven't read the book or don't like the book. I'm saying this, because what you are getting here, is very close to adult films. Something people in Germany (censors that is), do not have a problem with (the movie is rated 16+)."
1069,10,My Favorite Movie,"This is it my favorite movie of all time, now I'm not saying it's the best, because that honor belongs to The Godfather, this is more my opinion than anything else. So why do I like it so much, well nostalgia is a key factor, I was 8 when this came out, and it was even better than the first one, the stakes were higher, it was darker, and it had one of the greatest twists ever (beaten only by The Usual Suspects, and The Sixth Sense). It was just great, like the first one, while adding great new things to the tables. It is my favorite movie of all time, and it is without a doubt a timeless classic."
1070,9,Empire,"Just as cutting edge as the first instalment of this classic and innovative sci-fi series, and just as cinematically compelling. Some would argue that 'Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' is even better than its predecessor, but in most aspects it is merely a strong, steady and solid 'part two' to an epic three-part story."
1071,10,Not One Single Boring Moment Throughout,"This brilliant film wastes no time telling it's elaborate story. I was 9 years young when my father took me to see this in the theater. Back then you had to stand in line to see the soonest showing because it only showed once at a time, but boy was it ever worth it. What can possibly be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? How many other movies can you think of where the sequel is just as good, if not better, than the first? I can think of only three; The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2 and Superman 2. It's hard to believe that this film wasn't even nominated, considering The Return Of The King was not only nominated but won best picture; different times I guess. At the time there were a few scenes that shocked me; Han's freezing and the look of him, Luke losing half his arm and right after that learning that Vader is his father. Wow! I recall the scene where Luke goes into that tunnel and light sabers Vader's head off to reveal his own face, scaring the crap out of me. Another thing that was big back then was the merchandising. Lucas got a ton of money from my parents because of this franchise. I had everything that ever came out from trading cards, action figures to even bed sheets. God I wish I had it all still and in it's original packaging. And having just watched this, probably for the 2nd dozenth time, I can tell you that it still holds the test of time. So watch it again, preferably the original version in surround sound at a good loud level for the 2 hours and 4 minutes of it's running time and enjoy and American sci-fi classic."
1072,10,Possibly the greatest sequel ever made,"This movie is regarded as the textbook example of how to make a good sequel. It is up there with The Dark Knight, and Terminator 2 Judgement Day, as on of THE great sequels of all time, Almost all people say it is the greatest Star Wars movie ever made, while some say it is one of the greatest movies ever made. I don't personally agree with the last one, but I do think this movie, is one of those movies that gets everything right."
1073,10,Simply the best Star Wars movie,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I have to say this is the best of all movies. From Luke's training with Yoda to his battle with Vader and finding out he is his father, this is a superb cinematic experience."
1074,10,Best one of the Trilogy,"The fourth Star Wars movie was great because of the story and groundbreaking special effects. The second instalment had even more than the first film. The special effects, especially the asteroid belt sequence and the Hoth battle astonish me every time I watch the movie. Also this movie is much more darker than the first one because of the plot of course, Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, amazing!!!! It's one hell of a rollercoaster ride, great!!!!"
1075,10,Greatest of the trilogy.,"Empire is probably my favorite movie of all time. While it might not be the best film, I can watch it over and over and over. The Empire Strikes Back define the characters and introduces us to some new ones such as Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett. The most important new character however is Yoda, a Jedi Master who reluctantly agrees to train Luke at Obi-Wan's request. Luke follows his path as student, while Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C3-PO spend the movie trying to evade Vader and the Empire. When Luke senses Han and Leia are in danger he goes to confront Vader even when Voda instructs him not to. The movie is an all-time fave of mine and should be watched by everyone."
1076,10,Star Wars at it's best.,"This movie takes all the great elements of Star Wars and elevates them to something deeper and more emotionally resonant.  Sure, there are cool aliens, action sequences, and all, but here the heroes have to deal with things us normal people also deal with.  Along with helmeted villains, snow monsters and the like, they face sexual tension, identity crisis, spiritual yearning, betrayal, parental issues, separation from loved ones, etc...  The pacing is just perfect, although there seems to be a screwed-up sense of time.  (Luke seems to be with Yoda for at least weeks, but the pursuit of the Falcon seems to take only a few days.)  The film is full of dreamy visuals--- a city in the clouds, a murky swamp planet, Kenobi's ghostly appearances, Luke's confrontation in the cave on Dagobah.  And the best part is the uncertain ending.  The bad guys seem to have won, and the heroes' fates are up in the air.  Definitely the best of the series.  Watch it again and again, it's worth it!"
1077,,The best of the trilogy,"***** The second installment of the Star Wars trilogy is pure cinematic magic .While ""A New Hope"" will always be the first , Episode V precedes it in every aspect of moviemaking . Luke,our innocent ,wet-behind the ears farmboy is now been replaced with a seasoned war veteran ,a commander in the virtuous Rebellion , the small resistance pursuing its war against the tyrannical Empire, led by the infamous Darth Vader, among others .When Their new base is located , The rebels flee into the depths space, Luke traveling to a mysterious destination at the behest of Ben Kenobi, in search of ""Yoda"" a supposed jedi master, while Han Solo, Princess Leia and the rest of the gang escape to the floating metropolis of Cloud city in seek of asylum . Unlike the first, which maintained a cheerful and light-hearted mood throughout, ESB is so much darker in tone that it seems like its set in a completely different universe of emotion altogether .Its  sinister in its much closer examination of Vader , his obsession with luke, and the boundless methods hes willing to employ in his pursuit , touching and spiritual in its portrayal of the force to would-be-jedi Skywalker, and heartfelt and emotional in its thrilling climax {which I dare not reveal}and the scenes that follow . ESB is a true epic , surpassing expectations and becoming another classic."
1078,10,10/10,"Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca face the attack of the imperial forces and their AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape on the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the help of Jedi Master Luke will he survive when the Dark Side of the Force calls him to the final duel with Darth Vader."
1079,,The Ultimate Role Model of what a Sequel SHOULD BE!,"The adventures of my idol Luke Skywalker continue in this installment in the classic Star Wars film trilogy.  The tone of the series takes a darker turn as George Lucas's sequel masterfully delves into the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual developments of the lead characters and the ominous challenges they encounter.  "
1080,10,Part of the best movies of all time,In my opinion the six hour plus epic of episode IV through VI of Star Wars are the best movies of all time.  To separate them would not give them justice because it really is one incredible story.  I find the acting to be surprisingly good from mostly relative unknowns and they make the story so much better.  The feeling of depth to this story is what really sets it apart and it is so incredibly entertaining.  The special effects are mind boggling for their time and are still great today.  I love this movie because it made me want to be part of this universe and dream about being there.  The score has to be by the best I have ever had the pleasure to hear and the visuals are amazing.  For  entertainment I can't find any better movie than these.
1081,,Wow,"I am once again left speechless at the realm of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back was definitely an improvement of the original in many categories; especially action. Nobody could've pulled off most of the action scenes in Empire Strikes Back except George Lucas. Its intense, earthly feel is enough to amaze all your senses and send a chill down your back. The lightsaber battle between Luke and Darth Vader will always be a classic and will never be topped in one on one confrontations. As a whole of Star Wars, once again, the actors; Mark, Harrison, and Carrie delivered great performances that still today cannot be topped by any trio and shaped the movie into an even better film. Their chemistry kept the movie alive and full of energy needed for most of its pivotal scenes. Great job to Frank Oz, who made a funny appearance by Yoda look so real and to Mark Hamil, who also fed off Yoda just as good as Samuel L Jackson does in the new Star Wars films. All and all, 2nd best movie all-time of Star Wars, but *the* best in jaw openers and amazement- one must say to the intense galatic action... WOW. Out of 10 stars, a near perfect film with a 9."
1082,,The ideal middle of a trilogy,"""The Force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet."" Everything the middle section of a trilogy should be: quirky, incomplete, downbeat. The ending is famously glum; Luke missing a hand, Han Solo frozen in carbon. The beginning isn't much cheerier either. The rebels are on the run, probably wondering why they bothered blowing up that Death Star in the first place. After a scrambled retreat from the ice world of Hoth, the story forks in two. Luke visits swamp planet Dagobar to learn more about the Force from Yoda, a master of garbled syntax. Much more enjoyable are the attempts by Han, Leia and the rest to escape the Imperial star fleet. The very endearing plot device here is that the Millennium Falcon is old, crap and keeps breaking down. This is rightly regarded by Star Wars fans as the best of the lot. Irvin Keshner's handling is a great improvement on George Lucas' clunking efforts, the actors have grown into their characters and give performances which are at least competent. The special effects are wonderful once more and create a host of unforgettable images. My pick from a very strong batch: the At-At Walkers pounding across the snow and Luke clinging to the underside of the Bespin Cloud City."
1083,,Superior sequel to STAR WARS,"In EMPIRE, the Rebels have been forced to abandon their jungle base and settle on a cold, icy world, but the Empire is not far behind. After an evacuation which features an exciting battle scene, Luke(Mark Hammil)seeks out the advice of another exiled Jedi Master, Yoda(Frank Oz), while Han(Harrison Ford), Leia(Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) attempt to evade the Empire, eventually crossing paths with the suave entrepeneur Lando Calrissian. The film is probably the darkest in the series, with more muted colors than the other four, a more wet and muddy look and a somewhat depressing ending. The music by John Williams is among his best scores, with the Imperial March/Darth Vader's theme and the Han Solo and Princess Leia love theme, in addition to an adventurous asteroid chase fanfare. The acting is an improvement over WARS with Mark Hammil taking his role more seriously and Ford rising to movie star status, something he would attain one year later in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. EMPIRE is a Sci-fi/Fantasy classic. Even if you're not a big fan of STAR WARS, it's worth checking out anyway."
1084,1,Frozen movie reel,"Sadly , I did not heed my instincts after watching star wars and decided to follow up with what the fans call the greatest chapter of this saga."
1085,10,Simply the best,"This is just a great movie. The great thing about this movie is the relationship between the hero(Luke) and the villain (Vader) just gets more and more complicated. And the ending is just epic. In the prequels you just doesn't have this kind of connection, which is the main thing in the old star wars movies. The acting is also great and the introduction to this new character, Lando, is also interesting and well handled. you also get to meet the emperor for the first time, and WOW, what a creepy feller he is. But the thing that really makes star Wars, Star Wars, is John Williams score. It's just Great, and star wars is nothing without it's music. The practical effects is also stunning, and it is just wonderful to see the days when practical effects was the important stuff, and not CGI and green screen all over the place. My favorite movie of all time, well done! 10 out of 10 for me"
1086,10,The one that provides the saga's magic,"First,I'd like to add two things. I don't think that the whole Star Wars trilogy is an unique masterpiece, but then ESB belongs to my favourite movies. Why? While Episode 4 needs almost an hour to speed up and Episode 6 puts too much emphasis on little cute furballs, ESB is quite different from them. The atmosphere is dark and desperate, the plot as well as the characters are worked out perfectly in this part. Here we find most of the things which made that huge impact of Star Wars on our culture; John William's Imperial March, the first (and more impressive) appearance of Yoda and of course the legendary lightsaber duel at the end- when I think of Star Wars, it's ESB I remind. So there are two things to say:If you don't know the Saga, watch all three of them in the right order but don't give up after the first one, ESB will probably change your mind if you thought it was too childish. And then, may the force be with George Lucas to make Episode 1 look like Empire Strikes Back."
1087,,The Best Sequel Ever...,"Hey, I'm not afraid to call ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the best sequel ever made, closely ahead of ""The Godfather Part II"", ""Superman II"", and ""Terminator II: Judgement Day."" Oh, and who could forget, ""Penetentairy II"" (j/k)..."
1088,10,THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK:
1089,7,"Boba Fett, Big bangs, and Bad Blood(Family Pun)","The Empire Strikes back is truly an American classic.  Not only did it continiue the saga of the Force, it gave us the greatest and most remembered climax of all time.  Anyone can agree that This is one of the greatest sequels ever."
1090,10,Brilliant,"Star Wars movies don't come any better than this. This movie is the best Star Wars movie, and it combines rough action, and relationships. The characters are more developed in this movie, especially Luke Skywalker. C-3PO is slightly annoying in this movie, but he gets along well. Yoda is a wonderful addition to the crew, and he's even better in the Phantom Menace. But the most interesting character to watch is Darth Vader. Why? Because he's purely evil, and he's so hell bent on getting Skywalker. The scene where he reveals himself is probably cinema's most dramatic scene."
1091,8,A very good bridge between IV and VI,"As I feel the entire trilogy needs to be taken as a whole, trying to review just one piece of it (Empire Strikes Back) doesn't feel right. IMHO, Episode V is the least likely of the trilogy that could stand on it's own, if it had to (because of how this film ends). However, I can say that the action scenes are superb, the acting much improved from Episode 4 and the story just rips along at hyperspeed. George Lucas was the master of taking what little he had to work with, and making it all seem much larger than life. (Alas, I'm afraid he's strayed from his roots while making the prequels). Enjoy!"
1092,10,Best of the lot (so far),"This was the best of them.  Darker in tone, more exciting in general.  The best acting of the three.  The introduction of Yoda (probably the best actor in the movie).  Darth Vader's revelation.  Han and Leia's relationship. The list goes on.  This one has made Star Wars itself more fabulous by adding to the scope and granduer of the story.  Made Return of the Jedi into a bit of an anti climax."
1093,7,check it own.,This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.
1094,10,My fave of the trilogy and the entire series!,"This one is my favorite because it's when Han & Leia fall in love, when Lando comes into action and Han gets frozen in carbonite. I just love it so much. It will always & forever be my favorite. I love the droids, Chewbacca, the evilness of Darth Vader, and the acting from the entire cast. Mark Hamill is always adorable as Luke, Harrison Ford is always hilarious & gorgeous as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is perfection as Leia Organa & Anthony Daniels as C-3PO & Kenny Baker as R2D2. The entire movie is perfection to be quite honest. George Lucas is a revolutionary genius and that is without a doubt the best way to in the best of terms put it. Don't take my word for it though, see this movie and see why I am correct in all aspects!"
1095,10,Best of the best!,"I'm commenting on this movie just to say my piece.  I don't know how many people are left who haven't stumbled across this classic, so I'm sure everyone already has their opinion, and will disregard mine.  But here goes anyway- This movie had it all - it was one of the BEST films in every aspect. Never a dull moment.  Never a scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor.  The best!  10/10"
1096,10,Best Star Wars film ever made,"(spoilers ahead) Even if you don't like war movies with violence, don't miss this film. It deserves to be in the top 10 films of all time in my opinion. Unlike most Star Wars films, this one doesn't all focus on shooting and killing. Much of it is centered on Luke training to be a Jedi and Han and Leia's romance."
1097,10,A Masterpiece,"This is the first film I saw in the theaters. And it scared me to death (I was 4 at the time).  It's a horror movie. There are giant metal monsters that can't be killed and destroy hundreds, our hero is essentially buried alive, giant monsters eat our robot friend, our other robot friend is dismembered, and the Main character has his hand cute off. Terrors. And I wouldn't have it any other way. To start, the production values can not be beat- there is care and craftsmanship in every frame. The filmmakers put together a fully realized world that seems very close to ours. And there's plenty of interesting action to move the story along. Exotic locations serve as a backdrop to the action and we think we've never seen this world before, but we're immediately comfortable there. And the actors at last seem comfortable in the characters, if they are living in fiction, then they believe it- there is angst and passion and humor and sarcasm and it all fits. This film improves with age. Keep in mind, when Lucas did the SEs in 1997, this is one film that didn't get that much added- it was perfect as is."
1098,10,The Best SyFy Movie Ever,This is the best star wars movie ever created. This movie was perfectly filmed. This was definitely the darkest star wars film in the entire series. I loved seeing how many things happened in this movie like seeing the millennium falcon getting chased by tie fighters and showing Yoda for the first time and also seeing Luke in a light saber duel against Darth Vader and the battle of Hoth and most importantly finding out that Darth Vader is Luke's father. This movie is one the best movies ever made in the history of movies. This movie has more action than you can imagine. Even though George Lucas didn't direct this film it was still perfectly written. This will always be my favorite movie of all time.
1099,10,Epitome of Filmmaking,"This film is sheer excellence. In my opinion, It's the best film of all time and the best film of the entire saga created by the visionary George Lucas."
1100,3,One good twist following two hours of filler.,"The plot twist at the end of this movie is actually really good. It's executed well and sends the Star Wars franchise in an interesting direction. Too bad the rest of this movie was nothing but filler nonsense, lazy setups for future plot lines, and mediocre fight scenes. It's poorly paced and at the end, only three or four scenes end up being important."
1101,9,The best film ever.,"It is my best film ever, it tops of course the the two first Madonna movies (Seeking Susan and Who is that girl in 1985/1987). Where to begin, the actors play well, they are charismatic, they assume what they are doing. It is a mixture of drama,love, passion, adventure and Darth Vador. He is the main antagonist of this episode of Star wars. The empire strikes back is a good title for this movie, as the rebels are in deep trouble. Luke is training to become a Jedi. I can spoil only one thing, that there is going to so much emotion in Bespin City (the cloud city). There is a two minute scenes which captures really well the spirit of the movie. So I would give it a rate of twenty out of ten. Eventough it is not possible."
1102,9,"One of the Best Sequels in Movie History, and Sets the Bar for Future Entries","Empire Strikes Back starts with a bumpy plot, dialogue, cinematography, and acting. But as the movie progresses, you start to feel that it's a masterpiece. From the beginning of the Battle of Hoth, the movie elevates as it goes on. Every scene feels more mature than what comes before it. The music is perfect in every sense; in fact, it makes the stakes feel more elevated. Darth Vader proves to be the best villain in cinema history, while our protagonists feel much more mature and developed than in 'A New Hope'. For an 80's film, Empire Strikes Back is shot magnificently, and some shots look and feel as modern as most blockbusters today. The performances are a big improvement; every actor or actress plays his or her part extraordinarily, mainly because the characters are put through challenging obstacles. The film drags at some moments, such as the asteroid worm scene, which takes you out of the movie for moments. Everything else earns the movie a deserved ""Movie of the decade"" award (at least from fans)."
1103,2,o v e r r a t e d,I think I just found the most overrated movie in mankind's history.
1104,10,"Weakest-yes, weakest of the saga","I am going against the grain here, but I thought this was actually the weakest and least ""Star Wars"" like of the ""Star Wars"" films. It feels very confined to me. Where are the sweeping visuals? Cloud City is the most exotic locale and even that is pretty sterile looking (although it was helped GREATLY with the ""Special Edition""additions). I like the darker tone of it but there's just not enough going on here in terms of action. That said, it's still a great movie and one of my favorites, but it's my least favorite of the saga so far."
1105,10,My Favorite movie of all time,"I love the pacing of this movie, great twist at the end....beautifully directed by Kershner, the best SW movie to date....and will probably stay that way...."
1106,10,Why can't all second films be this good ?,The whole crew from the Star Wars returns for the second installment in the trilogy.
1107,7,Great!,"A fun movie to watch when you're bored or just want to have a Star Wars marathon! It's really cool because my band class gets to play some pieces from it! A bit gory for littler kids, but fun for ages 7 and up to see how ""old"" movies were. :) I'm personally a huge fan of Star Wars, and a total nerd about it! It has that bittersweet ending in which it leaves you hanging, but then you can go and see the next one to see what happens! And a great music selection all through the entire movie. Good actors and actresses for the age too! Also great for the people who saw it when it was in the theatres, because it can bring back good memories. Watch it!"
1108,9,Best Yet!,There's more character development in this episode. The tension between Leia and Han is an indication that she really likes Han. It leads to the romance and marriage of Han and Leia
1109,10,Excellent,"A classic original trilogy Star Wars movie. Refined, a movie for a more civilized time."
1110,10,Best Star Wars Movie Ever,I absolutely LOVE The Empire Strikes Back. It is and will forever and always will be my favourite Star Wars movie of all time.
1111,10,Best Star Wars Movie,This is the greatest most exciting Star Wars movie ever. This has the first appearance of Boba Fett(My 2nd favorite character) who is awesome. There is lots of great things about this movie.
1112,10,Greatest film of all time,When i saw star wars for the first time i was about 2 or 3 because my dad grew up watching them and they were his favorite too and i was immediately infatuated with the universe when i saw empire my mind was completely blown so if you like a new hope definitely watch empire it is even better
1113,,Full of adventure and excitement,Star Wars: Episode 5-The Empire Strikes Back
1114,10,The Greatest Sequel of All Time,"I have given only a handful of 10s out in my lifetime. This movie is one of the few. Most people who have seen it once have seen it multiple times. I have probably watched this movie 20 or so times in full. The words ""Timeless Classic"" do not do this film justice. This movie is better than anything that has come out in the 21st century. It is simply one of the greatest movies of all time."
1115,10,Now this is what Star Wars is all about,"All the Star Wars films are very good, but Empire Strikes Back is the best of the series.  The story line is more convoluted than the rather straight froward A New Hope and Return Of The Jedi.  Though it lacks the special effects of the more recent trilogy, ESB has better interaction between the characters."
1116,10,The definitive blockbuster sequel.....,"How do you top Star Wars? A global phenomenon, one of the most successful films of all time, a fantastic film for the whole family. In 1980, the characters from Star Wars return as fully-fledged heroes about to taste the wrath of Darth Vader and the emperor. In this classic sequel, we have new locations and new characters. A truly spectacular battle on an icy plain and the introduction of Yoda. The joy in seeing Han Solo and Princess Leia's bickering relationship blossom into romance and Luke Skywalkers realisation of his destiny to battle the dark lord Vader are unforgettable.With a cliffhanger climax which leaves you wanting more."
1117,10,Perfect!!!!,"Showed it to my 10year old son today. Still remember my first time and how impressed I was very well. Perfect looks, and over all PERFECT story. This is as good as storytelling and character-development gets! 4ever in my heart!"
1118,10,Good Storyline,Wonderful Movie the snow battle was phenomenal and in my opinion it was better then a new hope
1119,10,Small detail of uniforms that is never noticed,In the scene after veered leaves Vader contacts ozzel and piet and the lower rank blocks are brown and when it goes to Vader then back to admiral ozzel and Capt piet the lower rank blocks are blue.
1120,10,The greatest Star Wars film,The middle film of the Star Wars TRILOGY!
1121,10,One of the best movies of all time,"Definitely the strongest of the original trilogy and a thrilling movie from start to finish. Everything about this movie is perfect and I actually can't think of any flaws, such a satisfying sequel to an excellent original."
1122,7,"More Yoda and less everything else we want to see. Yes, hrrrm.","As someone who didn't watch any of the original Star Wars movies until early 2010's, I've had an indifferent relationship with them. I have always wanted to really like them but I never really could do to some of my issues with the films. Concerning Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back(1980) it was probably my least favourite of the three alongside Return of the Jedi. I'm still not quite sure whether I like it as much as A New Hope, but I learned to appreciate it more than before. I'm going to be comparing this movie quite a lot to its predecessor as its a direct sequel and makes the writing easier for me."
1123,9,This Is An Amazing Engaging Film!,Everyhting about this film is great except two SMALL things.<br /><br />
1124,10,THIS IS WHY STAR WARS IS BETTER THAN TITANIC,"This one sees the Rebel Alliance at its darkest hour, having Han Solo captured and the Rebel base on Hoth destroyed... Meanwhile, young Luke learns about the ways of the Force. Though much of the film is set on the Dagobah system, it also has some of the most emotional scenes of the Trilogy, including Han Solo's capture... And Luke's desperate encounter with Vader. The end scene, again, is the pinnacle of emotion."
1125,,The most tragic part of the SW trilogy, 
1126,10,Sorry Lucas this film is the best in the franchise,This film is absolutely incredible if you have not seen this movie your insane 41 years still holds up as one of the greatest films of all time.
1127,10,In a galaxy far far away........,"George Lucas made in a galaxy far far away a movie made of stars. The best episode of Star Wars so far. Unfortunetely the new movies are not so good as the old ones. If you have not seen the Star Wars especially this one i feel sorry for you! A fantasy movie with Jedis, Darth Vader, light sabers, an amazing Harrison Ford in the role of Hans Solo,Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker facing Darth Vader in an unforgettable duel. It is a movie that has it all fantasy,battles and of course.............a love story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 Set up your X-wing and let yourself free to experience Star Wars"
1128,,The best of the 'Three'?,When the old man tells his son the truth the hairs go up on the back of the necks of everyone in the room. This film is a masterpiece of cinema. I pray that Lucas watches this again before completing parts 2 & 3 so the good name of the originals isn't completely disgraced.
1129,10,Pure entertainment,"To be honest I've only seen this one and Episode IV: A New Hope so I can't tell if this is the best of all the SW Series. What I can say is that it's definitely more entertaining than the first one. I think it has everything to do it a nice movie. It's funny at times(I don't know what's your opinion but for me Chewbacca is just incredibly funny, his ""aaaaaugh"" language makes me laugh all the time), it has a sort of romance thing in there, characters are more mature and more defined. Harrison gives a very nice performance. Yoda is as funny as Chewbacca but he's serious and respectful as well. Darth Vader's revelation comes at a good moment, specially because the movie leaves us wanting to know more. What will happen with Han Solo, what made Vader choose the dark side of the force? "
1130,10,The Best Action Sci-fi Movie Ever Made,"This is by far the best movie in the Star Wars Saga. Irvin Kershner is far superior to George Lucas as a director, because he takes the film seriously. By looking at the prequels it is apparent that if George had control of this film it would have been a lighthearted ""Kids Movie"". This movie is the most dark in the saga, and deals with real emotions and questions. Kershner details the plot, character and mood with beautiful elegance and subtlety. The score is amazing. The action is tense and epic, despite the lack of thousands of CGI robots. The message is deeper and in my opinion is the only Star Wars movie that really gets you thinking in a deep way. Make no mistake, this isn't just a popcorn-munching movie, it is something altogether more important. It is really one of the few movies that extremely successfully mixes nail-biting excitement, epic action and character into a true masterpiece of cinema."
1131,10,Beyond Star Wars,"I think that it went beyond Star Wars. You got to know the characters a little better, you had some humour. I thought of The Empire Strikes Back as the second movement of a symphony. That is why you see some of the things slower. And it ends in a way you cannot wait to see to hear the vivace, the next movie, the allegretto. Episode V didn't have a climax at the end. It had an emotional climax. There were something about Empire that immediately just clicked when I saw it. I did not know how all the romance between Solo and Leia were going work and the adventure and were it too serious, and all this sort of stuff. But it really came together. Until its premiere, cases of lighting striking twice were rare in Hollywood. Sequels were nearly always a letdown. But in the Star Wars universe, different laws applied."
1132,,Star Wars,Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back is the best of the Star Wars movies in my opinion. At the end when Boba Fett was with Darth Vader in that little freezing chamber he was just standing there like a bad ass in case anything went down. when Darth Vader was fighting Luke and did his little shpeel at the end of the fight it gave my chills. These movies were cutting edge of the time that they came out. The way they made the lightsabers had never been thought of before. the space laser guns and the damage they did to walls and armor of the storm troopers was perfect that is what i think of when i see that and same for the lightsabers for that matter. The way they can slice through anything is great
1133,2,Compare to the other Star War series: Bad,I think that Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back bis the worst movie I had ever watched although I have only watched it one time. I really do not like this movie for several reasons. 
1134,9,"""Matches and even surpasses A New Hope is every single way""","Disclaimer: I am 18 years old and had never seen Star Wars up until this point. While most people's view on Star Wars is clouded by nostalgia, here is my unaffected take on the 'classics'."
1135,10,Awesome just awesome!!,"I loved Star Wars the day at came out in 1977, but this one top everything else ... got anything in it master yoda teach Luke the way of the force to Darth Vader shocking secret.."
1136,9,Must See Sci-Fi Classic,"The Empire Strikes Back is the second film in the Star Wars original trilogy, released three years after the unexpected successor, Star Wars. Directed by Irvin Kershner and seeing the return of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, The Empire Strikes back is considered by many to be the greatest film in the Star Wars saga, me included, and here is why I myself love it."
1137,,The Empire Strikes Back-An All time Classic,"The Empire Strikes Back its the fitfth movie in the Star Wars saga and, its still to this day the best movie in the franchise.<br /><br />Its a movie that does everything right, it build on what came before, in the story that started in A New Hope and it takes to a all new level.It is very well written and it goes in unexpected territory that surprises the viewer(The revelation of Vader that became one of the most quotable lines in movie history its just an example).<br /><br />In Empire, George Lucas not only delivered an adventure movie but also a movie about the relation between a father and his son and coming of age.<br /><br />The characters become three-dimensional, Luke is no longer that boy who lived in a farm with his uncles, Leia is no longer a princess who needs to be rescued by a hero, Han who in A New Hope the only thing he cared was money, now cares about his friends and Vader now truly feels menacing also because of the memorable theme ""The Imperial March"" by John Williams"".<br /><br />There is also the introduction of new characters, and the interesting development about the myth of the force.<br /><br />From a technical point the movie is also amazing, it has great directing and the visual and sound effects look even more refined than before. Also worth saying its that the movie is ridiculously entertaining and exciting to watch.<br /><br />Overall The Empire Strikes Back is a fantastic movie and it still looks great even tough it came out in 1980."
1138,10,The ultimate entertainment,"Like millions of people in the world, the Star Wars saga has filled me with great pleasure. George Lucas really managed to create a modern mythology. This story is eternal. I believe that the second chapter of the trilogy is the best film of the three. The Empire Strikes Back takes you and brings you far away, in a fantastic world, through a captivating adventure. What makes this film a masterpiece ? It is pure delight. The duel between Luke and Vader is memorable, it contains wonderful moments, particularly the one when Darth Vader tells Luke he is his father. The movie also introduces new characters, notably Yoda, the unforgettable Jedi master. The action sequences are really enjoyable. This movie is a summary of all the Star Wars magic. George Lucas has given the term ""entertainment"" a noble dimension. The force will be with him. Always..."
1139,10,It's star wars,Star wars...............................................................................
1140,,No question the greatest sci-fi flick- EVER!!!!!!!,"Unbelievable imagination, that's what sets this movie head and shoulders above anything that's been put on film before.  Just look at the different locations throughout the move.... a cloud city, swamplands,  huge asteroids, a snow planet, and just plain outer space!  Each one unique in it's own way. It sets the standard for Sci-Fi- great storytelling, fierce battles, unique characters, and best of all.... a dark ending.."
1141,10,One of the finest movies ever made,"Easily the best of the Star Wars movies, and definitely one of the best movies ever made. There's not much that I can say about this picture that hasn't already been said, so I'll simple say this: you'll enjoy this movie from start to finish!"
1142,10,36 Years Later and Still Dominates,"What else could be said about this film? It still holds it value through out time. The undisputed champion of the Star Wars saga. Everyone happened to be firing on all cylinders during this production. -Lucas was still in his genius creative mode -dark tone that fit the story -absence of embarrassment(Ewoks, Jar Jar, Young Anakin) -unique training montage for the 80s (no power ballad) -Luke got mature, no more whiny brat from A New Hope -great practical effects -Vader at the top of his game -Leia with her regular accent -cool as ice Lando I could go on. If you are new to the saga, this one is the most solid. Try to find the original cinematic release version instead of the ""Mad George"" remix."
1143,10,The Greatest Movie of the XX. Century,"""The Empire strikes back"" is the best movie made in this Century. It´s really more than a movie, it´s more a great epic tale brought on the silver screen. Much darker than ""A New Hope"" and more grown up like this first milestone, ""Empire"" creates an atmospheric intensity I felt in no other movie so far, and believe me I saw a lot!  The storyline is far more elaborate than those few critics say, and anyone who gives this film less than at least 6 points definitely doesn´t know anything about the magic in movie-making. ""Empire"" is not only the peak of the Star Wars-Trilogy (so far!), but it´s SFX still stand up to our CGI-overfed Era! Just remember the asteroid field or the battle in the snow on Hoth. And everything is underlined by the best score John Williams ever composed. 10 Points, but only because there are no higher ratings possible."
1144,,Gets better with age (spoilers),"20 years after its release, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" continues to improve with the passage of time.  This film has substance and I personally, catch something new everytime I see it.  My favorite thing about this movie is that it never lets up.  The suspense and tension builds throughout the full 2 hours."
1145,9,The Best of the Star Wars series,"Say what you like about A New Hope, Return of the Jedi, or The Phantom Menace.  For sheer emotional power, this one has got them all blown out of the water."
1146,10,My favorite among Star Wars series,"As the title suggests, this is my favorite among the series. I think this episode is the best in creating the conflicts between the good/bad and Darth Vader/Luke. Also it has more astonishing space-travel/fight scenes than any other episodes, which all seem less creative by comparison. The original Star Wars (episode IV) is a prototype, and this is a polished gem! All in all, this is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies. I give it a 10!"
1147,10,One Of The Best Movies Of All Time 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...!,"To Me This Is The Perfect Movie , it's has Twists and turns and everything, Visually This Movie is Amazing The Special effects Still Holds Up To This Day , I Highly Recommend It."
1148,10,Classic starwars movie,"The story of this movie is so brilliant, and that is why it still stands as The best star wars movie in my oppinon."
1149,10,The best sequel ever made !!,"This is by far the best of the star wars series, with AOTC second.  It was voted #16 by  imdb viewers. I'm going to be bold enough to call it the greatest film ever made. The asteriod scene is my favourite with Han-solo navigating  the millenium falcon with a right balance of humour and action in between.  As a kid this film had always fascinated me I knew ever scene and words the actors would say and never got bored of it.  when you watch it now it doesn't seem that much dated.  The character developments and specail fx are brilliant.  I heard best buddy Speilberg originally wanted to help lucas in this but was refused, they both went on to make the indiana Jones triologies.  A question I've always been asking is why aren't any of the original triolgies ever released on DVD."
1150,1,Overrated and boring,"Such an overrated and boring film. Initially, I heard many good things about this film and so, had high expectations of the film, especially after watching the other great films of the saga."
1151,10,The darkest of them all,"This is without doubt my favourite movie of all time! And watching Peter Jackson reprise the narrative cue of Irvin Kershner, in The Two Towers, solidified this!"
1152,10,Best Star Wars movie of all,"You have to admire Darth Wader in this masterpiece .""You have failed me for the last time"""
1153,10,Empire Strikes Back is my all time Favorite movie,"This is my very first review ever and I decided to make it about my all time favorite film ever, The Empire Strikes Back. I was 14 when this sequel to George Lucas Star Wars came out and I can remember loving every second of it , even more than the original which I would have thought impossible. The continuing story line of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and R2D2 and C3PO and the introduction of Yoda and Lando as they fight Darth Vader. The characters and actors portraying them are great , the action is amazing. I love the interaction between Luke and Darth and the big reveal. Also loved the cliffhanger ending for Han with Chabba the Hut. Overall a very fun movie for all ages."
1154,10,Luke Skywalker and his friends are driven more into the Empire's evil plan and soon discovering something terrible.,"An old childhood favorite of mine, E.S.B. is a great installment to the Star Wars series even with his bad criticism. The film told a great journey for the team and progressed their stories more, in a way you wouldn't expect. The film's fighting is amazing (unforchantly not a lot of light saber action) and gave the world the ultimate phrase of all time, ""... I am your father."" My only complaint though is the missing light saber action, I mean no offense to anyone who likes gun action , but we go see these films to see the awesome light sabers. Its a film worth checking out and a reason to continue watching the series of films."
1155,10,Best Star Wars,"What the title says. I believe this is the best Star Wars out of all of them to date. Regardless of nostalgia, favorite characters etc. This is the best one I don't care what anyone says!"
1156,10,Best of them All,"This is my first comment on IMDb, and I'm from Iceland so try to bere with my English. The Empire Strikes Back is on of a kind. It surpasses the original Star Wars in many ways. The visual effects are much improved, the asteroid chase and the Cloud City for example. John Williams' score is better, not by a long shot, but, better. 'Imperial March' is one of the best movie themes I've ever heard. The Sets are bigger and much more exotic. All the actors are doing pretty good job. Irvin Kershner is doing a good job, but I was disappointed that Lucas didn't direct. One of the reasons I liked this movie better than the original is because, that now, we get to know the characters feelings and thoughts. In the original we only got the know the characters. The Love between Han and Leia, The wisdom of Yoda and of course the father relationshp between Darth Vader and Luke."
1157,10,Even Before The Special Edition... Still The Best Movie Ever!!!,"This is my number one movie of all time. It has a critical and personal touch to my heart. The Best Star Wars movie ever is also the Best Movie ever!! Right from the visuals, dialog and pace. Has anybody said that this installment (of the previous trilogy) has the best sound a picture quality? Someone was doing something right when they filmed this. Darth Vader has never looked better in a menacing way (I have not seen Revenge Of The Sith so I am not sure). Pay attention to the scenes when he is looking out to the stars for a hint of Luke. Man, I can keep going for hours on this one! The Hoth scenes were so goddamn priceless. Those Imperial Walkers scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. The Special Edition was a tough call, but I do have to say of all the last trilogy, this one had the best restoration. If you can, see the original cut of this, it was the way it was meant to be seen, with no tampering! Every time I tell people that ""Empire"" is my favorite Star Wars movie, they just look at me with disbelief and say ""... but Return Of The Jedi had a lot more action scenes..."" I cringe."
1158,10,best movie EVER made (and very probably in future will stay like this),"Only 10 votes...how can I make it 100 or 1000 or googolplex? Like I said BEST movie! So there is no real need to go with real analysis just believe and watch (again and again). Good arguments are that movie has been making more then 3 years including 7 months of only filming acting. First time I have watched in theater was in okt-nov of 1980, like it suppose to be and like many of you first I was in company of my father. After that probably more then 10 times re-watched and I can clearly remembered difference in 70mm and 35mm versions. After cinema of course there was all sort of home watching so 100+ in all...There is so mush deep levels here, sub contest...Story from Lucas, Leigh, and Lawrence is so magical and mysterious...cuts for instance are made like you sub- conscience you have to wander what did you actually saw and watch again. Soooo refine direction of Kershner-brilliant! Cinematography of Suschitzky...woooow! You have black Dart Vader in dark room and you see everything...with unbelievable atmosphere. Do I even have to anything to add? John Williams! Ralph McQuarrie and whole Lucas crew made beautiful and expanded universe that has aspired us (and them to do more) since 1980. I just remembering that I was sad that could't stay back then in line, by thicket again and watch again again... Master-peace that in both ways (no need for better and again sadly) will never be repeated or outdone!"
1159,10,The best Star Wars movie!,"It's just the best Star Wars movie.<br /><br />And fan fact when Vader say that he is Luke father ,the only people they knew that were George Lucas,Mark Hamil and James Earl Jones(Darth Vader's voice). David Prowse (Darth Vader) say another line ."
1160,10,My favourite movie,"I used to think that Return Of The Jedi was the best out of the original 3, and The Empire Strikes Back was the worst, but that was when I was a kid. Since then, I have grown up a bit more now and watched the 3 all over again. I now believe that Empire is clearly the best of the 3. Why is that? Because of the following things. 1. Best Plot out of the three and it shows you that it doesn't all come down to special effects. 2. The movie is very dark, revealing and more importantly it's realistic that the bad guys actually win.Like how many movies out there do u see the bad guys win? The trouble with other movies is they are so predictable in that you know what will happen. In Empire you don't. 3. Best acting by the cast out of the three. 4. The soundtrack, the best music score I have ever heard. It adds a lot to the movie. 5. Irvin Kershner did a fantastic job of directing, I wish George Lucas brought him back for episodes 2 and 3. The scenes with Luke in the cave was Brilliant. The Battle Of Hoth was great, but I really enjoyed the scenes on Dagobah with Yoda and Luke. Yoda telling us about the force and the brilliant ending. This movies is 5/5 stars and my favourite movie off all time In conclusion I wish George Lucas would watch TESB again and realise the prequels should be done the way empire was done. The Phantom Menace was above average but it is nowhere near as good as Empire and the WORST out of the 4."
1161,,Takes the Cake,"If anyone is going to question George Lucas and his ability to write and direct Episode One, one needs to look no further than this movie here. Not only is this movie a great science-fiction masterpiece, it is a rich, dark, deep, and involving drama that takes this space opera to new heights. While the original was great, this movie improved on it in the basis that it WASN'T a Wild West movie in space. This was the Godfather in space. This was Casablanca in Space. Any great movie you have seen, this is it. It has everything one is looking for, plus the greatest few lines in movie history: ""Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.""  ""He told me enough...He told me you killed him.""  ""No, I am your father."""
1162,9,Not the best Star Wars film like everybody says...,"I agree I really enjoy the Empire Strikes Back. Out of all the 4 Star Wars films I think that it is the second best of the lot. what annoys me is how unanimously most reviewers automatically point out that Return of the Jedi is the worst of the series.(Many even say that the childish film, TPM is better than ROTJ???!!huh???!!!!!!) To be quite frank, WHY?"
1163,10,Untouchable,"The dramatic high point of the entire Star Wars saga remains the moment in Empire when Vader tempts a defeated Luke.  What Vader is offering is very enticing: come on kid lets you and me take over this universe.  There is also a genuine caring portrayed in Vader's voice.  There is a desperation in his words, like he realizes all he has for a legacy is his children. It's a brilliant scene, Lucas will never out-do it."
1164,9,Awesome 2nd installment to the greatest trilogy of our time!!,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a superb installment in the star wars trilogy. First, lets get started with the snow battle on the Ice planet of Hoth, Excellent!. The Imperial Walkers were inventive and another one of Lucas's great creations. The snow battle is my second favorite battle in the series next to Yavin. This films intensity was great. Vader had such dominate and evil presence, starting with hoth and ending with the best one on one confrontation I have ever seen in a movie, Vader vs Luke up top the most imaginative city of Bespin. Awesome!!!! I love the little green creature of yoda, who teaches Luke in the ways of the force.I love him not becuase he is unique and original but becuase he can act as well.Finally, I thought Boba Fett was an awesome bounty hunter and a great addition to threat of the empire. ""Empire"" focused on the darkness of star wars. It buried down into its mythology and made a strong backbone to the series. When C 3PO, R2, Leia, and Luke starred beyond into the outer rims of space at the films conclusion, never before have I been left with the curiousity and anticipation I felt at that moment. ""Return of the Jedi"" forfilled that anticipation and curiousity quite well may I add. I'll give "" Empire"" *** 1/2 out of **** stars. Classic!!!!"
1165,10,Best of the Trilogy,"I saw this movie as a kid, and I have loved it ever since. This movie has excellent special effects (even for today), a great story, great characters, great music. I think the acting was the best of the trilogy. The lightsaber duel was breathtaking and the best of the trilogy, while Vader reveals to Luke the ultimate truth. The Empire Strikes Back will be watched and acclaimed generations down the road. One of the best films in movie history. perfect 10/10"
1166,10,Excellent,"Wow. That was the only thing I said when I saw this masterpiece. I believe the other two Star Wars films aren't half as good as this one. George Lucas made an excellent film that would be loved generation after generation. The cinematography was excellent, as well as the lightsaber duel (best of the Star Wars trilogy). The special effects are still mind-boggling today, even though it's made exactly 20 years old. Kudos to this film. 10/10"
1167,,a step down in the Star Wars saga,"While not as good as the other Star Wars films, it's still a part of the best film trilogy ever made, and deserves respect despite its shortcomings. Still, I found it pretty boring.  It just didn't suit me.  A real step down for George Lucas and Co."
1168,6,"Lacking a bit in intensity, but not without it's charm.","While part five delivered the eye-popping visuals and exotic locales that were expected, I found it to lack the intensity of the other films.  It didn't deliver much action and was paced rather slowly.  While I realize character development is important, most of the real good stuff got held until part six. It left me with the feeling that it was a filler between parts four and six."
1169,7,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,Star Wars I really liked the movie and it was really exciting and cool I really like movies
1170,10,Best film of the series,"While the child in me loves Return of the Jedi, the adult in me realizes that this installment of Star Wars is, in fact, the most well constructed film overall."
1171,10,More than 20 times viewed and it NEVER gets old,"I literally watched this movie about twenty times when I first got it, VHS , a box-set of the original three. But this one is best! It was the most exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the whole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy in the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor. This is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any of the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many household names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those people lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films. All I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on this 5-star, one of a kind classic. Must see, it's too great for a 10 out of 10 rating. It was way ahead of its time. It's a film of the ages and has caliber modern films dream to re-create!"
1172,10,The best sequel ever made!,"That statement alone could stir up controversy, with some saying that that title belongs to THE GODFATHER, PART II or THE DARK KNIGHT. While I agree that those sequels rank the best, I would still have to give the crown to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. It's marvelous! Energetic, funny, thrilling, dark and complex; it has everything for the audience to enjoy! There is not ONE slow moment; moving at the speed of a particular Corellian freighter through light speed without sacrificing any character development or story progression! Not just a perfect sequel, it's a perfect film! ESB just celebrated its 40th anniversary, and still feels so fresh! May the Force continue to be with the best sequel ever made!"
1173,9,Empire Strikes Back,Most Sequels are garbage but empire strikes back introduces and archives so much and it will always be considered it a game changer no wonder its an iconic peace of film.
1174,10,Perfect sequel,This movie expands on everything the first movie does. This movie has the greatest plot twist in history and introduces so many new characters. The emperor boba fett Yoda lando. Without boba fett we wouldn't have the mandalorian or jango fett.
1175,2,Meh,"First I watched the episodes 1,2,3,7,8,9, then I watched the oldest movies. To be honest I didn't like the original trio. Prequels are better. I find the movie a bit boring comparing to the new ones. The plot is not very complex nor interesting. And because they are old, the aliens and the special effects look fake."
1176,8,Hoth,"The sequel to the original Star Wars feels like it could be longer. Although, The sets and the action are even better than A New Hope. The Battle of Hoth is an epic and cinematic sequence that shows the creativity of the filmmakers. It will always be cringey to me because I am used to modern film, but even though the original trilogy released in the 80s it is fun to watch and experience the innovation."
1177,5,Best yet,I think it's a great sequel to the fourth movie and I really liked it
1178,8,The Best Star Wars Film Yet,"Man This film has such good character development and Vader just kicks the ass of every rebel and of course ""I am your Father"" is just Awesome and Yoda's interactions with luke are just a banger and Han and leia play off together very well and it's so gripping as the Empire always is ahead of the Rebels and Han getting encased in whatever that is i forgot and Imperial March gets more intense than ever ,it's just a Awesome film,I love it."
1179,10,The Empire Strikes Back-Review,"This film is the sequel to the original Star Wars(1977). For a sequel I actually was really impressed by this movie for its beautiful art direction, visual effects and its musical score. I can also admit I adored the storyline a lot because the character development grows a lot more than the previous film. But I can tell you all this right now this really isn't a kids movie as much as the other Star Wars films. This is definitely more darker in many ways especially Luke's side of the story. But then again that darkness and maturity brought one of the most famous lines in movie history, ""Luke I am your Father"". Okay so overall I give this movie a 9 out of 10 for accomplishing everything a sequel needs. One thing though, you probably might all know but this movie leads to another sequel Return of the Jedi. SPOILER-someone gets captured and Luke and Leia have to rescue him. That means this movie has no ending but still I say this movie IS THE BEST OF 1980!!"
1180,10,Absolute Classic,"This has to be the best of the six star wars films. It is just one of those timeless classics that never get old as you watch them. In empire, the skills of the actors have grown with age, to better the people we see on screen. Also, the introduction of yoda stands as a strong point for the entire series. The bright introduction of the classic Han Solo/Leia romance comes to surface, and the most famous star wars line is spoken, ""I am your father,"" by vader. Lucas brings to the table action, suspense, romance, light comedy, intense drama and fantasy wrapped into one amazing movie."
1181,10,The epitome of what the 2nd installment of a trilogy is!!!,"I will summarize my comments in one short conversation a friend and I had three weeks ago.  We were discussing Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  I was voicing my displeasure with the utter predictability of the show and total lack of any climactic event and being left with a feeling of absolutely nothing happened in that film.  My friend replied with the comment, ""That's what the ""middle"" film of a trilogy is.  It is simply the glue for the first and third films.  Not every trilogy is STAR WARS.""  My point exactly.  Empire is still light years ahead of itself simply because it is still the only ""middle film"" of a trilogy to keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you taken aback by its own climactic events and revelations.  We can all remember the first time we saw the Battle of Hoth and were blown away, also who cannot say their world was sent for a spin when we found out Darth was Luke's father.  We all have our own personal moments with STAR WARS.  The music still stirs our souls and is prevalent in our society.  Ask any Raiders fan if they enjoy the Imperial March.  It is a part our culture."
1182,,The greatest example of theatrical cinema ever!,"The Empire Strikes Back will forever be the epitome of theatrical cinema, as envisioned by Wagner. Cherish it, the art of film-making in this way is lost."
1183,10,This movie is the best,"This movie is really great. All the actors did a remarkable job. I especially enjoyed the Cantina scene where we meet Chewbaca. My favorite character has to be C-3PO. This so cool for my 2006 senior prom at my high school the theme is ""Star Wars"" the interior of the building is supposed to be a replica of the Cantina. I especially enjoyed Frank Oz as Yoda. Mark Hamill was great as Luke Skywalker. Alec Guinness was good to. I loved Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. ""R2D2 it is you"" said by C-3PO is probably my favorite quote. James Earl Jones is one heck of a great actor as the voice of Darth Vader. I liked this movie because it is so great all by itself but also as part of the trilogy."
1184,10,A masterpiece of a sequel,"Have you ever loved something so much, that when you sat down to discuss what exactly it is about it that you adore, you could not find the words? That is how I feel about the Empire Strikes back: And I haven't a clue how I am going to express myself in less than 1000 words, but by god I will try."
1185,10,The best movie ever made.,This is my favorite movie of all time. I grew up watching the original trilogy and I have been into Star Wars and movies ever since. This movie and King Kong are really important to me because if it was'nt for them I would'nt be the same. Anyway the plot summary. The plot is great and original. I love how this was one of the first movies where the baddies win. Come on the bad guys gotta win sometime. It is'nt fair that the goodie tooshoo's always win. The effects are some of the best I've ever seen. They were the best in their time and the best today. The acting is great as well. The actors take great passion and empathy in their roles and it helps make the movie so great. Overall this is the best movie ever made and if you have'nt seen it you are missing out.
1186,10,Best of the saga is an understatement.,"The first instalment established the premise and the mythology of Star Wars, but the characterisation is defined in Empire Strikes Back. Often regarded as the quintessential sequel, Empire Strikes Back emphasises more depth with the characters depicted through emotional dilemmas. "
1187,10,The. Best. Movie. EVER.,"""This review contains minor spoilers from the film"" First, I dare NOT spoil ANYTHING about this film. Now, this film picks things up from the first Star Wars, and makes it much darker in tone. The scenes in this film are just PHENOMENAL. Seriously, the Hoth battle scene, the Asteroid Field, training with Yoda, Bespin, and OF COURSE; the final battle of Luke vs Vader. Luke is a great up and coming Jedi, Han and Leia are good and their growing chemistry is interesting to watch. And Yoda. Yoda is a BOSS. No joke, his role in the film is FREAKING IMPACTFUL, more than anyone else, on the ENTIRE TRILOGY. In conclusion, YES WATCH THIS MOVIE. YES ENJOY IT FROM START TO FINISH. AND YES, I give it a rating of 9.7 out of 10."
1188,10,no,"It was terrific but i'm not sure if it's the best one in the series or not, i'll say after watching the whole series."
1189,10,holy macaroni,"This has got to be one of the best films of all time!!!!!!! (besides Stand By Me). Better than the 4, and 6!!!!!!! The acting was far more improved and Yoda!!! :D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This has got to be the best out of the original! If you haven't seen this movie for shame!!!! You missed out on one of the worlds biggest movies. See A New Hope before this, or all the prequels. "
1190,10,One of the greatest movies of all time!,A Masterpiece. One of the greatest achievements in cinema history. This is the best episode in the epic Star Wars saga. 
1191,10,The exception to the rule,"Everyone ""knows"" that sequels are never as good as the original."
1192,10,My Favorite Movie,"Although The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest of the trilogy, it encompasses a lot more emotion.  It combines passion, fear, immaturity, betrayal, hatred, growth and love.  The score, I believe is the best ever written, ever piece of music tells a story and the music alone can make my cry or give me chills.  In the Empire Strikes Back Luke has a coming of age, Leia accepts her Love of Han, and even Yoda and Ben learn from Luke.  My favorite character in the Empire Strikes Back is Han Solo.  My favorite line is ""Laugh it up Fuzzball."" and my favorite part is the final scene between Vader and Luke.  When Luke lets go of the structure and falls into the abyss I get tears of joy everytime.  Watch it, you learn about love, friendship, growing and you just might learn something about yourself."
1193,10,The greatest movie of all time!,"George Lucas was a brilliant writer.  He knew how take the age old plot line of an ordinary boy becoming a legendary hero, through the trials of life, death and romance.  He topped it off by giving it a futuristic, science fiction twist.  Between the three of his movies this one was the best.  It developed the viewer's perception of the Empire and how rotten and evil it truly was.  It developed Darth Vader's character into something that would make us shudder just hearing him breath.  It clarified this mysterious power called the ""force.""  It contained outstanding battle scenes, on land, in space and man to man.  Finally, it set up our curiosity about Jabba the Hutt and the Emperor himself.  This had to be best movie of all time.  I wasn't big on Lucas' additions to the originals, but he managed not to tamper too much with this one."
1194,,The best out of the trilogy!,"Even though George Lucas did not come back to direct this one, this movie was the best of the trilogy. The emotions can be felt between Han and Leia, as the other ones did not have this feeling. This movie also included the most brilliant sequence in movie history of all time: The Asteroid Field, along with the Battle of Hoth. This movie will awe you with its gorgeous choice of colors (get the special edition for best viewing), and emotions that pop out at you."
1195,10,Empire Rocks!,"The middle film of George Lucas' trilogy is by far the best film of the three. Eschewing the cheap look and near-campiness of Star Wars, and not having yet succumbed to the commercialzation and dearth of fresh ideas that is Return of the Jedi, Empire broadens Lucas' canvas in sweeping epic strokes and fully develops its dark, brooding themes. While Star Wars is an exercise in pure escapism, Empire takes its characters, and us, down a dark path. Consider: Luke is revealed to be Vader's son, Han and Leia begin a seemingly doomed romance, the rebellion lies in near ruin, Yoda and Obi-Wan believe Luke will fail at his quest -- and he does. I don't think are on Tatooine anymore, Artoo!"
1196,10,The best of the original trilogy.,"George Lucas' 1977 space saga STAR WARS was supposed to be as good as it could get.  Completely flawless movie. The good guys and bad guys were well defined.  The young dreamer goes on to save the universe from a fate worse than death, etc...Then, 3 years later, the adventure continued.  THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK went on to further the adventures of Luke, Han and Leia in their never-ending battle against the Galactic Empire.  Considered by many to be the ""darkest"" chapter of the original trilogy, this film gave us everything we wanted and more. Luke is just learning to temper his Jedi skills, romance FINALLY blooms between Han and Leia, and Chewbacca is still unintelligible as hell.  Vader at this point, is stewing over the loss of the defeat at the hands of the Alliance, and will let nothing get in his way of crushing the rebels.  This is THE ultimate Star Wars to see. JEDI is still a good movie, but EMPIRE rules."
1197,10,The best movie I´ve ever seen,"I don´t think that I need to say many thing´s about this movie. It is simply the best one which was ever produced.I can only tell the people which haven´t still seen this movie: Take the time and watch this film, you won´t regret it. If I had the possibility, I would give eleven out of ten points, but unfortunately that´s not possible."
1198,10,My favourite movie,"I´ve seen this movie...very often. I think it is the best movie of all time because he is very exciting and there is romance and there is magic and there is great music and...in the special edition(which I prefer) there are also very good, modern special effects. I think that this movie is not as overstripped as episode one, but perhaps Lucas wanted to do this in this movie,too, but the technologie wasn´t as far as he needed it to realize this story how she was in his brain. But what he made, is the best movie of all times, the others are very very good, too, but ep.1,4 and 6 don´t have...I don´t now what they don´t have, but this movie has it. I could watch it again and again. I think that this is the darkest movie of the four ones, there are many people killed by Darth Vader only because he doesn´t forgive them mistakes, and the lightsaber duell between Vader and Luke is brilliant. The hunt through the asteroid field is very exciting  and of course the battle in the snow is very exciting, too. I would like to say, that the special edition is not as bad as some people want to make her. It is not a director´s cut where it is possible that the story changes or you see another message. It is a special edition with only one really important new scene, but the story of course doesn´t change. The Sp.Ed. has a brilliant sound, there are some new special effect, but not every old effect was deleted, which I think is so because these effect are part of the legend of star wars. The quality of the picture has improved very much, I don´t understand why people say that the Sp.Ed. is bull***t. They can´t expect to see a new movie, they have to expect a better quality of all, and they get it."
1199,10,The Absolute Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw ""The Empire Strikes Back"" first when it came out in the Special Edition. I didn't expect to like it, so you can imagine my surprise. The entire film blew me away. I was amazed by the emotional impact. Princess Leia became a role model, Han Solo became an object of lust. I knew before seeing it, I wanted a career in movies, but this one helped me make up my mind for certain. I used to have over 10 different favorite movies, including West Side Story and Rebel Without A Cause, but I found that Empire left me breathless every time. In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is the best cinematic experience in history, and will remain the best."
1200,10,Backbone of the Star Wars saga,"This movie serves so many purposes and accomplishes them all.  TESB does a fantastic job of bridging the gap between an intro and a conclusion to a great saga.  Not only that, but this great sequel builds character involvement and plot.  An all time great and easily the best of the Star Wars movies, one gets a true feel for the story and what the characters are going through.  ROTJ and a New Hope do not give you this same feeling.  A new Hope is simply meant to introduce the characters (Lucas alluded to this), and ROTJ wraps things up.  On a personal note I watch this one the most and never get sick of it.  It is definitely the meat and potatoes of Star Wars."
1201,9,The Best of Star Wars,***SEMI-SPOILERS HEREIN***
1202,10,Sinister Reality,"Hello Friends,"
1203,6,You know what? I didn't like it!,"I wasn't planning to comment on this movie, but after reading nothing but good from all the others, I decided to give you my opinion anyway. The story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. There isn't any tention-building or climax whatsoever. The movie just stops after 2 hours. There is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. The only character that has won my sympathy is Han Solo,(Harrison Ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and noone seems to care about him anymore. Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. On the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. Unbelieve what effort George and his guys have done!"
1204,10,One of the best movies ever written,"I don't think I could ever say anything more than just this. As a young girl watching this, I was captivated by the love theme between Leia and Han first and foremost the tension between them as she put Han in his place at first with that first scene, but then gradually things turn around in a bittersweet way between them in what was a heartfelt way."
1205,10,The only SW movie that really rocks,"I saw this film again yesterday..and i remember now why i used to be a Star Wars fan. This is THE SW movie! Harrison Ford is just PERFECT as Han Solo. Watch his acting in this one, and then go and see no 1-3."
1206,10,Classic,The Empire Strikes Back is one of the all time classic movies that everyone should see.
1207,10,Ive got a gooood feeling about this.,By far BEST STAR WARS MOVIE. Luke's journey<br /><br />from a farm boy to a jedi is what makes it so good and Han and Lea's love story on the other hand finishes it. DARTH VADER = BEST VILLAIN.
1208,9,The best one in the classic trilogy,"Ah yes, my favourite hollywood franchise. This one is excellent and is the best among the other movies of the classic star wars trilogy. A classic epic."
1209,9,Best of the 3,"Although it is not the happiest of the 3 Star Wars films (I'm not even considering the pseudo-Star Wars rubbish Lucas is putting out now to pre-cursor the greatest trilogy ever concieved), it is my fav.  Perhaps it is the films darkness that make it slightly better than the other 2.  I have never watched a film more times and hoped for a differnet outcome than this one.  Everytime I see it I hope that somehow Luke chooses to stay with Yoda and finish his training.  Anyway.  Best of the 3, no doubt."
1210,7,I liked it so much,"This is the best thing I've seen in my life, and it's worth watching."
1211,,"Probably the ""worst"" of the original three","While this was a good movie, I just don't understand how some people can claim that this is the best of the original trilogy.  I would rate Star Wars and Return of the Jedi above it.  As I recall, that was also the general consensus soon after they were first released.  At the time, people generally thought Empire was good, but were a little disappointed.  When Jedi came out, it seemed as though people were much more satisfied, similar to the early reviews of Episode II (favorable) compared to Episode I (not up to expectations)."
1212,,"""The dark, funny, one.""","Episode V is without a doubt the most different of all the Star Wars Films, and yet it manages to be everything we know and love about Star Wars. Who knows why? Was it because of the writing, directing, and production? Was it Lucas' intent for the movie to be this much different? I don't have the answers. But I do have a movie to review. I would call ESB the most atmospheric, exiting, and well-paced of the series. The development of the Han/Leia tension which started in the first film is going full steam ahead here, with some of the best one-liners in the history of one-liners. It's sad that this tension completely dies in Return of the Jedi; just because they love each other doesn't mean they can't fight any more! The action scenes in episode V are, IMHO, second only to the huge battle at the end of Ep VI. I don't have the wide-screen version, so I'll have to admit that I've never seen it in all of it's glory, but the star destroyer chase/asteroid sequence is incredible (i.e. the podrace in epI is a drive to moosejaw in comparison). The plot in ep V takes some very cool twists: the introduction of a new mentor for Luke, some revelations about his origins, and a conflict between his destiny as a Jedi and his love for his friends. I'm not sure which of the three writers of this film are responsible for this stuff, but it's presented here in a way totally different than in any of the later films."
1213,10,George Lucas at his peak,"The Empire Strikes Back is regarded by many fans of the series as the best of the bunch. The acting and script rise several notches from its predecessor with the characters becoming less two dimensional and more interesting, yet these do not detract from the breakneck pace of the film, with some truly breathtaking action scenes. John Williams score is probably another reason why so many fans rate this so highly. Though the main themes from the first movie are all present and correct, the films darker tone is reflected perfectly in the soundtrack. Yet there are still moments of hope (the swelling strings as Yoda gives Luke a pointed lesson that ""size matters not). Oh yes, and there's also the matter of THAT revelation! Possibly the best twist in movie history. Overall, movies don't get much better than this."
1214,,Why is it always 2?,Everyone has already commented for the most part better than I could on how great this movie truly is. It is the best of all the Star Wars movies. I watch it from time to time to forget the hideous Jar Jar Binks and my only solace is knowing that he will be killed in a bad way in the next movie.
1215,10,The Best Movie Ever Made,"The Empire Strikes Back is, simply put, the best movie ever made. Who among us was not stunned the first time we heard Darth Vader's revelation to Luke? For all intent and purpose Darth Vader was just a robotic villian in A New Hope. Now he was a suffering man underneath that armor, one who just happened to be the father of the protagonist. This movie deepened the Star Wars saga in other ways. It introduced us to the Buddhist aspects of the Force through Yoda. Lando Calrissian was a smuggler with more intrigue than Han Solo in my opinion. Too bad his character was not further developed in Return of the Jedi. The visuals of Cloud City, with its pink and purple sky and dome shaped buildings, opened up the imaginations of so many children. We also got our first glimpse of Emperor Palpatine, although he was not yet truly brought to life until Ian McDiarmid played him three years later. Perhaps one of the finest scenes is Luke's journey into his dark unconscious via the cave on Dagobah. Of course, I cannot forget to mention the epic Hoth battle with the Imperial Walkers or the chase through the asteroid field. There is not a weak or unnecessary second in this movie."
1216,9,(Arguably) the best of the original trilogy,"The Empire Strikes Back is a rare gem in that it, in many eyes, surpasses the original. From the very beginning, showing the improved special FX of the probe droids crashing down onto the ice planet of Hoth, the audience is hooked. The beginning of the movie continues to amaze, with the Imperial vs. Rebel battle in the snowy plains, and, more importantly, showing an array of character development. For example, Luke's recklessness and determination to become a Jedi, Han Solo and Princess Leia's wonderfully-crafted love story, (which far surpasses the new prequel trilogy's heart-on-your-sleeve awkward love story), and the main characters being divided into several different stories and places. Overall, a brilliant, fun film. 9/10"
1217,10,Best Star Wars Movie - EVER.,"This is the movie that defined the Imperials.  It is clearly the best Star Wars movie because the effects and gadgets were used just to enhance the setting, not tell the story.  The fact that is was essentially written and directed by someone other than Lucas is probably why there is more human emotion and connection between the audience and characters.  Hopefully Lucas will realize he's better as a producer and technology advocate and little more when he begins production on Episode III."
1218,10,"I miss Jar-Jar, but it's still the perfect picture","A movie without beginning and without end. The movie which, for many who say they love Star Wars, covers up for the other five other movies."
1219,10,The Sci-Fi Masterpiece of Generation X,"Personally, I really kinda' hate ""Generation X"" as the tag line for my generation. Nonetheless, it is the label that has been given to my age group and I shall use it as a frame of reference here."
1220,10,"Best Star Wars picture EVER, a timeless classic, and a literal MUST-SEE","The darkest and most epic film in the Star Wars franchise. This production teaches the audience 3 valuable lessons. 1. Not always will the good guys win. 2. Disobedience, recklessness and stupidity always have negative consequences. and 3. You will see how big a shocker can plot twists be."
1221,9,A great movie,"This was a great movie. Yoda made his first appearance and trained Luke to be a Jedi. As Leia and Han traveled in the Falcon, they fell in love. They thought they had escaped the Empire but Boba Fett tracked them down. After Han was frozen in Carbonite, Leia, Chewbacca and Lando tried to save him but they failed. When Vader told Luke that he was his father, I thought that he was lying. But everybody learned that it was the truth. A lot of people are mistaken about what Vader said. People think that Vader said ""Luke I am your father."" But he didn't say that. He did in fact say ""No I am your father."" I didn't like Hoth or Degobah too much. But I liked the rest of it. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it."
1222,9,Culture shock.,"One of the most quotable and influential movies of all time gets a sequel, and who would have guessed, it's extremely quotable and influential. Empire is one of those rare sequels that improves on the original. It takes all the great parts of Star Wars and develops them further. Masterfully crafted from a technical perspective, empire strikes back is just as innovative as the original. Where Empire distinguishes it's self is in the characters. This is where Luke Skywalker becomes Luke Skywalker, Han Solo becomes Han Solo and Darth Vader proves to be the greatest cinematic antagonist in film history. Every character and scene is iconic and memorable, with a story that satisfies while subverting the expectations of it audience. Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones give more than memorable performances with dialogue that come across as cheesy without the right actor behind it. Williams provides music that could inject any scene with intense emotion. With the most iconic movie twist in history, the story takes you on a ride that you can't help but want more of when the film comes to a close. Hopeful and charming, Empire is one of those movies that define a generation."
1223,10,My favourite Star Wars movie...possibly my favourite movie,This has always been my favourite movie of the OT. Star Wars (A New Hope) is a sentimental favourite and it introduces us the to Star Wars universe and characters but I think Empire is the better movie.
1224,10,The Best of the Saga...,"The Empire Strikes Back is the ultimate sequel to the first (or fourth) film in the Star Wars saga, and also the best film."
1225,10,The best movie of all time,"I genuinely believe that Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes back is the greatest movie of all time. Besides it being superior to all other instalments of the Star Wars saga, it is superior to all other movies ever created. An amazing sequel to the film that kicked off the best entertainment franchise ever created, making an empire of its own."
1226,10,Best Star Wars Movie!!!,"Couldn't ask for anything better! Story is excellent, visuals far beyond its time. Never lets you breath for a nano-second. Watch the movie until you can't watch it anymore."
1227,10,The Sequel of all Sequels,"This movie is as prefect as possible. It's incredibly dark and sophisticated screenplay by Lawerence Kasdan uses new planets and characters use everything a sequel needs to do to be great. Also, It's performances are all phenomenal from Harrison Ford to Carrie Fisher to even Mark Hamill. It doesn't stop there! The Empire Strikes Back suceeds with great direction by Irvin Kirchner, Score by John Williams (Obviously!), Cinematography, Sound, Production Design, Costume Design, Film Editing, and acourse VFX by ILM. Not only is it the greatest Star Wars or Scfi, but the greatest sequel of all time."
1228,9,One of the best sequels ever,"It astounds me how this film isn't higher. As a Star Wars film, it is amazing and even as a regular film, the dialogue, direction, performance, effects, and emotional weight is amazing"
1229,10,Shakespeare in space,Amazing. This is the best movie ever and everyone should be forced to watch it
1230,10,"Excellent, the best star wars movie out of the star wars saga! 10/10","I love this movie I've seen it 20 times, mainly because now that we have Disney+. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be shocking, just because there is only one shocking scene at the very end."
1231,10,The best of the Star Wars Trilogy by far.,"The Empire Strikes Back has remained one of my favorite films since I saw it as a seven year old in a theater on the Ocean City Boardwalk (NJ). It was the first movie I really cared about--its offbeat and dark atmosphere is still a treat--and it introduced me to a wide range of cinema. Few blockbuster movies are as unconventional and audacious. Unlike the other two Star Wars movies, ESB can be taken seriously or not taken seriously at all and still be thoroughly enjoyed."
1232,,The best of the bunch!,"I saw all three star wars movies as a kid. Of all three I can safely say that ESB is by far the best. From the action and suspense to the wonderfully crafted story, it definitely is the best. In fact since the star wars movies are my favs and ESB is my favorite of the three, ESB is my all time favorite movie. It's great! Watch it, feel it, be one with the movie."
1233,,Best of the Star Wars movies,"I think The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the three. While Star Wars was certainly a pioneer in special effects and it introduced the trilogy as well as it could, it was a Western in space, essentially, with all the hokiness and formulaic storyline. I don't like the Western genre, so it doesn't get my vote. Return of the Jedi has brilliance in its own right, but its flashiness overwhelms most elements of story. The Empire Strikes Back has something the other two lack, a darkness and foreboding that makes it more suspenseful and altogether more satisfying. It also contains the crucial element in the entire Star Wars storyline, the little fact revealed at the end."
1234,10,You can't spell BEST without TESB. Need I say more?,"Undoubtably the best of the triolgy, TESB explores more than just action sequences.  The story itself seems to flow and come alive more than the other two in the series because it deals with emotions and a deeper, more serious story of personal struggles."
1235,10,2nd Greatest Movie of all Time,"This movie is the greatest of the original trilogy and in my eyes is second only to Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace.  This installment has emotion, action, plot twists and is a pure joy to watch."
1236,10,Sequels Strike Back!,"Most of the time in movie history, sequels have been half-herted, never living up to the first movie. But that trend stopped in 1980 when (in my terms) the best sequel of all time: Empire Strikes Back. This movie shined on the evil Imperial forces shining, the Rebels fleeing, and romance building. It's a great movie to watch with the other 2 great films, or just by itself!"
1237,10,The best,"About the four movies, this is the most intense and dramatic of all the Star Wars Saga. Best of all is the revelations in the relation between Vader and Luke. The last sequence is one of the best in the story or movies."
1238,,Sensational,"Whereas the fourth and sixth episodes suffer from some minor blemishes (the first installment has too many to mention), Episode V is sacrosanct."
1239,10,Incredible!,"Because I grew up with Star Wars, I have always found it difficult to choose a favorite episode in the Star Wars Trilogy.  I love them all equally. However, I do like The Empire Strikes Back very much for many of the same reasons that Samuel (see previous comment) did.  It seems that the characters really find themselves in this film.  They come to grips with who they are and what they're doing in life.  Some of the awkwardness of A New Hope is shed and they begin to (if I may use a cliché) blossom.  I think it's a perfect middle story, it has a nice cliffhanger, yet it never disappoints you!"
1240,10,This movie rules,The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest movie of all time.  It doesn't depend on the first movie for characters and action.  It however sets up the beautiful plot conflicts and scenes that help move the series.  Basically there is no better movie in the series.  No other movie has this many surprises and emotional scenes as this one.  'Nuff Said.
1241,,THE best,"OK, I've been reading these comments. We all know the film(s). So if you're looking for a movie description, get out of the cave and go see it like the rest of mankind has. The rest can read on. Now, I'm no pro critic, but I do tend to look at things with a broad mind and try to capture the universal sense in everything. First, as far as ""pros"" are concerned, this IS the best of the 3. Phantom doesn't count. Not bad but not the Stars Wars I grew up with and love. Second, most true fans are in agreement that ESB is the best as well (myself included). This is also probably my favorite movie of all time. What is the point to this comment then? I really wish I could know the age and background of some of these people making comments. It says a lot. I'll admit when I saw ROTJ back in '83 ( I'm 26 now), I thought it ruled. I still love it, but time has changed me and what made a great movie back then isn't the same as what makes a great movie now. (THE FOLLOWING ARE GENERALIZED, MADE UP COMMENTS BY ME WHICH GIVE A CONCENSUS ON THE MATTER IN QUESTION)  When I see comments like ""ROTJ or HOPE or PHANTOM (God for bid) was better because it had more spaceships, more fighting, action"", I just roll my eyes. THAT makes a movie?? I think not. Or others saying ESB started well (battle on Hoth) but lost steam because it wandered off in character development(luke and yoda, han and leia, vader's obsession) or something like that. PLEASE! ""OH NO! is that a STORY getting in the way of my eye-candy!!"" I'll bet most people who say things like that are either kids or people who think ""Goodfellas"" is a bigger feat than the ""The Godfather"" because it had ""more action"", thought Titanic was a stupid, mushy love story...or worse, are narrow-minded enough to reduce ""Godfather"" to a mere gangster movie. Open your eyes!! Neither of the other insallments in the trilogy compare to the ESB's deapness, character development or suspense. Though Hope is nice mix of its sequels qualities. Great movie! Don't get me wrong! The human soul loves a struggle. win or lose. In fact, not ""winning"" makes it all the more poignant.But the Rebels didn't really LOSE. They narrowly avoided disaster. Had Luke been caught or killed, true victory would have gone to the Dark Side and the Emperor...the true Evil is story. And all hope would have been lost. For as long as the Dark Side lives, the Rebels could never truly win. Also, if DiCaprio had lived in Titanic, the impact on us would have been weaker. See what I mean? In conclusion, I have been one of the trilogy's biggest fans for 20 years. I love them all BUT I'll be the first to crititize them when compared with eachother. And in true artistic, refined cinema quality, ESB is unsurpassed. It does it all. Makes you laugh, cry, cheer, mourn, wonder and most importantly-FEEL. Sure, if you're not in touch with your feelings and refuse to be overcome with emotion because it's ""wimpy"" then the extent of your movie appreciation will be razzle-dazzle action and special effects. ESB has all that plus a lot more. Watch for the next 2 films. They will be better than Phantom for that reason.Especially the next one-a winding, complex epic full of ups and downs, tension, a romantic subplot( anakin and the queen with obi-wan in the mix)and an unpredictable ending. Sound familiar?? The third will be the darkest of all episodes. Apocolyptic. Remember the state of the galaxy when HOPE starts compared to Phantom!! May the faint hearted stay home!( MY COMMENTS ON THE UPCOMING PREQUELS ARE BASED MAINLY ON ARTICLES FROM MOVIE MAGAZINES AND IN PART PART ON MOVIE FAMILIARITY)"
1242,10,"A more romantic, serious & darker episode to the holy trilogy...","GEORGE LUCAS has inspired all of us STAR WARS lovers with STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE in 1977, in 1980 he then brought us STAR WARS: EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (second in the STAR WARS TRILOGY) is a much darker film, with more drama, romance and evil. Being a more dramatic film is actually quite heart warming at times, JOHN WILLIAM's fantastic musical score and the actors of the film have helped a lot to make the dramatic scenes...dramatic."
1243,10,BEST OF THE STAR WARS SAGA,"EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the best of the STAR WARS saga hands down. And if PHANTOM MENACE is any indication, it will remain the best once George Lucas completes the other two prequels."
1244,10,Best movie of all time.,This is my favorite movie!!! It's so great. It's probably the best sequel of all time and is just great.
1245,10,Best Sequel Ever Made,"It is not as good as A New Hope, but The Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest sequels and films ever made!"
1246,9,nice 1,Llove this movie. after a long time watch this kind of movie
1247,8,The best directed Star Wars film (so far),"Of the Star Wars franchise, this film is the best directed, has the best cinematography, and has the best score.  Irvin Kershner has been noted on not seeing ""eye-to-eye"" on some directorial decisions with George Lucas. From what I understand, George likes (at least in 1979) to keep camera direction simple and did not like to set up complex camera shots.  Irvin uses the moving camera very well and very subtly.  The cinematography is also beautiful.  My favorite sequence of all the SW films is the final lightsaber dual.  This is so well directed and lit with the contrasting blues and oranges intermixed that it really comes to life.  The score is one of John William's best.  Here you have so many themes.  My favorite is Vader's theme embedded within the asteroid sequence.  What I don't like about the film is the climax resolution of the film.  R2-D2 makes a minor adjustment, just in the nick of time and saves the ship.  The only thing lamer is ending the ending to the Phantom Menace."
1248,10,The Best Movie Ever Made,"Simply the best movie ever--enough said.  It is brilliant because there is no cheese, the humor is not forced, the action paces perfectly with dialogue, the musical score is superb, and it ends abruptly and surprisingly.  No Death Stars, quirky alien creatures, or bad lines where added, which made for some of the most heartfelt and emotional scenes in the history of filmmaking.  This is space opera as it was meant to be--where the fat that the film takes place in space is not the overriing theme, but rather a question of good and evil with complicated, graying, adult questions (Is Vader Luke's Father? Does Leia love Han? Is Lando a traitor? Are Ben and Yoda being truthful/helpful to Luke?)  Watch this again and again and again."
1249,10,STAR WARS EPISODE V,"Obviously it's not only my favorite movie, it's definitely one of the best movies in the world, it's got great cinematography and a perfect pill with music. I'm sure one of the last scenes in particular is one of the best movie scenes in the world, maybe the best."
1250,,Greate job,One of the best movies that i saw. This movie is fantastic!
1251,10,Just watch it......,"Easily the best star wars film of the set! However, if you're reading this comment, then you will have most probably seen ""a new hope"" (first film) and therefore wont need much persuading........You will not be disappointed in any way!!! Without giving anything away, just imagine more of the first film but in a bigger, faster and therefore, better fashion.....As usual, the special FX are amazing considering date of production. To be honest, if you're reading this having not seen the film, you should be ashamed and My advice would be,to buy the trilogy boxset - it will soon become a prized possession, one of them that you WILL watch over and over again...If you have seen it, then you know what I'm talking about and no doubt love the film as much as i do!!!!"
1252,10,Best Star Wars Movie,"There is nothing to comment, it is the best of the saga."
1253,10,Possibly the greatest film of all time,Not just the best Star Wars movie by far... not even one of the best sequels ever... but strong contender for greatest movie of all time.
1254,10,"Hands down, the best Star Wars movie.","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Whenever my friends and I discuss Star Wars, I always say that Empire Strikes Back is the best of them.  Why?  Because it added not only emotion and conflict into the series, it asserted that the Empire and Dark Side of the force have tremendous power despite the Death Star getting blown up. It also made the Empire seem as hated as ever.  No one could have ever expected that Darth Vader was Luke's father, and the big question mark left at the end of the movie made everyone want to come back for more."
1255,10,It Is A Dark Time For The Rebellion,"The Empire Strikes Back is the second instalment of the classic Star Wars saga. It is widely regarded as the best in the entire series in which I completely agree... In the hands of director for hire Kershner, a more satisfying character study of the relationships between the lead actors is achieved. Although credit should be given to Lucas for setting up these interesting characters and assembling a great cast to begin with."
1256,10,This Is Without A Doubt The Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen,"Star Wars has always been a big part of my life. I've watched them since I was 4 and I never get tired of them and I literally leave a Star Wars movie on every night when I go to bed. But I have to say that I agree with the users of IMDb, The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest of the Star Wars trilogy."
1257,10,Staple Film Everyone Should See...,"One of my all time favorite movies. In this business there are few titles I can personally recommend in such a way to entice you to watch and though I vie to create an atmosphere of interest surrounding titles that I think people would enjoy, little can be done in some cases to truly convey the urgency to get out of the daily routine and sit back to relax only to hopefully be pushed out to the edge of your seat by watching a movie. This movie is one of the finest examples of a science fiction trilogy should be. Empire is definitely on a regular rotation list for me in my home. Every so many years I will throw on the 3 Star Wars movies only to find that it is Empire Strikes Back, that leaves me still wanting more and more. See it if you can, stand alone it will be enough to make you watch the entire trilogy."
1258,10,The Greatest Film Ever,"In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest movie ever made. The pacing of the story is excellent to the extent that the viewer is never bored as the action just keeps on coming. The content of this film appears to be of a far more adult nature than any of the other Star Wars films.In this film the characters seem to come alive in a way that other science fiction films are simply unable to match. In no other Star Wars film does the audience learn more about the main characters then in The Empire Strikes Back.It should be mentioned that Yoda in particular is a remarkable creation as he is very interesting as a character as well as being very original in design. In Empire, the direction is first rate as is the acting which is a complement that one cannot honestly pay any of the other Star Wars films. In The Empire Strikes Back, the audience not only gets the usual  dose of action that is expected in a Star Wars film but also a healthy dose of romance and spiritualism as well. If you are after a film which has great action, a dark atmosphere, great characters and an excellent plot, then watch The Empire Strikes Back. I would give The Empire Strikes Back 10/10."
1259,10,"The classic, the masterpiece! (spoilers)","I wish I was there when it came out in theaters in 1980. Empire Strikes Back is my favorite movie of all time. Great action, great storyline, great acting (especially by Harrison Ford). A movie full of emotions and style, with great special effects even today. And who doesn't remember the biggest twist in movie history? ""I am your father""."
1260,10,Can it get any better?,"The Empire Strikes Back, from this point on to be referred to as Empire, is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.  Why?  I could give many reasons, most of which would have been said before.  However, this film really does have a completely different feel to it compared to Episodes IV and VI. People say it's dark, and it is, but there is a lot more to it.  There is this transitional feel about the characters and the movie, something which shows how our intrepid heroes are being forced into darkness.  Luke Skywalker, is learning about his past and the powers that he has inherited from his estranged father.  This also introduces Yoda into the saga.  Han Solo and Leia are falling in love, this changes Solo's character from the out and out space cowboy, so to speak, that we know from Episode IV.  He has mellowed and found different priorities in his life.  This is definitely the middle ground for the development of this character.  I never liked what he became in Episode VI, his role in the movie was poor and he had changed a lot from the loveable ""rogue"" that we saw in Episode IV.  Leia's character had changed from a slightly stuck up ""princess"" in Episode IV to a more ""lets get down to it"" action character who was not afraid to get stuck in, fix equipment and shoot a blaster.  Then we have all the obvious plot developments.  Seriously, a great film.  For me Harrison Ford, aka Han Solo, is the star of the film.  His character was a whiny, annoying kid (like we see from his father in Episodes I and II) in Episode IV but in Empire we see the beginnings of the man he becomes.  There is so much about this film, and the characters, that make it No #1!  Add all this in and is it any surprise that this is the film where George Lucas didn't write any of the script, or direct it?  His only contribution was to write the story.  A lot of people would see this and hope that Lucas doesn't direct or write the script for the highly anticipated Episode III.  Unfortunately, I'm one of them."
1261,,My favorite movie in the series!,"One of my happiest memories as a kid is going to the theaters with my father and watching A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. I saw the original trilogy when I was 9. Dad took me out of fourth grade and faked the dentist appointment and took me in it."
1262,10,Best Movie in Series,This has to be my favorite movie off them all.
1263,10,"""The Empire Strikes Gold""","I watched the Empire Strikes Back for the first time since I can remember the other day and let me tell you. . . Wow! This really may be the greatest sequel ever made. It has a darker tone, more character depth, and one of the greatest twists in cinematic history. Most sequels get caught up in doing exactly what the originals did or something completely new and not remembering its roots. Episode V was perfectly balanced between the two aspects. A landmark in cinema, The Empire Strikes Back will continue to entertain and captivate movie-goers forever and with the new trilogy coming out will have a lot to live up to."
1264,9,A Classic that is a must watch,"This is one of my favorite films. It is a great mix of action, drama, and adventure. I would suggest that when watching this film, to watch the Theatrical version first because the special effects can be too distracting. It is the darker film of the trilogy, but still fine for the family."
1265,10,My first Star Wars at a theatre,Simply the biggest pop phenomenon ever. Star Wars is a passion for millions and ESB is one of the best movies of the saga
1266,10,"Dark, moving, and enthralling.",The Empire Strikes Back is the easily the best Star Wars movie. 
1267,10,The perfect sequel,"Never in the history of cinema has a sequel surpassed what the first time has done. Empire Strikes Back is what every sequel longs to be... full of humor, suspense, tears, and introduces new characters that we end up caring more for than some of the originals."
1268,10,The High Point of the saga,"TESB is what can I say THE BEST STAR WARS FILM BY A MILE!!! I tell you my friends although the other Star wars movies may be excellent The Empire Strikes back is perfect. A brilliant piece of movie making. One of the things better about this one was the dialogue, this is the only Star Wars movie that has really good dialogue and also may I say the acting in this movie is brilliant and far better than the acting in the Prequel Trilogy ( Except for Ian Mcdiarmid of course ). The Plot twist in this movie is amazing when Darth Vader says to Luke ""I am your father"" I still shiver. Also another thing about this movie is Vader, he is delightfully ruthless in this movie.Best film of them all. Well done Lucas and everyone else involved in making this movie."
1269,9,The best Star Wars movie,"The Empire Strikes Back is in my opinion the best Star Wars movie. Its balanced combination of action,adventure,character development and plot is what i ask from a movie,especially when it is a space-opera movie. Darth Vader is much more interesting here as a villain than ''A New Hope'',where he was a villain just for the plot. The action sequences are much better and frequent,the places are more interesting and beautiful,like the ''city in the clouds''. The famous plot-twist is quite shocking i must say, but for me it was spoiled, as i started the saga with the prequels(and it was wrong). Even though it was a good plot twist, i think the ''i am your father'' scene is not well-done because it is a bit unnatural and the dialogue is a bit cheesy. But overall, The Empire Strikes Back is one the best fantasy movies i've ever seen and it was very enjoyable for me to watch. Furthermore, i believe it is one of the best sequels of all time."
1270,9,2nd Star Wars and an AMAZING film,Who would have thought that this would be the greatest film and sequel ever made? There are many good things about The Empire Strikes Back.
1271,10,My favourite,Simply the best of all the Star Wars movies. My favourite movie. Must of seen it 2000 times and still laugh at the cracks and enjoy the story.<br /><br />A well crafted jewel that expands your mind and imagination.<br /><br />Truly a timeless masterpiece.
1272,10,My favourite movie of all time,I don´t think i need to say anithing everything about this movie is perfect
1273,6,is it really a good addition to the star wars saga?,"i think the empire strikes back is really disappointing.did george lucas really need to add this to the saga.the only bit worth a mark is the lightsaber fight at the end and the dark secret.from the hoth battle its just a downward hill struggle up till the duel.its a good job i watched this in about 3 parts cause if i'd have watched it all together i would have fell asleep.i can never watch this all the way from hoth to the lightsaber battle.darth vader,emperor palpatine and Luke skywalker are the only characters worth a mention they are a good asset to the story.if it were'not for them empire strikes back would have skipped my DVD collection for ever.so 6/10 a really wasted effort to the star wars saga."
1274,7,nice,"Very good movie,"
1275,9,Amazing movie,This movie is amazing. Its practical effect and visual effects still holds up today the story is amazing I will not go into it to avoid spoilers but this film definitely takes on a darker tone then then a new hope and return of the Jedi this is one of the best movies ever made and by far the best star wars movie. With twits and turns all around this movie is definitely worth a watch. If you haven't seen any of the star wars movies I would recommend watching them in release order as it saves some information that is spoiled in the prequels. Also watching the prequels is not necessary as it ruins some concepts that were prominent in the original trilogy
1276,10,Best Star Wars movie ever!,"This Star Wars movie was the darkest film with quality characters. In this film you get to know the characters properly. I love the interaction between Han Solo and Princess Leia, as well as many other great characters that are introduced and developed further."
1277,10,Casablanca in Space,"To me, ""Empire"" is the perfect illustration of a B-series movie state of grace. Not only this one is the best of all in the ""Star Wars"" anthology, even better than the Lucas's ones, in all respects, but it is a true lesson of cinema. I use to say that it is ""Casablanca"" in space. (look at the poster !) "
1278,10,The greatest SCi-Fi movie. (possible spoilers),"Empire strikes back brings a tension of evil and darkness. The most darkest science-fiction of all times (more than Revenge of the Sith) I always felt a shock and a fear when I was a kid about this flick. Darth Vader is a like an iron grip devastating everything on his path. The light-saber's duel is kind of dramatic and unfair for poor little Luke who's just a disciple/Jedi Knight but yet unexperienced. Ultimately ""I am your father"" brought the most classicism line in the Star Wars universe. I liked the battle of Hoth and frankly I found drama in the rebel's defeat rather than in Revenge of the Sith when the Jedi are betrayed. The part with Han Solo freezing carbonate is well filmed and mostly sad but still funny ""I love you"" ""I know"". This movie also introduces Yoda and his philosophy giving a remarkable atmosphere to the Star Wars universe. I was thrilled then and I am thrilled now when I watch this film. The script is well written and it proves George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan had done an original work."
1279,10,Two is tops!,"This movie is the best movie in the Star Wars series. The best part is when Luke Skywalker fights everybody's favorite the one and only... Darth Vader. But before I go into that I must tell you my review. This movie is the best in the series because it reveals the most secrets (Next to Episode III) and it is packed to the gills with action. This like all of the other ones has a lot of killing (BUT PARENTS LET YOUR KIDS SEE THIS MOVIE!)but the peoples faces are hidden beneath masks so there is little agony on peoples faces when they are shot with laser blasters. By this I am referring to Stormtroopers. In the beginning we are introduced to the new Rebel Base on Hoth an icy planet. Darth Vader is sending probe droids to find the Rebles and find Luke. Hmmm I wonder why... Luke investigates is attacked by a snow beast uses the force escapes leaves and almost freezes to death. Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan and is told to go to the Degobah system. Han goes out to look for Luke and eventually finds him. Han and Luke are forced spend a cold night on Hoth in the morning a search party finds Luke and takes them back to the Rebel base and puts Luke in a Bacta tank. Then the Rebeles find some Imperial walkers ready to destroy Echo Base. There is a battle and Han and Leia escape on the Mellenium Falcon. The Imperials are looking for Han and Leia. Then Darth Vader calls in 6 bounty hunters IG-88, Dengar, Zukuss and 4-LOM, Bossk and Boba Fett. Han and Leia are forced to flee to Cloud City on the planet Bespin during their visit they will meet up with an old ""Friend"" Lando Callrisean . Right as they leave we see a ship resting on an asteroid... Meanwhile Luke and R2 leave Hoth to find Yoda. They find a little creature who turns out to be Yoda. Yoda teaches Luke the ways of the force. Luke feels in the force that Han and Leia are in serious trouble so he leaves Degobah to go and save his friends. Han is put into torture to be put into Carbon Freeze. If he survives then the Empire will use the Carbon Freezeing Chamber on Luke to turn him to the dark side. It turns out that Boba Fett has also made it to Cloud City. Han survives carbon freeze then is taken with Boba Fett to visit Jabba the Hutt. Luke arrives in cloud city to find Darth Vader in his trap. Luke and Vader have a lightsaber battle while Leia Lando Chewbacca R2 and C3-P0 escape. In the end of the battle Luke gets his hand chopped off along with his fathers lightsaber. Vader says the lines "" I am your father."" Luke is hanging on a platform over an abyss then lets go to escape the dark side. Luke almost dies because he is hanging on a pole after being sucked into an exhaust vent. Then his friends Leia and Lando save him from death. I loved this movie so much that I used to freeze my Han Solo toy and pretend that he was in Carbon Freeze. Now watch the movie and see if you liked it as much as I did. If you want it real bad buy it on DVD with the bonus disk. May the force be with you!"
1280,10,A perfect film.,"One of those rare moments in cinematic history when the stars aligned in an axis of perfection.<br /><br />Everything is right, plot,writng, environments, characters, character development, visualisation and musical score......all sublime.<br /><br />Not just the greatest Star Wars film but also one of the greatest films of all time."
1281,10,Great movie,"It was great at everything<br /><br />Iam officially fan of han solo and darth vader<br /><br />Dialogues were good and screenplay was well written, Harrison ford nailed it as Han solo"
1282,8,I love Star Wars!,"Very first review of Star Wars V, better I'm watched TV cause I'm beautiful experience, Luke get lost hand by Darth Vader also but can, I'm not cool better so, trying so nothing can make on TV, Okay? So very awesome!"
1283,10,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980),"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). The perfect sequel to Star Wars. Included in the movie, we see the introduction of three characters. Each playing important roles that lead to the events of the end of The Empire Strikes Back to Return of the Jedi. First, we see the debut of Yoda. A small hermit like creature who happens to be a former wise jedi master who helps Luke advance as a jedi and (not knowing) to prepare him for his clash between the sinister Darth Vader. Throughout the movie, we also see the appearance of Lando Calrissian. An old friend of Han who is the administrator of the cloud city of Bespin. With the introduction of Lando, comes the clash of Luke and Vader and the mercenary, Boba Fett. Although he Boba plays only plays a short roll throughout the movie, he does bring sense of unknown and interest. Boba Fett's actions have importance which further continues into Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. We also see a range of new planets including my personal favorite Bespin, Hoth and Dagobah. With the addition of the new characters and planets, The Empire Strikes Back is really the best Star Wars film to watch for those who are new to the franchise. Even though it lacks some elements that the original had done better, I still recommend it. But I do encourage you watch the first film before you watch The Empire Strikes Back so the story makes more sense. With the movie only earning one Oscar, it is the best of the lot. Star Wars is definitely up there for being one of the greatest franchises in cinema history."
1284,10,Cool Movie.,I like Star Wars. Its very interesting movie. Very very dood artists and produsers.
1285,8,about structure if the movie,Nice movie nice graphiCS <br /><br />anazing sound effects <br /><br />screen play is nice <br /><br />cast is over prited
1286,7,Amazin,"Didn't expect the plot, was very nice to see! Enjoyed a lot!"
1287,9,Inspirational Piece Of Art,Wow!<br /><br />Star Wars has always been an amazing trilogy yet this is easily the best movie from LucasFilm yet.
1288,7,Love it,"This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away."
1289,10,The Best Movie Ever!!!!,"As if being a part of the most successful series ever, Empire stands as the best movie ever.  Though it could not exist without its counterparts, its plot complexities, character development and superlative story telling allow it to reign superior.  Even though it was the least successful of the the trilogy, most critics agree it is the best of the series.  It accepts its role as a single part of a series and takes the most signficant strides to give the Star Wars saga meaning."
1290,,The best sequel of all time!,"It starts off kind of slow, compared to Star Wars, but picks up during the battle on Hoth. We see Luke begin his Jedi training with Yoda, the romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia begin, and some beautiful special effects. My favourite exchange takes place on the Millenium Falcon between Solo and Leia, during the chase through the asteriod belt:"
1291,10,Best movie ever,"All the Star wars episodes are great, but this is the best one. This is actually the best movie that has ever been made.  At least in my opinion."
1292,10,The best of the trilogy.,"Empire Strikes Back is the best movie in the trilogy and of all time.  With great acting, story script, plot, special effects, and directing, no wonder why it was so good.  I recommend this to those who haven't seen it."
1293,10,The best of Star Wars Trilogy!,"I've seen this movie lots of times, and I must say I never get tired of it. Some friends tell me I´m crazy about watching it so many times, but I just don´t get bored. As it is the one in the middle, Empire strikes back is the CLIMAX of the Star Wars Trilogy.From the first battle in the snow to lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, this movie is full of action, adventure and suspense! If you haven´t seen it, do so."
1294,10,This is the best movie that I'd ever seen,"This movie is the greater of the saga because it had a lot of suspense. In the special edition this suspense is greater (In Hoth;the Wampa scene,in Cloud City;the arrival of Darth Vader to the Star Destroyer) I was qualified with a 10 and give you the recommendation to see it."
1295,,Definitely the best film in the Star Wars Trilogy,"The thing I like about 'The Empire Strikes Back' is that it's not formulaic in the Hollywood tradition. In 'Star Wars' no sooner had they destroyed the Death Star, they were awarding each other medals. Too neat, I think. Life is never that simple. In the sequel we have a reality check in no uncertain terms:The Alliance got thrashed;the hero had a hand lopped off and his best buddy was reduced to an ice cube. To cap it all, the hero's pop is revealed as a bit of a bad lad-setting Luke up for a conflict of duty and emotion in the final film. All in all, a Lucas tour de force (pun intended)."
1296,2,Episode v,Splendid performance....actors well organized and very creative...very entertaining indeed!!!
1297,10,The Best,By far the best film of the series as well as my favorite movie of all time. There is nothing else out there that sucked me in as this movie did.
1298,,From a paper I wrote on the film...,"In opposition to Return of the Jedi, The Empire Strikes Back usually gets the nod as being the favorite installment.  This becomes increasingly interesting as one looks more closely at the film.  Starting and ending seemingly in mid-sentence, with the characters separated and following different plot lines, Empire has more in common with Ulysses than the standard Hollywood blockbuster.  Rather than following in the footsteps of the first film and depicting a sunny, neatly sewn up story with the requisite happy ending, this film descends into darkness and despair. Throughout the film the protagonists are chased across the galaxy, they generally lose every conflict they enter into, are variously dismembered, double-crossed, shot at, swallowed whole, traumatized, dropped from great heights and frozen in carbonite.  The Romantic tradition would demand that the bad guys pay dearly for these various insults, but astoundingly the bad guys actually seem to win.  In light of the success of this film, it seems that no one minded."
1299,10,This is the greatest movie ever.,This is the best film of the Star Wars series. The characters and the story are superb. Of course the effects and the action is great. This is my all-time favorite movie.
1300,10,Back and better than the original,"The Empire Strikes Back is in my opinion a superior movie to the original Star Wars.  Many true Star Wars fans would agree with me on this.  The characters, action, and overall plot of Empire is greater than its predecessor.  The ending is less predictable and is at the same time relevant to its title.  True, it's not as original as Star Wars because the basic aspects are similar and for that reason may not be regarded the ""greater"" movie, but I think that Empire at least attempts and in my opinion succeeds in breaking the old rule that sequels are never as good as the originals.  It is because of these reasons that The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite movie of all time."
1301,10,This movie has never stopped resonating within me.,"It took the release of the worst, most disappointing film of all time (The Phantom Menace) for me to realize that ESB is my favorite movie of all time. Aside from the great story, characters, acting, dialogue, art direction, etc. etc. etc. -- it is simply the most primal, mythic, formative movie of my childhood. No movie has ever captured good vs. evil so well. Let's hope Lucas can make Episodes 2 and 3 somewhat closer to ESB and further from the awful crap of Phantom Menace."
1302,10,"Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, the greatest film of all time","I am in shock after reviewing this list of the top 250 films of all-time. Now, the Godfather and the Shawshank Redemption should be in the top 10, but they are the only movies I see in the top ten that deserve to be there. The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King was a great movie, but not top ten worthy, and the same goes for the Godfather Part II. Schindler's List was a good movie as well, but not top ten worthy. I have no say on Cuckoo's Nest and Citizen Kane, but Casablanca should be in the top 20, not the top 10. And then comes the Seven Samaurai, some dumb, stupid, idiotic Japanese movie. That movie does not even have enough votes to be that high, and anyway, maybe it should be in the top 200, but no better. Pulp Fiction is the movie in this list that gets me. This film is garbage that should have never made it past the editors desk. It is just so terrible. Let's waste time talking about a hamburger, what a boring movie. Where is Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes back though. It does not even appear in the top ten. It is number 14, which is totally incorrect. This film has by far the one of the most memorable lines in cinema history. Only the Godfather could beat it, no other. I cannot not believe the fact that this movie is not in the top five and that other not as good movies are. Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back has the greatest score in film history with the Imperial March and has the greatest battles in film history. This is the greatest film ever made and should be number 1."
1303,10,"Great, just great","'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the 'Star Wars'-movies to date. There's something special about this episode, it has something that the other episodes hasn't. I can't say what it is, really. It's just so..."
1304,10,The best movie ever.....PERIOD!!!!!!,"I remember as a 10 year old child seeing this movie when it was first released back in 1980.  I was completely awestruck by the special effects, characters, and the incredible plot-twist at the ending. Now, 20 years later, nothing has changed.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" still leaves me with a feeling that no movie before or after ever has.  A feeling that I have just seen the absolute pinnacle of cinematic masterpieces.  I have never seen the ""Special Edition"".  I never intend to.  I want to rememberr TESB as it was originally released.  Because, in my opinion, there is no improvement on perfection."
1305,10,One Of the Best,"I have seen this movie many times, and each time I see it it gets better and better.  It has everything,romance, action, suspense and catches you in the end with a twist ending.  To really appreciate this film one has to look past the fact that it is a cult classic.  Watch it as a movie not as ""one of those geeky science-fiction films""."
1306,10,Excellent,"Excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway."
1307,10,One of the best movies I have seen,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, a world of fantasy and high ideals which inspired many......a classic."
1308,7,Good but not great,Fight scenes are too amateur. Concept is good. You can be bored sometimes.
1309,10,"No Midichrolians for all of us, only the Force.","This part of the saga is the only way to understand the truly significance of the force. Because there are not Midichrolians, only the way of the master and his pupil. Only the words of an ancient teacher. Only the force and the dark side."
1310,10,I could say so much,"I could say so much about how great this movie is but will instead recommend that anyone with an interest in film watch one of the greatest scenes ever: the carbon freezing scene.  Everything is perfect in that scene from the patience Kershner has to let the emotion build, to the incredible use of music, to the cinematography.  It is a scene where almost no dialogue is spoken and yet more emotion is conveyed from each character present than perhaps any other scene ever put on film.  For a director to achieve such an effect with no dialogue is the mark of a truly great directing.  Every film student should study it frame by frame. There is no way George Lucas could have filmed that scene and thank god he didn't try."
1311,10,Best sequel even made,This is the best movie sequel even made the cast are amazing together darth Vader is Luke Skywalker dad best twist even and Han and lea get together
1312,10,best movie ever,Never gets old...love it...too much... every human in earth knows star wars movie and all of them knows its an awesome movie.
1313,10,Star Wars raised me!,The Empire Strikes Back is by far my favorite out of the whole series. Harrison Ford was epic. Spot on acting. Carrie Fisher played so well off of him and they had great chemistry together. James Earl Jones is the best Darth Vader EVER!!! Mark Hamill is BY FAR MY FAVORITE actor of all. NO ONE and I mean no one could play Luke Skywalker better!!!
1314,9,Excellent movie,"So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem."
1315,,The greatest film ever made?,"I can't really add to the comments of the others who have spoken at great length about this film.  Suffice to say, it is my favourite of the four(so far) available, ahead of episode 1, then 4 and finally six. I'm writing this to inform others of the one jarring addition to the special edition version of this film.  I don't know if this rates as a spoiler, so a spoiler warning is in effect. The final saber fight, where luke is hanging precariously over the core of Cloud City.  In the original movie, he falls to escape Darth Vader, prefering death over betrayal of his friends.  However, in the Special Edition, why did they feel the need to make him scream?  And not only did they make him scream, they simply pasted the Emperor's death scream from Jedi in!  Just go back and watch yourself if you don't believe me.  This not only ruins the scene for me, but it detracts from the power of the ending. If they wanted to make him scream, surely it wouldn't have cost too much to get Mark Hamill in for 30 minutes?  They got him to change some of his lines on Dagobah, why not this?  Still, it's just a slight gripe, the rest of the film is excellent.  Perfect 10."
1316,10,My favourite Star Wars Movie,This is my favourite Star Wars Movie with Return of the Jedi because I like the atmosphare and the Music the character in the Movie and this Movie is very timeless because this Movie is old but the look from the Movie is fantastic it give a lot of younger Movies with a worst look.<br /><br />My favourite Star Wars Movie and in my top ten list my best movies ever!
1317,10,Moving cinema,"This movie includes the greatest scene of all time: The ""I am your father"" bit. After watching it several times, it still shocks me and moves me to tears... The plot is the most intriguing and exiting of the episodes of The Star Wars saga."
1318,10,best movie ever,I think this is the best film ever made; the music is magnificant and the special effects are the top of the bill (of that AGE). I will always remember my idol -Darth Vader- ;he is the best. In this film you can also see the might of the empire and the power of the dark site. It's my top-movie.
1319,10,An excellent movie,"I love it as well as my life,though I'm a young fan of Star Wars."
1320,10,The first time the fifth is the best!,"What can I tell about this Fifth episode of the so famous trilogy of Star Wars! This part contains a big dramatic aspect (with the Lando affair and the run after Han) that gives so much feeling. You want to cry to kill the bad Lando, to Scream like Chewbacca and to say with Luke ... ""No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!"".  I think any of Star Wars episode provide so much of feeling than ESB and that's why It is MY best episode of that Star Wars trilogy of mine. Hope that episode 2 and 3 will be of that quality!"
1321,10,timeless classic,"Amazing movie, first one i ever watched and was directly hooked on Star Wars."
1322,10,Awesome Movie !!,It Is One Of The Best Movie In the Star Wars the Skywalker Saga.
1323,,Best of the 4 Star Wars films to date,"Whenever I see a list of the greatest films of all time, Star Wars, A New Hope, deservably, is always ranked high. However, none of the other films seem to make it. Not even 'The Empire Strikes Back, which is generally regarded by fans and movie critics alike as the greatest of the series. Would ANH be so highly regarded if not for ESB? ESB added depth and emotion to the series. Star Wars was HUGE and any sequel was sure to make money. In the hands of hollywood it would have been called Star Wars 2 and would have featured an even more amazing escape from a bigger and more powerful Death Star. A meaner villain and an even more impressive final space battle. But in the hands of the master he decided to take the Star Wars universe in a new direction and expand on it. He took a risk doing this. With the exception of the lightsaber duel, nothing from the original is rehashed here. Imagine if GL needed Hollywood backing and pitched the story to some Hollywood suits, ""The big battle between the Empire and Rebels takes place at the beginning of the film, not the end like in the original. The film then splits off into two parallel non-action, character driven stories and climaxes with 2 simultaneous battles. Throughout it all, the heroes are retreating and the bad guys are winning.  The movie ends with Han Solo frozen in carbonite, and shipped off to Jabba the Hutt, and the rest of the rebels are in hiding.""  What Hollywood suit would have greenlighted a script that depressing. ""Damn it, this is supposed to be a sequel to Star Wars, I want bad guys dying and Empirial bases blowing up and a happy ending with a cheerful ceremony."" Fortunately, Lucas makes films on his own terms. The few original reviews I found from 1980 were unenthusiatic. ""It has no beginning and no end and drags in the middle"" was the common complaint. 20 years later it is now considered the Masterpiece of the series. Other great sequels that come to mind are 'Godfather 2', 'The Road Warrior', 'Star Trek 2', 'Superman 2' and 'Toy Story 2'. These are all sequels that refused to follow the standard sequel formula of rehashing the original.  Roger Ebert calls ESB the heart of the franchise. The excellence of ESB resonates back to ANH. Had Lucas not had a bigger story in mind and Star Wars, ANH stood on its own, I believe it would not be as highly regarded today."
1324,9,A masterclass of Cinema and Sci-fi fantasy,From start to finish it's an incredible film and really shows and pushes the boundaries of filmmaking from the era it was made. The way they do all the visual/special effects is insane and looks so beautifully well done.
1325,10,BEST MOVIE IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY,"The Empire Strikes Back is no doubt the best movie in the original trilogy! The story was 100% wonderful, and it's very beautiful how we got a deep insight within the romance between a smuggler, and an Alderaanian Princess. Especially how Luke was being trained by Grand Master Yoda. Hell, I could go on all day, but this movie is a MUST-SEE!"
1326,10,The perfect movie,There's literally nothing I can say that's not already been said. Truly the most amazing film to ever exist.
1327,10,Storm Troopers and Bobba Fetts accents,"Can anyone explain why in the new star wars, the clones and young bobba fett have Aussie accents and in the originals they have American accents? Now George Lucas has tried to cover his mistake by editing the voice of bobba fett back to an Aussie accent in the originals, if you haven't noticed then watch Empire Strikes Back whenever it comes on TV and watch it on DVD or video you will notice the change in accents. Is this a mistake or have they just developed an American accent during the 20 year period after the war? if so then that is stupid and doesn't make sense because there are different accents in stars wars not just American!"
1328,10,Amazing,"One of the best movies of all time, simply brilliant"
1329,8,classic film!,It's just a classic film
1330,10,Empire strikes back,"The empire strikes back is probably one of the most iconic movies ever made. Everyone knows Vader's ""I am your father"" line or ""Do or do not, there is no try"". And the reason the movie is the most iconic of the Star Wars saga, is because it's the consensus best of the Star Wars saga. It's not my personal favorite but I will agree that there is definitely an argument for it to be the best. I don't think it's a perfect 10, and if I could give it a 9.5 I would."
1331,10,Greatest Star Wars Best Movie,"This movie is an example of how to not only do a perfect sequel, but a perfect sci-fi movie in general."
1332,10,The Best Star Wars Movie Of All Time,"I always ask others which Star Wars movie was their favorite. Most say Return of the Jedi because of its climactic ending, and although I can't argue with them at all, my pick is Empire Strikes Back."
1333,10,Greatest movie of all time?,"Everything is right with The Empire Strikes Back. In this classic George Lucas introduces the world to the emersive, mystical side of his world of Star Wars. Where A New Hope was somewhat shallow, plot-driven and sometimes poorly written and acted, the sequel feels like the story and characters wrote itselve, and took the character development and world-building to a whole new level in cinema history."
1334,10,"Still the greatest movie I have ever seen, still awesome!","Proved that Star Wars was not a fluke - and even improved on it and expanding an already amazing universe. it was this movie that made Darth Vader the ultimate villain/movie icon (or fallen hero?), this movie that defined the force (something which many other films have tried to copy) this movie that had a main character (who was completely believable & watchable) who moved us with the magic of the force - yet was a puppet; this movie that showed us the most epic duel/showdown/cliffhanger to date; this movie that showed that Harrison Ford was a movie star - and this movie that made us all want to fly the Millennium Falcon ( the first movie spaceship to really fly), fight with a light saber and be a bounty hunter!And it still amazes me today! Oh and has the greatest soundtrack ever recorded."
1335,8,Legendary Classic,The best film in the original trilogy. This movie still holds up to this day and is a joy to watch 42 years on. If you haven't watched this glorious film i suggest you do along with the other two entries in the trilogy.
1336,7,a good movie to sit down and watch,This is a good movie to rewatch over and over i still love it<br /><br />It is outdated but still great till this day good world building and character development.
1337,10,As good as it gets,"A sequel better than the original. Excellent for so many reasons. Good performances, effects that still hold up 20 years (+) on. However it is the story that wins it for me. The good guys get defeated midway through the film after which the heroes get chased until they are caught and then tortured and imprisoned. Their saviour then comes only to need saving himself. Fantastic and a killer cliff hanger. This is a film about a relentless villain with a purpose and without the gore, absolutely fantastic. The only fault is that the writer/producer and director were not there for the films since, now that would have been worthwhile........"
1338,10,The Best SW film fer sure,"Being a huge star wars fan and having seen the movies a bajillion and 1 times, I have to say this one was the most well rounded. It had suspense, romance, action, comedy and special effects that still stand up to todays standards. It also had one of the biggest suprises in movie history. Anyone who heard ""Luke I am your father"" for the first time came out of the theater completely blown away... I know I did. The movie is just brilliant. To me, Mr. Lucas just did everything right."
1339,10,empire strikes back,Empire strikes back is the greatest movie of all time. It surpasses any and all movies ever made for any category. There is not one movie that is better than empire strikes back. It's the best and greatest movie of all time. It is the only movie that can be truly be called a movie and it is the best film from start to finish. Plus it has the greatest ending of all time. Also the work frank oz did as the Puppeteer for Yoda was genius. You can hardly tell that Yoda is a puppet because frank oz did such a remarkable job Yoda seems lifelike to me no matter how many times i watch the movie. It's also the very best movie out of all the other movies in the star wars series. 
1340,10,i love the empire strikes back.,I dont even know what to say i just know that this movie helped me at my lowest points got me out of a depression and i have the entire thing memorized i love this movie so bad. Literally would do anything for it i love being a dramatic 15 year old lesbian who absolutely adores the empire strikes back. Live laugh love the empire strikes back. When in doubt watch the empire strikes back. Think youre crazy?? I type the e and empire then strikes back immediately show up maybe i need to tell my psychologist about this i dont know!!!!!!!! Anyways moral of the story is i needed to get the required characters and i love the empire strikes back more than my life and more than anyone else does.
1341,10,The first great plot twist,***spoilers ahead***
1342,,My favorite of the five,"What a remarkable film this is. Easily, the greatest of the five Star Wars films made so far and one of the greatest fantasy films of all time. I remember what a revelation ESB was when I first saw it as a child. What a contrast it was from the first film. From the offset, it was darker and more brooding and psychological. It was of a more mature nature and had the richest character development of any of the Star Wars films. In a way, I think that it was the most ""realistic"" of all these films, in that it was more grounded in solid emotions and there was palpable resonance to it. This truly is the film that solidified the Star Wars mythology, and it defined and molded the characters in ways that give them all deeper meaning, purpose, and motivation. Everything starts working on a whole other level. To me its all about dark family secrets lurking just beneath the surface, and you definitely feel that all throughout this film. When the awful ""truth"" is revealed in the end, you realize that the clues have really been there all along. Luke's anguished cry after Vader tells him that ""I am your father"", is not one of shock or denial, but of the acceptance of something that he has really known all along. And Vader suddenly has more form and dimension. He has a purpose (as all truly great villains must). Is he not now, after all, basically a father trying to find his children and bring them to his side? Yoda is wise and wonderful and really embodies all the magic of this modern fantasy myth. The developing romance between Han and Leia is engaging and believable. And there's real chemistry there. It's truly light years ahead of the love story between Anakin and Padme from ""Attack of the Clones"". On just about ALL levels, its far superior to ""Clones"", making the latest Star Wars release seem cold, ineffectual and flaccid. AND, most importantly..."
1343,10,The Bests from the Best is the Best from the West!!!!!,"Yes! That is it! It was my first VHS movie since 1990''s, I can remember that very well! What can I say? It's nothing! It's super-action science- fiction film for that year and still popular through many fans and collectors! George Lucas started his saga so many years ago...., but the time is infinite for him! He creates something creative, something brilliant, something wonderful, that I cant explain in full words! The saga will be sound again, again and again in our ears, in our hearts and in our mind forever! I just would like to say one important thing! To wish THE BEST REGARDS from us to this ""favourite master"" of his own ""genre""!!!!! The SAGA will be with us Always!"
1344,10,The best Star Wars film,"This is the best Star Wars Film Action from the very start, iconic battle machinery, the biggest plot twist ever and a major cliffhanger. "
1345,,"Beautiful, dark, touching....perfect.","Star Wars itself is without a doubt the greastest saga of all time, and Empire Strikes Back is the best of Star Wars."
1346,10,Maybe the best SW movie !,"This is a great SW movie, even better then SW: A New Hope.... The music is great, the acting is great and the special effects are great. The love relationship between Han(Ford) and Leia(Fisher) are fantastique , they have a love/hate relationship. The Lightsaber sequence between Luke and Darth Vader are also wonderful.10/10"
1347,10,Greatest Movie Ever,"It seems clear to me that this is the greatest movie ever for several reasons.  First of all it has great action and special effects.  Anlng with every other star wars movie, This was the benchmark for special effects upon its release. Plenty of battles on Hoth and in the asteroid field.  Great drama.  It shows the evolving relationship between Leia and Han Solo and between Luke an Vader.  It also has one of the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema which contains one of the most memorable lines in the history of cinema. And to top it off is has the greatest viliian of all time.  Darth Vader!  His pure evil is enforced throughout the whole movie by showing him kill his own admirals for thier mistakes, and through his detrusction of the rebel base on Hoth.  Which is one reason why the climax is so great in this movie.  It shows us he does have feelings when he is unable to kill Luke.  Great Irony,   Great Movie."
1348,10,The Greatest Sci-Fi of All Time,"released in 1980, the sequel to George Lucas's mega-hit Star Wars. The Empire Strikes back is the penultimate science fiction experience, aside from flying a space ship and shooting aliens out of the sky yourself!"
1349,9,Best Star Wars flick ever.,"Best Star Wars flick ever. Obscure and intriguing, full of turning points and excellent directorial work by Irving Kershner, new exciting characters and marvelous editing. Also John Williams keeps up with a stupendous job and the depth of actor Mark Hamill gets better and better during the movie. Yoda is a an example of puppetry at its finest."
1350,10,the best sequel ever,"Quite frankly if you've not seen it you've not lived, and it was the original movie NDA.<br /><br />Its one of the best movies ever not to mention and arguably the best sequel ever and on par with Terminator 2.<br /><br />This is a childhood favourite and will be passed down from generation to generation.<br /><br />This is cinema"
1351,10,My Fav Flick,This by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which blew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is the best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the characters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each character affects the progression of the story.
1352,,Still the Best,Empire is the high water mark for the entire series because it got the funding it needed after the first movie and Lucas had not yet decided to make it too cute like the series was for kids all along.  Perhaps he just hung out with Spielberg too much.  The third in the series gave us teddy bears up the butt and the fourth brought us Jar Jar.
1353,10,This set the tone for darker sci-fi movies...,"While most would consider this tame by today's standards Chapter 5 of this saga had menacing overtones, a huge twist reveal, and a not so happy ending. To me this set the tone for sci-fi movies to push the envelope not only for special effects but story structure and resolve."
1354,9,A milestone in our film history,"A movie that stand as a milestone in our recent film history. It not only changed the films that where made in the 70's, it changed the genre: Science Fiction; By it's groundbreaking special effects, by it's storytelling, use of shots, etc. George Lucas proves with this film that he is a master in creating worlds. A master in telling stories and one of the founding fathers of Science Fiction and Special Effects. On a more technical base, he reinvented the use of Panavision. The movie is the second one in the Star Wars franchise. And it proves to be a promising franchise, that continues to surprise the audience. "
1355,4,A short response.,"There's no review necessary from my part and I will make this short, sweet and simple. Empire Strikes Back is so far THE best one in my opinion. That is all."
1356,9,This one is my favorite!,I first watched this as a kid and even then it was my favorite of the three. I don't know how to put into words why I like this one so much. Something about the flow of it and the cinematography and how the plot moves. I also like the cloud city and Luke finding out the truth finally! Plot twist! :-D lol In all seriousness tho I don't know what to say about this movie that hasn't already been said better by so many others. I just enjoy it. Its a classic. Its Star Wars. I watch it at least once a year. :)
1357,10,the death star has been destroyed by the rebels. However the strength of the empire remains omnipotent. Its effort in finding and destroying all rebel forces has doubled.,"Not getting old. The immortality of a genuine argument is probably what is most looked for by directors and producers. This movie in my opinion is unarguably the clearest representation of filmographic imperishability. In this one George Lucas gathers a virtuously designed nexus between the fifth and the 6th movie of the saga. However, this movie is by no means fault of action or memorable moments. Here we discover the relationship that lies between Luke and Darth Vader. George places us in front a very decisive moral dilemma: Will young Luke grow prey of fear and hate like his father? or by the contrary, will he become a jedi?;or in other words: will he save the day and defeat Darth Vader? or will he join him and Palpatine, screwing it all up? I was glad to see that in this movie, the hard challenge to which the actors were subjected was passed by all of them flawlessly. I was specially thrilled by the way mark Hamill succeeds in showing us with great sophistication the metamorphosis Luke is undergoing, evolving from an ignorant crybaby, into a mighty and wiser jedi. The way his motifs become more altruistic and less egocentric in such an adverse situation makes us watch a man handling a light saber and no longer a boy. This simply broadens the range of ages that will be adhered to this particular movie. Carrie fisher and Harrison ford excel at their role and add the necessary spice to the film. Resorting to the child-pleasing comedy provided by C3PO or R2D2 was thankfully not a major concern in this movie."
1358,10,The Best Movie Ever Made (Pre Special Edition),This movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have to say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire time. Lucas had to capture his audience in the first film and no one likes a film where the bad guys wins. However once he had established the rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy bashing.
1359,10,A Quick Film Review,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back has to be easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie has a strong cast, a great director, and a really awesome sound track. This movie is the second one in a three part trilogy that revolves around a group of heroes and how they help save the galaxy from the tyranny of the Empire. The main characters are Luke Skywalker (Played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Played by Harrison Ford), and Princess Leia (Played by Carrie Fisher). George Lucas, the director and maker of Star Wars, does a fantastic job telling the story about Luke and his friends and the challenges they face. And John Williams wrote the music that, which in my opinion, helps make the movie a true epic."
1360,9,The Most Powerful Star Wars Movie,"After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swamp world with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?"
1361,10,Greatest twist of all time...,"***Potential Spoiler*** Simply put, if you haven't seen it (I feel for you), wait until Luke finally confronts Vader near the end.  The ensuing conversation is WHY so many people love Star Wars.  It contains the greatest twist (in my mind) in movie history.  NOBODY could have seen it coming and if they tell you they did, they're lying.  Straight up."
1362,,Still Amazing 3 decades later,"I remember seeing this in 1980 and being just amazed. Fast forward to 2012, with all the big budget thrill rides, and yet, The Empire Strikes can still hold its own with any of them."
1363,10,best in the original trilogy,"This is the turning point in the Original Trilogy films, more character development rather than action."
1364,10,The most visually striking episode?,"I remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star Wars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced anything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may actually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we are alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one more time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen. Then that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a Snowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say Striking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like that... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working very hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make each of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and producing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG animation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the sandman."
