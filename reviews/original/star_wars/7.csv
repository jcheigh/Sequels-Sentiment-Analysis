0,6,The death of a franchise.,"The Last Jedi is a well-made film; it's visually stunning and well directed. The problem is that it singlehandedly ruined the sequel trilogy by closing the second chapter with a dead end. There are truly baffling character decisions, awkward humor, useless subplots - it's by far the most frustrating Star Wars movie because of the potential it had. If it were 20 minutes shorter, it could have been something special, but the last act sees our characters in the exact same spot as they began. As a standalone movie, it's watchable. As the second part of a trilogy, it's a disaster."
1,6,Star Worse,"I've seen some Star Wars movie lately, 3 or 4, skipped episodes, but they were not as bad as this one. This seems to hit all records, and by this, I mean the bad ones. It's a Swedish buffet with the worst thing you can imagine: poor acting, action, scenes, etc. It certainly doesn't look like Star Wars to me. And I don't believe it looks this way for others either."
2,6,Almost Garbage,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was a huge disappointment to a long time ""Star Wars"" fan such as myself. Okay, here we go."
3,,My Issues With The Storytelling in The Last Jedi (Without Hyperbole),"I didn't hate TLJ, but even if I completely ignore all the (among many fans) controversial choices Rian Johnson made with regards to his treatement of Star Wars' lore and characters, I still have a great number of qualms with the film in terms of its storytelling (sorry, this is going to be rather long):"
4,8,The Force has properly Awaken,"The 8th chapter in the newly resurrected Star Wars series, is a rollercoaster of an adventure, filled with the unexpected fun, twist and turns that have been delightfully introduced by Rian Johnson. What you would expect is not what is given to you, in the most whimsical Star Wars film to date."
5,6,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi can only be surmised, for me, as a disappointment.","I'm not exactly sure what everyone else watched, but this is certainly no masterpiece. I've seen words like risk-taking, bold and edgy being thrown around. Bold? Gimme a break. There's more boldness in the Times New Roman font. This instalment has evidently, looking at aggregated scores, polarised viewers. And I can see why. In this episode, the rebels attempt to flee from The First Order and it's up to Finn to retrieve someone to help them infiltrate their primary ship. Meanwhile, Rey tries to convince Luke to help the rebels and train her in the Jedi religion. That's pretty much as grand as this chapter gets. Where is the grandeur!? Where are the stakes!? Why am I not on the edge of my seat! No matter how aesthetically pleasing the visuals are, the constant feeding of nostalgia and the inclusions of a few memorable scenes...it doesn't make a film great. This episode is weighed down by underdeveloped characters, sluggish pacing and pivotal elements that are rushed. I have no doubt in my mind that Rian Johnson's directing style was glorious, in fact the technical aspects to The Last Jedi are outstanding. Visually I cannot fault the effects that are used and also appreciated the use of puppets and animatronics, particularly the Porgs which are bound to make Disney a fortune. Various memorable scenes, such as a cruiser lightspeeding into another ship, make for some general entertainment. But, I can't shake off the fact that I was bored. It took nearly half the film's runtime to get going and become interesting. Kylo Ren is the most intriguing character with plenty of internal conflict. Adam Driver gives a perfectly good performance, full of emotion beneath his eyes. I can see it! They just didn't explore his character arc or utilise him to his maximum potential. The Force Awakens introduces us to these fascinating bubbly characters that are just utterly wasted in this. I'm uncertain about ""bold"" choices regarding Leia, Snoke and Luke...but even so, I wasn't enthralled enough to care."
6,9,Amazed by the negativity,"I walked out of this movie with six friends at 3 am, and all of us were WIRED from adrenaline and amazement. And then I checked IMDB and saw nothing but angry fans, proving that there really is no pleasing organized fandom. Everyone complained mightily at how unoriginal and ""safe"" The Force Awakens was, and then a movie comes along with an actual point of view, with incredible style unlike anything that has come before it in the series, that is daring, fresh, and original...and now it's just too different for everyone."
7,6,The weakest one thus far.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Last Jedi. I read tons of reviews stating The Force Awakens was the worst one while for me it was the best one. The worst one to me was The Last Jedi, it's just much too long, it has an uninteresting story with a lot of unnecessary scenes, the CGI's were good but that's only normal for a Star Wars movie, certainly for a recent one. I just feel the writers didn't know what to do at one point, it was just a bad script this time. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One and The Last Jedi, those I thought were of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the tenth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely five days for me, next one today will be The Rise Of Skywalker, the latest and last one in the hope it will be better than this one, looking forward to it."
8,8,a lot of hate in the comment section,"It's not the best star wars film indeed, nor the best film of all time, but for me it's a very good film, one of the best of the year. this franchise has always been loyal to it's theme that is good vs. evil. sometimes the good comes from the evil side and vice versa. but in this film, the moral value is even more expanded. there's a lot of conflict about good and evil, virtue and vice, also what's best and what's not best in every plot of the movie. I also find one character that is very interesting. he simply doesn't belong to the good nor evil, he is either above or below that, he call it ""a system"". i bet he will get more screen time in the last installment because that character just opened a lot of possibility to another direction about good vs. evil."
9,6,"The problem , Writing Is","I am Star Wars fan when I was young, and when I finished for episode 8 , I was eagerly awaiting this Film and, as usual, Disney proved its complete failure to write!"
10,2,Did Rian Johnson watch the other films on mute?,"It is as if Rian Johnson watched the Star Wars movies on mute before writing/directing this film. Visually, the movie is stunning. From the set pieces to the action sequences, ""The Last Jedi"" has some of the best visual moments in the franchise. Unfortunately, the story and a true understanding of the Star Wars universe is lacking."
11,8,"A beautiful, humorous and magical Star Wars movie!","I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 7 years old, and I even remember seeing Empire and Jedi on the big screen as a kid. Yeah, I'm old. But, I'm a little shocked at so many haters of this movie, many of you have given a 2! A 2???? Seriously?"
12,6,The worst of the newest installments,"This film's downfall was the screenplay. The writing was all over the place with major plot issues and convoluted scenes. Even the attempted humor was stale. This felt more like a Disney film than a true Star Wars installment. For the long length of this film, the writing should have been tighter. However, still amazing cinematography and VFX, and the directing was OK considering the screenplay was a mess. Not sure how anyone can rate this a 1 (seeing lots of those) without any credit to the visuals. It's a fair and honest 6/10 from me"
13,3,Not this Disappointed Since Jar Jar Binks,I love the Star Wars franchise. I was so anxious to watch The Last Jedi especially how The Force Awakens ended and how good The Force Awakens was. I bought my tickets a month and a half in advance in anticipation of episode eight. 
14,,its just sad,"From now on, if a director wants to make a star wars movie, he should be tested in a exam from the fans first. Like this we would maybe get a actual star wars movie, and not a bad reboot."
15,10,"""Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans.""","I took my father to see this when it came out in theaters. After the movie, I told him that I thought it was my second favorite after Empire. My dad, who raised me on these movies, who has seen each of them when they first released in theaters dating all the way back to 1977, who has seen each of these movies almost as many times as I have, said ""Nah, I think this might've actually been my favorite.""<br /><br />I just watched this movie again for maybe the fourth or fifth time and I still love it. I think this was honestly my favorite of Mark Hamill's performances as Luke, because he shows so much range. He's a very tortured character, angry at himself, angry at the Jedi, angry at the Sith, and angry at the Force. In one brief moment of weakness, fearing the potential of the darkness in his nephew, fearing that he wouldn't be able to be the mentor Ben needed (the same fear he showed in Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, mind you), he made a mistake, because of course, not even Luke Skywalker is perfect, and that mistake cost him the soul of the son of his sister and his best friend. Without giving spoilers, Luke's arc takes him from the part of a reclusive curmudgeon, reminiscent of what we saw from Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, and leads him to be the hero and the face of hope that the Resistance needs when he utterly humiliates Kylo Ren in front of the entire First Order and the remains of the Resistance.<br /><br />The only real issue I have with the movie is that I feel the Canto Bight sequence is too preachy for my taste, as I just watch movies to have a good time - not to be given a sermon. But even that sequence has merits going for it, like that little drunk alien shoving tokens into BB-8 (that alien is played by Mark Hamill, by the way). Rose is adorable, and the fathiers are cute and the practical effects used to create them in the stable are flawless.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie is the whole last half hour that takes place on the planet Crait. The imagery of the asymmetrical speeders skating on the dusty surface, kicking up the bright red salt underneath is an incredible, unforgettable image. And as mentioned before, that one-on-one final confrontation is so satisfying, capped with that ""See you around, kid."""
16,6,The downfall of Star Wars,"Luke Skywalker's peaceful and solitary existence gets upended when he encounters Rey, a young woman who shows strong signs of the Force. Her desire to learn the ways of the Jedi forces Luke to make a decision that changes their lives forever. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren and General Hux lead the First Order in an all-out assault against Leia and the Resistance for supremacy of the galaxy."
17,8,"Johnson's fresh touch and Hamill's magnificent performance make for a film which is thrilling, clever, funny and heartbreaking at its best moments","I attended an advanced press screening of the movie a few hours ago. It won me over! And bear in mind that I hated ""The Force Awakens"" (honestly thought it was a Episode IV rip-off). Here, director Rian Johnson doesn't play it safe, and it pays off. If I must point out a certain highlight, it's without a doubt Mark Hamill's performance. I really admired his ability to convincingly convey so many different emotions throughout the film; hats off to this guy. I'll be rooting for him in the future."
18,7,Visually stunning but story gets lost,"Overall, I found this film very enjoyable and would rate it much higher had it not been part of a series of films where it undermines most of the main concepts. Sandwiches between TFA and ROSW, it makes little sense that Johnson tried to take this film in a different direction and little sense that Disney let him. A saga this big and important needed consistency and coherence, so the same director should have created all three films."
19,10,This is not going to go the way you think.,"First of all, let me alleviate the concern that this film is a rehash of Empire Strikes Back by affirming that it is indeed not. The Last Jedi is by far the most original, surprising and exhilarating Star Wars film since the Disney-Lucasfilm acquisition in 2012. It's also a high point in the Star Wars saga, and I have no doubt it will be remembered as one of the most consequential chapters in the Star Wars mythos in the years to come."
20,6,Somebody Phoned This In,"It's just not interesting. The fight coreography is terrible. Nothing is really answered and some things seem to be done just to change the story up. The jokes play on nostalgia for the original trilogy, but they're lame."
21,3,I'm going to keep this short (unlike the film).,"After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough."
22,9,"lots of supposed ""fans"" have no bloody clue what Star Wars is, plain and simple.","Let me just establish first that i grew up in the revival period of Star Wars, i watched the original VHS tapes, i vividly remember the special editions coming out, i remember there being no star wars games, then suddenly Rogue Squadron and Shadows of Empire being a large part of my childhood, i grew up knowing what the sith are, who Jorus C'Boath was, that Leia had twins with Han and that Luke starts a new order, the majority of my books are either physics texts or Star Wars/Lucas reference books. even in school, many lessons were taught with star wars references, from philosophy to english."
23,6,Mixed Bag: The Movie,The Last Jedi is one of the most complicated films for me to talk about. On one hand I love where they took some things but I also hated where they took other things. It feels like the director clashed with what was intrigued in The Force Awakens for a new approach to the story that doesn't make as much sense and isn't as good. Some character arcs are handled perfectly and others go nowhere. The Last Jedi's worth will only be proven by time at this point.
24,4,Don't reward Disney for this travesty and hand over your money to watch this Mickey Mouse movie,"Modern Disney - you know, the one that has to buy Pixar to gain any originality - has its fingerprints all over this one. There were great visuals, entertaining characters, and funny one-liners. Oh, and this one had inspirational messages: Anyone can be a hero, we fight out of love, failure is a teacher, etc. (however ham-fisted)."
25,,Different For The Sake Of Being Different,Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a cinematic event unlike anything. The buzz it created from the moment its first teaser went live resulted in a blockbuster release that shattered many box-office records during its theatrical run and gave the fans & newcomers their money's worth of big-budget extravaganza. It was also the first Star Wars film that I actually enjoyed watching.
26,10,The force is strong with this movie!,"This review is spoiler-free meaning it does not contain spoilers, but I will genuinely share with you how ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" affects me as a movie fan, as a Star Wars fan,.. and whether or not it does what it's supposed to do. Audiences around the world tend to agree with the statement that ""Empire Strikes Back"" is one of the best sequels ever made, well, I think ""The Last Jedi"" can easily take that honor now. This movie is astonishing and spectacular. It pushes many of this franchise's familiar elements to their limits and it really digs deep into the key characters and brings forth everything that stands out about them. Writer/director Rian Johnson is an impeccable storyteller."
27,6,"Good,Bad,and a lot of plot holes.",Great visuals. Some good moments. Terribly paced. Very boring I. The middle. Canto Bite scene worst in Star Wars. Terrible humor. Disconnected from the other movies. I'm confused how critics have this move high ratings.
28,10,"Master Piece. Your boos mean nothing to me, I've seen what makes you cheer.","Rewatching the Last Jedi. This movie is a master piece. I know that's an unpopular opinion, but I never put much stock in judging truth by popularity."
29,6,The Last Jedi is so bad on so many levels.,"I don't know where to start with this utter abominaton of a Star Wars movie. It's like Rian & Disney took everything that J.J. Abrams wrote and threw it out the window. There is no explaination who Ray and Snoke are and who were the Knights of Ren, Snoke is even killed off in the middle of the movie in a ridicilous way. The way they changed Luke Skywalker as a character is is just sad. All the hype where lukes blue lightsaber came from in The Force awakens was for nothing. There was not even a proper lightsaber battle in the end."
30,10,A near perfect star wars movie.....one of the best of this series......,"From all aspect this is by far the most attractive movie of star wars series to me. Not that i haven't seen all the movies , rather i am a real fan of star wars movies and i have seen all old and new movies very attentively. Also enjoyed those as well. But to me this is the movie of near perfection and ultimate action to go for."
31,6,Thematically misguided sequel that works better on its own terms than as part of a larger tale.,"""The Last Jedi"" is a surprising film, and a disheartening one. Surprising for its willingness to shake the status quo, and disheartening for how it nearly turns Star Wars into a series at war with itself. Surprising for the poignancy it clearly aspires to, and disheartening for casually discarding the goodwill garnered by its predecessor. It doesn't destroy Star Wars, contrary to some reports, and manages to avoid a far worse trajectory towards the end, but nonetheless left me with the dashed hope that we would ever get a non-polarizing installment. ""The Last Jedi"" essentially sapped my enthusiasm for the sequel trilogy."
32,1,An embarrassment for the Star Wars fans,"When I watch this movie, it only makes me remember how good were all those other Star Wars movies and series before this one. They were great! But this one is a disaster."
33,8,"""This is not going to go the way you think"". Damn true Luke!","THE GOOD<br /><br />Well that was most certainly a shock! After the phenomenal Force Awakens, The Last Jedi had a lot to live up to, and it most certainly delivered the hype in terms of story, characters and twists. It gave us some excellent development on the existing characters like Finn, Kylo, Leia and Luke, as well as giving a great new character in the form of Rose. The acting is excellent throughout, particularly from the veteran cast members. Looking back, Daisy Ridley as Rey was one of the weaker actors in The Force Awakens, but absolutely bring her A-game in the new film, running the whole range of emotions to incredible effect. As excited as I am for JJ to come back for IX, after this film Rian Johnson deserves to make this new trilogy he's announced."
34,6,The Force chooses The Weakest Jedis,"So even the most powerful Jedis didn't know how to contact each others this way, only feeling & high sense of each others."
35,4,Has its moments but generally unengaging and dull,"Picking up where The Force Awakens left off, Rey meets Luke Skywalker and tries to convince him to help The Resistance. He is initially hesitant but eventually decides to train Rey in the way of The Force. However, Kylo Ren also wants to track down Skywalker, and uses Rey for that purpose. Meanwhile, The Resistance are locked in deadly battle with the First Order and, while they have some minor victories, it seems like a futile struggle."
36,,i am shocked and speachless!!!,"What a insult to the fans. What a horrible thing to do to my childhood dreams!! Ryan johonson and kathleen kennedy obviously dont know or feel star wars. This movie is the worst film i have ever seen. I habe never experienced this amount of pain, anger, dissapointment and hate just by watching a movie. I mean...its just a movie. But actually it is not. If i would have a time machine i would kill hitler, buy bitcoins, and stop me from watching this movie!"
37,9,The Star Wars movie I like but a lot of people hates,"A couple years ago, Episode 8 of one of the best franchises ever came out and boy did it have serious mixed reviews. I was in my final year of high school and I had a friend who's a serious fan of Star Wars and he told me it sucked, but I didn't listened to him and I wanted to find out for myself. It took me longer to finally watch it for the first time than I thought, I finally watched it in February 2019 when I finally got the DVD for the first time. And what did I think of it? I actually enjoy it."
38,6,Never had these mixed feelings after Star Wars,"Well, it shocked me a little bit. Yes, it was a long movie, with a lot of happening, but away not enough explanation. I felt a bit disappointed after watching the Force Awakens. Despite it was a huge remake of the New Hope, I felt it was awesome, and a great base for a new trilogy. Because JJ was able to bring back the magic, that I'm watching a true Star Wars movie, in every single detail..."
39,8,As Daring as it is Divisive,"There's a stark imbalance of tone and pace that can make it difficult to reconcile Jedi's light-hearted and action packed moments with those slower and more reserved, and make the film's second act feel as low on fuel as the Resistance fleet. At times more concerned with exploring the moralities of heroism, the consequences often unseen behind them and the grey areas between the Light Side and the Dark, it also embraces the explosive spectacle that made this franchise great; delivering some of the best action and most phenomenal cinematography Star Wars has ever seen."
40,7,1-Star reviews? Give me a break.,I feel compelled to explain why I think SW: The Last Jedi deserves far better than the staggering number of 1-star reviews and why I think it's genuinely a pretty good movie (though not without caveats).
41,8,"Deceptively slow and a bit muddled to start, but stick with it and The Last Jedi will reward you with boldness and brilliance to think and talk about for days.","The middle film in a trilogy is, almost always, a tough one to pull off. Its predecessor gets to introduce characters and ideas and themes; its successor gets to finish off the tale and tie up all the loose ends. Often, this awkward second movie ends up treading water, padding out a story without the benefit of including either its first chapter or its last. For a while (quite a long while), it feels like writer-director Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi has fallen prey to this very syndrome. Fortunately, he pulls it all together in the film's final hour, firing off a series of crackerjack narrative twists that are as surprising, heartfelt and spectacular as anything you'll see in a cinema this year."
42,6,Made no sense,"I nominate this film as The Worst Movie in the History of the World. Why? Because the criteria is that the movie has to be bad, but not cheap, and made by a studio that should have know better, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi fits this description perfectly."
43,1,What the hell was this?,"Wow this is getting hammered by reviews and now I understand why. Given its still in week 1 and most of the early reviews were all paid for and fake, the fact that this is at:"
44,9,One of My Favorite Star Wars Films,"After watching Rise of Skywalker, I decided to go back to The Last Jedi. And yes, it's still great. It's got issues, but as a whole, it's quite impressive what it was able to accomplish. Middle chapters are not easy. But I think this film pulls it off wonderfully. Almost as well as Empire Strikes Back. The acting is brilliant, especially from Mark Hamill. His performance as a tormented and downtrodden Luke Skywalker is fascinating to see. Daisy Ridley is very talented, and I think she killed it as Rey. The rest of the cast is quite good as well. Particular praise goes to Adam Driver. This guy is destined to be the break out young star of this trilogy like Harrison Ford and Natalie Portman before him."
45,6,Deus ex machina overuse and a bad script made even more painful by good acting and a lot of wasted potential,"What I found incredibly professional was how serious and well everybody acted in what was clearly a joke of a story, yet instead of phoning it in, every actor did great. Like any force user turned towards the dark side, I felt conflicted, sitting there in the theater, admiring the technical work of CGI artists, actors, set designers and so on, while being taken for a complete retarded idiot by whoever wrote the story. Scene after bad scene, the heroes are stuck in impossible situations, only to get out again and again by means of tricks that make no sense with heroic music on the background. Either an all present, invisible and intelligent robot or a cute yet proud animal or some technology that could have been used three scenes ago with devastating results but for some reason no one thought of it, but at every step something that is no merit of the characters involved had to save them in order to further the stupid plot."
46,1,"Awful, DO NOT WATCH",Its so bad it doesn't deserve a proper review. So i'll just list the problems with it.
47,,The Last Film Review,"Years ago a sound-man on a Sun Micro corporate video shoot gave me a phone number for a job contact up at ILM. Being a young sci-fi fan and a then aspiring film maker, I was a nervous wreck. I called the number, let it ring three times and then hung up, largely because I had very little technical training and didn't think I would be of much benefit."
48,8,"Much more emotional and comical than it appears, ""The Last Jedi"" is an unusual follow-up in deified Star Wars canon","The most successful, celebrated and cherished franchise of all time is already here brimming with brand new, groundbreaking and laudable proposals, stamped in the story by a potential filmmaker who has achieved the impossible: get the endorsement of Lucasfilm about to conceive another radically different trilogy, with characters, scenarios, approaches and themes never seen before; he calls himself as Rian Johnson and is here to stay."
49,7,Different,"""The Last Jedi"" fits into the well-established atmosphere of the new trilogy, but at the same time it is different. Rian Johnson's revenue is clearly visible. Unlike ""The Force Awakens"", where it was set to be more secure, here the director allowed himself to insert entirely new things that make up the big universe of Star Wars."
50,10,One day you'll realise The Last Jedi is one of the good ones..,...Or one of the best ones. Please allow me to explain why.
51,6,What?,"I have been a star wars nerd from the age of 6, and this is not my Star wars. Im going to see episode 9 to round things up. But after that i am done with the 'Disney' star wars movies and will only read the legends material. Broker my heart"
52,9,This is my favourite one!,"I felt like everyone involved in this film had a blast doing it! The most artistic film in the entire franchise with some great humour, action scenes and suspense. I sat and watched the entire franchise on Disney plus. This one is by far my favourite."
53,6,Somewhat disappointed,"Well, I went to see it with quite low excectations on the basis of the directors past efforts, namely Looper."
54,2,"Almost 2 years later, still the most disappointing movie I've ever seen in my life.","Since Rise of Skywalker is coming soon, I'd figure I'd write this."
55,9,Awesome movie,"This movie continues the story of the force awakens beatifully and in unexpected ways. The villain kylo ren gets a lot of depth and screen time, which i wasnt expecting. He might be my new favorite star wars villain. Rey is likeable because of the great actress Daisy Ridley. Her charakter isnt that well written but i can see past that. Because of how great everything else is. And like i said i still like Rey, she is just not one of the most fleshed out Charakters. The ending of this movie is the best ending in the entire saga. I get chills only thinking about it. I have seen this movie now more than 10 times and its still great to rewatch because of the many deatails I discouver everytime i rewatch it. It ranks just behind star wars and the empires strikes back."
56,6,Disappointing,"'Star Wars Episode 8: The Last Jedi' was very different from any Star Wars film before it, in some ways good, and in some ways bad. It had an interesting story, like pretty much every other 'Star Wars' film, which isn't at all surprising. I was extremely excited walking into 'The Last Jedi', but I left kinda disappointed about certain aspects. I loved seeing the legendary Rebellion hero and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker again, but his death is the main part I was disappointed by. He is one of the most iconic characters in film history, and I feel his end should've been equally as iconic. I was on the edge of my seat when he showed up on the planet Crait to help the Resistance and him and his former student Ben Solo/Kylo Ren were about to fight. I thought it was going to be the most epic lightsaber duel of all-time, but instead it turned out Luke wasn't even there! He chose to stay on his little island and project a Force-illusion or hologram or whatever you want to call it, instead of showing up in person and facing Kylo like a man. Then he just disappeared and ""died"" like Yoda did in 'Return of the Jedi'. That really rubbed me the wrong way. Even if he knew he was gonna die, why didn't he go to Crait in person and duel Kylo Ren to buy the Resistance even MORE time to escape? Then when they were safely off-world, he could've done what Obi-Wan did in 'A New Hope': lowered his lightsaber (which technically should've been his green-bladed one instead of his blue one which had just been broken in half about a scene before), allowed Kylo to strike him with his red lightsaber, and just disappeared, leaving only his robes and lightsaber behind. That would've been an epic and iconic end for such an iconic character. Anyway, I feel like I'm ranting, so I'll move on. The space battle at the beginning was amazing, even though it didn't end well for many Resistance fighters and pilots. There were definitely a lot of deaths in this movie. Luke, Supreme Leader Snoke, Captain Phasma, Vice Admiral Holdo, Rose's sister, and Admiral Ackbar (""It's a trap!"") all died, which was very sad. I was hoping to learn more about Snoke's backstory because he was shrouded in so much mystery since The Force Awakens, but I guess he just wasn't that important. I got so excited when Kylo Ren killed Snoke because I thought he was turning good again, but it turns out he's still evil and just wanted to be Supreme Leader so he wouldn't have to take orders from anyone anymore. I guess it wouldn't have made much sense if he turned good again because then who would've been the main Force-using villain? The ensuing battle between Rey and Kylo vs. Snoke's guards was pretty cool, I just wish there would've been an actual lightsaber vs. lightsaber duel because this is actually the first Star Wars movie (aside from Rogue One) without one, which makes me kinda sad. Probably the biggest question going into 'The Last Jedi' was the mystery of Rey's parentage. It turns out her parents were just... nobodies. Drunks who sold young Rey off for drinking money or a way off Jakku or something, which was initially very disappointing to me because I really wanted her to be descended from or related to a character from the original trilogy or even the prequels. But the more I think about Rey essentially coming from nothing, the more I'm ok with it. After all, Anakin Skywalker was just a slave boy (and so was his mother), and I guess it shows fans that anyone can be a hero, no matter who you are or where you come from. Plus, it means she's free to forge her own path and make her own destiny instead of being held down by a famous bloodline. I really hope she has a double-bladed lightsaber like Darth Maul's in Episode 9, since she's proficient with a staff. The scene at the end with the little boy on Canto Bight using the Force to grab the broom and holding it like a lightsaber while wearing Rose's Resistance ring was cool because I think it symbolizes that a new generation of Jedi will rise, so the Jedi will never really ""end"" as Luke wanted. The acting from everyone was fantastic, and I think this was definitely Mark Hamill's finest performance as an older and more weary Luke. Overall, while there are some parts I didn't like, the film as a whole was solid. Not my favorite Star Wars film (that honor goes to The Force Awakens), but definitely solid, I just really wish Luke went out like more of the epic badass I know he is. I think the main, overall message of the film is that no matter how dark and dire things get, there is and always will be hope. By the way, I forgot to say my favorite part by far was Yoda's cameo. I almost cried."
57,2,"Dumbest plot in a long, long time","I can't really get into what's bad with this movie without dropping a ton of spoilers, but let me put it this way: a friend of mine went to see this before I did, and when I asked him how it was he hesitated, then said ""it's just a superhero series now"". He was more right than I ever could have known."
58,,Someone at Disney really hates Star Wars,"I have no explanation for this piece of junk other than that someone at Disney really hates Star Wars for being bigger than Mickey Mouse. This is not a movie. This is a planed assassination of the Star Wars myth, lore and legend."
59,9,An incredibly enjoyable film!,"Episode VIII is very enjoyable. It is the type of film you could easily go back to any time, sit down and watch and easily binge watch in a marathon (the way star wars are meant to be watched)."
60,7,A New-Age Sci-Fi Classic,"For film fanatics like myself, The Last Jedi is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the originals or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Star Wars films and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this 2 and a half hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why The Last Jedi is a must see as soon as possible. "
61,9,A Bold Film That Moves Star Wars Forward,"I was pleasantly surprised with how many risks this movie took, and I was even more surprised with how many of those risks paid off. I liked The Force Awakens, but I thought it often played things too safe. This does not."
62,6,Disappointingly Average,"I originally went to the midnight showing of this back in December. Only reviewing it now because, for whatever reason, I was unable to make a review for any title for the longest time."
63,9,"IMPRESSIVE, EVERY WORD IN THAT SENTENCE WAS WRONG!!","Since this film released 4 years ago i've had a mixed relationship with it where things dont seem to make sense and at times felt a tad boring. Having watched it again many times since and now again this evening I have come to grips with the story they're trying to tell and get along with it quite well, being able to piece parts of a puzzle in myself. The New Order have tracked the remaining Rebels and have them cornered and Rey having found Luke is searching for answers. There is a side mission with Finn and Rose in an attempt to free the rebel ship but it makes very little sense in the main scheme of things and is never really referred to again. Even with the issues, its a very fun film and a welcome part of the Star Wars family."
64,7,Please Take a Risk...... Someone?......... Anyone?,I'm struggling to understand the plethora of positive ratings and reviews for TLJ. 
65,4,Doesn't make sense,"If you sort these reviews by ""helpfulness"", you won't find a single review with a score of 7 or higher. Then how come this movie has an overall score of 7! Something isn't adding up."
66,9,Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Quick Movie Review,"Director: Rian Johnson<br /><br />Release Date: December 15th, 2017 (US)<br /><br />Runtime: 2hrs 32mins"
67,6,It's bad. I don't know why people defend it.,I really want to sit across from Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy and ask them honest questions:
68,5,"A Betrayal, and not a Star Wars film","The New Order has the Republic, now the Rebellion, on the run. General Leia Organa's small resistance force has been discovered. Their only hope is Force-newbie Rey finding hermit-like Luke Skywalker and persuading him to pass on his Jedi knowledge to a new generation."
69,,Boring,"No sense of danger, no tension, no interest and the jokes oh my god the wisecracks and the one-liners. What was that??<br /><br />The actors are terrible, the new emperor was obviously a moron and his guards were beyond useless obviously too. When the fight breaks out around his throne not for one moment anyone believes the outcome is in doubt. It looked like a weak dance choreography.<br /><br />I guess I am tired of Disney's movie and that they release one a week. I never liked jokes and humour anyway."
70,9,A film that takes time to warm up to.,"I was one of those who saw the film on opening night about 3 years ago. I like most was kind of upset and at times angry. And the more I watched it the more I hated it. However, after watching it recently I began to realize it's message and it's ideas. And after watching it again a few hours ago I wasn't left angry or disappointed or even happy, I was left with tears in my eyes. It does have many problems, but with its message of choosing your own path and it's character changes with Luke for example. I can say that this film is possibly the best film in the entire series (well next to Empire)."
71,6,Flawed But Enjoyable,"I was very torn between a 5 and a 6 on this movie. This movie is like 2 steps forward one step back. Things happen that are very interesting and make you want to learn more, but then something will happen that takes you out of what is happening because the movie is absolutely disjointed at times. Still, it's Star Wars, and that's all you need to say for me to enjoy a movie."
72,9,Time flies when you're having fun,"The latest installment in the Star Wars movie universe takes it back to it's origins with a fun, enjoyable space ride. Sure there are some slow moments and corny moments but Star Wars was always about adventure and fun and this movie has loads of it. If you want more serious SW drama just keep watching Rogue One or ESB. A lot of the things that happened in this movie I expected to see in Episode IX not in this one so it makes me wonder what will be happening next..."
73,7,"90% safe and marketable mediocrity, 10% interesting ideas","I'm not going to tell you whether it was good or bad, this is for you to decide. I will just try to share my experience. Spoiler-free, of course, yet there is not that much to spoil in this episode. The movie was mostly predictable for a sane person."
74,10,The Last Jedi - Just as Mind-Boggling As The Others!,"As I sat back in the comfy leather seats and watched the star-dusted opening credits roll out in front of me, I reminisced about what it felt like watching the Star Wars series for the first time. It has been a long time since that happened and my only hope was that Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be just as mind-boggling as the others. Shame on me for ever doubting the legendary billion-dollar franchise, because (spoiler alert): It is!"
75,7,"Moments of brilliance, but messy at times",The First Order is closing in on the Resistance and Rey meets Luke Skywalker.
76,1,Delete this from my memory pls,Absolute crap.
77,9,"Heroes inspire others to be greater. I think that is what ""The Last Jedi"" does best.","Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile, the Resistance prepares for battle with the First Order."
78,7,A lot better than 'The Rise of Skywalker',"This film was doing the series a favour, by creating new elements that Star Wars desperately needed. Rather than going round in circles with the same cliched story arcs, most Star Wars properties seem to fall into. It was bold, and energised the series with new concepts that Star Wars hadn't had taken time to think about."
79,2,The day that Star Wars died,"I watched this movie twice before finally making up my thoughts. The more i think about this one the more i felt empty and angry at the same time. You can enjoy this movie if you're simply want to see some space ships fighting, some aliens, thrown in, random politcal correct messages without any connection to the splot, some Marvell humor and no story telling at all."
80,,Why the hell are they tearing down the old films.,Rian Johnson has made a dogs dinner of this franchise. It had such potential but he's decided that he's going to change the whole world of the Jedi and the characters who occupy the Star Wars world. This film is an absolute disgrace to the story George Lucas was trying to tell.
81,9,STILL NOT AS BAD AS EMPIRE STRIKES BACK!,"I'm a crazy fan boy who knows everything there is to know about Star Wars! This movie did not line up with my specific vision of what Star Wars should be, so therefore it sucked! "
82,6,One and done.,I did enjoy the movie when watch it first. At least get some new ships. How some of them are illogical. Space bombers fire missiles because they can not rely gravity to make the bombs drop. Most space bombers in Star Wars fire missiles or torpedoes of some kind. Then have what come in the end of the move which question make weapons in the first place. Good seeing first time because not really thinking about it.
83,10,The most divisive star wars film,"I've finished seeing the film an hour and a half ago, utterly shocked. I could not decide whether I liked the film or was disappointed. I'm serious: this film can really give serious doubts on their capacity of judgement."
84,6,They made Obi-Wan Kenobi a LIAR! Again!,"The biggest problem I have with Episode VIII is...<br /><br />""If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.""<br /><br />Because he is a force GHOST! That (once) meant he can't physically intervene in the ""real world"".<br /><br />In TLJ it seems that force ghosts can do everything they want. Cast lightning, fight Kylo Ren. etc.<br /><br />So Obi-Wan was a liar, or the script for TLJ invented new Jedi powers? <br /><br />You decide."
85,9,"""The greatest teacher, failure is""","It disheartens me to see all these scathing criticisms by die-hard Star Wars fans on the IMDb. ""The single worst Star Wars movie ever!"", ""I thought I was in the wrong theater"", ""This is a parody, right? RIGHT?!"", ""A disgrace to the greatest film saga of all time"", ""Star Wars is now officially dead"". No, it's not. I'm not ready to throw Star Wars under the bus. I'll tell you what WILL be the death of Star Wars, though: this constant nitpicky attacking for insufficient purity. I am not a die-hard Star Wars fan and you can call me crazy for saying this, but this movie is actually my favorite in the Star Wars saga. Everything about it screamed beauty: the sets, cinematography, costumes, acting, storytelling, and the pathos. Some claim it's too Disney-fied and I see their point. A little too much comic relief can make it unpleasant (looking at you, Jar-Jar). But I say, ""If this is the way Star Wars is going, then so be it"". This is probably the quintessential Star Wars film and the most satisfying entry in a while, which merits from me a 9/10."
86,6,Disappointing,"Star Wars - The Last Jedi was disappointing, to say the least. To many mistakes were made, no questions were answered, as if they just do not care, which is probaply the case. Even Mark Hamill said that he did no like what they did for the original charakters.<br /><br /> It sometimes reminded me a lot of the prequels from the early 2000s, so I can not rate this movie higher than 6/6.5!"
87,3,Snoke: You are no Vader. You are just a child in a mask.,"The Last Jedi is a weak eighth installment, lacking the magic of all those before."
88,9,The best star wars storytelling and directing since return of the jedi,"When a movie goes against what people think they want and know about the star wars universe, they will complain. That does not change the fact that this is, objectively, the best star wars since the original trilogy. Well done rian johnson. Disney, dont turn star wars into the Marvel universe and pan to crowd pleasing, because that's an impossible task"
89,6,The Death of Fandom,"Fanboys? Where we are going we need no fanboys. This is what I take from ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017). Disney decided to troll the man-children and oh boy how they did it. From in-your-face feminism to the unnecesary love of a nerdy Asian girl, they managed to fill the movie with satiric touches about the failure of fandom. This is the anti-Nolan in a way: it tells fans that they are stupid."
90,2,Garbage,"I am so sorry that for the first time in my life, I walked out of a Star Wars movie. This was so disappointing. As a young father, every moment I spend outside of the house without my kid has to be justified, and after about an hour of this garbage, I could not suppress my conscience anymore, and walked out to go home and spend more time with my kid. This piece of garbage had no character development, horrible edits, basically ruined Luke Skywalker's character and turned him into a hobo. I am so frustrated right now. They've ruined Star Wars."
91,,"A quick further note about ""professional"" reviews.",The professional reviews? Either paid for or written for them by the studio. You cannot have this many terrible reviews here by people who saw the movie and believe Metacritic and RT are the real reviews. Or else they were given a different movie. Don't waste your money on this movie.
92,8,WTF is wrong with you people?! It is a good movie! :D,"Won't post any spoilers, but reading all these bad reviews: I just have to set this straight."
93,6,Very ambitious and Very bad,"As bad as the first two prequel films. Awful writting-terrible humor, dialogue, and character arcs. Not to mention the awfully boring pace of a slow speed chase, and terrible inconsistent tone off the film. <br /><br />Replaces fantasy world building and new direction on story telling with subversion for subversion sake.<br /><br />This movie is aging really bad. It has become a joke! A lot of movements are laugh out loud unintentionally funny. <br /><br />For all the ""subversion "" we are left at the end right we're it starts. Bad guy in black leading empire against rebels with young Jedi. At times it felt like it could get interesting, but it reverts back to d tropes and bland writing. <br /><br />None of the emotions or wonder of the original films. <br /><br />I am amazed this gets a decent critical review with so many crinch worthy moments. Anyway, watch it after a beers for a good laugh. <br /><br />I give it two stars because it looks pretty. <br /><br />In the end it is said it had come to this. TLJ and the prequels will make people forever sceptical of these films. Maybe, we should just take them for what they have become,. Big loud, pretty popcorn films with corny dialogue and little depth. Subversion does not equal depth. These movies will never be as good as the originals. Why did it take so long to realize this?"
94,9,Fanboys ruin everything,"This is a 8.5/10 Star Wars film. Many similarities to Empire. They were both bold, took the saga to new levels and were ORIGINAL. People didn't like Empire at first, same with Last Jedi. Empire aged well and so will this movie."
95,6,They keep moving just out of the range of our guns,"The original Star Wars, now 40 years old, was always presented as a complete but fairly sterile universe. We enjoyed the heroics of the first 3 films, but were largely nonplussed by the CGI laden effects of the next 3. Like the last film, this is a return to form."
96,9,A triumph,I've never called anything in my life a triumph before so I guess this is a fine place to start since some folks are being so hyperbolic.
97,7,Oh Boy,"""The Last Jedi"" is probably the most controversial film in the entire saga. There are some people who truly hate this movie. There are some people who think that it's one of the greatest in the saga. I'm somewhere in the middle. Honestly I could care less about whatever lore ""contradictions"" this movie upsets fans of the series with. Most of the ""new"" force powers here work for the movie. Also, you're complaining about characters projecting themselves across the galaxy through the force in a series where one of the main characters is a two foot tall goblin who can move rocks with his brain. People who are upset with this movie for very minor in-universe inconsistencies really don't understand that they've been doing this since the very first few ""Star Wars"" films. ""Wow, they can shoot lightning out of their fingertips now? Why didn't Obi-Wan or Luke just do that in either of the previous movies?"" Stuff like that. It doesn't really matter. In the end, these movies are all just dumb adventure movies set in a unique and interesting universe. What I will say is that this movie does have quite a few actual issues in terms of telling a competent story. The plot and tone are all over the place. Some of the characters and subplots are extremely rushed and underdeveloped. There's an overall lack of focus. This movie could have been trimmed by about half an hour and it would have been excellent. The bright spots shine, but there is also a lot of fat that should have been cut."
98,1,"NEVER, in ALL MY LIFE, have I been more GENUINELY ANGRY at a movie.",How this script made it past everyone at Disney I'll never know. What happened to the Star Wars that told a coherent story and focused on characters that we truly cared about? 
99,8,"As Kylo said, let the past die","""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" is a 2017 science fiction film directed by Rian Johnson starring Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Back when I was a kid, this saga was a key element of my daily life. I had dozens of shirts and tons of merch and considered myself as a hardcore fan. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole six films (yes, even the prequels) and was always sad when the credits for Episode VI rolled, knowing there will never be a continuation. Years later, after Disney bought the franchise, my wish became reality. I was so hyped to see what the next generation would achieve in this beloved franchise of mine. In 2016, I finally had the time and chance to experience the seventh installment and although I thought it was great, it was still a bit disappointing as the people around me considered it as the best of them all. Since then, I lost the interest in the whole universe, especially after realising that there were way too many projects in this saga. Star Wars films became mass products and I disliked that a lot. But now that the final conclusion hit the theatres, my brother told me how great the sequel trilogy is and actually caught my curiosity, but before I get to watch the series finale, I had to check out the probably most hated entry of the saga, abhorred by the fans and praised by the critics. So, after four years of literal abstinence, I finally revisited the galaxy far, far away and it made me feel like a kid again. First of all, the film looks beautiful from start to finish and the modern technology enable the creators to create something that is way beyond phenomenal. The scenery and especially the aliens and animals are well designed and reminded me of the good old times. The other thing I noticed was how the film (like the MCU films) had instances of humour in it. I had mixed feelings about it, to be honest, on one hand it was kinda enjoyable, but on the other hand unnecessary. Furthermore, I als noticed the things that bugged the hardcore fans the most, but I considered them as so small and irrelevant that I even enjoyed most of them. The problem most fans had with this entry was probably that the director didn't follow the usual pattern of how SW films were made in the past. He went in his own direction and made some decisions that wouldn't appease all the fans, but this is what made this film so good for me. Nobody expected Smoke to be killed of in this film, that's what makes it so interesting, because they tried to do something all new. Also, many fans complained that Luke wasn't in the main focus of the film. He was never supposed to. All characters from the original trilogy only play supporting roles and are only there to pass the torch to the new generation. In my humble opinion, the only logical decision one could make. They already played their part, that's it. Now it's about Rey, Kylo Ren, Poe Dameron and Finn, the first two being two of the most interesting characters in the franchise that ever existed. Both actors are extremely talented, Adam Driver even is one of my favourite actors of the current generation. There's no black and white anymore, they both rank somewhere in between the old balance and that was one of the best decisions Johnson ever could have taken. There doesn't need to be an all bad guy anymore, but therefore people need to get out of their comfort zone. Next to this, it still had enough connections to the original trilogy: Luke and Leia reappearing, R2-D2 reuniting with his owner and most importantly, my favourite moment of the film, the appearance of Master Yoda. It gave me goosebumps to see the old puppet in action again, it tried to make such connections without losing its originality and it succeeded with this. Also, it had enough epic moments in it (the tag team fight, the face off with Luke) and even the side story of Finn and Rose was kinda enjoyable (still don't understand the hate towards her character) and in general it had a well thought out plot and story. It combined multiple story lines and it never became boring, not even a single second. A movie that runs more than two and a half hours never appeared so short to me. Of course they could have gotten deeper in the Grey Jedi philosophy, but I wouldn't consider it as a wasted opportunity, instead they did something no-one has seen coming, and I applaud for this brave decision. The death of Luke Skywalker had a meaning and it was a magnificent farewell to this character, as I said, he played his part. All in all, this installment is a surprisingly terrific entry in the saga. It's not what people expected, hence the sheer amount of hate for it. What others dislike is what I personally cherish, it tried to do something all new and went in a direction that nobody expected and that's what deserves my respect. As I said, I have been gone from this galaxy for almost four years and had zero expectations about it and that's probably my advantage. In the end, the general rating is low, because we all know that nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans themselves. As someone who enjoyed most of the films, I had no problem with it and it even made me curious about the final episode. An enjoyable film for those who go into it with and open mind. Don't expect anything, free yourself from frantic expectations and enjoy a film that finally brought fresh air into an old saga. Disney didn't ruin the franchise, they resurrected it greatly. It's an unpopular opinion, but I'm standing behind every single word and that's what makes me happy, because it made fun from start to finish."
100,7,Is this even Star Wars or is it a terrible fanfic,"This movie has terrible a plot, it made no sense, the characters from the original trilogy and the new trilogy just got destroyed, the force now makes no sense, they forgot gravity doesn't exist in space, they massacred the old characters (I might of mentioned that already), this movie is the ultimate disrespect for the original 3 movies that I've ever seen, they made Luke into something that shouldn't even been spoken about. They somehow made Leia, FLOAT. EYES OPEN. IN. SPACE. NOT DEAD. This movie is one of the worst movies ever made.<br /><br />They made Poe into Han Solo but worse with no Chewbacca, they made Kylo Ren what he wasn't supposed to be, a boring character, we don't get enough explain of his backstory of how he became Kylo Ren, Snoke had potential but only the force knows what they did to him. Rey was the best character in the film when we see her have some training with the force, but that's literally the only good thing I can say about this abomination. Finn was just shouting the entire movie, for Anakin's sake just SHUT UP!! Hux was supposed to be space Hitler but they turned him into a joke, they messed what would of been an interesting character, up."
101,1,A Complete Disgrace,"I was totally baffled during the movie and when I walked out of the theater, had become lost of thought and empty of any emotion - perhaps because I was in a state of shock. I won't regurgitate the many valid negative points that previous reviews have already discussed. They are all valid and should be up-voted every single instance. I just want to comment on how utterly disgraceful it was for the handling of four main characters:"
102,,Underwhelming,"I share Hamill's disapproval regarding the evolution (of rather devolution) of Luke. His self-imposed exile made just about as much sense as Yoda's. In fact, it made even less sense because at least Yoda was acknowledging that he was getting too old to fight the good fight and instead decided to wait for Luke and Leia to grow up. Chances are he felt his time had come because of his old age. (In the originals we didn't even know why Yoda was on Dagobah)"
103,9,Not bad at all,"From my point of view, who saw the original trilogy as a kid in german lang. on sattelite tv, and then few years later on VHS in czech hundred times, I say I liled it a lot, it is original, as the original trilogy was. Total problem was the prequels, where GL tried to maximize the universe, too many tricks and robots, that did not work, the acting was terrible, and only last few minutes of first and third movies where worth it. But I loved Ep XII, and I love this episode as well, RJ is not bad, AJ is my favorite director, but he did not do well in Ep IX, the screenplay was terrible in first 30 minutes and he killed all the acting of side actors, he developed only the main character (succesfuly), but he should not try to change what RJ tried to evolve in Ep VIII, he should not return with Palpatine (there is no base story in it), I think that was a biggest mistake, the story was going its own way and that was good, we did not need a remake, but a new SW movies, and in that Ep VIII was excelling. So for me Ep VIII is better than Ep IX."
104,7,Vissualy amazing but other than that meh...,"It's not as bad as most of the world says but at the same time I understand why it's so controversial! In my opinion, Snoke was a disappointment, he appears for a short time after which he is killed and that's all about him, there are no explanations about the character and he is forgotten in the future as if he didn't exist. Luke shows up and it's pretty disappointing and Yoda I was happy to see him again. Towards the final act, apart from the spectacular fights, the story remains in the air and as if everything should have ended definitively and I was quite confused. Yeaah not the best for sure but also not the worst!"
105,9,Suck it up fanboys. Star Wars is moving on!,"It's arrogant to assume that the Star Wars films, like the force, belong exclusively to one group of people. These movies no longer belong to those who grew up with them, but to everyone, old and young. The films are moving on and if you can't deal with that, then perhaps it's time you got off the Star Wars train."
106,6,Adam Driver is the only good thing in here,"I'd give him a 10 for his Kylo Ren. But the film itself is so forgettable I can't give it more than just a 4, and that's considering the weight of Adam's part in it."
107,9,Best Star Wars Movie Yet,"My favorite Star Wars Movie before seeing The Last Jedi was Empire, but it has since been replaced. This movie hits all the right notes while bringing Star Wars to the next level. It maintains that Star Wars feel and adds a lot to the mythology of the series. I really wish Rise of Skywalker had continued the themes of this movie."
108,6,The Last Jedi is an original movie unlike The Force Awakens!,"I want to start with saying The Force Awakens was not just the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. It is the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. So some of you may have bad expectations from this movie because of the first movie of this trilogy. Don't be afraid, it is not going to be a waste of your money or your time. It is definitely worth to see!<br /><br />During the movie, some of the characters has their own conflicts. We see that it is not that easy to be the bad or the good. Making a choice between two sides is never really easy. I think this is one of the things that makes us human. I loved to see this conflict inside the characters during the movie. <br /><br />The story is above the avarage. I don't think this is the best Star Wars story or movie but The Last Jedi has a different style. You will be shocked in some scenes. This movie made me feel very excited for the final episode of this trilogy. <br /><br />The Last Jedi is way better than The Force Awakens and you really need to see this movie. You won't be disappointed. Star Wars is back!"
109,3,A big stumble backwards,"I didn't like Star Wars: The Last Jedi and I'm sorry. It seems as if the filmmakers were so focused on cool visuals and clever-sounding lines that everything else suffered. There are plot points that don't make sense, dramatic scenes which are undercut by out-of-place humor, and inconsistent characters. After the prequels, I felt like The Force Awakens was a step in the right direction, but this movie is a big stumble backwards."
110,10,"One of the best, or the best","This came along and blew expectations out of the water. The Force Awakens was too safe, and basically remade A New Hope. The Last Jedi attempts to course correct by choosing a filmmaker who would deliver something original and fresh. Some of the best story beats are removing the dull aspects of the original. The Empire Strikes Back was released to mixed responses, just like Last Jedi. In time it will be interesting to see how this film is received. The backlash came from a corner of fans wanting a simple mythology, and no twists. How boring. This flipped the switch and true Star Wars fans were treated to an original storyline. Hopefully the last film can maintain the edginess created here by Rian Johnson, but sadly with Abrams returning, I suspect more spoon feeding for the masses. Next week I'll find out."
111,6,Star Wars Digging Their Own Grave...,"Everyone knows that Star Wars movies are always going to get billions in the box office, no matter how bad the movie is. I feel like Star Wars is now a cash grab from the fans, and I am a fan. The last Star Wars movie that was good was Star Wars: The Force Awakens, in my opinion, and it was in 2015; it's now 2018. I saw some mixed reviews on rotten tomatoes between the audience and the critics, as usual. Personally I'm more on the audiences' side, because I really don't care about the visuals, I care about the story; and let me tell you, the story is trash for a Star Wars movie. And I don't know if it was the director or the writers who screwed up the story. I'm now afraid of what Star Wars movies are going to become; probably a big cash grab, hopefully not to the point as Ghostbusters (2016). Star Wars: The Last Jedi is like a tennis ball, bright on the outside, but hollow on the inside."
112,1,Over 8 stars... for this?,"After seeing the unbelievable rating of this movie, I have never felt further removed from the average Star Wars fan. "
113,,"Visually impressive, but surprisingly sterile","I'd heard lots of good things about this film before coming to it; in particular with its darker tone being comparable to Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps this slightly hyped expectation is what led to the film being quite the disappointment. There is an attempt at darker material here, while also shadowing what has gone before, but mostly it feels like a production line film, rather than something made with real energy and risk. That feeling is not anti-Disney for the sake of it (I get most of my entertainment from massive corporations seeking to make money) but certainly part of that is the weight and ease of the franchise, and how it impacts the film."
114,9,Best Star Wars movie since 1980,"The story is excellent and you will not believe some of the twists and turns of it. Everyone is unbelievably great but Mark Hammil steals the show. Great practical effects. John Wiliams score shines as always. I have many things to say but ill let you watch this amazing movie. Yes, its that good!"
115,7,"It's a Good Film, Just Not a Great Film (Spoiler Free)","Look, The Last Jedi is good, it's just not great.<br /><br />If you're a Star Wars fan and thought The Force Awakens was a little too close to Star Wars - A New Hope in terms of story line then TLJ is more of the same.<br /><br />Effects are good, Daisy Ridley is the undoubted star and Adam Driver brings a complexity that is often missing from the main protagonist. It's recommended for the Big Screen and it's no Attack of the Clones (6.6), but it isn't Empire (8.8) either and in the end it falls somewhere between the two."
116,10,Call me crazy or whatever...,"A disclaimer on the Last Jedi, art, and toxicity: you're allowed to not like this movie just as you're allowed to like this movie. You are no less intelligent based on your opinion; you are no less of a fan based on your opinion. I love this movie and I have very good friends who definitely did not. That is okay. I'm sorry if you felt the Last Jedi ruined your childhood or ruined Star Wars for you; but please don't attack the people who put every ounce of love they had into this piece of art. Don't personally attack Rian Johnson and don't attack the actors for doing their job; and certainly don't ever attack anyone because of race, sex, or just who they are as a person. You're allowed to not like this movie; just don't hate the cast and crew behind it. That way lies madness."
117,6,A Disappointing Next Step For The Franchise!,"""This is not going to go the way you think"", too right! A lot of people including Youtube's SCREEN JUNKIES have claimed that this is the worst STAR WARS movie to date. I don't think it's the worst, but I certainly don't think it's the best. In the first half I was quite frankly bored, and by the beginning of the second half I had already diagnosed several, big problems: 1) The clunky script had abandoned the emotional weight and grit of the previous movies. 2) There are FAR too many sub-plots and additional characters. 3) It's just too predictable and 4) the whole plot is quite frankly just a rehash of both THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI. Don't believe me? Here we go: a young Jedi abandons the cause of the Rebellion to travel to a desolate homestead to learn how to become a Jedi from a cranky but father-like teacher, ""it's a trap"" as bad guys close in on the rebels once again, half the gang is betrayed by a conman who they thought was their friend, the young Jedi has a dream where they see a shady figure that turns out to have the same face, the rebels prepare for battle with AT-ATs while sitting in a trench in a primarily white landscape, the 50% bad guy kills his evil overlord, the old Jedi master passes away and finally, a Yoda ghost appears. Sound familiar?"
118,9,Best since New Hope & Empire,"If I didn't have such good nostalgia for the first two (New Hope & Empire), I would say that this was the BEST Star Wars film."
119,6,Weakest entry in the series,"A visuel triumph that is unfortunately bogged down by mostly forgettable characters, as well as a plot that is both deeply unsatisfying and at times eye rolling."
120,2,Where it all went wrong.,"This is the movie that killed the sequel trilogy. A cocky director who was awful to fans because they enjoy speculating in between movies to get excited for them. He then proceeded to release a complete dumpster fire of a film where he wrecked a storyline that was sent up in the last film, had a 35 minute sequence that made no sense and added nothing to the story just to have some sort of strange animals abuse message, wrecked the character of Finn by having him go on that ""mission"" and tried to saddle him with Rose who was a useless character, and crapped on the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson is such a doofus he thought he was gonna change Star Wars and he succeeded. He succeeded in wrecking the movies to the point where now everything is a show."
121,8,Should Satisfy Your Action Needs,"I saw ""Star Wars:The Last Jedi"", starring Mark Hamill-Kingsman:The Secret Service, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back; Carrie Fisher-Charlies' Angels:Full Throttle, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back; Adam Driver-Logan Lucky, Midnight Special; Daisy Ridley-Murder On the Orient Express_2017, Star Wars:The Force Awakens and Andy Serkis-The Planet of the Apes movies, 13 Going on 30."
122,7,"Terrible Director, terrible technique","Rian Johnson, clearly wasn't a choice for a movie of that magnitude. The movie edition was terrible, jumping from scenes to scenes in a very amateur way that kills all the drama."
123,1,The Single worse Star Wars film ever made,"Expect everything you love and know about Star Wars to be trashed in this film. Imagine preparing the most extravagant meal with the most expensive and luxurious ingredients in the world. You spend days preparing the food, then as you plate up you pour two buckets of salt on top of everything. Your wonderful well made food ruined under a mountain of salt. This is exactly what the director did in the Last Jedi, he destroyed it. It was overlong, far too conscious of itself with crude plot twists and no love for the characters. It was as if an alien had landed on earth and never seen the other films and just made it in an afternoon. The words Last are very meaningful, it's the last time I will go to a Star Wars film, the Last time I will care about a star wars film and the last time any fan will have hope of seeing a film fans deserve. The Jedi are WELL AND TRULY DEAD!! Great work Disney!! Took some doing to destroy this franchise."
124,,Glad I didn't see in theaters,"I waited to read reviews cause I wanted to make up my own mind, wish I would have now, I think one reviewer said it best it was Spaceballs 2, the worst parts were the strange humor, the Casino stuff, and Luke being a jerk, I honestly wanted to turn it off halfway through, it never got any better, so sad"
125,8,Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017),"Directed by Rian Johnson. Starring Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher, Kelly Marie Tran, Domhnall Gleeson, Laura Dern, Benicio del Toro, Andy Serkis, Anthony Daniels, Joonas Suotamo, Gwendolyn Christie, Amanda Lawrence, Lupita Nyong'o, Frank Oz. (PG-13)"
126,7,Thoroughly Disappointed,There is so much I didn't like about this movie it's hard to know where to start. And what's worse is that I am a huge Star Wars fan and I feel the franchise has been betrayed by people who do not appreciate it as it deserves (namely Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson).
127,8,Disney spent $5 billions for this editing fiasco,Beginning movie sequence.<br /><br />Why doesn't the dreadnought move when Poe attacks?<br /><br />Why it doesn't move when the bombers move in?<br /><br />Just move a couple miles. 50-100.
128,6,A weird feeling: Star Wars The Last Jedi,"Very few times has happened to me that I'm unable to rate a movie. I tend to have a very claer idea of what I think about a movie after I've seen it once, or maybe twice if I'm not sure what to make of it the first time. But after the third time watching this movie and almost three years of thinking about it, I'm still impressed by the unrateable quality of it. As a Star Wars fan I can understand why people got upset about this (although not necesarilly to the level it got to), but I do not see how in any capacity this movie is terrible. It has a number of problems that I consider irredeemable for a movie of this budget and scope, but at the same time it has some of the most interesting concepts explored in the Star Wars Universe. I would watch this over Solo every single time, but I wouldn't blame anyone for doing the opposite."
129,9,May the Faro be with you,"The Baltic Sea, should you find yourself there, and you're the romantic type, searching for a philosopher by rowboat, you know about the two islands off the southeastern coast of Sweden. You're looking for Faro, the smaller rock, further north from Gotland, where filmmaker Ingmar Bergman called home, away from well-meaning but bothersome cineastes who had so many questions about the creative force inside him, until he passed away in 2007 at the the age of 89. Filmmaker Rian Johnson outs Ingmar as a secret Skywalker, Luke's spiritual brother. In ""The Last Jedi"", Episode VII in the ""Star Wars"" saga, Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a Jedi who lost that fightin' feeling, can't understand how this unannounced visitor, Rey(Daisy Ridley), a mere girl, was able to locate the tiny island on the most obscure planet in the galaxy. Towards the end of J.J. Abrams' ""The Force Awakens"", BB8, an astromech droid, supplies the last piece that completes the map detailing Master Luke's supposed whereabouts, which R2D2 kept stored in low-power mode. The two hermits, one, a fictional character, a Jedi Knight, who turned his back on ""The Force"", a religion that, according to its last living practitioner, does as much bad as it does good; and the other, a legendary filmmaker of Swedish origin, who directed, for starters, ""Winter Light"", the 1963 film about a pastor losing his religion and his parishioner to suicide, is linked together by Max von Sydow. Sydow plays both Jonas Persson, the morose and fatalistic Lutheran, and Lor San Tekka, a retired adventurer but active Resistance collaborator from Jakku, the same desert planet where Rey, an orphaned junk collector, hails from. The presence of the medieval knight from Bergman's masterpiece ""The Seventh Seal"" makes plausible the theory that Faro serves as the inspiration for the floating rock where Luke Skywalker inhabits. ""Bergman's Island"", Faro's unofficial moniker, had loyal residents who protected their famous neighbor from reporters and tourists, which became increasingly harder after the advent of Google Maps during Bergman's final years, but like Rey, not coincidentally, the film world sent its own emissary, Marie Nyrerod, a girl, to coax the old master back into the spotlight. Luke, inevitably, would unretire, but in Bergman's case, ""Saraband"", released in 2003, would prove to be his final film, but Nyrerod returned back to civilization with ""Bergman's Island"", the last time the film universe would hear from its beloved hero, whose camera was his lightsaber."
130,6,Such disappointment and an overly bloated movie with useless scenes,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi was a severe disappointed. A two year wait and anticipation was wasted with missed opportunities and plain bad writing. <br /><br />Because so many things are awful and made no sense at times, I'll start with what I did like. <br /><br />The special effects didn't disappoint. They were of Stars Wars quality and then some. Great colour throughout the film. <br /><br />The opening sequence of where the Resistance is evacuating their base was awesome. Beautiful action sequence and well done. There was one problem where a bomber released its bombs and the movie completely forgets the laws of gravity but I'll ignore this since there's not supposed to be any sound in space. <br /><br />Lightsaber battle between Rey, Kylo and Snoke's elite guards was another high point in the movie and should have had a lot more lightsaber battles. Remember it's a Star Wars movie guys. <br /><br />Now for all the bad. <br /><br />Humour was overly used and made power characters look like fools, namely General Hux. <br /><br />Cat and mouse game between the Resistance and the First Order was tremble. A sequence that should have been 10 minutes lasted three quarter of the movie. Bad script and writing. <br /><br />The Canto Bight scenes burn my eyes. How this sequence got green lighted is beyond me. The movie could have completely done without this part. Benicio del Toro, a talented actor got completely wasted. <br /><br />And speaking about wasted characters, nearly all was put to extremely poor use whilst others were completely wasted. Wasted ones include Supreme Leader Snoke, Captain Phasma, Finn, Rose, Leia and Luke. <br /><br />This whole movie was to deal with Luke Skywalker as he is now and training Rey to be the future. His character was a complete 180 from what he once was. His character was not done justice at all. But his performance was still great to watch despite the bad story and is still probably the best part of the movie.<br /><br />The great Leader of the First Order was a complete joke in this movie. The set-up was great in the last movie which was to pay off in this and in the future film but like so many things that were set up by the last movie the director of this one just flush it all down the toilet. <br /><br />This movie as a standalone would be considered a good one but completely abandoning the set up from the last one made this movie suffer immensely and is probably the worse in the franchise. Bad writing and storytelling from director Rian Johnson has sealed this. What Kathleen Kennedy was thinking when this script was green lighted is beyond me. <br /><br />There wasn't anything to hook the audience into seeing the next episode."
131,5,"Slowly over the last year, my distaste for this film has increased","I'm going to open my review with this note: I did not make up any theories for The Last Jedi. I didn't spend time looking up theories. I didn't have any real plot expectations. I didn't watch any of the trailers because I didn't want the premise spoiled to me. I say this because I know a lot of people who discredit reviewers who disliked the movie because ""the only reason you didn't like the film is because your fan theories were ruined."" While this may apply to some people, it does not apply to me."
132,8,Don't trust the negative reviews,Why the hell does this have a 68% rating on google. One of the best Star Wars movies. A great story with amazing performances of the cast. The screenplay is slow in parts but keeps you hooked to the film. Sad to see another legendary character killed. Definitely don't trust the bad reviews of the film and go watch it.
133,6,Subpar (Non-Fan Perspective),"I'm not a huge fan of the series, but I have seen all of the major films and got the references scattered throughout The Last Jedi."
134,1,Worst Star Wars movie?,Not sure how this could happen to the Star Wars franchise but this was a bad film all around ! For the first time as a huge Star Wars fan can say this one was horrendous... $317 M budget for this crap!
135,,Simply a bad film!, 
136,8,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (Short Movie Review),Positives:<br /><br />
137,7,Returning to the galaxy,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'."
138,10,Last jedi is amazing,Great movie! Love it so much! I'm so happy with the plot!
139,6,Missed the mark,"This film didn't miss the mark because it's different. It missed it because it had no clear vision, and Rian Johnson just clearly didn't know who the Star Wars characters are."
140,8,Best Star Wars since ESB,"Let me start off by saying that I am one of the countless people for whom Star Wars was their childhood. ESB wins by a landslide as my favorite movie ever. After the most recent reboot, this movie was truly going to be make or break for me. If it took a page from TFA and just gave us a slightly more modern telling of ESB I would have lost faith in the franchise. I would have lost faith that they actually care about the fan base and want to make movies for us and not just to line their pockets. However, this movie truly struck a chord. Was it a perfect movie? Of course not. Did it do something incredibly brave and original that not only hasn't been done in Star Wars, but in cinema in general? Absolutely. This movie has everything, the epic space battles, incredibly choreographed fighting, quotable lines, and scenes that make you want to stand and cheer. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan this movie will have something that appeals to you. And if you are a Star Wars fan then I think you're in for quite a treat. Now, to address the people giving this 1/10 for some inane reason. I keep hearing things like ""This was out of character for Luke"" and ""It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie."" To address the first complaint, all I have to say is, it's called character development, look it up. To address the latter, I say be more open-minded. No this isn't a movie that fits perfectly into the confines of what the previous films have created. But that's a good thing. What Star Wars is at its core, is a risky movie that challenges the norms. 30 years ago when ANH came out, nothing like that had been done. It rewrote what it means to be a good film. Some years later, ESB challenged what we thought a sequel could be. And now, TLJ yet again takes Star Wars to a bold and interesting place. Because of that, it is the truest Star Wars we have gotten in almost thirty years and holds up to the originals. If you don't go see this movie, as a fan or non-fan alike, you are greatly missing out."
141,6,Felt like a waste of Mark Hamill and even China didn't like it.,"When I finally watched this on Netflix I was a bit worried since the last movie, ""The Force Awakens"", felt like more of a retread of ""A New Hope"". Though in this movie it felt kind of slow at times and even China thought of that as well. Basically Rey goes to this planet to train with Luke Skywalker but he now wants nothing to do with the force. Even though he brought back balance to the force in the original trilogy."
142,4,Why THE LAST JEDI is being rejected by fans,I've read articles saying the THE LAST JEDI is being rejected by fans because the fan theories all turned out to be incorrect. That's wrong. THE LAST JEDI is being rejected because it didn't deal with any of the questions that THE FORCE AWAKENS spent so much time asking. Who are Rey's parents? It doesn't matter. Who is Snoke? Shrug. We're going to save Luke Skywalker until the last few seconds. Why? So he can spend almost the entirety of the next movie doing absolutely nothing.
143,9,Doesn't deserve the hate.,"Yeah I know, I'm getting controversial with this (again😅), but this is an amazing movie. I used to be a hater. But I had an open mind watching this, pretending as if it is the first time watching The Last Jedi. When you sit down, pay attention and try not to be judgemental, it's a whole different experience. I used to think this movie is a bore. It's so weird how things can change once you actually TRY to watch this film. It's at the point where I don't know why people hate this film. It's Star Wars, it's adventure, emotion and you can learn a lot of life lessons. One reason why I didn't give this a 10:Leia flying. Come on, even if you are a Jedi or strong with the force, nobody can fly through space, let alone survive in space, you would choke, no matter how important of a Jedi you are."
144,7,Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,I used to hate this movie. I used to think that this killed Star Wars.
145,5,Samo Samo,"Poor fate of the magnificent ""Star Wars"" saga. From the moment George Lucas filled his pockets with lots of money, the wonderful saga has become a terrible commercial franchise with exploitation of the worshiped characters to make money. Of course the movie is entertaining, but with nothing new for fans. Shame on you Disney and his new characters. My vote is five."
146,,It's a complete abomination !,"The movie is boring, disrespectful and an incredibly wasted opportunity in so many ways. Which they called ""subverting expectations"" and ""surprising twists""."
147,9,This is Star Wars!,"Everything you are looking for in a Star Wars movie! A must see on a large screen with a great sound system. The directing and cinematography was amazing! What a great end for the new and old characters of the saga. It was such a joy seeing my young son on the edge of his seat with a huge smile on his face as he was watching this movie. Until we back to my childhood to when I fell in love with this franchise. This movie left me wanting more and the sad part is, we have no clue how long it will be until we get another big budget Star Wars movie on the big screen again. If you're not enjoying this, then you're one of those Star Wars fans that no matter what, you will always hate anything new Star Wars, and to that I will tell you that you have outgrown the franchise."
148,6,Review After 3rd Viewing,"Definitely in the camp of people who disliked this movie when it was first released in 2017. This is the first Star Wars movie since Episode 1 that I left the theater feeling disappointed. Every other time I have watched a Star Wars film in theaters (including Solo and Rogue One) I left feeling exciting and generally pleased with what I just saw. As I think back to how I felt when I left after watching TLJ, I just remember feeling empty and questioning whether the film franchise that had essentially served as a major part of my identity for the majority of my life was no longer going to be something that I could look at the same way."
149,10,People need to chill,The movie is actually awesome! Both storyline and cinematography! I wish Rian Johnson had directed the other two as well! We would have had a better finale in the trilogy than what JJ Abrams gave us.
150,7,"Good sci-fi action movie, but it's simplified Star Wars","Overall I enjoyed 'The Last Jedi', great spacebattles, fx, nice jokes and several unexpected plot-twists that made the movie an enjoyable ride,"
151,10,Best Star Wars Movie Since Empire,"This is easily the best Star Wars film to come from Disney since their acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012. Also, easily the best film of 2017."
152,7,So so,Meandering through the motions leaving you with more questions than answers. Never going to compare to the originals but I guess for a new generation of fans it's not bad as movies go. Was hoping for more airtime with the old cast but I guess eventually you got to let go of the past and move on. Hopefully the final and third installation will have a fitting end to the trilogy.
153,4,"Ineffective, unexciting and pretty pointless latest addition to the SW franchise",STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning
154,8,For those who don't have unfair expectations,"Rian Johnson had the hardest job in the universe: how to please fans of the original trilogy, attract new audiences and surprise all those who thought Episode 7 was a rip-off of Episode 4. So how did he do?"
155,7,JJ Abrams Needed To Direct This Movie,"I think Lucasfilm and Disney have kind of lost their way recently, they entrusted the Star Wars franchise to Rian Johnson, his last movie was Looper in 2012, someone else who hasn't directed much in the last five years so I can't undertand why Lucasfilm and Disney would entrust the Star Wars franchise to someone like Rian Johnson."
156,3,Sooooo Boring,"Honestly, as I was watching this all I could say that is was really, really boring. It simply seemed to drag on with little happening. Okay, I've probably earned the wrath of all the Star Wars fans out there, but honestly, I'm really starting to wonder whether this new trilogy is really all that worth it. In the end the film really seemed to be going nowhere, and simply had no purpose in it at all. In fact the entire storyline really could have been squeezed into the first third of a movie by simply cutting out all of the irrelevant stuff, and in my opinion there is quite a lot of it. Okay, there were some surprises, and it did end well, but having to sit through this film just to get to the end really wasn't worth it, and just to think that I have to go and see it again simply because my brother loves Star Wars.<br /><br /> I'm not really all that sure if there is all that much I can say about it, other than it is basically the rebels attempting to escape from the First Order (read Empire). In fact that is basically the movie, which is why I found it so boring. They start off evacuating a base (aka Empire Strikes Back), and are then chased through intersellar space, before arriving at another planet where they attempt to fight off the First Order, fail, and manage to escape. Oh, and we also have Rey on the island with Luke attempting to convince him to come and help them with the fight against the First Order, while Luke is basically not wanting anything to do with anyone anymore.<br /><br /> As a friend suggested, in the end it is the original characters that are the best, and this new lot are simply trying to take the shine away from what were some awesome characters. There is no way that BB8 can ever outshine R2D2, and the only reason I didn't give the film a lower score was because they still had R2 in the movie - and Chewie, who is also pretty awesome. But these new characters, I'm really not all that sure about them.<br /><br /> Oh, and the whole idea of them travelling in lightspeed is absolutely ridiculous. Really, most people would know that in the grand scheme of things light speed is really, really slow, and that was something that really put me off the first movie. Surely the creators of this film were familiar with the originals, and would have known that they used the word 'hyperspace' instead of 'lightspeed'. Look, I'll probably end up going and seeing the next few movies, but I'm not all that impressed with where it is heading. Then again, I didn't actually mind the prequels (and I still consider C3P0 to be much more annoying that Jar-Jar Binks, but then again I'm not a huge fan of Jar-Jar either)."
157,,Turds,Rian The Johnson is a deeply disturbed little man.
158,10,A worthy sequel,"I like Rian Johnson. He did great work on Breaking Bad, the best TV show of the last twenty years, and did great work here. The saber battle at the end is exciting and brilliant and the story flows. People complained about the chase, and that we finally find out that the ships don't run on wishes, but those kind of fans, who feel it necessary to attack the actress who played Rose Tico, well they should go back to hiding under stones. This was a fun exciting movie and there was a fine chemistry between Luke and Rey as teacher-student. The cameo by Yoda was awesome and welcome. My advice to people who take Star Wars far too seriously is this: sit back and enjoy or simply shut up and go away."
159,6,Rian 'WHO' Johnson,"To take on a movie dynasty like Star Wars was always a daunting task... and when Disney got involved, I thought 'I've got a bad feeling about this'.... luckily with JJ on the case, The Force Awakens was very good, and more importantly, very true to the nature of the saga."
160,9,Cannot understand the hate!,"The Last Jedi (now my 3rd favorite Star Wars film) gets some much underserved hate, in my opinion. The filmmaking in this film is some of the best in the saga. I feel that the storyline is strong, the development of the characters (Rey, Finn, Poe), especially Rey, is outstandingly done! The dynamic between Rey, Kylo Ren and Luke is so fascinating and superbly written! And, Luke himself...I thought he was awesome! I had no issue with the way he was developed for this story, at all! I felt that it blends perfectly well with the last time we saw him in Return of the Jedi, but this Luke was older, wiser and knew more of the past. It stands to reason that he would be the way he turns out to be here. I absolutely love this film, and still don't understand how people hate it so much!"
161,7,Will Create Internal Conflict Akin To The Pull Of The Dark Side,"I will say one thing for this movie - it will cause conflict within you which will mimic that of a Jedi tempted by the dark side and a viewing of The Rise of Skywalker and reevaluation of The Force Awakens will only perpetuate this. I left the theater happy with TLJ but over time developed more and more issues with it and its arc with Luke. But after watching the heartless shell which was TROS and then reevaluating TFA with this considered I've finally come to think of TLJ as the only one of the new franchise which actually took any risk or spent any time on Luke. whether you're crazy about the portrayal of Luke in the first half or not this movie did spend time with him and allow him to shine bright in the end. I think as years go by this movie will gain traction and come to be appreciated more when compared to the slightly cheesy TFA and the emotionally void TROS. TFA is a fine movie but but even the scenes with the old characters feel a little forced. Love it or hate it TLJ took risks, pushed the envelope and ACTUALLY spotlighted a Skywalker rather than using his as passing fan service. That said I am no fan of Johnson and the many times his ego has shined through in interviews. You DO NOT EVER interrupt or contradict Mark Hamill - the man is the one and only Luke and no one has yet had the nerve to recast him in some one off Skywalker movie. But on that same note Johnson is the only one who let Luke shine on screen for longer than five minutes! The Mandalorian is the future of Star Wars for me but force to pick a favorite from the new trilogy I might have to stir some controversy into that pot and pick TLJ."
162,9,One of the best,"Like many of the ""Star Wars is dead""-haters , I grew up with the old titles. And while I respect the charme the old ones have, this one has everything Star Wars is about and at the same time, it looks and sounds amazing."
163,7,Not bad not bad,I will admit it had some faults but I really enjoyed seeing Mark Hamil as Luke Skywalker in this one seeing what's become of him over the years
164,3,"""I'll destroy you, and her, and all of it""","It has been a while since I reviewed a film on IMDB. Most of the time, I just enjoy watching them, but this time I just had to say something. I can't guarantee that I'll avoid spoilers, so don't read below the asterisks this if you haven't seen the movie. "
165,8,"What's with the hate? (mostly spoiler free, skip point two if you don't want any)",I loved this movie. I don't get why its so divisive. 
166,7,"Dissapointed and let down, but i can't hate this movie!",This is without a doubt the worst movie in the Star Wars Skywalker universe.
167,4,The Empire Pranks Back,"The Last Jedi is an interesting failure, unlike the slick but pointless The Force Awakens. The more ambitious Episode VIII has intriguing ideas and neat set-pieces, but they are obliterated by major mistakes."
168,,"As we all know, Star Wars is dead now.",The Star Wars films have committed suicide. Why they would do this is anybody's guess.
169,8,the most dangerous Star Wars,"The Republic has fallen and The First Order under Snoke (Andy Serkis) is taking over. The Resistance led by Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is on the run once more. Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks guidance from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is conflicted about his dark side. Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) try a last ditch effort to save the Resistance."
170,7,"A step in the right direction, but not quite there yet","""The Last Jedi"" truly have some awesome scenes to behold, the opening sequence made me feel like a kid again, something ""The Force Awakens"" never managed, because it was just a remade ""A New Hope"" with lack of direction. There is big differences in these two films. And here i will talk about some things i think separates them."
171,9,Did Nay Sayers See The Same Movie As I Did?,"Reading the reviews and I see negative after negative reviews for the purists and nitpickers of the universe that left me scratching my ""cabeza"". I have went and see the movie, paid my $10.50, saw it in 3-D with my movie buddy and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was entertaining. I bet that the 'nay sayers' sat there and kept there critical glasses on and ripped apart the movie at every turn. While on the other hand, I and I am sure others, did not have it one and let the movie do its thing and take us on a ride in the Star Wars Universe. I am sure that if they did that, they would have seen the movie for what it is, a masterpiece of cinematic history."
172,6,A very misunderstood film,"This film is one of the most ambitious high budget movies I've ever seen. When it came out in 2017, I remember how polarizing this film was. Some people loved it and a lot of people hated it for being too different from the star wars regime. I have to give props to Rian Johnson for taking a risk and trying to expand the star wars universe and make it more deep in it's mythology and bring out the humanity in it. I thought this film was genius to make Luke Skywalker not the legend we thought he would be. Mark Hamill also gives the best acting performance of his entire career. I enjoyed the progression in Kylo, Rey, Finn, and Poe as well. Their narratives were unexpected but welcome as it helped them not follow the same tropes as the predecessor heroes from other trilogies. Exploring toxic masculinity, learning from failure, and how someone can be special without be related to a big name. Overall this film gave me the unexpected. Something I've been wanting. Love it or hate this film gives you a lot to talk about since the prequels."
173,9,What is wrong with you people?,"This movie is great. The best of the Disney Star Wars movies. For some reason, an army of trolls has made it their mission, still, three and a half years later, to make sure everyone hates this movie. Seriously, every positive review of this movie has a bunch of thumbs downs, indicating ""not helpful"". You are solving absolutely nothing with this. It's ok if you don't like the movie. Just enjoy new Star Wars content, there is a lot of it coming. Or don't. I feel sorry for people whose life mission seems to be to review bomb movies they don't like"
174,6,Kind of a Mess. It could have been better.,"The film score was all over the place - it was overpowering every scene (Think grand orchestra while the character was just reaching for a water. Hilarious). The filler jokes were lame. Acting of The two main leads were poor. TBH Felicity Jones' acting in Rogue One is so much better than Daisy Ridley ( in this movie). There is nothing likable or special about Kelly Tran's character - if she was an action figure at Target no one would buy her. I gave it a 6 because of the porgs, and the Vulptex; the CGIs, VFX and of course the spaceships."
175,1,Proof that money can't make a good movie - this one is a real turkey,"Everything is terrible about this and someone said Mark Hammil didn't like the script at all and I would certainly believe it. Why it has a normal rating is beyond me. It's corny, the script is bad, little teary-eyed birds to keep the kiddies entertained.. blech, I didn't like anything about this."
176,8,A much Better sequel to THE FORCE AWAKENS.,"Well, the wait is finally over and I must say that this film THE LAST JEDI is a much satisfying sequel to TFA. Director Rian Johnson has taken the Star Wars franchise to a whole new level. Visually Stylish and Very good.<br /><br />It takes me back when I was 7 years old and my Father took my older sister and I to see A New Hope late 1977. It was a childhood experience that I will never forget. If you are a die Hard SW Fan you will understand this."
177,7,It's a different Star Wars film,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was a weird film in the franchise for me. There were parts that I really liked, such as, the development of Kylo Ren as a character and a lot of the visuals and fight scenes."
178,2,Makes me miss Jar Jar,"Finn was terrible, Rey was terrible. They even made Yoda terrible. <br /><br />What's going on here, are Disney trying to kill the Star Wars Universe? <br /><br />The jokes were so atrocious, and actually managed to single-handedly break the fourth wall. This is supposed to a be about characters in a galaxy far, far away, not people who live in 2018 on planet Earth. So bad it makes me miss Jar Jar Binks."
179,,I Think It Was Boring,"They are making too many movies, I think. The story is uninteresting, the acting is somehow weak. It seems a little unsure or perhaps the actors are reacting to a poor script. <br /><br />I have watched all the new Star Wars so far and I don't feel like watching anymore because to be honest with myself they are uninteresting. There are better movies out there or I can just do other stuff."
180,10,"As George Lucas used to say: ""Star Wars is poetry"". And, yes, TLJ is poetry!","Ok, the first time I watched the movie I left the theater truly conflicted, I was angry, sad, mad, and many other things. It was a mix of love and angry, for all that had happened. I really wasn't prepared to Luke's death (even with everyone saying it would happen). But, after some days of reflection, I saw the movie two more times, and now I'm finally prepare to talk about it."
181,7,The Last Empire Return to Strike Back at the Jedi,"Just as The Force Awakens was A New Hope 2, this most recent instalment in the Star Wars anthology is a mix of Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi. <br /><br />The most recent trailer actually made it appear to be more exciting that it would eventually turn out to be. "
182,10,Excellent movie!,Easily the best Star wars movie since Empire. If you like the same old thing over and over again this movie might not be for you.
183,7,Devisive entry in the sci fi space opera,"Right after seeing this I am very conflicted about my feeling toward this movie. There were parts I liked, parts I didn't like, and parts I found downright ridiculous. I suspect the context of this entry may change once the whole trilogy exists, but right now I am not surprised one bit by its polarised reaction from fans, as I feel that way myself...."
184,9,"Have an open Mind, This is not your Fathers Star Wars","I should start by saying if you're an unwavering star wars fan who can enjoy the prequels then you will be able to enjoy this movie. Seeing how most user reviews are 5 or below i feel most will disagree with me, but here goes nothing."
185,7,Im going back to make sure its really as bad as I think,"Theres really nowhere to start but i will try.<br /><br />Far far too many little ""jokes"" in the film, yes a few is fine but this feels like forced comedy every 2 minutes.<br /><br />The death of certain main characters is just passed over in seconds.<br /><br />It fel so Disneyish with so many cgi creatures in there for them to make into toys to sell on.<br /><br />The whole casino side story was a complete waste of time.<br /><br />Im gutted, huge huge star wars fan and you have done this to the series. Rogue one was literally a breath of fresh air (10/10 film) and you have dragged star wars back into the dirt with this drivel"
186,2,Middle School,"This is an example of writing for the middle school masses. Not yet bright enough (well not all) to be critical, and with little history of seeing cheap inaccurate redundancies. <br /><br />1. Centuries from now fighter craft w/combustion flaming propulsion? Please!<br /><br />2. Everyone is still wearing what looks like WWII surplus clothing, and the purple dyed hair in Vice Admiral (what does the Navy have to do with all this) - how late 1900s. <br /><br />3. Sound effects dominate the movie (a crutch I suppose for lazy writing & research) in the vacuum of space (or just anywhere to add effect). Also, overbearing music though out to add effect a form of cheap action subbing. <br /><br />4. Lots of dumbed down simplistic dialogue thus showing no desire to educate an audience or require thought.<br /><br />5. Same old storyline - boringly predictable.<br /><br />6. Too heavy a reliance on the same old visuals of things burning in space which incidentally would also fail middle school science. Also, the accelerations/decelerations - not possible especially for living occupants. More dumbing down. <br /><br />7. All these years no one has ever bothered to explain the physics behind a light saber laser stopping a meter away from it's source.<br /><br />Conclusion: Scify (Sci-fi) can be done intelligently w/a bit of creative research & writing, and less concern for the bottom line."
187,9,Better than The Force Awakens,"All I can say is that all these people that hated the movie were never Star Wars fans in the first place. They don't appreciate the beauty, the art, the hard work, the unpredictable story, and they don't understand the essence of Star Wars. Rian Johnson is the first director since George Lucas that goes back to the child like innocence that these movies radiate, George Lucas created this universe, respect it."
188,6,Too many unanswered questions!,"Review:<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, especially as I heard that Luke Skywalker was making a comeback but I was quite disappointed with the outcome. I found the storyline quite messy, and there was way too many unanswered questions, which I found annoying. I also found it hard to get used to the moody Skywalker, who has completely lost faith in the Jedi realm, and it lacked wit, which I loved from the earlier movies. On the plus side, there are some amazing scenes, like the casino and the epic battles throughout the movie but there wasn't much character building, and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), wasn't in the same league as Darth Vader. I was hoping to see loads of Jedi skills, which seemed to be missing in the film, and the surprising death was also a big let down. Anyway, with the First Order still battling against the Resistance, with Princess Leia in the commanding seat, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is trying to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) that the Resistance can takedown the First Order if he helps them. As Skywalker has turned his back on the force, and believes that no good will come out of igniting his powers, he tries to show Rey some of his skills, and he soon realises that she also has surprising abilities. With the Resistance coming under heavy attack from the First Order, Rey returns to help them to fight against there new leader, Kylo Ren, who she has a special connection with. She believes that he still has good in him but he is possessed by the darkside, even though they both took down the evil Supreme Leader together. There are other storylines happening at the same time but it's really the Kylo & Rey plot that interested me. I have to commend the director for making the movie look fantastic but it didn't have the same spark that the original did. A lot of the scenes seemed way too long, especially the Rey and Luke scenes at the beginning but it's a must watch, if you are a die hard Star Wars fan. I'm looking forward to the next movie in this franchise but I was still was expecting more from this one. I have finally come to the conclusion that we are never going to get the magic from the first 3 movies but it's good to see some of the old faces, even though they didn't make a big impact on this film. Nice try but no cigar!"
189,1,The Ultimate Facepalm Movie,"If TFA was a slap in the face, then The Last Jedi is a knife in your guts. It's a horrendously badly written, focusless, directionless, awfully long, stinking mess from yet again a director who does not have the faintest idea what Star Wars is about.<br /><br />TLJ reveals that there absolutely never was a story for Disney's sequel trilogy, after all. There are no character arcs either (save for, maybe, Kylo's). The only 'grand idea' they had was to kill our old heroes one by one and destroy everything they stood for. To destroy everything we loved about Star Wars.<br /><br />Did they at least replace them with something worthy? Well, since from Finn to Phasma, from Maz to Hux, from Snoke to the new characters (Rose, Admiral Holdo, or the Codebreaker) everybody proves to be nothing but filler (even more so than in the already dreadful TFA), the answer is a definite No.<br /><br />Stick to Rogue One. That's the only post-Lucas SW movie that is worthy of the name. The Last Jedi? A new low, but I'm afraid we still haven't reached the bottom of the barrel."
190,,This is the Star Wars movie that should have flopped,"I literally struggle to believe that this movie is so utterly terrible.<br /><br /> Rian Johnson clearly has no idea of how a trilogy works. The second movie in the trilogy needs to build upon what has gone before, or it renders both pointless. It is easy to subvert expectations but not so easy to subvert them in a satisfying manner.<br /><br /> The cast do their best with what they have but the script is terrible, badly paced and has plot holes that you can fly a star destroyer through. The decades of Star Wars history are ignored in favour of lame jokes and muddled mysticism.<br /><br /> It appears the Rian Johnson Effect has done for Solo but this is the movie to blame"
191,9,"Brilliant, stunning, awesome!","What can I say? I was totally satisfied with the movie. It was exciting to see everything throughout the movie. From the start of first 15 minutes it already was very intense. Apart from some slower pace drama combined with brief action here and there, the rest of the movie was totally awesome. From the middle till the end, it was almost constantly full of action, but not the kind that was making you strapped to your seat, but more like a ""cannot wait to see the next thing that would happen"" kind of actions."
192,7,"Not what I expected, but still something to be enthralled by","Rian Johnson goes for his ultimate Star Wars experience, instead of giving us the story this trilogy needed. In the end, delivers some of the most orgasmic space odyssey sequences i have ever seen in the sci-fi genre. And catapults a story (that may be a bit jumbled) but doesn't disappoint in subversion or surprise."
193,8,Inconsequential storyline dampens what could have been a masterpiece,"This film would have been a masterpiece if it weren't for the completely inconsequential adventure we're forced to take with Finn and a girl named Rose. This detour achieves absolutely nothing in the movie: none of the action or story development is of any consequence whatsoever to the larger plot or themes and to add to the tedium of it is that the settings and special effects in these parts are completely amateurish and juvenile. Honestly, they feel like the prequels. Any producer worth his or her salt should have cut that storyline altogether, thus trimming the film back by thirty minutes and letting it be exactly what it is otherwise: a well-paced story with an awful lot of heart and wisdom graced by powerful performances and breathtaking visuals. The Finn and Rose storyline will keep me from seeing this over and over again. "
194,6,Damages the franchise but entertains the generic masses,"As much as I'd like to gang up on SWTLJ and give it an appropriately damning ""1"" ratings, I can't do that. Sure, as many (the entire universe, et.al., ad nauseum) have tirelessly pointed out, this exercise in Disney dysfunction shows the force isn't with them nor the director: Inexplicable plot holes, an overload of deus-ex-machina rescues, characters acting wildly out of character, PC run amok. "
195,10,"As a Star Wars fan, I highly recommend The Last Jedi","I had been a kid growing up watching the original Star Wars trilogy from the late '70/early '80s in movie theatres during their first release so I know about the excitement that often greets these movies though I also admit I've only watched Episode II when it came to the prequel trilogy. So it's that in mind that I write this review of the second in the latest trilogy and declare this was even better than The Force Awakens. First, Mark Hamill makes a welcome return as Luke Skywalker though not having the same attitudes as his previous portrayal. I actually found this quite refreshing as it gave Hamill new nuances of his characterization. I also liked many of the new characters introduced here. Also, John Williams has not lost his touch in once again scoring another series entry. He's always the best at what he's done and this is no exception! And finally, the late Carrie Fisher does herself proud in playing Princess General Leia one more time. I especially liked her scene with Luke near the end. Great final scene with both together one last time. So, overall, I loved The Last Jedi and have no hesitation saying so!"
196,7,Star Wars fans are the worst,I watched this and its easily the best of the sequel trilogy. The characters feel like they change and grow and the story is good. Is it perfect? No. Is it entertaining? Yes.
197,3,"Worse than I thought it would be, horrible script. That fantastic trailer tricked me!","The film makers did the right thing by releasing a smart trailer that did not give hardly any of the story away, however I was left unsatisfied and there were some plot twists that completely destroy the rest of the potential star wars cinematic universe. Most of the movie is a missed opportunity."
198,10,This Is how Star Wars Lives ON!,"An incredible tribute to the things that made the original trilogy great. It also is everything I would want and more from a Star Wars movie. With just the right balance of darkness, action, and light hearted humor I loved it from start to finish. Go Watch and dont believe the hate"
199,7,Didn't Leave Me Wanting More,"As the dust settled on ""The Force Awakens"" and I had a chance to re-watch it a few times, the weaknesses and flaws that were initially masked by both low expectations and it being so much more like a ""Star Wars"" movie than any of the prequels became painfully obvious. Fun as it is at times, it's just a rehash of ""A New Hope"" with a hopelessly lazy second half."
200,1,This one makes JarJar and the Phantom Menace look excellent.,"Horrible film. But it did do one thing for me. I turned me to never watching of following the film franchise ever again. I might watch some of the series with Boba Fett etc... but as far as the movies go.... Sad! My childhood growing up watching and loving these movies, and now I'm just stunned with how bad The Last Jedi was."
201,,Disney continues to beat the dead horse of star wars.,"The movie was garbage, but it was completely what i expected."
202,10,"Don't look to the horizon, look at the piece of massive, character-driven entertainment (and some pathos) here","Ive seen Last Jedi twice now and the second time went with my older brother (who is old enough to have owned original Return of the Jedi toys). He remarked (and I took for granted) John Williams's score once again being a highlight, and starting off on that point reminds me why Star Wars still has the adventure/operatic impact it does. The Last Jedi is full of sweeping action and tragedy and loss and hope, and Williams reflects that and heightens it, elevates it, into more than it was. We just always think, well, this is Johnny, but his achievement here is no less than any of his other compositions. For all of the attention to the psychology of the characters (as much as can happen in Star Wars, which is a fast-moving adventure serial), without Williams's themes it doesnt grab the punch. One day he will go into the great dissolve in the sky. "
203,7,"Dude, it's Star Wars, you will find something to like...",Rather over whelming piece of Science Fantasy that is hard to follow and understand.
204,10,People were angry,Because it pushed all the characters in a different direction. It challenged Abrams reboot to be something unique instead. It is without a doubt the most original Star Wars movie yet. It is laugh out loud funny at the beginning and inspiring by the end. My favorite star wars movie yet.
205,7,Second viewing review,MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!
206,8,I don't understand the hate,"I don't understand the hate for this movie. People need to get over the fact that the original Star Wars trilogy is a product of it's time, never to be replicated again. I personally enjoyed the previous Ep 7 and now this Ep 8 a lot. There were plenty of plot twists and action, and more than anything I felt like Star Wars is trying to evolve into something else instead of just being the same old thing. The 2.5 hour length only felt too long during the last 10 mins or so to me, otherwise it held my interest and I was fine with it. Bring on Ep 9."
207,6,The greatest teacher failure is,"This is ""Episode VIII"" and the ninth film of the Star Wars trilogy. Not to give too much away, the rebels battle against the Evil Empire as Rey goes to Luke to become a Jedi and give us a fan fiction back story. ""Page turners they were not."""
208,3,"utterly unwatchable, even repulsive","I visibly cringed while watching this pile of vomit. Everything sacred was torn down and buried. Subvert expectations is an excuse for gross negligence, perhaps even malicious intent.<br /><br />Jedi training matters, no one is born to the art and skill. Ancient Jedi teachings matter, wisdom matters, no knowledge should be burned. Murder is not the Jedi way, especially of unarmed individuals presumed guilty before innocent. Credible character arcs are born of flawed journeys. Giant characters built up over time should not be eliminated in ridiculous and implausible manners, without adequate back story and closure.<br /><br />I was emotionally detached from this mess, and retained no affinity or attraction. It is utterly unwatchable, even repulsive. I have never witnessed such a rabid and rapid destruction of a franchise. Subvert expectations indeed, the expectation that Star Wars is reborn or has a future."
209,9,That good old feeling!,"When I went to watch this movie for the first time, my expectations were very high. Because I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, but also the marketing.<br /><br />I also assumed it would not be as magical as the first three movies. That is impossible to match anyway."
210,6,The Last Jedi,"I can definitely see why the Last Jedi divided fans. When I first saw it I wasn't quite sure how I felt. Now I can say overall I enjoy it but I do have a few issues with it. To start the Finn and Rose subplot wasn't very interesting and ultimately led to nothing. Also the way Rose stopped Finn's sacrifice and her reasoning was really stupid. The story between Holdo and Poe was weird I thought. Why she couldn't just tell him she had plan is weird. And Finally Luke's Death. The scene was done very well but to me it just didn't feel justified. Had they waited to the final film then it might have been better. But depending on how he is used in The Rise of Skywalker, I might change my mind on this. As of what's good, I enjoyed everything with Luke and Rey and I didn't mind how Luke was in the Film. I really liked Kylo Ren in this film. Smokes Death didn't bother me and I thought that whole scene was great. As well I like the Luke force projection at the end. So overall it's not without it's issues but I can watch it and enjoy it."
211,5,This film is extremely upsetting for fans of Luke Skywalker,"We all know Luke. He is the heroic Jedi Knight who turned Darth Vader to the light and destroyed the Death Star. In fact, some of us may have looked up to him at some point in our lives. When we feel down, he gives us hope. When we feel like we can't win and are defeated we remember Luke destroying the Death Star when the chances we near impossible. We remember the wise Luke from Return of the Jedi, the Jedi Master. The son of Vader who is supposed to train the next generation of Jedi. I'd love to so say The Last Jedi continues his story amazingly, but unfortunately no. It kills it all. They made Luke a grumpy old man on an island that almost killed his nephew in his sleep in fear of him turning to the dark side. That sounds an awful lot like Palpatine killing Darth Plagueis doesn't it? You have to think, Luke isn't palpatine. Luke isn't pure evil. He is quite the opposite of that. It all comes down to Rian Johnson not understanding the Skywalker Legacy. It was a poor choice to hire Rian for The Last Jedi as it did cause many issues. It was revealed that Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill had repeatedly asked Rian to think about the fans. Selfishly Rian said that it was his movie and story, not the fans'. However, his movie was not the right story at all, and he clearly didn't understand. Back to Luke's many problems, Luke then pouts on an island saying, ""It's time for the Jedi to end."" When literally all the way through the original trilogy he was trying to restore the Jedi Order and turn his father to the light side. It completely goes against everything he stands for. Now people might say,""well how would you feel about causing the deaths of hundreds of people?"" Of course you would feel terrible, but you have to remember it's Luke Skywalker. If Leia, his sister, needed him he would almost immediately help her. She didn't even blame him for Ben's fall to the dark either! I could talk way more about the negatives, but their are some positives. The visual effects are the best out of any Star Wars film, the praetorian guard fight was cool, and the props were very well made. However the negatives clearly outweigh the positives. The humor is terrible as well and that is not how you use humor in Star Wars. Anyways, that's my review. If you like the movie then Great! But don't be toxic about it please. We all have different opinions. Same goes to people who disliked the movie like myself."
212,,Worst Star Wars story ever,"I say worst story ever because this is the worst story as a movie and makes some of the worst Star Wars books look better by comparison. This movie was poorly shot, poorly paced, and poorly written."
213,8,Some of the best of Star Wars...and spinklings of some of the worst,"This is a direct rebuke to the rank nostalgia of The Force Awakens. There's even a moment when R2-D2 shows Luke the original Leia message, and Luke calls it a cheap trick. This is a movie about learning from the past and using it to help forge the future. The three main characters all explore this question in really interesting ways. And then there are the two worst characters in Star Wars and a side adventure that ultimately doesn't matter that much. The parts that work do so at such a marvelous level while the stuff that doesn't falls flat so fully that it's an interesting contrast."
214,7,"""This is not gonna go the way you think.""","It's easy enough to feel conflicted about this film. Upon initial release I was somewhat disappointed with the treatment of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the unexplained mental 'force' between Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). Well, not that it was entirely unexplained, because Snope claimed he was responsible. I feel a little better following a second viewing of the film, as captioning helped overcome some difficulty with the dialog in the theater. But near the end of the picture there's a scene in which Ren is trying to turn Rey to the dark side, and he says ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" It's as if that was Disney's and director Rian Johnson's message to Star Wars fans who have been with the franchise from the beginning. The treatment of Luke Skywalker still bothers me somewhat, as he seemed awfully out of character compared to the young hero of ""A New Hope"". I get it that he had feelings of failure over the Kylo Ren situation, but he should have seen it from Rey's point of view right from the outset. I'm seriously hoping that the final picture in the series restores some of the original legacy, and that the film makers take stock of spirit Yoda's well offered admonition - ""The greatest teacher, failure is."""
215,8,"Enjoyable Film, A bit long but Hamill nailed it.","In the ever intense world of Star Wars junkies and mere film fans the new Star Wars films sans Lucas are a lightning rod of negativity and second guessing. I liked Force Awakens, but Last Jedi easily blew that out of the water. Is it an amazing film? No, and it did not need to be but it is well written, acted (well outside of Rey and a newbie character) and actually has a designed plot. Were there twists? Yes. Were some predictable? Yes. The answer is did they pull them off? For me, they did, for others, evidently not. The main problem with the film is the middle of the film seems to drag a bit, although it does because it sets up the final act. I loved Luke's necessary presence in the film, the unexpected humor and the script as a whole. Hamill who overall always seemed the weakest actor in the past (despite still being effective) truly here nailed it in my opinion, and where the film may have lacked at times, his presence lifted it high above when they needed that heavy lifting. The latter surprised me to be honest but I thought despite some plot points and pacing that were a bit much, thrown in with a new over the top, annoying character the film was easily the best since Return of the Jedi. Of course, the trolls and die hards will vehemently no doubt disagree, but that is their right. A fun film that to me was well written and plotted out with a great performance by Mark Hamill."
216,6,What are the chances if we want to destroy Star Wars legacy,"First of it was a nice movie but kind of revolutionized version of it, so Disney wanted to good ,no doubts, but how come that this script was the actual one mean what the hell lol.<br /><br />After all these years imagining about what Luke did after the war and seeing that last scene of force awakens , I'm actually pissed.<br /><br />Luke could have been at least mysterious or wouldn't say anything at the opening scene ,how come this is a star wars when there is no one who believes in force and no Jedi to train someone that believes it.<br /><br />This was without a doubt huge amount of waste but also Snoke didn't have a chance to do anything I hoped he could be another palpatine but they ruined too.<br /><br /> It was a nice final scene , seeing another skywalker saves the day.<br /><br />I just want to positive for upcoming sequels but sadly I cant."
217,10,Ignore the trolls.,"I'm still reeling and processing what it is that I just watched! Holy cow this movie was intense! It challenges what we thought a Star Wars movie could be. It takes the franchise and shakes it up to new levels of writing and intensity we never thought possible! As a huge Star Wars fan, I've tried my hand at writing fan fiction and I could not have written anything better. The first 5 minutes alone are some of the best in the franchise. I have never laughed so hard during a Star Wars movie than I did in the first 5 minutes. The dialogue is riveting, the plot twists are insane, and the characters, both old and new have definitely developed a lot more. There's a reason Lucasfilm gave the director of this film, Rian Johnson, 3 more Star Wars films to direct after episode 9 comes out. It is certainly well deserved. The film is like a rollercoaster that flips you upside down, backwards, zigzags and jsut when you think you're done, throws you for a loop one last time. Rian Johnson has definitely earned his place among the great Star Wars storytellers, and deservedly so. It's got everything I want in a Star Wars movie, and more. Heart, humor, edge-of-your-seat thrills, emotional moments that made me cry, and just a touch of nostalgia. Johnson has done what we never thought would be possible. He dethroned ""Empire Strikes Back"" as the best Star Wars movie! There was nothing about this movie that I did not like. It was perfect! The Force is definitely strong with this one.<br /><br />Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
218,7,Star Wars: The Last Jedi. This movie is not going to go the way you think & that is a good thing. I like surprises.,"Just in case you live under a rock in Jakku. This movie has been rather divisive for audiences, despite the fact, that the visual/special effects from ILM were impressive, the sets & costume were beautiful, the film score by John Williams was amazing, and the action scenes, while, nothing really new, was entertaining enough to get by. Most of the criticism, come from director/writer, Rian Johnson's sharp retelling on the space fantasy mythos. Some examples, being discuss & highly criticize about, is how the sequel does not sync up, well, with the previous movie, 2015's 'Star Wars: Force Awakens' continuous story elements. Fundamentals key points, like Rey (Daisy Ridley)'s journey for closure with her parentage, the disaster-like effects of the Resistance & First Order, losing key battles, like Starkiller Base & Hosnian Prime, and Kylo (Adam Driver)'s quest to kill, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) with his knights of Ren, were downright ignored, talk little about, or turn into 'red herrings'. Even, significant original trilogy (1977's A New Hope, 1980's Empire Strikes Back & 1983's Return of the Jedi) establishment tropes, like powers of light-speed travel & how force projection works, are drastically changed to serve Johnson's vision, thus, become a little more muddled for the fans, on what, characters & vehicles can and cannot do. So, it was no surprised, these changes to the mythos, rub people, the wrong way. For me, I really didn't mind too much, as excessively familiar with no mystery, can led to mediocre rehash writing. Nevertheless, I was a bit disappointed, by certain story beats that the film glaze over, such as how Snoke (Voiced & Motion Capture Performance by Andy Serkis) rose to power, or why the New Republic was so ill-prepared to stop him. You have to go to outside sources to find any information on this. The movie story is not so flesh out. Because of that, it weakened, the last movie and this. Another, frustrating thing about this film is the morality, it's trying to tell. Using examples of unseen forces, playing both sides into conflict: such with the 'on the nose', side-quest filler, through Canto Bight, the burning of the Jedi texts & the scenes onboard Snoke's ship, 'the Supremacy'; its seems that Johnson was going to take, the ultimate risk, by praising something that was good about the prequels (1999's Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith), by exposing how the universe isn't as cookie cutter good vs evil, as the original trios of films make it seems to be. However, it seem like he got cold-feet, and backpedaled, quite a bit, by this adult-driven nihilism approach. In the end, the film play it, safe, by showing yet another kid-friendly coercive persuasion repetition hopeful message. The climax with another naïve generation following in the same footsteps of its forefathers into believing in one ideal symbol, over another; rather than seeing the whole picture; that seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent, was disappointing & somewhat cheesy. I wanted the film to show, that the old-school dualistic dogma thinking about morality is not that fundamental sound; as it only leads to the same tiresome continuous circle of violence. Because of that backpedaling, it kinda ruin any big counterculture beliefs like 'the Grey Jedi' concept; which I felt, would had work, better for these series of films. In short, it makes more sense that the only way, to find balance in the force is to walk the thin line, between the light & the dark. Maybe, producer and director, JJ Abrams would introduce that concept, in the next film. Regardless of that, this movie had other problems, going against it. A great deal of the film is devoted to a fleet chase scene that just wasn't that good of a premise; seeing how the First Order could have ended it, just by calling another fleet to interception the Resistance fleet during hyperspace travel, but whatever. The film had to go somewhere, even those sequences led only to more awkward & pointless filler doesn't really connect much, with what's happening on Ahch-To. Although, as much as the movie suffer from pacing issues; at least, most of the acting in the movie is good enough, to overlook it. Ridley as Rey was commanding in her role. Unlike some fans, I wasn't really bothered by how the picture portrayed Skywalker, as grumpy bitter old man/ teacher. Hamill was good in that type of a role. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa, on the other hand, felt a bit wasted, & misused. It's sad that this will be her last role. All people will remember from her in this movie is the 'Shooting Star' meme. As for Driver, he brings a certain gravitas to Kylo Ren that makes the character, one of the most interesting villain, in a long time. A fine good job from him. With John Boyega as Finn, I found him, less annoying in this, than the last movie. Boyega is enjoyable. Plus, he does have better comedy chops than Oscar Isaac, as Poe Dameron, ever had. Any jokes fed to Isaac felt force and awkward. As for supporting characters like Kelly Marie Tran, she never really deserve the racist attacks from some Star Wars fans who were dissatisfied with her character. She was alright, as newcomer, Rose Tico. Once again, I was somewhat disappointed with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) & felt that, Benicio Del Toro & Laura Dern were wasted in their roles, as well. As for the cameos, I like all of them. Overall: I somewhat enjoy the film even with its flaws. It was still an entertaining popcorn flick, worth going to. Nevertheless, films like this, are starting to feel more and more like a postmodern experience. While, the spirit of repetition doesn't sit lightly for some viewers, this movie brings enough nuance to the table to stand on its own. So seek it out. It's a force to reckon with."
219,1,So now the Jedi can fly through space and control weather,This is just the latest classics that have been remade to capitalize on the past success.
220,10,Best move forward,"I'm so frustrated with tros I had to write this review. I love TLJ and I know a lot of people do. But we are not the loudest voice and I don't even believe that is the majority. The majority enjoyed this movie without wanting everything old back or having our own agenda based on childhood and childish memories of how things were and should stay the same.<br /><br />JJ set up Luke hiding on that island due to his failure in TFA so what was RJ suppose to do with that? Did Luke go to the island to be happy and perky and positive and continue to act like his 30 yo self? No! RJ took the premise of the previous movie and logically built on it. This is the most fleshed out version of Luke ever. People go through trauma and mid life crisises that change them. That is life. I mean look at Mark Hamill now compared to MH from the 80s. He's not the same! But at the end of the day Luke still came back and saved the day. Luke will inevitably die someday. He ain't young. Do you prefer he die of old age doing nothing? Or go out with a bang using the force? I loved his death scene. It was powerful and moving and purposeful. That complaint about his death is so childish. I mean he's done it all already let him go! It's not his turn anymore.<br /><br />TLJ did nothing that a talented writer could not have taken further. (I do think JJ is talented)<br /><br />For example RJ gave us such a good set up for the next movie's use of Knights of Ren. He even said he purposedly did not use them in the throne room so that they can be used later. Luke says to Rey that Ben took some of the trainees from the academy and disappeared. There were total of 12 other kids Luke trained so it makes sense the KoR are the other kids Ben fled with. So without Snoke how do you not take that opportunity to use the Knights of Ren as former Jedi trainees and build on that? Develop them and make one of them Kylo's new apprentice/ right hand man. This can be one of the things he ""finishes"" since vadar was alway apprentice to Palpatine. But instead he reverts him back to apprentice to Palpatine in 9 is so lazy. New Ren could of somehow gained Snokes darkside powers when he died making him a strong adversary to Kylo and Kylo can still be redeemed since he's still not actually the darkest bad. New Ren can find out Kylo killed snoke and have a sinister back plan to bring Palpatines spirit back and move darkside forward if you still want Palpatine in a logical way. Or anything else! I don't care just make it follow the previous movie. Just saying there were possibilities to move forward with TLJ's set up. So people who complain that TLJ put JJ in the corner have no imagination or logic.<br /><br />And why reverse the message that the force is for everyone? oh no it's just for the priviledged. You gotta be born royal?"
221,7,A revolutionary turning point for the new trilogy of Star Wars,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is finally here and this highly anticipated movie does not fall short on good storytelling, awesome space battles, great characterization. This movie is great in many ways, and fortunately tells a good story without having to repeat itself unlike the Force Awakens did with a New Hope. Yes, there are elements in this movie that are similar to Empire Strikes Back but it is not because of a lack of originality, it is to provide good star wars nostalgia for the older audiences, pay homage to great pop culture characters such as Luke Skywalker and also not try to be a new thing without forgetting what came before it originally. The Last Jedi seems to be its own thing in a good way and explore areas of the Star Wars universe that have not been explored before. As always, great acting from the cast especially to Mark Hamill for an excellent performance as Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher (Rest in Peace) who was able to portray Leia Organa in a great way for one last time."
222,1,Ruined everything,"Everything that this epic saga has been building to, was burned to the ground by this movie. They killed Luke Skywalker. They killed him, man. He just died, on his own, without doing anything. Nothing even happened for the whole film. There was that casino planet... The casino planet. What was the point of any of it? Tell me what the point was coz honestly.... I dont even know where to start. They killed Luke Skywalker. He's dead. Even Han Solo went out like a champ. Luke just died. Luke Skywalker. The main guy. The big dog. Dead. Like he was nothing. Disney can suck a widge."
223,,Watched this movie,"It sucked.<br /><br />It was boring, it was contrived, it was cheaply done and the characters made zero sense. All the coincidences and stupid behavior almost put me to sleep.<br /><br />If there is any learning that can happen in this world it will be the end of sequels forever and ever."
224,8,Shockingly good,"Not every other piece of this extremely ambitious and unique film works, but it's still wildly impressive in many ways."
225,7,A great film but a bad star wars film,So when i first did my review it was when i watched it in cinema and now iv watched it a couple more times on dvd iv realised that this is a terrible star wars film but a beautiful movie on its own.
226,10,Best one since Empire Strikes Back?,"The Star Wars franchise has been a favorite of mine. Although I developed this love only after I saw Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens premier, my love for it has never been lost. I started watching all the cartoons, I watched the updated versions of the original trilogies that kept being remastered by George Lucas and I started reading the Star Wars novels (which to my surprise, were pretty entertaining). Now, it would be stupid not to be pumped for the new one. But, I did have some concerns then. I feared that the franchise that I love will lose its magic. I don't want it to be another generic sci-fi action films. The X-Men universe, Transformers, Star Trek, or even the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Not to give hate, but when you watch these movies, sure it's cool, fun, and entertaining, but after you got home and you turn on your laptop or whatever, the impression you had kind of fades away. The Force Awakens was great for me. It was immensely fun, they introduced us to great new characters, while still doing justice to older ones, and most importantly, it captures the Star Wars magic that we all know and love. So, I hoped that this movie still has that same magic. Thankfully, it did."
227,7,DEFINITELY not as bad as everyone makes it seem.,"This movie has its flaws, as do a whole host of other Star Wars movies, but it is not a bad movie. "
228,8,Pretty much what the fans probably want....,"I think the easiest way to sum up this movie is to call it ""The Empire Strikes Back II"". In many, many ways, it's a bridge movie between the last film and the next and, if you think about it, nothing is really resolved in the film. Now this is NOT saying it's a bad film. Heck, it's exactly what most fans probably want--tons of action, lots of heroism and a lot of the familiar. "
229,7,Could have been great,"I really enjoyed this movie, despite its many flaws. Anything under 5 stars is just neckbeard edgelords trying to be cool. "
230,1,So much wrong with this tragedy of a movie,So many plot hole:<br /><br />
231,8,Star wars,In spite of the very low ratings I thought the last jedi was actually Mark Hamill was super . Highly recommend if you like Star wars franchise
232,7,This movie gave me the Star Wars feeling I hadn't felt since the original trilogy,"Is the Last Jedi perfect? No, it's not. And if you're interested in dissecting it completely with the sole purpose of finding things ""wrong"" with it, while sipping from your glass of vinegar, you'll probably end up with a decent list by the time the credits roll."
233,1,One of the worst,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
234,,The Last Star Wars Movie,I've just seen the adverts out today to purchase this garbage on Blu-ray and DVD. They should be handing these out free with an apology letter never mind charging for them.
235,10,Easily One Of The Best And Most Enjoyable Entries In The Series,"The eagerly anticipated next chapter in the Star Wars saga; ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" has arrived and it is by far one of the best films in the series and a significant upgrade over ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". The film picks up where the last film concluded as Rey (Daisy Ridley), has located the long in hiding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and attempts to recruit him to return to fight the evil First Order and train her in the ways of the Force.<br /><br />At the same time, the First Order has commenced an assault on the retreating forces of the Resistance and this has caused a rift when key members of the command staff are lost/injured leaving Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) in charge. Her style does not mesh well with the impulsive Poe Damron (Oscar Isaac), and in a move of desperation, he oversees a mission for Finn (John Boyega), and Rose (Kelley Marie Tran), to make a desperate move to allow the forces to escape the relentless assault and pursuit of the First Order.<br /><br />For many films, the above scenario would be enough to comprise the bulk of the movie but in the case of The Last Jedi, it is simply part of a much larger and far more intricate storyline that is at times much deeper and darker than one would expect from a Star Wars film.<br /><br />Rey finds Skywalker a broken and bitter man who is consumed with his past failure regarding his Nephew Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and wants no part of his former glory and praise believing the best thing for the Universe would be for the Jedi to end.<br /><br />Ren at the same time is a conflicted mess as he is eager to win the approval of his brutal master Snoke (Andy Serkis), while being drawn to Rey who believes he can be redeemed. It is this conflict as well as the tug of war between Snoke, Ren, and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), that shows a much more dynamic and complicated connection between the characters as well as drives home their complexity of their relationships and the situations they find themselves in.<br /><br />The late Carrie Fisher is captivating as General Leia and her presence lifts the scenes she is in. She portrays Leia with a calm yet feisty and determined edge which shows that she is always in control no matter the situation.<br /><br />The action in the film comes in waves and when it arrives, it is a wonder to behold as the lavish visuals and complex action sequences are dazzling but unlike the Prequels, never once overwhelm the cast as this is first and foremost a character driven story.<br /><br />The film does put more of an emphasis on the new characters vs the old, but as this was always the plan, it is nice to see that older characters are not shoved aside or given a token cameo, they are still central to the plot just let the younger cast do more of the heavy lifting, but still get plenty of moments to shine.<br /><br />Writer/Director Rian Johnson has done a masterful job in crafting a new entry into the series that not only entertains, but gives a deeper and dark look at the universe which makes the film easily one of the best Star Wars films ever made. There are sequences that will delight and surprise fans, and when it was over and I could catch my breath and reflect upon what I had just seen, I found myself saying that I could not have asked for a better sequel as it not only entertained thoroughly, but provided plenty of unexpected moments that makes me all the more anxious to see how the new trilogy concludes in 2019. ""Star Wars"": The Last Jedi"" is the film that fans have been waiting for as it contains all of the best elements of Star Wars and boldly moves the franchise ahead.<br /><br />5 stars out of 5."
236,6,I had a bad feeling about this...,"Yes, there are a lot of small things that annoyed me. The marmot-penguin hybrid things, for example. (But then again: remember the ewoks?) Or Leia suddenly having strong Jedi-powers. (Remember Fin being able to fight with a light saber?) Or the fact that no one said ""I have a bad feeling about this"" (or did I just miss that?)<br /><br />But I do not want to go on about these, as I am sure that you will read a lot more about it in other reviews."
237,8,What's the deal with Reylo?...,"Dame Judi Dench asked this^ question, and the answer is...they've kinda formed a 'link'/'connection' between them through the Force, communicating/having conversations over vast distances, with one trying to lure the other to their side. We're treated to three different versions of how Ben Solo became Kylo Ren, though none excuse what he's done. Like Rey, I'm sure Kylo's fans will try to see the 'conflict'/'good' inside him, but at this point he's virtually unsalvageable as a character (the one *good* thing he does involves Snoke, who's more interesting in the flesh than as a hologram, which I liked...but that's about it)."
238,6,A pretty good Star Wars film,"I don't care what whiny Star Wars fans say, The Last Jedi is a good film. It's not great but it's definitely not as bad as people say it is. It has great action, pretty good visual effects, great acting, genuinely funny scenes and the film had surprising moments. Yes, The Last Jedi does have issues, like the subplot focusing on Finn and Rose and some pretty silly moments like Princess Leia surviving from the destruction of the spaceship by using the force but it doesn't really hurt the film that much. Overall, it's a pretty good Star Wars film and I can't wait for the next one!"
239,8,"Fascinating, dark and deep","While the many turns, surprises and callbacks are appreciated, there is a feeling that too much is packed into this entry. One only wishes Johnson had been given two movies to write instead of one, as this film feels at times like a Shakespearian play - dark and deep, but also long at times with some characters such as Finn getting sidelined."
240,7,Thoughtfully humane and visually epic.,"Rather underwhelming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens. None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage, Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connection, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren, etc. The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same. In fact, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones. Still, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic. And the special effects are especially well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs. While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much)."
241,4,To sum up the movie in one sentence:,"Snoke is a silly joke in a yellow bathrobe compared to Palpatine. And so is this movie compared to Episode V, even to Episode III in my opinion."
242,10,"A Divisive, Deeply Flawed Masterpiece","""This will not go how you think it will."" Truer words have never been spoken- to Ray, or to the audience. Because The Last Jedi does not follow the path you would expect. The story here is not a mirror image of the past films. When you think you know where it's going, it has a way of taking another direction. And all the fan theories inspired by the trailers: they're dead wrong. So, let go of your expectations and enjoy the ride, because it is magnificent."
243,7,A bit better than TFA but only because of Rian Johnson,"Rian Johnson is a very talented writer. One of his most famous works is the most highly rated television episode on Imdb ""Breaking Bad: Ozymandias"". I have a feeling this would have been a lot better if Johnson was given more freedom, but alas, he had to stick to the corporate churned-out story"
244,4,Has the franchise really devolved to such low depths?,"It really is sad to see a Star Wars film and not only not be impressed, but to see it as no more than any other generic Hollywood schlock. A Star Wars film should be cause for excitement and expectation, not simply a quick fix of CGI effects and beloved characters."
245,,At Least The Porgs Were Cute,"The Last Jedi ruined everything that the Star Wars franchise has been working towards in one sentence. Luke Skywalker, the man that helped bring freedom back to the galaxy, help defeat Emperor Palpatine, and free his father Anakin/Darth Vader from the clutches of Palpatine and the Dark Side. Although Luke spent years studying the ways of the Jedi and mastering the force he somehow now thinks that the Jedi are evil and brought about the reign of the Galactic Empire. What? Did Rian Johnson watch any Star Wars movies leading up to directing this, or did she just not care? Everything that George Lucas worked towards character wise is gone. Disney has officially ruined Star Wars."
246,8,"This movie SUCKED, and now I will tell you why.","I'm a huge-ass starwars fanboy, and I will now list everything wrong with this movie."
247,7,My Review is Generous.,Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it a Star Wars movie? Meh. I think I want to like it more than I actually do.
248,9,It's a good movie...but,I would have done a couple things differently as the writer. Luke should have been happier to see Rey and more willing early on to train her just as Obi-Wan wanted to help train Luke in A New Hope. Some extra light saber battles would have been nice too. JJ Abrams should have done this movie as well as the other 2 to keep the flow and continuity between movies. But overall it's a good movie. If you want bad go back and watch the Star Wars Holiday Special from 1978. It would give you a whole new perspective of what is actually bad.
249,7,A Misunderstood Film but Not a Perfect One,"Now TLJ is by no means a bad movie, but it has major problems but I'll start with the pros.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Rian Johnson used techniques of the Force in canon lore for the universe.<br /><br />His writing brought light to a more dark Star Wars film.<br /><br />It creates a path that shows that Ben Solo isn't entirely corrupted and does care about Rey and what happens to her."
250,8,Liked it as a movie but also as a Star Wars,"""The Last Jedi"" is considered the most polarising Star Wars movie ever and is hated quite a bit in the fandom. I've watched this movie at least five times and I've enjoyed it every time. I can comprehend why other people didn't like ""The Last Jedi"" and their points are legit but a lot is due to their own thoughts about Star Wars in the first place. As far as objectivity the movie is very well directed, it looks great and has a great score (John Williams can't miss with this saga). The plot hasn't big issues as long as we forget is Episode VIII of Star Wars. The only problem I have with the movie is that is too long mainly because of the useless Canto Bight subplot that is very bad. The most controversial topic of ""The Last Jedi"" is how Luke Skywalker was handled and I have to admit that I would have liked too to see him as a powerful jedi with insane level of power but I also liked what Rian Johnson did. And this is because I was never a big Luke fan, I've always perceived him as the generic hero that most action films have and as a tool to bring back to the light the real protagonist of the saga: Anakin Skywalker. In giving him this powerful redemption arc with that beautiful scene with Yoda, then projecting himself across the galaxy that requires a special knowledge of the force and becoming the ultimate symbol of hope I grew to love Luke as a character. As I said I can see why for someone his character was ruined but for me it was the opposite. Surely I preferred this version of him that his useless role in Episode IX.<br /><br />In conclusion ""The Last Jedi"" is polarising and is right to have a personal opinion about it. I personally am on the side that liked it but it's not a sure thing, this movie is a perfect example of not knowing what to expect and whether you'll like it or not. Just give it a watch and mature your idea!"
251,7,Luke & Leia are the film's heart & soul,"STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (2017) *** Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro, (Voice of Frank Oz), Billie Lourd, Joonas Suotamo, Jimmy Vee, Justin Theroux, Warwick Davis, (Voice of Joseph Gorden-Levitt). The latest chapter in the phenomenal sci-fi fantasy adventure franchise takes up with the Rebellion alliance once again fighting the evil Empire for peace in the galaxy and having a reunion of sorts with brother and sister Luke & Leia (Hamill and Fisher, in her swan song, both the heart and soul of the film and both amazingly the best things about the film overall too). Director Rian Johnson brings out all the guns with amazing CGI fireworks (many battles and kick-ass light saber stand-offs) yet overall the screenplay he has cooked up fails with the new characters (which I will not mention since they all are rather lame and seriously Del Toro - your check is in the mail for sleepwalking thru this; shameful!) and some unusual shots of humor (taking pages out of Monty Python and Spaceballs) but continues the traditional theme of uniting via The Force to find your true inner spirit (Ridley and Driver excel as the new life force - yes, pun intended) and resolve."
252,1,this film is bad,I hated this movie so much it was such a let down same with force awakens and rise of skywalker and if disney hadnt bought star wars george lucas would have made it good possibly would have given it a diffrent name the force awakens and last jedi and rise of skywalker just sound camp and cringe and overall just really weird it also seems really random.
253,10,EPIC! MASTERPIECE! MAJESTIC! people who dont give it a 10 should be banned from this site,"EPIC! MASTERPIECE! MAJESTIC! MASTERFUL! OUTSANDING! PERFECTION! totally the opposite to the EPISODE V, which is DEFINITELY the worst of the saga, this is STAR WARS and it has all the elements of it, AND MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE, people who didnt give this film a 10 should be banned forever of this site for not having the at least the minimum understanding of Star Wars story and universe.There is not gonna be any star wars film that will ever superpass this, people didnt get it because its very complex and has a lot of layers one above another, like Twin Peaks, Inception, or THE OA, but way more complex.<br /><br />This movie is only gonna be understood as a masterpiece just for the smartest fans, because it's actually outstanding, and it doesnt have the flaws of the worst film of the saga(episode V), it's a wonderful travel to the star wars heart in its finest way!"
254,7,Quite Mediocre,"I went into this Star Wars film thinking it was going to be a dark and serious movie since that is what the trailer made it out to be, shoker! It is NOT."
255,1,A Lobotomy for the franchise fans.,"Yesterday, I watched 3 movies in sequence. The first one was ""Captain Marvel"". The second, ""The Last Jedi"". Need I say it was a painful night?"
256,,"A Complete Mess: Bad pacing, script, direction, and jokes.","I can only imagine that Disney assembled a team of bean counters who had to okay the dailies for this movie. Otherwise, I don't know how you realistically end up with such an uninspired disaster."
257,8,Not the ideal middle chapter for the Sequels,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi wasn't the ideal middle installment. Instead of continuing what we got with The Force Awakens, Rian Johnson chose to steer the series into a different direction, and it hurts the trilogy as a result. I did think the acting was really good, the VFX were beautiful, and that the music was spectacular. I'll admit that this movie has the best cinematography in the entire series. However, TLJ massacred characters like Luke and Finn, and that didn't do so well with the movie. It's great as a movie, but it doesn't work so well as a Star Wars movie."
258,6,"Not a good star wars movie, but there are worse movies","Yes, the movie is heavily flawed, which is almost entirely the fault of the storyline. I'll summarize what has been mentioned already many times:"
259,8,Let Go Of Your Hate,"I made a reputation for myself for defending the Star Wars prequels, calling Revenge of the Sith the best film in the franchise and Attack of the Clones the 3rd best. That self-made reputation was largely negative. I'd often make the prediction that after the Lucas-free sequel trilogy, fans would beg for the return of George Lucas to take the reins back on this franchise. And with The Last Jedi getting undeniably the worst audience reception of any Star Wars film to date (The film has the worst audience rating of any Star Wars film on Rotten Tomatoes with 47%, with multiple fan videos proving the actual score may be even lower) and with Kathleen Kennedy and LucasFilm in panic mode, I can't help but smile and stifle a laugh at every hater who called me an ""idiot"" and a ""fanboy"" for defending the prequels. And all those people who doubted my predictions are probably biting their nails waiting for an absolutely righteous evisceration of The Last Jedi from yours truly. And believe me, I can't BEGIN to tell you how much I've been thinking about this day...And I can't in good conscience say it's a bad movie."
260,7,I was not a big fan of Star Wars Series. But now I am!!,"My husband is a fan of Star Wars and he finished all previous 7 movies. I started to watch Star Wars with The Force Awaken in 2015. To be honest, that one did not catch too much of my interests. Still, for my curiosity on those characters' relationship, I went back and watched Star Wars Original Trilogy. Although their scenes were not as vivid as recent years' works, they had a good story. However, I just felt enough with these 3 classics and did not continue on Prequel trilogy."
261,10,The hate from a vocal section of viewers is hugely over the top and can be answered with simple logic. This is a GREAT film!,"I am a Star Wars fan who grew up in the late 70s and 80s watching the original trilogy. I am also a fan of cinematic brilliance overall. My favourite two Star Wars films are The Empire Strikes Back and the original Star Wars (Episode IV) which I rate among my top 10 films of all time along with my 3 favourite Alfred Hitchcock directed classics Vertigo, Rear Window & North By Northwest, It's a Wonderful Life, 12 Angry Men, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Godfather Part II and Lawrence of Arabia. These are all highly acclaimed true greats of cinema. They are works of art and created with genius skill so their quality far outshines whatever tiny flaws there might be. The Last Jedi similarly is not perfect but its qualities, in my opinion far outshine any imperfections. The internet has created an online forum of hate where everything that is popular gets attacked, usually in a really exaggerated way. This film has attracted a lot of vocal online hatred but as usual this hatred is over the top and ignores logic. By applying logic I will answer some main criticisms I remember hearing:"
262,6,"I Had Much Higher Expectations,","Star Wars: Episode VIII- The Last Jedi is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It certainly has a ton of action and gorgeous spectacle that we have come to expect from this franchise, there are many great fight sequences, in particular one towards the end that was breathtaking. The cast are all in great form, especially Mark Hamill, it is an absolute honour to see him return to the role of Luke Skywalker after all these years, and he delivers what I would consider to be the best performance of his career.

263,1,Worst star wars movie ever!,The movie makes no sense.
264,9,Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans...,"Let me start by saying that I am an HUGE Star Wars fan.I have seen the movies,read the books,the comics,played the video games,listen to the audio books,purchased merchandise.I have done it all,for too many years really.After the prequels hit,everyone was angry that they ""werent true to the original trilogy"" and they wanted ""something faithful to the franchise"".So the Force Awakens comes out,a movie that can be said to be a Tribute to the original trilogy,Disney's message to the fans that ""We are back to our roots"".Guess what happens.Everyone is angry again.This movie,fithful to the originals,got shunned for the same exact thing the fans were asking for.<br /><br />Now on to the Last Jedi.They listened to us again.We didnt want a copy paste of the old movies,we wanted something new.And they delivered EXACTLY that.<br /><br />Nearly EVERYTHING this movie showed us was unexpected.As a huge fan,knowing all the lore,even I couldnt predict this.<br /><br />And I loved it so much.<br /><br />If The Force Awakens' message to us was ""We are going back to our roots"",The Last Jedi's one was ""And now we re moving forward"".This is a NEW Trilogy.It isnt about Leia,or Luke,or Han Solo,these are things of the past.And the movie showed exactly that.Luke is a bitter old man because of what he went through.Because of what he went through,Kylo Ren is who he is and is in constant war with his inner self,while Rey is just lost in all these things about ""Fate"",""Destiny"",""Heroes"" and just wants to find her place.Luke,Leia,Snoke,even Han from the previous movie,they were a stepping stone for our new protagonists,just how they should be.Even the side characters,like Finn and Po,we see them that not everything can be romantically heroic and successful just because their cause is noble,and that the galaxy is more gray than the black and white they though it to be."
265,7,"Terrible Director, terrible technique","I won't talk about the movie as a Star Wars history, since me as a big fan of the universe I will always have a good impression of it, instead I prefer to analyse it by his technical characteristics ...."
266,1,"Boring, stupid and changing the rules","This is the second film ive walked out on in my life, i was actually bored and nodded off at one point."
267,,what a turd,"This film is a turd. Before it even went to camera, it needed 1000 rewrites. The editing was so bad in this film as well- made many great actors look pretty bad. There was almost no plot or waaaay too many plots going on. And, everyone had to be funny. This was just a hot hot mess. I will never watch this film again. I also love the Austin Powers steamroller scene... ya'll know what I mean. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, READ A BOOK INSTEAD. <br /><br />I feel like they were also placating dialogue and action for little kids, but like little kids were freakin morons. I saw Star Wars: A New Hope when I was about 8 and it was amazing; I watch it now, and it's amazing. Dumbing this down for what they think kids will like, makes them dumber and society worse."
268,8,Master Jedi,This review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is spoiler free
269,6,I have mixed feelings,"There were a lot of great things in this film and a lot of... not so great things. This film tries to subvert expectations and bring some freshness to the franchise. In doing so, it creates a lot of deus ex machina and a lot of pointless scenes that don't amount to anything. It negated a lot of things that were built up like some mysteries or plot progression. At the same time, there were some good scenes like the red room battle. It just doesn't seem like an official Star Wars film for some reason. More like a ""troll fic"" (""Fanfiction made deliberately offensive"")."
270,10,"Disney didn't release this film, it escaped. It's *easily* the best Star Wars film","The people who hate this film can go ahead and down vote this review-especially if your reaction can be summed up as ""this film ruined Luke!"" I am not trying to be verdictive; I *fundamentally* disagree with the small but vocal part of the fanbase that seemingly reject the film *because* it wasn't a carbon copy of the prior films. Moreover, in light of Rise being godawful and no way Disney will ever let such a daring film be released again I think the haters have really damaged pop culture. This might say something bad about me but the very qualities that a lot of people hate on in this film is *precisely* why I think it is the best film in the series. If anything I think the film struggles with not alienating fans enough."
271,7,"THE LAST JEDI expectedly bottoms out in the abysmal nadir in its story-line, only awaits a spark of new hope to ignite its retaliation next round","The prospect is bleak, this entire Episode VIII of STAR WARS saga is a concatenation of the Resistance forces' half-baked escaping plans from the claws of the indomitable fleet of the totalitarian First Order closely on their tail, so one has to hand it to Princess Leia Organa (Fisher, in her swan song) for still being able to bullishly encourage a handful of survivors in the coda that, paraphrasing here, they still have everything they need to start the rebellion from the scratch, attagirl!"
272,9,An Honest Review from an Old Fan,"I've been in love with Star Wars since I was 3, and sometimes you love things even though they're stupid. People wanted The Last Jedi to be that same stupid plot they've been in love with since 1977, and it wasn't. People expected Luke Skywalker to hop in his X-Wing, go blow up an even bigger Death Star, and get a medal while everybody claps at the end, and that did not happen. Instead we got a very strong, independent movie that wasn't trying to emulate the success of it's predecessors. While some of the hardcore fans pan this movie for not being the same thing they've been watching since 1977, I think in the years to come it will be remembered as a high point of the series, because this is the movie that broke tradition and let Star Wars be something new."
273,6,A mixture of good and bad writing and a lot of wasted opportunities,"Never before have I felt such conflicted feelings towards a movie. On one hand, there are moments of genuinely brilliant filmmaking and on the other, there are some bafflingly stupid moments that makes you wonder how this was made by the same director."
274,1,How to Wreck a Franchise In One Easy Step,I'll preface this by noting I've been lukewarm at best on the other Rian Johnson films I've seen. His style of humor smacks of impish self-congratulation; his plots invariably have gaping holes and are far less clever than the audience is supposed to believe. But if you're a fan of his screenwriting style then you'll probably find The Last Jedi marginally more tolerable than I did.
275,9,The New Jedi!,"I have been a longtime Star Wars fan and I did not care for the prequels at all. I think this was a very satisfying entry in the Star Wars Saga. I have a few issues with the story and some of the plot choices, but overall, Luke's portrayal in this film is one of the best character arcs to take place in the whole Saga. "
276,7,Can we pretend this film never happened and try again?,"It's basically like someone took Star Wars, really watered it down, then added some Marry Poppins, Las Vegas, Avenger 'humor', oh and then then turned the force into magic."
277,1,Is Kathy Kennedy a Star Wars fan?,"That is the big question. I am given the impression that she is not. She seems to be reinventing it. There was much speculation as to why Colin Trevero left, but it is becoming clear that Kath Kennedy has a lot of creative input for the writer assigned, that he is obligated to use. I had a lot of faith in her given her track record of turning out big blockbusters...but she doesn't seem to understand the Star Wars appeal. Why she hired Rian Jonson for this movie I also find confusing. I watched Looper 3 times and I still don't get it. I just ordered Brick. So if I were to make 2 films on par with those then I qualify for directing one of the most anticipated blockbusters of all time? It is very encouraging. I need to get started. "
278,,A Star Wars franchise killer,"I'm a massive star wars fan and seen every film in the cinema but after seeing TLJ couldn't even be bothered to go and see Solo as it was so dissapointing. I didn't mind the The Force Awakens although it didn't make any sense that Rey could pretty much do anything (expertly fly the falcon, defeat Kylo, use Jedi mind tricks without any training) it did have a coherent story even if it was ripped off from the original triology. TLJ on the other hand is a complete mess from start to finish, the exciting storyline is ships running out of petrol, it's extremely slow, no character development, Luke Skywlker (who left a map to find him in the first film now don't want to be found) who's probably the most optimistic Jedi of all the films gets turned into Victor Meldrew, princess Leia (who can survive in outer space) gets turned into Mary poppins, no lightsabre fights, the at at scene a complete rip off of Empire, the humour is cringeworthy, the casino scene is as pointless as it is awful (Disney lecturing us on the evils of capitalism), just when you think something might resonate finn sacrificing himself, Rose has to go and spoil it (a love interest with absolutely zero chemistry and what an awkward kiss) it's as if Rian Johnson had no idea what went on in the first film the main baddie gets killed without knowing anything about him (he can read Kylos mind but not when he cuts him in half) and the jump to light space at the end what the f*%k they could've just done that to death star 1, death star 2 and death star 3, this film pretty much goes against every thing that's happened in the previous films. The cinematography and effects are amazing but the rest is truly awful."
279,9,"Well, certainly wasn't what I was expecting. And it payed off!","The Last Jedi is probably going to become canonised as a cinematic classic in the next couple of years; who knows? I think that although it is just under The Original Trilogy, this and The Force Awakens are pretty worthy follow-ups to George Lucas' monumental legacy."
280,6,A thoughtful and gorgeous addition to the Star Wars epic,"Finally, after two long years, the third trilogy continues in ""The Last Jedi"" by Rian Johnson. From a writer/director of this calibre I could only expect the most mature Star Wars ever, and I was not disappointed on this end: in this film we finally see some doubt in the sharp distinction between good and evil, a more interesting dinamic between the baddies and the good guys. Rey doubts master Luke, Luke himself hides some shadows in his past that he would like to bury forever, Finn and the newly introduced Rose team up with a guy whose lesson is ""Good and Evil are the same: it's just business"". One could see this as a common carefree character, but in reality he channels an interesting point made throughout the film: good and evil may not be as different as they seem. Maybe. Because eventually the good guys (kind of) win, and Kylo stays true to his baddie persona, if with some very interesting twists coming along. To this regard, Rian Johnson seems to be playing with fan fictions here, proving all of them wrong even if the solution he finds is not quite as satisfying sometimes. Is it really a good idea to make Rey's parents some nobodies? What about all the threads scattered around in Episode VII that we got crazy to understand? Can it really be the best choice to let it all die this way? Sure, Kylo said that, Rey believes that, but nothing forbids for Ep. IX to change everything on this end. Luke's death is pretty good, although maybe not that necessary. Same goes for Snoke's fate: he was never anything more than a nobody himself? An all-powerful being without any connection to the past of the Sith order? Seems very cheap if you ask me."
281,8,Screw you guys,We're so used to thinking we know what a Star Wars movie should be like. How the character should act. That good characters would never do evil things like evil character would do good things.
282,7,But Luke is not that kind of person.,"I didn't find it that bad, but Luke is not that kind of person."
283,9,Amazing achievement in cinema,"Definitely a 10/10 without question. Watched this film again to see if I was crazy compared to the audience, and I wasn't. This film is so intense. The screenplay is amazing the plot is groundbreaking and the script is solid Hollywood gold. Rain Johnson does what other directors fail to do. He transcended the genre while giving it nostalgia but making it his own. The Last Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars films ever. Arguably one of the best from the originals as well. The intensity shot in every film really makes me feel so hard for even the side characters. I feel the stakes rising through every scene. I don't understand the audience and I read some reviews and I guess fans just want to watch what they expect. I think this movie isn't a spit in the face, not the slightest. It is a movie that takes your expeditions and flips them into something even better. I can't believe how beautifully crafted this film is. Truly remarkable and definitely misunderstood from moviegoers. I was a huge fan of the force awakens I just thought it relied a bit too much on nostalgia factor. This film transcends it beyond measure while keeping the franchise fresher than ever."
284,6,A forgettable entry,"I had a new hope that Disney would do a good job revitalizing the series, but it's just been a downward spiral since Force Awakens. I remember walking out of the movie theatre thinking that this movie wasn't too bad, but now that I've revisited the film, I've realized that the only reason I ever liked this film in the first place was because of the 3D."
285,5,STAR WARS S3E2,"So our resistant heroes continue their fight against the Second Empire. Not much really happens unless you consider killing off various characters significant. (Admiral Ackbar!!) No real answers or explanations to any of Abrams ""mystery box"" storytelling. Who's Snoke? Dunno. Who's Rey? Nobody. Long winded and filled with awkward humour (Luke milking a thing) and pointless adventures. (Finn's trip to a space casino which ends up accomplishing exactly nothing) Filled with confusing story telling where characters turn bad (or good) and back again for no reason and people show up out of the blue with no explanation as to how they got there. (How did Rey meet up with Chewie again?) Like Han in the last film Luke is really only in it to pass the torch and is just treated in an embarrassing manner. Strangely Leia survives and I'm expecting her to be written out in the opening crawl for the next one. These new movies are written in a TV variety style where characters and things show up for a round of applause and then go away.( ""And now...heeeeeres YODA!) These new movies are more in the style of the Star Wars Holiday Special than the original movies. Frankly it's just weird. <br /><br />(P.S. the Harry Potter-esque final scene was the most Un-Star Wars scene ever)"
286,9,I felt very satisfied and very entertained after watching,"Excellent, one of my favourites from the franchise so far."
287,7,Trying too much.,This movie is all about subverting our expectations. And it's sucks.
288,1,Star Wars: The Last Hope,"Disney, You should be proud of Yourself - this blatant, mindless and disgusting flick of Yours led me to write my first IMDB review and receive 1/10 rating."
289,,B A D,"Boring, bad, no respect to old fans.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot that Episodes 7,8 etc. introduced one new character that all people liked: BB8.<br /><br />He is so cute, round and chatty.<br /><br />He is good at posters or as a toy, so that's the only value of new trilogy..."
290,8,To this day i will never understand the hate for this film.,"The Last Jedi Jedi did exactly what the second film in a trilogy should do. It took risks, subverted expectations, expanded on the lore/mythos, took characters to their natural most logical step in their journey, took the story in a new direction and tried to move on from the past that this franchise seems to be shackled to. In the Force Awakens it is established the Luke went into hiding because of what happened with the new school of Jedi and Ben turning to the dark side. It makes complete logical sense that this is where Luke's character would be. Why wouldn't Luke be questioning the principles of the Jedi. Why wouldn't he be bitter and shut himself off from the Force. His perceived failure with Ben (his sisters son/best friends son/ nephew) drove him to this point. It's the story of the fallen hero. Luke like any great hero has flaws and makes mistakes but that is what makes him so relatable and in the end Luke becomes the Legend everyone thought he was by saving what was left of the rebels and he did it without even physically being there. That is how powerful Luke was with the Force. Expanding on the Force is a progression within Star Wars lore that needed to happen. The Force is a living breathing thing and just because we haven't seen these aspects of the Force until now doesn't mean they weren't always there and our characters are tapping deeper into unseen/ unexplored aspects of the Force. That doesn't make the Leia floating in space scene perfect, but I do find it interesting. Yoda Returning was amazing, it literally felt like I was watching the Yoda from the original trilogy. The fact that Rey is a nobody in The Last Jedi is such a breath of fresh air. Star Wars needed to get away from the idea that you have to be a blood descendant of a Skywalker, Palpatine, Kenobi or any other hot shot Force user (which is clearly undone in The Rise of Skywalker). I love that Kylo destroys his mask and forges his own path instead of being stuck in Vader's shadow. Kylo Killing Snoke and and fighting with Rey took the story to places we haven't seen yet. It was unexpected that who we thought was the main villain is killed in the second film and the apprentice is now the main villain and that our hero would be fighting along side him. The idea that he wants Rey to join him so they can destroy the Jedi/Sith and create something new together is both disturbing and fascinating and I would have loved to see what they would have done going into this new direction. Star Wars needed to delve into more of the grey territory instead of just good vs evil Jedi Vs Sith over and over and over. It needed to move on from the Skywalker story and try something new. The Cantobite sequence wasn't perfect and it did drag at times but I liked that it showed the political side of selling weapons to both the resistance and the First Order. Finn and Rose attempting and failing to help the resistance is a very humanizing plight. Poe having to learn trust and maturity was also a necessary character growth. This film is not perfect, the only perfect Star Wars film is Empire Strikes Back and nothing will ever touch that. But at least The Last Jedi tried to take Star Wars into a new direction and I will always respect this film for what it tried to do."
291,7,From a certain point of view....,"Review: it really was a well done and well crafted movie. Whether you like or dislike it depends on if you can accept the fates of the Characters in the story. Though Divisive amongst the movie fan base, this movie is a shocking and shattering experience that will leave your heart racing and your eyes wide open. The Last Jedi is not like ""Empire Strikes Back"" Shocking, but you will be surprised at some stuff. Obi-Wan tells us to Look at Things ""From a certain point of view."""
292,9,"Unique, Epic, Fantastic!","Following the Force Awakens which was both a critical and fan hit, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi had the highest bar to climb, and it manages to go a lot higher than the its predecessor. Rian Johnson's touch has elevated The Star Wars franchise by daring to take risks, and taking our beloved characters to a new level. <br /><br />This is a unique Star Wars film in its story telling aspects, in its humor, and in its style. This will drop as many jaws as I assume The Empire Strikes Back originally did. This is also the most beautiful Star Wars movie to date, with breathtaking Cinematography, Fight Choreography and Visual Effects. But Most importantly, all of these technical aspects are only there to elevate the gripping story and character arcs that Johnson has created. <br /><br />The Last Jedi is absurdly entertaining, gripping, and is also a mind bender. It will trick you, confuse you and ask you questions, only to pay them off and answer them in the most surprising and satisfying way possible. None of the main characters are one sided, as Rian Johnson manages to make you feel empathy for all of its characters, specially the main Villain, Kylo Ren. He remains a strong antagonist who is conflicted, but driven and you could say the same about our hero, Ray. Luke Skywalker is handled masterfully, and that's all I can say about him without going to spoilers. So much happens with him that is surprising, but fitting to his character. Mark Hammill shines bright, but the brightest star is the Late Carrie Fisher, as General Leia. It is difficult not to feel emotional every time you see her on the screen. She plays her iconic character as well as ever, and could not be in a better movie as her last. <br /><br />The Last Jedi has grand emotional gut punches, followed by great action sequences, including my all-time favorite _and for a lack of a better fitting word the most Badass_ scene in the franchise. However just like any film it has its flaws and I can summarize my main problem with the movie in one word: Porgs. These cute birds are only there to be adored and are only there so Disney can sell Toys, which we know brings a surprisingly large amount of revenue to the studio. In Contrast to the Porgs, I loved the cute droid BB_8 because he as so much purpose and he is vital in the story. The story also loses some of its emotional build up in one particular heavy scene towards the end, to throw in a joke which felt forced and unnecessary. Happily these two minor complaints get lost in this fantastic story. This is truly a great film, and you don't have to be a Star Wars fan to love it. Rian Johnson's different vision for this movie, has made me a lot more optimistic about the future of Star Wars, and his original trilogy."
293,6,Gutsy storytelling that doesn't quite work in the context of a franchise,"Possibly the gutsiest Star Wars film. Rian Johnson went for the gusto as he basically did the opposite of JJ Abrams in not playing it safe but instead making decisions that although craft a great narrative also carried potential to upset a lot of the fanbase, and it did just that. The movie has a much more grounded tone while also giving a lot of surprises throughout. The movie functions almost like a roller coaster in the dark as every action taken in the film in jarring and often unexpected. The bold decisions by Johnson although repelling to most fans really worked for the most part (with the exception of some of the casino stuff and Rose Tico). Unfortunately, the movie was just way to sloppy to stick the complete landing. Many action sequences are a great spectacle, but Johnson did not know how to put it all together smoothly especially with a lot of small plot holes. It feels clunky at times, and many small details are just left hanging leaving the audience not fully satisfied especially when it comes to advancing the overall trilogy storyline (since it does not do that AT ALL). Ultimately, the Last Jedi is creative, exciting story-telling that looks beautiful but leaves to many loose ends to put together a masterpiece. So instead we end up with is overall a solid Rian Johnson film but also a very poor Star Wars film that really holds back the sequels from progressing as a franchise."
294,10,Better than The Force Awakens!,"To be honest, I only watch the trailer once because I'm afraid to put so much expectation and it fails me like TFA. But hey, it's beyond EPIC!"
295,7,Pretty good!,"I enjoyed it more the second time around, when I picked up little things that I must have blinked over the first time - like the broom - and some really great set pieces, like the At At Walkers suspended in the factory set ablaze, and seeing the people standing in Kylo Ren's hovering ship from a far away shot. Some of these incredible scenes last for only a second and it's easy to miss how much went into making this look so great. I would have gone a different direction for some things - it wasn't made clear that alot of the main protagonists were, at one point, on the same ship, just in different locations on that ship - so that was a bit confusing when it all came together. I wouldn't have given Laura Dern purple hair as though she just walked in from the set of the Hunger Games. Casting Finn and Rose together seemed like an attempt to force a multicultural agenda - their storyline was the weakest in the film, especially after Benicio del Toro gets involved - this whole chapter should have been rewritten. On the positive side, Adam Driver - an actor I don't particularly fancy - was incredible as Kylo Ren. Every line he delivered was perfect, and just from his eyes you could see the conflict within. Brilliant"
296,3,Disappointing..,Several problems in the film.
297,9,The Last Jedi - It is good. You know it to be true,"I really don't understand why there are people that have such a huge problem with this movie. I remember seeing it opening night and it was one of the best movie theater experiences that I had. The employees and some fans were wearing Star Wars uniforms and everyone in the theater cheered when the movie started. I was blown away by the film and just wanted more after it.<br /><br />I loved that the film took a different direction with characters and events that really left me in awe with the surprises that were in store. The best parts were with Rey, Kylo, and Luke. If the movie had more time spent in these 3 more, I would probably give this movie a 10. Of course, the other characters besides them weren't as good but they were ok. Rey and Kylos dynamic was so good and I loved that they introduced force bonds like in Knights of the Old Republic.<br /><br />Please if you hate this movie for dumb or childish reasons, you can suck it! This is probably my favorite of the Sequel Trilogy and I hate that stuff that was built up in this movie got squandered in The Rise of Skywalker like Rey being a nobody. Rian Johnson is a great director and you can't make me say otherwise. This movie really helped the franchise and has better directing and performances than all prequel movies combined."
298,7,The end of an era?! A new begining or passing of the torch?,"I see all of the ""Star Wars"" movies even though I think that the franchise is getting overblown and to expanded as the originals from the 70's and 80's had more tradition and the characters seemed more original. As now the saga seems ever changing and with more leaving and only a few of the old heads remain!(Note my favorite is the wookie a bigfoot spin off as the mighty ""Chewbacca"" is still in the ""Star Wars"" universe!)."
299,4,Perhaps time to stop now Disney...,"I was fed the hype, including a number of critic reviews in the mainstream media, and am left wondering if they saw the same film that I've just watched."
300,,Not going to watch episode 9,"It will suck. I knew I should not have watched this and yet did. It showed me that I am stupid and weak. Well, no more.<br /><br />I am not upset that they somehow somewhere found fat East Asian girls (nothing against that at all) or that they changed Luke's character (he is a work of fiction after all), etc etc. I just think it was stupid, boring and not Star Wars."
301,8,Critics versus Fanboys,"I really enjoyed this movie. I say disregard the haters and their expectations of what should have happened; and Star Wars movies were never known for their acting. <br /><br /> Bottom line, this movie is fun! From start to finish I was entertained, it's family friendly and left me wanting to see the next one. I enjoyed the cameos. I didn't even have to adjust in my seat I was so entertained! I did not get all my questions answered and have more. I will be back for episode 9!"
302,7,An Average Movie,"Rey is still not a compelling character in this movie.<br /><br />She is a boring character who frankly they keep trying to tempt her to the dark side when she literally has no good reason to go to the dark side. Every man she meets she looks at a father figure and I'm just like....bruh you said less than 100 words to them you got problems.<br /><br />Poe actually had a good arc in this film, you don't always have to go in guns blazing sometimes there are other options. However it is very idiotic for that purple hair lady not to tell the crew the plan....so as far as I'm concerned the Poe turning on them made sense.<br /><br />So tell me why Luke tries to kill his nephew because he sends a whole lot of dark in him, but won't kill his father who is a mass murderer. Is it because he sensed good in his father, but none is Kylo. Yet Rey Does Sense Good in kylo. Anyway that force connection Kylo and Rey Had was actually good addition to the story. Luke final battle with Kylo was good, but the way his character ended up very much dissatisfied me.<br /><br />Kylo is a good character in my eyes. You very much see him struggling with the light side all the way until the end. A very telling scene was when he had the chance to kill Leia, with his spaceship, but chickened out. His interactions with Rey were great and anytime he is in film the movie is cool. He wants the past to die and a new world to begin.<br /><br />Finn. Alright didn't like Finn all that much in the first movie, and the second movie I still don't. I don't know why he is so concerned about Rey in this movie. First thing he does when he wakes up is say ""Where's Rey"".<br /><br />Rose is also a lame sidekick character who doesn't need to be in this movie. ""We win by not fighting the ones we hate, but saving the ones we love"" is the most cheesiest line ever. Kanto Bite Island is very boring and nothing exciting happens here."
303,8,"Over 2,000 angry 1 star reviews can't stop me from liking this movie","It has been 2 1/2 years since the Last Jedi Ruined Star Wars. Many of the reviews claim this to be a plot whole ridden, boring, incoherent poorly written mess.<br /><br />And all the blame falls on Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kenndey (The second one makes zero sense, one executive can't ruin or make all the creative stories that ruin the movie for you)<br /><br />I am not here to tell you this is the best Star Wars Movie or a Masterpiece, but I think it is quite a great enjoyable movie.<br /><br />I think Rian Johnson directed and wrote a movie with beautiful cinematography, great character development, a thrilling story with unexpected turns. Along with Johnson many other people brought this film to life. Anthony Daniels, Carrie Fisher, and especially Mark Hamill returned to the series and preformed just as well if not better as they did 40 years ago and Daisy Riddle, John Boyaga, Oscar Issac, and Adam Driver returned and gave Good performances (not through the roof, but not an abomination). The special effects brought it to life with superior technology to the last generation of films, but top notch for today.<br /><br />******I don't expect anyone to read further than this***** (Not that I don't recommend it, but I personally don't read reviews this long, just right them)<br /><br />I have know idea how long this review is and I don't want it to just be about what people complained about, but I think I need to rant about the ridiculous absurdities of many of the low nit picky complaints that people hold as legitimate complaints in their reviews of this movie. One thing that people held as truly running the movie was the uses of the force introduced as new in this movie. A common complaint is that the force is just magical and the creators of this new movie are ""just making up force powers at this point"". Some of these new powers introduced are a force connection between two people where they can transfer matter, physically touch and see each other, the ability to move your self though space, the power to survive in space, the ability of a force ghost to bring lightning from the sky, and the ability project your self across the galaxy and trick people into your appearance being real. The first problem with this is that fundamentally the force is a fictional made up element, that exists in a world that leans more towards fantasy than science fiction, therefore YES THE FORCE IS MAGICAL. Though these are problems that can be held against Star Wars as a whole. And that is fine you can not like the force. (There is sacrifice in that it is a giant plot convince that allows for things to happen that may seem like luck. But it is a sacrifice because it opened the door to a magical story that touches on basics of human ideals of what is truly good. And it has captured and continued to capture fans from around the world, and of all ages since 1977). We have no reason to think from previous that we know as an audience everything about the force, and there is no rule that you can't introduce new things, and it creates more creative freedom for the story teller to introduce previously unknown elements, and if they break previously establish rules I think that it is a worthy sacrifice for good story telling. Though the examples from earlier have some falsies they do in some case introduce some plot holes. There may be a gap between what we have seen before and what this movie displayed and there may be an unexplained reason that it was never used explore. That is the definition of a Plot Hole, it a hole that can be filled in the future. None of these break any clearly established rule made by the years and years of Star Wars media, and the creators of a high budget film should not have to hold to the most minute detail reviled by some guy in one line of a book or a comic book. (To be fair I am a big fan of material beyond the film and it does not bother me). The reason for Kylo and Rey is establish a clear reason for its origin (Snoke connected them). It is clear establishment of previous movies that the force can connect people across great distances, in this movie the degree was greater and it establishes there is a physically connection this time around. Though we have no reason to believe that this can't happen in a stronger occurrence and that this is rare occurrence that was seldom used in the past. Kylo and Rey are established as very strong and Snoke is established as even stronger. Leia is a beloved character that has clearly established that she has a strong connection to the force (she is the daughter of Darth Vader, the chosen one), and there is not reason we should not believe she pursued a stronger connection to the force over the past 30 years. As for how it is portrayed I agree it looks like superman, it clearly could have handled that better. As for the ability for her to survive in space, I don't think it has little to do with the force, it is a false assumption people have that space kills you instantly, and we have no reason to believe she was out there for that long. In the movies it is a new development that force ghost have the ability to connect with the physical world. The movie does not explain why that is or why it does not happen very often. This is a plot hole, but I think there is room for that to be filled. A force projection it what people have come to call Luke's manifestation on Crait, and it is establish to be a rare power that require a lot of concentration, and for Luke it lead to death (it took all his energy) and I don't think this was the best time for Luke's death and maybe there could have been more to tell with Luke Skywalker. Though just because this power is unestabilhed it does not make it bad, it does not mean you can't like it or think that it cheapens the story. Another plot hole that is really truly a nit pick is the bombs that blow up the dreadnought in the very first scene, they fall in space and blow up the ship. The movie offers no explanation other than that they are all stuck togther as if they are magnetic. An explenation on how these ships and bombs worked would have worked against the movie and is worse than no explanation. Poe yells ""I know everyone I am talking to knows this, but the bombs are magnetic and if I was trying to command an attack I would just say bombs."" Holdo's hyperspace ramming of the First Order capital ship is some thing we have never seen, but from the movie we don't know the difficulty of what happened and even if it made no sense what so ever she made a sacrifice which if you where paying attention you are supposed to see that see is a hero and not just a jerk. These critisims spread through the whole movie and people have dragged this mentality onto the next movie also.<br /><br />I love this movie I am not going to deny that I love it. I love all the Star Wars movie. Many of the other reviews claim this to me poorly written movie with no character development. I just do not see that. I think that Rian Johnson wrote a great movie. It is complex on many levels. The most valid controversy in this movie the portrayal of Luke Skywalker. I understand that people did not like it, Mark Hamill himself wasn't crazy about it, but I like. I he is a broken hero, he has become a legend on and off the screen, this movie humanizes him. He failed and decides to run from his failure and guilt (heroes do not always have to be right). The Force Awakens established that it affected out three main heroes, Luke being the worst (He ran away to never be found). But why did he leave a map, I think it is clear his motives and ideas changed from the time he left to the time Rey found him. When he reveals the truth of the night Kylo turned he admitted his weakness, he is human and that is powerful. Though he is wrong in his willingness to help. When Yoda shows up he learns that faluire is not the point where you give up, but the point to learn the most and he uses all his strength to save the resistance.<br /><br />Rey and Kylo I think are the weakest of all the arcs in this movie. Though it is not absence or all bad there is just some faults, overall I like it. I feel like the dialogue and tension is a little awkward, but for the most part I look past that. Though on re watch I don't think romantic tension is completely out of the blue, I still think it is weird. They are conflicted and on opposites sides thinking they can both get the other to join. Rey individually is lost and scared. She seeks answers and Luke fails at that, but that does not ruin her desire to do good. Though she takes a dangerous road that is unlikely to succeed straight into darkness. Kylo is conflicted and his growth in this movie is breaking free of everything and trying not to be controlled. His defiance of evil authority and opens the door to new ideas. He kills Snoke (A wonderful twist). I did not expect it.<br /><br />Poe, he is very likable and we love him as a audience, and at the begin we see Holdo as a jerk, but by the end we she that it was Poe's fault he was a hotshot that did not understand his leaders and was not open listening. Holdo taught him a lesson that he learned in the end. Though we are to see that Leia sees him as a future leader with lots of potential.<br /><br />Finn was running away he was scared in the beginning of the movie he held that he just wanted revenge and lived in fear. Rose changed that view in his mind that he was a hero to the resistance not just an enemy of first order. Though Roses line is cheesy ""save what you love not kill what you hate"". This is what Finn need to see and her she saved them and then he saved her. Though the kiss was thrown in almost out of nowhere. I does not work and it is weird because he does not feel the same way.<br /><br />This movie is not absent of substance the plot lines, and characters draw me in, and the action and the way it looks is great. I don't think that the Kanto Byte was a weird sub plot that was a waist. It was successful in character development. Also this movie is not political or pushing an evil agenda."
304,7,A hard pill to swallow,"Spoiler review:<br /><br />I've gone back and forth on this one. After first viewing, I enjoyed what I had seen, but was disappointed mainly in the portrayal of Luke. With time and multiple viewings, I have mostly accepted how Luke is written, although I cant forgive a few lines of dialogue/actions."
305,10,The Last Jedi equals Ingenious,"I will never understand the bad word of mouth with the last Star Wars outing, The Last Jedi. There's no going wrong with this franchise as far as I can see. In my honest opinion, Rouge One wasn't as good as The Force Awakes but after watching The Last Jedi, I will say it is one of the best. This gives me reason to question why people are going out of the way to bash what is being done with the Star Wars series. "
306,7,The Last Jedi was the same,Another solid Star Wars film that seems to me seems like it is just telling the same story over again with newer special effect and different actors.
307,5,The Worst Jedi,"If The Force Awakens was a bit too adherent to the classic Star Wars formula, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is its equal and opposite reaction. JJ Abrams' effort often felt like a young boy putting on his Dad's coat, splashing on his cologne and trying in vain to mimic the old man's booming baritone voice. Rian Johnson's entry is the same kid a few years later, willfully eschewing everything that is his Father. The Last Jedi doesn't look like a Star Wars film. Hell, it rarely feels like a Star Wars film. Sure it's got familiar faces, space battles and Force mumbo jumbo, but this ain't your Father's Star Wars, and I think that's the point. The look and feel of this film is synergistic with its message. This is no longer Han, Luke and Leia's show. Perhaps more importantly, it's no longer George Lucas'. This is Star Wars: The Next Generation, and I don't like. Not at all."
308,10,My Favourite Movie,In my opinion this is my favourite movie of all the movies I've seen! This movie subverted my expectations and the story was strong and was very unique and not a copy of The Empire Strikes Back which lots of people where expecting it to be. Because of this The Last Jedi gave the franchise the boost it needed to be able to carry on with Episode 9 and start new series in the Star Wars Universe. The movie looked incredible with the CGI still beating all other movies made and I never got bored when watching the movie and was always really drawn to the story.
309,6,Not what you'd expect,"So everyone says this is the worst of the Star Wars saga. At first I too jumped on this band wagon, and whilst it is certainly not the best by any means, there are some good things about this film. Firstly it's beautiful. The film itself to look at is mesmerising, full of stunning scenery, and beautiful shots. Secondly, there are a few (and sadly only a few) amazing scenes. The opening scene with Poe, as well as the whole section on the salt planet Craig. Most of the film I will admit, is not what you'd expect (or want) from a Star Wars film. Confusion, too many plot holes, and a real feeling like the makers didn't know what they actually wanted to do.<br /><br />Overall, by no means the best film, and yes it probably is the worst of the Star Wars films, but it's not all garbage"
310,2,The most boring and lame star wars movie,This film was boring i almost feel alseep watching it every other one at least tried to keep me intresting in watching it and also they killed luke for no reason and rey continues to be a mary sue and the casino scene was unneeded to give tico more screentime
311,,I want my money back!,"Not only was this just a bad movie, it's also an abomination to the Star Wars series. There's no reason for such heavy experimentation with one of the core 9 Star Wars films. Experimentation either succeeds or fails. Here, it failed."
312,9,Don't listen to the butthurt masses,"This movie was fun, exciting, and expanded the Star Wars universe more. Since when has Star Wars been about answering all of the nitty gritty questions of how the force and the universe work. When people are upset about that, I am astounded that they ""expected more"" explanation from the series. Since the prequels, people have been crying that there was too much revealed, and not enough mystery, as there had been with the originals. I for one am glad that we are introduced to characters who aren't fleshed out here, that leaves room for the imagination and the extended universe to delve into. I've seen some reviewers complain that the movie is too slow, some that it is too scatterbrained, but I think the nuance of the movie outweighs either of these. Also, no spoilers, but I think that what they did with each character felt good, and by no means did I feel cheated by the movie. I loved the questions it left unanswered and the new questions it posed, and am excited to have months of speculative discussions again."
313,7,Star Wars Fans Are Rating It Too Low,"It seems as though you can't pleaae The hardcore Star Wars fan base. I've seen a lot of '1' rating. This is not even close to a '1' rating. I actually put this film off because I get to a point where I think ""another Star Wars film, I'll get to it one day."" Then I watched it and completely remembered why I love these films from the opening scene."
314,8,"Reviews are crap, not the movie","Most of the reviews I read were at grade 1 to 5. And they were all wrong, because the authors were to blind to see. Star wars are not only the Skywalkers and only a true fan would know it. What this film and previous one are doing is transition from one generation to another. There is an adventure, an action and a drama that the Star Wars movie need. Of course I could make it different, every fan can, but you will need a perspective to understand what this movie is offering to. There is still to much mystery to go on. For example only clue to Reys parents is Kylos statement. Who can tell it was true? Further more, how far is Reys training and who will continued it for. Only a limited mind fan would disprove this film. For the rest of us, it's another chapter in the saga. And I couldn't wait for new one."
315,6,Terrible plot,"The script is terrible. Basically, the First Order is chasing the Resistance waiting for them to run out of gas. wow. That's interesting."
316,9,can't understand the negativity here at all.,"My expectations were modest, and the movie surpassed them. Better then previous, even."
317,7,"The Last Jedi puts a nail in the coffin that is the 'Old Star Wars', but it also comes with the new generation of cast that is the 'new Star Wars'","The Last Jedi has opened with overwhelmingly positive reviews, which was an instant sign that I may be in for disappointment due to the film being overhyped and admittedly I didn't come out of the film being very satisfied. Personally, my instant response was negative towards the choice that took with several of the films characters, for instance the choice to very lacklusterly offing supreme leader Snoke when he has been built up in episode VII as the next big bad or the way that Luke was in fact using his 'Jedi hologram' to battle Kylo Ren in the final climactic battle which ended anticlimactically when Luke disappears into the winds in the first Jedi Temple. "
318,5,"I could've written a better plot, while there are some cool moments, it is utterly dumb!","The way this series takes a turn for the worst is unprecedented. This makes the prequels officially better than the sequel trilogy. There are plot elements, character elements, and even elements of the force that make no sense at all! True Star Wars fans will be disappointed to say the least, the film has many problems."
319,9,Viewers not involved anymore,"I liked this one as much as the preceding others. Each character has a purpose and feelings to be useful to the story. To get into the story of the resistance continuing to fight against the bad guys, you have to accept new characters and try to understand those feelings in the story line. The story changes as years go by and it seems that most people just want it to stay in the past. If you are tired of Star Wars, please stop attending and go on with your life instead of filling reviews with complaints. You just aren't getting into the story as it is presented. It is a good thing this one in December is the last. There is definitely not an appreciative audience. I liked it, even if I am in the minority."
320,6,The Ups and Downs,"Just like the last film (The Force Awakens) you are either going to love it, or hate it. But I also noticed a lot of people are very much in the middle. I am one of those people. Yes there were some good elements that made me happy, but, there is a lot more issues then I realized walking out; after thinking more and more about it, the more I feel unsatisfactory. I'm not going to go into spoilers, I'm just here to tell you if it is worth the watch. Honestly, it is, but I wouldn't go rushing to the theatre to see it like with The Force Awakens. I'll start off with the positives, firstly, Mark Hamill gives the strongest performance of his career in my opinion, however some of the direction of the character was off. With that said, I felt fulfilled with how Luke was portrayed in this film. Adam Driver gives a riveting, and damaged performance as Kylo Ren, surely his character is a lot more interesting then Force Awakens. I am very curious what will happen to him next. Daisy Ridley as Rey was spot-on, so was her character in many ways. There is a little surprise in the film involving two characters which I felt satisfied with. Ok, those were the ups. As I enjoyed Luke, Ren, and Rey...thats about it for the characters. The others fell flat, Finn is remarkably pointless at this point, he has no arcs, no story, he's just there right now to give John Boyega a paycheck, good for him, but not for us. The Porgs are Fu--ing stupid in the worst way. They're just a dumb excuse to sell TOYS, but why do you NEED that for Star Wars? Doesn't Star Wars sell enough TOYS! When I saw them in the trailer I snapped, this is what Hollywood has turned to. I wouldn't mind so much if they had a purpose, other then to sell TOYS. They are not as annoyed as the Minions, but pretty close. Finn wasn't the only character who was pointless or unneeded, and some of the ways they handle the characters makes no sense, I would go into more detail, but I want you to go experience this yourself. But in my opinion, this film is worth seeing, just don't expect The Empire Strikes Back or anything. It proves that Disneyfying everything isn't always great."
321,2,What a terrible little film.,"I didn't hate it as much the second viewing as I did the first, but I still found it incredibly weak and cringe inducing. It's hard to point at one particular element that fails as it's all pretty poor. Oscar Isaac is the one saving grace as far as casting goes because pretty much everyone else seems miscast. Boyega grimaces and mugs for the camera somewhat less than previously but is still underwhelming in the extreme. I want to like Ridley so much but she's just wooden and doesn't seem to ""get it"". All the usuals are there, doing what they do but it's all a lot less charming this time around. The story is just another retread and Driver, as good an actor as he is, and as miscast as he is, can't save this tired old piece of space junk."
322,,Get along with the idea that this is a good movie!,"I really don't understand how some people dislike this movie. The only weaknesses I can think about are the characterisation of Finn, who is actually a useless character in this movie and the movie's length (the picture could last 20 minutes earlier)."
323,8,Better than episode VII,"Was not much to work with after Director JJ Abrams did episode VII, but it got the series back on track to what I do not know?Not the original three Star Wars movies"
324,7,Porgy And Bess,"Another film watched in preparation for seeing Episode 9 at the cinema in the upcoming week. My feelings, based on the only time I'd seen ""The Last Jedi"" before was that I didn't really like it, particularly as a follow up to ""Force Awakens"". Watching them both again now, my opinion has flipped, and though this film has more stuff that I don't like, it does both try something different with the universe, and have higher high points."
325,8,Johnson (director) is Supreme Leader of this saga,"Writer and Director Rian Johnson (director) is Supreme Leader of 8th chapter of Star Wars. This chapter can be consider as whole package of action,dialogue, performance, visual effect, sound effect and cinematography for the audience. Brilliant performance from Mark Hamill (actor) since beginning to climax. Another strong performance from Daisy Ridley (actor) and Adam Driver (actor) ."
326,6,"Better than Episodes 1-3 and 7, but Worse than the Originals","There seems to be a general desire of these directors to destroy the Star Wars universe like Darth Vader in a Death Star. I can understand originality and Lucas' stilted dialogue hindered the originals, but the new direction these movies are taking is just ridiculous. If you removed Han, Leia, Luke and Chewey from the last two movies, you'd have a very boring space flick. "
327,10,"A brilliant Star Wars movie, that doesn't deserve the hate","The last Jedi does what a sequel should do. Go in a new and unexpected direction. I love what Rian Johnson did to this movie and Lukes arc. I was kinda mixed the first time I saw the movie in 2017, but the movie has grown on me since and I've realized how great this movie actually is. The Story between Rey, Luke and kylo ren is amazing and so interesting. What you Learn about the characters motivation and desire is so fascinating, And how people can change after time. The cinematography and cgi is top notch, and looks way better than most marvel movies. It's not a flawless movie. The things I don't like is the entire rose and Finn subplot that just panders out the time and ruins the pacing and canto bight sequence (F#ck canto bight). The chase between the first order and resistance is not the most creative plot and kinda adds some plot holes. But overall I love this movie and I could watch it again and again. If you don't like this movie, that's ok. We all have different opinions, but calling this the worst movie ever is kinda over exaggerating"
328,7,"In my opinion, I like this movie.","Yes, I do agree with some of the criticisms like the chase plot making no sense and The whole cantobite plot with the exception of the idea that there are people who do work with both the resistance and the first order is boring. But I enjoy everything else like the acting (mostly Adam driver and mark hamill), the effects are gorgeous, some shots are beautiful, kylo turned into a fascinating character with a interesting plan of wiping everything out, and some of the criticisms fans make I don't agree with like:<br /><br />Rey being a nobody, Good because I'm sick of this galaxy's characters somehow going back to this tiny group.<br /><br />Snokes backstory, he was a boring ripoff of the emperor who I gave no craps about and it makes kylo more interesting.<br /><br />Luke would not kill his nephew over his instincts. Oh like in return or the Jedi where he nearly kills his father over his instincts?<br /><br />The holdo manuver, I personally just really like the moment.<br /><br />Luke wouldn't abandon the force which coming off of him not doing anything in TFA is the only explanation that would make sense.<br /><br />So yes hate me all you want and call me a disgrace to Star Wars but to me with all the Luke, Rey and kylo Ren stuff, I really enjoyed this movie."
329,2,A completely empty movie made for profit on a generic PC hollywood formula,"There is very little good to say about it. The movie is void of any significant story or dialogues, it lacks purpose and vision. Its rather an obvious and obnoxious mix of studio wishes for toy sales and trying to please as wide an audience as possible. So many things wrong dont know where to even begin."
330,8,Getting back on track...,Oh wow! Where to begin?
331,6,I enjoyed it better than Episode 7,"It has flaws. Many flaws. For one, I really did not like Rose. She felt like Rey 2.0. She was given knowledge and skills that she should not have had, and they did that finishing each other's sentences that made me cringe in Episode 7.<br /><br />The animation of Yoda was...horrible. Unbelievably horrible, like worse than Episode 2. He looked like the Yoda in the Clone Wars animated series.<br /><br />On to what I liked about the movie, Luke was the most entertaining character in the movie. His interactions with Rey were the funniest scenes in an otherwise somber movie. As a shock to no one, Luke Skywalker dies. As with Harrison Ford in Episode 7, Mark Hamill was eager to retire his character and pass the torch onto the next generation. His death was terribly anti-climactic though. Heart attack. Yes, the most iconic character in the Star Wars franchise next to Darth Vader dies from a heart attack. I can see why so many fans hate this movie for that reason alone."
332,1,This movie made every Disney Star Wars film except Rogue One non-canon to me,"Absolute rubbish. Can't believe I still have the DVD of it, think I might destroy it in a very brutal fashion tonight. I nearly turned it off at the bit where Luke gets green milk out of an ugly alien and I've only ever watched it once, more than that is just unbearable the whole thing was pretty much unwatchable so I'm never watching it again and to me only Episodes I-VI and R1 are canon due to this outrageous film. The space battles dragged on for way too long and were mind-numbingly boring, the scenes at the cantina were pretty pointless and boring, Rose Tico was super annoying with her identity politics and anti-Imperial agenda. Finn should've died when Rose saved her and the fact Finn didn't blame her for 'saving' him made no sense at all, the Rose character was a complete lunatic basically. Luke's character was destroyed as was Jedi's powers with Rey learning how to be as tough as Sith Lords after just a few weeks of training and the force ghosts still having powers despite not bothering to help the Rebels out against Snoke and Palpatine. Complete and utter rubbish, if you're a SW fan and haven't watched this I urge you to not watch it."
333,,DIsaster,The worst Star wars film ever made. I can't believe that it was so awful. I am so disappointed.
334,10,Astounding New Episode,"Well, so much has been written, said and tweeted already that very little can be added to a loud choir of either praise or another choir, of criticism. Anyway, having said that, I must admit that The Last Jedi is a truly astounding episode and it holds admirably well in the already large and weighty Star Wars saga. This new part is the longest but the movie never drags or stalls and what's more, a very healthy intake of breezy humor adds a very strong element to this tightly-knit fabric of a plot. <br /><br />Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher - to name the few - do a very spellbinding and jaw-dropping work, and what's again very cool and decent, they are shown as real people, with weak spots, doubts, hopes, hesitations, panic, fear, terror and strength. Much has been written about Kylo Ren's battle with his own Dark Side, so no new thing must be added, but this very struggle is a truly breathtaking edge-of-the-seat holder all through this excellent film. Large and very clever parts played by Hamill, Fisher and Ridley also never let us down, and every time any of our beloved characters appear on the screen, we feel delighted to see them alive and kicking and going on their uneasy but deserved and rewarding paths. <br /><br />Awesome CGI, heart-wrenching deaths, intrepid feats, daredevil space battles add a huge portion of awe and excitement. And then, a beauty of the nature as well as very strong music put new pieces of mosaic thus building a mesmerizing kaleidoscope of thriller and food for thought.<br /><br />This is a very welcomed new part of a large mechanism, and so many hints were dropped, new bridges to a fresh episode were built that we now have to take a deep breath and pluck up all our patience awaiting a new film.<br /><br />So, this one earns 10 out of 10, to my and to many watchers' minds. I do hope the next part will fly into high space (pun intended) with the same gusto and valor."
335,7,Almost Flawless!,"This action-packed installment of the sequel trilogy is far the most amazing Star Wars movie I have ever witnessed.I don't know why people hate it.Nevertheless,The movie made $1.3+billion in the box office worldwide and had a budget of $300,000,000+ which means that Rian Johnson along with Disney made a $1 billion profit which is outstanding.But why is it nominated for 4 Oscars when I personally think it should've won 7-13 Oscars.-Isa Akbar"
336,8,"Contrary to reviews, I love this one","So much negative things has been said about this one that I still can't believe how much I like it. A lot of story points, great action and so important moments between Rey and Ben. And on top of this, a lot of funny moments, with a strong performance from Mark Harmill as a aged desillusionned Luke Skywalker."
337,7,Star Wars is running out of steam,"Critics have seen a different movie than the general audience. Their high ratings are quite baffling since The Last Jedi has very large plot holes, lacks the sense of humor of other installments and has a twist you could see coming from miles away. "
338,9,EASILY the best of the last six films,"Despite the misogynistic, racist, elitist, and classist backlash by a-hole fanboys, The last Jedi is easily - EASILY - the best of episodes 1,2,3,7,8,9. It is also simply a thoroughly enjoyable movie in its own right, pretty much on par with the superb Rogue One. A big and important reveal about one of the character's parentage in Last Jedi, much contested by unimaginative, closed-minded viewers, was brilliant and spot on, taking the franchise in a welcome new direction. The more diverse cast was also welcome. Unfortunately, that new direction - less elitist, more diverse, more imaginative - all wonderfully typical of Rian Johnson - was completely undermined in Rise of Skywalker. JJ Abrams could have built on Johnson's excellent script, but Abrams, who I have almost completely lost interest at this point because of junk like that, proved himself to be predictable and, it must be said, downright racist in his caving into the racism of fanboys. Also, astonishingly elitist and classist with his undoing of the lineage reveal from Last Jedi."
339,7,"Not the best of the franchise, but does enough to keep the momentum going for Episode IX","'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (Episode VIII) has a big challenge - live up to the original trilogy and build upon the solid foundation laid by 'The Force Awakens'. It achieves both in parts, but probably not overall. If Episode VII was reminiscent of 'A New Hope', Episode VIII doesn't really emulate 'The Empire Strikes Back' too much. It starts with a pretty good space battle between The Resistance and the First Order, with Poe Dameron (Issac) and General Hux (Gleeson) the main players. Poe's a great character, but probably needed more of him. The characters are all in different locations, so the film spends a bit of time hopping between them - Luke (Hamill) and Rey (Ridley) are on Ahch-To; Leia (Fisher) is with Poe on a ship being chased by Hux & her son, Kylo Ren (Driver); Finn (Boyega) is on a mission with Rose (Tran) at Canto Bight, a casino planet."
340,1,Pointless,The whole film was pointless and amounts to nothing. It could literally be 5 minutes long if it just had actual relevant plot.
341,9,"Dense, exhausting, wonderful.","Leaving the theater, I didn't have the same euphoria I had after seeing The Force Awakens for the first time. The Last Jedi is an exhausting, at times dense, entry into the saga. It is also the best since Empire."
342,7,Great special effects but not the good old Star Wars,"These days thanks to technique and special effects you can create and continue what once George Lucas started.<br /><br />So I rated the movie with a 7 for the nice scenery, special effects and alien characters created.<br /><br />But I consider the movie a disappointment, because of the overreacting characters and everything not being the same anymore since George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012.<br /><br />I mean you can clearly make the difference that it's not George Lucas's magic hand anymore.<br /><br />All those old scenes where MAster Yoda was appearing, all those past great landscapes are not the same anymore.<br /><br />Old landscapes and all the old characters gave to the movie a certain weight and put accent on characters.<br /><br />Even though the new film has action and great special effects nothing is the same anymore.<br /><br />All those winter battle scenes from the Battle of Hoth with the AT-AT's are long gone. <br /><br />I hope they will stop shooting and continuing because they will just spoil what Lucas created and Star Wars will just fade away.<br /><br />Unless Lucas will start directing again because what he did cannot be continued by others."
343,2,The Force is now gender neutral.,This film goes to show that reviews can be bought and Disney is now the real-life Galactic Empire of filmmaking. How critics rated this movie brilliant baffles me. The only emotions this film delivers is one of heartbreak and shock at what is being portrayed on screen. It's a slap in the face for all Star Wars fans intelligent enough to know a PC movie whenever they see one. THIS MOVIE SUCKED.
344,,What the apologists just do not understand...,"...Is that Star Wars is a whole lot more than just 'a big franchise', it is an institution and part of our cultural heritage. You cannot go ahead and deconstruct it to your liking and expect everyone to come out feeling the same way as you felt as you painted the canvas with your brush...Which is what Rian Johnson did and it backfired by not a little."
345,9,Brilliant,"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a brilliant and unique addition to the well-loved franchise, and could very well possibly be one of the best. I had the privilege of attending the midnight premiere screening of this film, which was undoubtedly one of the best cinema experiences I've had. Hosted by Star Walking, the longest running Star Wars fan club worldwide, this film was accompanied by constant applause and cheering from an audience of over 700 individuals. Many of them being dressed up in remarkable costumes, the overall atmosphere was full of excitement, apprehension and joy, and made the premiere a great experience.<br /><br />Now, onto the actual film. Sequels always have a high chance of being a disappointment, as they usually do not live up to its predecessor and never feel as fresh or enjoyable. Director Rian Johnson had huge shoes to fill in creating this film, and not only did he not disappoint and stayed very true to the franchise, but he also made a Star Wars film that has it's own unique and refreshing style. Johnson's directing style is quite different to previous directors in the franchise that ultimately sits well. When combined with a well-paced storyline that is full of many plot twists and complex underlying themes, you end up with a flawless film. The casting in this film is great, with a mix of diverse actors that all portray their characters exceptionally well. Notable highlights go to Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Laura Dern who's talent shines throughout this film. Adam Driver's performance was also very well-done and had certainly improved from the previous film. An honourable mention also goes to the late Carrie Fisher who played the role of Princess Leia for the last time and did an exceptional job.<br /><br />One of the best things about this film is the fact that it is so visually striking. With breathtaking locations, wonderful fantasy creatures, elaborated costume design and striking cinematography by Steve Yedlin, this film is a delight to look at. The action scenes in this film left the entire audience in awe of its visual appeal and overall execution. The score in this film was as great as ever, by longtime Star Wars composer John Williams, and certainly contributed significantly to the film. The humour was frequent and brilliant, producing genuine laughter throughout the whole cinema, and did not have an effect on the serious side of the film which was certainly emotional in several parts.<br /><br />Overall, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece and may very well be my favourite Star Wars film to date. Every aspect is perfect, from the acting to the visual aesthetic. You do definitely not want to miss out on seeing this in theatres."
346,7,A good film in a great franchise,"In part eight of the nine segments of the super-franchise, various sub-stories occur simultaneously: General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) is leading the resistance against the destructive First Order while her son Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is a member of the enemy force; Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to coax self-exiled Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to join resistance; and other characters on both sides infiltrate the other."
347,10,"Ignore the ""fans"" who hated this film, they're blinded by the Dark Side.",No spoilers until indicated
348,6,The best of a bad bunch,"I actually enjoyed this movie on a stand alone basis, it was original and had more of a new feel instead of being a copy cat version. That being said it was still no where near the standards it should be and is still apart of the worst trilogy of Star Wars films."
349,8,The Rian Johnson Experiment,"The sequel trilogy's 'Empire Strikes Back' chooses not to follow the Force Awakens model of updating the existing story, instead taking the darker themes and style of risks and do something completely new. Can you hear the fanboys screaming yet?"
350,6,Not the best star wars film,"There's a lot of hate for this film, calling it the worse movie ever etc. This is clearly not the case, it's just blind hatred. The film has some good things but also many problems that prevent it being as good as it could have been."
351,4,I'm sorry I'm just sorry!,This movie is a 4/10 AS I FINISHED WATCHING IT! Take this score IMDB! It will lower over time as I think about it more! So take it now!<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />I saw the TFA yeah it felt good and walking out this felt like a 7/10. As I drove away we began to discuss it in the car. It then became a 6/10. I then saw it again and it ended up being a 5. <br /><br />So take this 4/10 for TLJ while you still can! Don't make me watch it again. It will be a 1 for SURE! Terrible! And that Rian Johnson guy? He is for real? What drugs are you all doing at Disney?
352,9,Downvote This Review. Losers.,"The Last Jedi is a great film. Given that it's supposed to be part of a trilogy, perhaps the choices Johnson made were a bit too harsh as it forced The Rise Of Skywalker to bring back The Emperor. Vice Admiral Holdo really didn't need to keep her plan a secret. It sucks that Rey, Finn and Poe are all on separate adventures."
353,6,Even better than the last,"""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" is as the title already states the 8th installment for the long-running Star Wars franchise and the second of 3 films from recently. Rian Johnson took over as director and writer all on his own for this 2.5-hour film and I think he did a really good job. No surprise this won box office for 2017 movies as it was as big of a financial success as it was a success with critics and reviewers like myself, probably even more. I liked episode 7 already, but I loved episode 8 occasionally. Adding Mark Hamill to the cast does so so much for it and it's a shame he won't be back for the final chapter. But this also shows how they are not scared of killing off major characters, legendary characters even, the way they did with Han Solo in the previous. The scenes with Daisy Ridley and her male partners were the absolute highlight. First all the action on the island with Hamill and then the scenes with Adam Driver exploring the complicated relationship between their two characters. I still am not sold at all when it comes to Boyega I must say as the male lead to such a strong franchise. He was clearly overshadowed by the other guys I just mentioned. But he was also hurt by the story with the Asian girl going from zero to hero in the most unrealistic unlikely hero story I have seen in quite some time. The only purpose her character eventually has is making clear there won't be a love story between the two protagonists, just like there wasn't in the old Star Wars films, even if for completely different reasons. Several other actors reprised their roles, most of all Carrie Fisher of course and her untimely death makes some situations fairly awkward as there is a great deal of references on death surrounding her character, even if she lives eventually. As for the other actors: Isaac is a much better actor than he is allowed to show here, Serkis makes for a good bad guy once more, Nyong'o is almost non-existent, Gleeson impressed me once more. Dern and Del Toro bring characters to life that teach you that the first impression isn't always right. As for BDT, I think it was a bit strange how they can't get the real guy and just take him instead, even if he may be gifted. Next best thing huh? Did not feel too smart to be honest."
354,5,It is still a retread,"In terms of visuals, The Last Jedi is the best looking Star Wars film, shiny bright, wonderful use of monochrome and then adding splashes of red in the climactic battle."
355,,Even worse than I expected.,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it's terrible. I honestly can't think of a single good thing about it other than the music (almost all of which is from earlier Star Wars films) and that it isn't a remake of The Empire Strikers Back. Besides that, there's almost nothing good about it."
356,10,a master piece of a film,One of best sequel to the force awakens ever. this film help me so much to coped in life and give me something to look forward to every time i watch it at home and on trips away on holiday.
357,6,Worst Star Wars movie since The Battle of Endor,"I've seen it in cinema, then a few times already on Blu-Ray, then rewatching it again right now on Disney+ I have to say it is really terrible. The plot, the whole story is stupid, this low fuel nonsense, then the Luke part is really a shame, the casino planet, so silly, with the racing animals, and the escape, also why Finn and Rose, like they couldn't come up with any ideas. Also the half naked Kylo...really, I mean I could go endlessly. I would give less stars but it is Star Wars."
358,10,Best one of the sequel trilogy,"I don't understand why it gets all this hate. It's a well made Star Wars movie. I understand there is some people will think that the movie is long and some will say ""we didn't like the fin and rose storyline"", and some will say ""this is not how the force work""<br /><br />But they don't see how well directed is this movie. And after the trilogy you see that this is the best and the most thrilling of all the new ones. Great use of camera movement and tricks, beautiful cinematography. Not one minute is wasted it, every moment elevate the story until we arrive into the standoff third act that make my jaw drop. Best lightsaber fight since Return of the Jedi, Rian Johnson really knows how to direct and where to put the camera, the use of extreme close up and wide shots are perfect. John Williams music in the third act is like hearing heaven.<br /><br />Stop hating The Last Jedi, because it cannot be better than this, it was perfect."
359,6,Good for being an Action Movie/ Bad for Star Wars Lore.,"I truly enjoyed the The Last Jedi compared to Rogue One. Although most people not agree with me on this movie being good I loved it. The truth is I was dissapointed in some of the character plotholes with Rey and I didn't like Rose at all. The film could've been better with some character explanations but it did have one of the most eye opening moments in this new trilogy. The story was flawed yes, but still worth watching, Mark Hamil as Luke Skywalker returns with a good performance, The Visuals are still as mind-blowing as The Force Awakens, But the Action was insanely choreographed with Samurai styled swordplay with lightsabers and combat weapons along with very good fight scenes. The movie has some good and bad points, I was considering giving it a 7/10 but I'm gonna give it an 8/10 for its exciting sequences of action, humor, and well done visuals. I hope Episode IX fills that bad climax of Episode VIII with J.J. Abrams writing the script for IX."
360,8,The Force Remains Strong!,"Okay, first up, 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is what a Year End Blockbuster is meant to be. Its action-packed & extremely ambitious. <br /><br />Having said that, not ALL Star Wars fanatics might end up feeling the same. Reason? The narrative's familiarity as well as the humangous expectations, those looking for hardcore emotional-connect. So if 'The Force Awakens' worked for you, 'The Last Jedi' will do so too. I, myself, loved the film & was engrossed by the mayhem all around it. "
361,7,Epic,"Pretty good slow chase story with heroes and cavalry coming for help. The life of mice. Luckily, some have the force. Great effects, good acting and rather funny at the beginning."
362,4,Death of a franchise,"Following the disappointing film before this JJ Abrams gives us another dumpster fire. when Star Wars was injected into our solar system it was a great story of the Rebellion vs the Empire. Luke Vs VADAR/Emperor. The prequels got us to the point with the characters we knew. We lose Han Solo in The Force Awakens, We lose Luke Skywalker in the Last jedi. This is just obligatory and killed the franchise"
363,10,REVIEW!,"I am literally and technically laughing on people's REVIEWS! I mean do you guys even have the slightest idea about a movie's Plot or Cinematography? What a good movie is!? Also is there any REAL STAR WARS FAN HERE?! ""WELL YEAH IT WAS A BIT SLOW...BUT AS EPISODE VIII IT WAS REALLY GREAT."""
364,7,I really enjoyed that! It's good!,"Like that film for characters, cinematography, plots and villains."
365,4,An embarrassment and an insult to the franchise and fans,Did we wait 40 years for this?<br /><br />Did we spend all tbat merchandising money for this?<br /><br />A travesty my friends. How are we to recover from this?<br /><br />Mr Abrams. Over to you.
366,,A very badly written fan fic,"Horrible, just horrible. The acting, the script, even the visuals were lacking in comparison with the last 6 (and I cannot believe I'm saying the prequels were better, they were terrible). "
367,10,"Yoda Says, ""Of A Great Movie Spoilers There Be!""","I just returned from finally seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and I just loved the movie. I did as much as possible to avoid spoilers while waiting to see it, but I do know that many people complained about it-even as it set new revenue records. Having seen it myself, I have to say that I don't understand all the complaining."
368,7,"Legacies, Characters, Acting, and Interest Lost by Rian Johnson and a Horrible Script","I was excited for this Star Wars. I drove to my local theater through plenty of snow and traffic with some friends to see a movie I'd greatly anticipated. <br /><br />Walking in, I felt good, watching the first ten minutes, a high-paced action scene akin to great space battles before it, with great piloting by Poe, timely comedy and sacrifice scenes to boot that brought a new element of sympathy to the random characters we see die that we rarely spare much of a thought about. Had the whole movie been similar to this or even at least have the action scenes follow this mold, I would give this an 8 out of 10. Unfortunately, the final 140 minutes were a narrative mess without any direction or meaning.<br /><br />Let's start this with some things I really enjoyed about this movie. The acting was fantastic, and you could tell everyone playing their characters really channeled their best efforts into this project. The score was fantastic once again, and so was the cinematography and special effects. The action scenes are well-choreographed, for the most part, and they didn't shove callbacks to the original trilogy as much as they did TFA.<br /><br />However, once you get past the talented and passionate actors, effects workers, and John Williams, you find a movie truly lacking in the elements that made Star Wars such a great trilogy in the first place. <br /><br />I'm glad to see many reviewers also believe that the comedy in this film was sub-par. You never saw the on-the-nose forced humor from this in Empire, A New Hope, or even Jedi. Yoda burns the ancient Jedi scriptures as a joke, and then Luke, despite literally 30 seconds previous he was about to burn it himself, gets mad and tries to save the books. He also throws his lightsaber away when Rey hands it to him, which was cheap. There are just plenty of quips and one liners that aren't needed, to summarize. <br /><br />So many characters from The Force Awakens, the original Trilogy or even introduced in this movie are wasted by a script that doesn't know what it wants to do. Finn does nothing in this movie, besides almost run away, have a casino subplot that made no effect on the plot, and fight Captain Phasma for 1 minute. (Phasma was once again criminally wasted, and then killed off.) Maz could have been used in place of Guillermo Del Toro's shabbily introduced and shoved out character, but she was relegated to one scene where she fights off something we have no idea about. Yoda comes in for five seconds and does nothing except crack a few one liners and do what Luke was about to do. Snoke, who was intriguing, mysterious and incredibly powerful to the point where he senses his apprentice's intent? Just some nobody who gets killed off in a manner impossible not to see coming. R2-D2 served no purpose in the movie other than say hi to Luke, Chewbacca was basically some dude who flied the Falcon and couldn't speak, and while Leia actually was treated well in this, her god-like come back to life scene was astoundingly confusing. Poe was used to a serviceable amount, and had at least some character development. Laura Dern's admiral character was perplexing in many ways. She could have told her crew about her plan, rather than not say anything before she loaded the transports which rightly provoked a mutiny. She also waits until most of the ships have been shot down before reaching her plan to go to light speed and destroy the ship. Rose, played by Kelly Marie Tran, was interesting. Her character as a nobody in the Resistance who has seen friends and family die only to see her supposed invincible heroes disrespect that was something that could have been worked with and I hope that unlike many characters from TFA that we see her again at some point in a significant manner. General Hux also could have been used more than he was and was given little to do other than get intimidated by Snoke and Kylo.<br /><br />The entire subplot with Rose, Finn and the Codebreaker only dragged the movie far longer than it needed to be and could have been shortened greatly with little effect on the movie, or even cut out entirely, since the tracking of the ship no longer was deemed necessary. Also, The Force Awakens leaves off on the Starkiller Base being destroyed, and then resumes in TLJ with the Rebellion being on their last leg, almost completely destroyed with no explanation for how.<br /><br />Obviously I have to talk about the major deaths in this movie. Rather than kill off Leia respectfully, as she will not be in episode 9, or even in the scene where her cabin gets shot out and she climbs back into the ship somehow, they kill Snoke before anything is revealed about his origins, character or how he got to power. Luke's death, while interesting and needed to close out the plot TLJ was trying to tell with the end of the Jedi, epitomized the wasting of Mark Hamill's talent and love for this franchise. We never know why he gave up so suddenly, or why he wouldn't even contact anyone important from the original gang. Instead, he becomes an unhelpful and resenting hermit completely unlike Ben Kenobi.<br /><br />Rey and Kylo Ren have the closest thing to character development in the script. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were once again fun to watch and kept you on your toes, with their narrative of projecting to each other, to their fight scenes. However, Kylo goes from refusing to kill Leia, killing Snoke and helping Rey to immediately fighting her and making power grabs for the First Order. Once Luke's lightsaber explodes, we never see Rey again until she's in the Falcon again with Chewbacca, even though we never see her running away to get in the ship, or boarding it. She also does barely nothing in the final scene, where she definitely could and should have. <br /><br />Overall, this movie could have been one of the best movies this franchise has seen, yet instead it only barely holds itself up above the prequels. This is the worst Star Wars movie since Revenge of the Sith."
369,8,Gets way too much hate,"The Last Jedi is seen as the most controversial Star Wars film to date, splitting Star Wars fans down the middle and emphasizing the toxicity of the Star Wars fandom. The Last Jedi acts as the eighth installment in the Skywalker Saga, and despite protests and signed petitions of fans, is going to stay that way.<br /><br />The Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens ends, a first for a Star Wars film. The films centers around Rey being trained in the ways of the force by Luke Skywalker, while the resistance flees from the first order's powerful fleet. As Rey travels to The Supremacy to turn Kylo Ren to the nightside, Finn and newcomer Rose to a chance of finding a ""master codebreaker"" to weaken the first orders hold on the resistance fleet and provide a chance of escape. The film ends with a battle between the massive first order army and the few remaining members of the resistance.<br /><br />This film includes the best performances of the sequel trilogy. Daisy Ridley, Oscar Issac, and John Boyega all take their characters first introduced in the previous film and gives them new meaning, but the strongest performance comes from Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren. Rian Johnson took the quiet and monotoned villain that delivers no emotion hiding behind his mask and gives him intense and brutal scenes, really diving into the character and giving him more worth in the trilogy.<br /><br />The cinematography of The Last Jedi is some of the best of the saga, easily separating it from the other films. Even those who aren't fans of the film can agree on the beauty that Rian Johnson was able to create. I will never forget when each story is at its climax and Commander Holdo uses her ship's hyperdrive to erupt through The Supremacy. Another example of the beauty this film generates takes place on the planet Crait. The resistance is flying their ski speeders towards the first order army in a perfect line, shooting the red planet surface into the air. The whole planet of Crait is very satisfying to watch with the white surface being splattered with red, every blast, every step, every track of a vehicle is being recorded on the planet surface.<br /><br />One of the biggest issues the fans have with The Last Jedi is how Luke Skywalker was written. It's argued that the character is ruined in how he has run away and cut himself off from the force. What people don't seem to understand is that Luke's story didn't finish with Return of the Jedi. Luke's fear and ,mistakes prove that he isn't the legend the galaxy saw him as, but a human, like everyone else. Luke's character is redeemed by the end of the film, as he sacrifices himself to save the resistance. Fans wanted Luke to come back and just save the day with an epic lightsaber fight, but that wouldn't have progressed the story in any way. They complained The Force Awakens was too similar to the original trilogy and they complained that this film was too different. Luke already saved the galaxy in the original trilogy and now it was time for the new characters to have their story.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect Episode 8 showed was the fall of Ben solo. Ryan Johnson showed this event through multiple points of view, giving the viewers a little mystery of who to believe and how the event actually went down. It's argued that it is completely unlike Luke to strike down Ben Solo in fear, and that's 100% true, Luke even knew it and that's why he couldn't kill his nephew. This gives meaning to Luke going into exile as he was ashamed by himself. Through these flashback sequences, we are able to learn more of why Kylo Ren turned and what makes him the person he is.<br /><br />One of the coolest features of The Last Jedi are the scenes that highlight the force bond of Rey and Kylo Ren. These scenes of them speaking to each other in different locations are unlike anything we've seen before, and further the tension between the two. Kylo is certain he can turn Rey to the dark side and Rey is certain she can do the opposite with him. They are both being seen exactly what they want, and proves just how manipulative Snoke really is.<br /><br />Snoke is another reason the movie receives so much whiplash by the fans is because Snoke is killed off before we can learn more about who he is and how he rose to power. People had no problem with Palpatine being killed in the original trilogy. Similarly to Smoke, it was only his second movie and we knew nothing about him. We later learn all about him in the prequels, and we even get to learn about Snoke in the Rise of Skywalker and we might even get more secrets uncovered in time to come. Just like Palpatine, Snoke's story is far from finished, and I am certain more will be uncovered as more Star Wars projects are made.<br /><br />When it comes to the massive controversy surrounding The Last Jedi, there are many fingers being pointed at who should be taking the blame. Rian Johnson? Kathleen Kennedy? It is clear that the real blame is held with the fans. The fanbase has grown so toxic that no matter how amazing a film The Last Jedi could've been, it's impossible to please everyone, and with technology and social media at an all time high, those who aren't please we have no fear in sharing their opinion. This resulted in multiple actors going off of social media, the fanbase becoming split and even future Star Wars projects being cancelled.<br /><br />The Last Jedi is the most debated and controversial film in the saga, and while certain parts of the plot are weak, the overall story, stunning performances, visual and audio effects, and magnificent score by John Williams quickly turn the film round into a complex and enjoyable ride for the audience. I am giving Star Wars: The Last Jedi a 7.8/10."
370,7,Jedi Master Yoda We Do Hear From,"There are two things that are worth seeing this for long term Star Wars fans (since 1975-76), over 40 years. Top two on my list -"
371,9,"Bursting with exhilarating spectacle, unexpected twists, and profound respect for its characters and story, The Last Jedi is an uncompromising force to be reckoned with","So, the beloved Star Wars saga has reached the eighth chapter and now continues the story with our heroes battle against the diabolical First Order. After making a warm welcome back with 'The Force Awakens' in 2015, the Star Wars franchise has made a remarkable recovery from the damper left by the botched prequel trilogy launched by the hands of George Lucas. Although The Force Awakens was a flawed chapter as it drew more than enough parallels to 'The New Hope', it marked a significant turning point in the saga. The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson of films such as 'Brick' and the hit time-traveling sci-fi piece 'Looper', is a heartwarming spectacle full of just about everything you desire in a Star Wars movie: killer special effects, compelling expansion of the characters, heart-pounding twists, and a story bursts with near endless excitement from beginning to end. This film strikes at the heart of the franchise with a strong emotional magnitude that keeps you growing hungry for more as it leaves you questioning nearly everything. What is all gonna come down to? And don't worry, this review will be restrained to a spoiler-free frontier. But if you prefer to go in completely blind, just go see the movie and come back later. So, Princess Leia (played by Carrie Fisher) is the now the commander of the Resistance as they continue their fight against the First Order headed by Snoke (played by Andy Serkis). Ex-Stormtrooper Finn (played by John Boyega) has awaken from his coma and escapes with fellow resistance warrior Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran) on a conquest to foil the First Order. Meanwhile, Resistance fighter Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) is stranded on an island where he encounters the estranged Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) who he must convince her in battle to settle the score with his nephew Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver). But first, he must teach her the ways of the force. "
372,7,"Fun, but doesn't quite fit in Star Wars","Star Wars The Last Jedi isn't a bad movie, it's even visually stunning at times, but fans of the Star Wars franchise will find that it rubs them the wrong way as it just doesn't quite jive with the rest of the existing franchise. Rian Johnson seems to have been so intent on leaving his mark on the franchise he had no interest in either doing very much with the plot threads JJ Abrams left him or setting up any for the conclusion of the trilogy."
373,2,The end before it's time...,"I've always considered myself as a Star Wars fan that can keep a long and good talk about the saga.<br /><br />When I went to see The Last Jedi, I had a bad feeling about it, since the trailer wasn't that good.<br /><br />But I had good hopes on the movie to be good enough, as fans could see Luke Skywalker fight like we never experienced before and show us how the best Jedi ever returns to the big screen.<br /><br />But Rian Johnson had different objectives for the character...<br /><br />After the ending of The Force Awakens, I think I talk for everyone here, we were expecting for the best for the next film.<br /><br />Then Johnson happened... An amateur film director that took a story bigger than him, took the responsability of characters he shouldn't have had. He literally destroyed everything Abrams built for what could have been the best freaking Star Wars movie the world could've seen.<br /><br />He made Luke ""look"" like an old and weak man who is now afraid of even going out of a cave because of a mistake he made with Han Solo's spoiled kid.<br /><br />And that's the smallest problem of his ""creation""<br /><br />-What happened to Ray?<br /><br />In The Force Awakens, Ray had that charming behavior and innocence that made every man fell in love with that character.<br /><br />In this film, I was sad for what I was watching, but it was gone, and Ray was just a simple character.<br /><br />-Leia...can fly?<br /><br />I'm sure I'm not the only one who almost walked out of the theaters after that scene with Leia using ""the force"", levitating and returning to the ship. LIKE WHY?"
374,8,An unforeseen upswing for the sequel trilogy,"The short version is this: I love this movie. The year's passage after seeing ""The Last Jedi"" hasn't dulled its impact. This is a movie that approaches the status quo and completely flips the table. It's fearless; it's surprising; it's unexpected; it's the kick-in-the-ass that this new trilogy needed. The only question I'm left with at the end of watching this is, ""Where the hell do we go from here?"". And that is exciting."
375,7,Better Jar Jar than this,"I liked Ewoks, little Annie and I even didn't dislike Jar Jar but I sure didn't like The last Jedi. "
376,1,Destruction,"Probably spoilers, but the movie is 5 years old so who cares at this point."
377,,Star Wars is finally dead ... the worst movie in the franchise,"This is the movie that kills off Star Wars franchise. <br /><br />I belong to the original Star Wars generation and I always understood that in order to bring the story forward some sacrifices would have to be made. I seriously thought that ""The Force Awakens"" was pretty alright considering that a shift to move things along was necessary but ""The Last Jedi"" instead of taking things forward kinda just seals the fate of this already fledgling franchise. Don't get me wrong the movie is very well shot, there are references to previous successful shots in other movies, but the magic is gone. I don't know how else to put it. It's like what happened to Superman after Reeves, the title is same but the movies aren't. <br /><br />It feels like just another scifi flick not special like Star Wars should be. I was really disappointed by the prequels trilogy and was hoping that this new trilogy would reincarnate the magic but alas it does not. In-fact ""Rogue One"" was way better at being a Star Wars movie that any other after the original trilogy and that's saying something."

379,7,Watchable but not as good as previous film,Star Wars - The story of galaxy clashes continues and the third movie in the franchise that I had watched till date. It's good movie and nothing bad as critics said but not strong as the plot of The Force Awaken and Rogue One in past years. Still it is a watchable film. 7/10 Imdb rating.

381,7,A very weak and dissapointing movie for a Disney franchise,"After The Force Awakens and Rogue One, I had high expectations for The Last Jedi. I believed that Disney could bring the Star Wars franchise back to it's peak and maybe even improve it. "
382,10,A fresh new beginning with the potential for a new direction and ideas. Loved it.,"The Last Jedi instilled the same excitement, awe and wonder I first felt when seeing A New Hope back in 1977. "
383,7,"It's a small step for a movie, one giant leap for Star Wars universe.","Eight episode's motto could be: ""Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to."" There are average parts (battle at start), good parts (chemistry between Kylo and Rey) and iconic parts (meeting Luke, final farewell). Johnson is not afraid to go against conventions and thus relativises the Force, the Jedi, the Darkness and even Luke himself. Sometimes it's done well, sometimes it's worse."
384,3,Enter Jake Skywalker,Without a doubt this was the worst Star Wars movie in so many levels. It is because of TLJ was the reason that The Rise Of Skywalker was such a trainwreck. Lets go into the reasons:
385,10,"I liked it, but I understand the criticism","So Rey and Kylo Ren are my favorite characters, so it makes sense that I loved this movie because the movie was really meant to service them. Both of their character arcs were well done, and better than any other Star Wars character arc."
386,7,Went Places Die-Hard Fans Didn't Want To Go,"After seeing The Last Jedi for a 3rd time I believe I can finally give my honest opinion what I believe to be one of the best Star Wars movies in general and my score 8/10 is based on that. <br /><br />I am a Star Wars fan ever since I was 12 or 13 and watched the old Trilogy in the late 90's. As a kid you just can't help but falling in love with the Star Wars universe because in its core it's still a children's fairy tale. Kids just love the young prince to be (Luke), the warrior and politician princess (Leia) and naturally, the likable looks bad but is actually good thief (Han Solo) and the scary and cool Darth Vader.<br /><br />Then I grew up waiting for the Prequels where Lucas actually wanted to do a real movie, where the characters went through trauma and actually looked scarred by events (unlike Leia which got her whole PLANET BLOWN UP and shrugged it off really easy, not to mention kissing her brother and stuff). There was never real character development apart from Vader/Luke and in general the characters didn't react naturally to emotions, but that was partly because THEY WERE POOR ACTORS! The only real actor out there was Sir Alec Guinness and it showed by a mile, but in all fairness, Lucas's Days of Our Lives kinda dialogue for every emotional scene which felt fake and just out of place.<br /><br />So, the Prequels tried to be a much more serious movie which dwells on Politics, Espionage, Revenge and Friendship and after all these years, I still believe the Prequels to be superior to the original Trilogy which only had The Empire Strikes Back as a really outstanding feature and still perhaps the best Star Wars film to date. The only real problem with the Prequels was that Lucas never learned how to write better dialogue and we were stuck with much better actors who were fed awful and cheesy lines.<br /><br />The Force Awakens had just too much to do and did it quite well as a Intro film with its major flaw being just too darn similar to A New Hope. At times even a blatant copy.<br /><br />So now, Disney was faced with a choice, either to continue playing it safe with the next installment or try to take it a step further and actually focus much more on the new characters and their development instead of the ones from the Original Trilogy. For what its worth it worked great for me.<br /><br />I'm not saying The Last Jedi doesn't have flaws like the too many gags, or the way Kylo turned on Luke or the almost entirely RESHOT Casino Planet part (yes, that was really not what was originally planned and you can tell).<br /><br />Where it got things right is first and most of all REAL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND REACTIONS. Luke, Leia, Rey, Poe and Kylo developed into their own characters and it felt a seamless transition. Absolutely loved and support how Luke was portrayed and his line of thought, and that scene with Yoda was a master-stroke! Kylo and Rey or Reylo as the Internet now calls it really makes sense once you think about it and whoever thinks Snoke death was poor really needs to take another look at how the Emperor died in Episode VI. Snoke's absolute faith in his abilities and that all fear him led him to become way too overconfident and Kylo got the better of him at the right moment but producing a line of thought that actually fooled his master, because he wanted to hear exactly that only he didn't know it wasn't about Rey, but HIMSELF.<br /><br />Luke's logic makes sense as he is left alone and knows a Single Jedi, no matter how good he is, can't take on the ENTIRE FIRST ORDER + Snoke and Kylo, even with Rey's help. So he plunged into despair and saw the Jedi for what they really are, an interpretation of how the Force should work and a selfish one indeed. Having been betrayed by his teachings and pupils Luke lost hope as he knew there was nothing he could do. But he saw how he could still be useful and most of all inspirational! The entire First Order + Rebels SAW that Luke Skywalker couldn't be killed by Blasters, Robots, Tanks and Kyle himself, that alone was worth far more to the rebellion than him actually raising his lightsaber and charging against them. In general, if you think about it, Luke is and has always been a pacifist.<br /><br />The bottom line is that, Die-Hard fans don't care about the new characters! They just want Han, Luke and Leia to ride into the sunset together with the new cast just there to play second fiddle and get passed the torch in the end, but was just too predictable, childish and not taking the franchise forward. Rian Johnson saw past that and actually did. I know you may not like it, but I do and I am also a Huge Star Wars fan, so some of us, wanted something else, and Rian did great.<br /><br />I am not thrilled to see J.J. directing the last installment because this means Disney is probably playing it safe now and we are back in fairy tale land, but I am still holding on to the hope that the final installment can make Poe, Finn, Kylo and Rey as Iconic sa Luke, Leia, Han and Vader were in the OT."
387,2,Is this a joke?,"What is this?! The special effects and the CGI were good, probably because of the high budget, but the rest?? The story is so lame, the characters are boring, and Luke Skywalker? What happened to the main character of Star Wars? I can't believe what they did to my childhood hero... he's now an old man that doesn't care about anything..."
388,,Rian Should be run out of town tarred and feathered.(spoliers),"When Rian said he did not give a damn what fans wanted and this was his vision, THAT should have given everyone a serious clue that this was going to be the same of the ""reimagined"" Fantastic Four which bombed horribly. BUT since this is Star Wars it will bring in a ton of money because fanboys and idiot viewers are just that lame. It says Star Wars...that is all they need to hear."
389,9,Better Than the Other Two,"I loved this movie the best out of the sequels. It grew the characters in better ways than the TROS in some ways. We also finally got to see and hear Luke! I wish they had done more with him actually training Rey but I loved the twists with Kylo (Ben) and the humor in this film the best. Plus, we can say Leia shot first verses Poe."
390,7,Better than the prequels,Why all the bad reviews ? This was better than the prequels and has a lot of punch.sure it has its ups and downs. Carrie Fisher in one of her last roles. Mark Hamill as a aged Luke skywalker and some very colorful characters.The special effects are very good the storyline good. No I don't believe Disney has destroyed the franchise but brought new lif to it. I did not like the prequels at all they lacked the excitement of the originals. Hey I even liked the solo movie go figure.Im hoping the next one which is rumored to be the last(?)<br /><br />Comes out in December 2019 is better than we can expect.And May the force be with us.7 out of 10
391,10,The best star wars movie to date,"I am a die hard star wars fan and I came into this movie with somewhat low expectations. I never thought I would see a star wars movie that I would enjoy as much as the movies in the original trilogy. I was wrong. This movie has it all for star wars fans. Incredible performances by the old crew (especially Mark Hamil). It had intense fight scenes, suspenseful moments, great story, and overall it was a different kind of star wars movie. I guess that it is why I see so many negative reviews about it. Yes it doesn't ""feel"" like one of the original movies and there never will be another movie like that. To me it seems that people can not get over this fact. This movie was something different, something better. And I hope that future movies will continue this trend of being bold and trying something new."
392,7,The Force Is NOT Strong With This Movie,"The reason for my title is this. I saw the film with my Dad on Friday and I have to admit I liked it. I thought it was an okay film for what it was. The reason I said this is because I liked the Force Awakens a lot better than Jedi because at least their was a story there. The Last Jedi was basically the same rehashing of the same Star Wars plot the Empire is trying to take over and the Resistance is trying to stop them. That's it. That's basically the film. And no that's not a spoiler because I don't do spoilers.<br /><br /> What I liked about The Last Jedi I loved Rey and her journey to find Luke and trying to find out who she is and learning the Jedi arts. I loved BB8 he was basically doing everything in this film from piloting the airplane, helping take down some guards or helping out anyway that he can for the Resistance against the Empire. I did enjoy seeing Luke even though he was asking like he was an manic depressive disorders douche to Rey but that sort of reminded me of when Yoda treated Luke that way in Empire Strikes Back which was cool but sort of mean to be honest. I did enjoy seeing Carrie Fisher in her last role as Princess excuse me General Leia BUT to be honest she didn't really do much in the film but whatever at least they didn't cut her out because she passed on but I do have an issue that I'll get into in my dislike part of the review. <br /><br /> What I disliked about the film which isn't much BUT the major thing I'm disappointed with and it's really not a spoiler BUT the way they honored Carrie Fisher's memory at the end of the film. They didn't do anything! They just said in loving memory of our princess....that's it. Of course her role in the film was a bit weird as well which I can't say because I don't want to give away anything but I found it weird the way they kept her in the film. <br /><br />Other dislikes where maybe the so called training of Rey which didn't live up to the hype and that's all I'll say. Kylo Ren was a bit lame in this film at least in Force he was interesting in Jedi he was just an emo kid on a bad acid trip but I did like the lightsabor battle with Rey that was pretty cool so I guess that would go in my like part of this review. I did not care for that Asian chick Rose she was a bit annoying with Finn. One more she hates him and then she somehow loves him it's like pick an emotion girl. <br /><br /> Should you see this film? Well I mean if you're a Star Wars fan you're going to see this film and possibly love or hate it. Will I buy this film on Blu-ray probably so to add to my Star Wars collection. If I were you I would wait until a few weeks to watch Star Wars because it was a bit crowded when me and my Dad went to the theater but that's normal for any Star Wars film."
393,10,No one's ever really gone.,"'The Force Awakens' was Han Solo's final victory lap, and it is Luke Skywalker who takes center stage in 'The Last Jedi.' Mark Hamill gives the best performance of his career as a down-and-out Luke who, reluctantly inspired by a young pupil, re-discovers his heroic core."
394,6,"Not as bad as some of these people say, here's my take on the movie...","The newest installment in the Star Wars series has critics and a portion of the fans divided. While, I can't say The Last Jedi is without its problems, overall I did enjoy it and consider it to be an improvement over The Force Awakens. In some ways The Last Jedi is predictable and rips off The Empire Strikes back, but director/writer Rian Johnson took some left turns and added some plot twists that made it interesting. I thought Mark Hammill gave a excellent performance as Luke with this new take on the character. The film looks great and is fairly on point with action and special f/x. The characters are beefed up are and there are more layers to them and the cast did a fairly good job. The creature/critters are there for little kids that like that crap, but are mostly in the background and did'nt bother me too much. On the downside, the story could use some tightening up. The film also is too long and could have edited some of this stuff out to make it flow better as a whole. Some scenes and humor go way past ridiculous as well. The Last Jedi is a kind of mix of highbrow and lowbrow elements that does not always work and won't please everyone, but it is far from being a bad film and at the very least entertaining and not completely predictable. It also must be noted that movie productions with gigantic budgets have a lot of people's hands in the creative side of this, with studio executives, producers,etc that go out of their way to try to make this appeal to as much of a wide audience as possible, so some of those problems are probably a product of that of what elements to throw in/take out. It is doubtful that on a big studio production like this how much creative control Rian Johnson really had or how much material made its way in to generate money and appeal to the lowest common denomenator. As of this moment, I found this to be interesting and enjoyable, how well this holds up, time will tell in the years to come."
395,2,So I watched this movie a second time and it gets worse every time,"I am literally amazed at all the idiotic things I discover in this movie. Oh my God this movie is stupid and makes no sense. Why has this movie series been cursed like this? They took a massive dump on Luke Skywalker's character but oh my god.... oh my god... just horrendous.... I am seriously consider not watching any of the new movies anymore... The force awakens took Leia and Han's story and threw it in the toilet, then took Han Solo and threw him in the toilet, from the commander of the rebellion transforming him into a lowlife... now this movie finishes the job by taking Luke's character and completely destroying him... they even take Yoda and take a massive dump on him as well... this movie is just.... Christ allmighty...."
396,10,"AT THIS POINT, IT HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL RIGHT NOW!!!","This Movie Was So Good. It follows on from Rey finding out that she can Wield The Force and Expands on it by her seeking Luke's Guidance so that she can Develop in the Force, She also wants to recruit Luke to the Resistance."
397,7,A Very Entertaining and Exciting Action Sequel,"After the return of the magical Star Wars action in The Force Awakens, Rian Johnson attempts to create an addition to the new trilogy, victoriously delivering what Star Wars fans want the most. In fact, The Last Jedi is easily so much better than The Force Awakens and majority of the previous Star Wars movies. It paces well with its runtime."
398,2,This is not the star wars i love 👎,O boy where do i start : the good part real star wars feel is to me in the last part of the film. The rest is full of holes and the character of all luke is now obiwan. they just fade away his story from the original trilogy😱 I hope so they remake make this film like they do with the old ones👎 It diserves better
399,,STAR WARS: Is it no longer for my generation?,I'm 49 years old. STAR WARS was the first movie that I ever saw as a child. My mom and dad took my brother and I to the drive-in to see it. That year for Christmas I got a STAR WARS bed spread for my room. I've been a true fan for literally as long as I can remember. 
400,8,ian Johnson creates a powerful and immersive analysis of the mythological Force and gives Luke Skywalker an epic and touching conclusion,"""The Last Jedi"" respects the place and the importance of the series in the same measure that it understands the need to evolve it. Just as ""The Force Awakens"" has parallels with ""A New Hope"", ""The Last Jedi"" has with ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but far from being a copy."
401,7,Star wars sequels #2: the last jedi,"Is this a good sequel? Yes, is it a good movie? Yes, is it anywhere close to a masterpiece or even my favorite star wars? NO, the emotion is there, but the story is all over the place, I liked the way they did Luke, but I would say the biggest problem with this movie is that it feels like it goes on forever. The run time is 2h 32m, which is the longest of any star wars film (sure, avengers endgame was 3h long, but it made sense because of how much was going on and needed to happen) so yeah, I would say the pacing was the biggest problem with the film, but it's still good."
402,9,The Last IDEJ,This is a movie that has grown on me a lot. At first I hated it as much as the other people . But after repeated viewings and a lot of thinking I actually appreciate what Johnson tried to do. It could have been better but it is not bad
403,6,Two decent action movies sandwiching dull dull dull,"I think the Star Wars franchise moves closer to the edge of irrelevance with each entry, starting with (in the order actually made) Attack of the Clones and proceeding onward. The first portion of this movie mildly engaged me, the much too long middle portion with Luke and the girl was Star Wars at its meandering, grade school arbitrary philosophical worse, then the action kicked back in and saved my 12 year old from leaving the theater (by a hair). Ridley is attractive and effective, Driver presents fine as the young evil force, but the explanation (if there is one) as to why he went bad is even less convincing than for Anakin Skywalker, and for this to actually work that has to be done better. Star Wars was always light on believable plots or characters, more in the mode of this person is this way and that person is that way, this happens and don't ask anymore questions. No one else does much for me and the graphics are less effective than in the last movie. Add to all that, there was an intervening Star Wars movie which probably wiped the vestigial memory of Star Wars 7 from any normal person's brain, and this is more bust than blockbuster."
404,9,The Dark Knight of The Star Wars Saga 🦇,"Yes, it's that good good! Rian Johnson and Christopher Nolan are both good Directors, and TDK and TLJ are both masterpieces! Of course, Nolan's masterpiece is better, but both are still good movies so it's a fair comparison. What these movies have in common is that they are both darker sequels, and the protagonists are facing very difficult tasks of what it means to be a hero. They're not just movies about heroes saving the day, it's actually much darker and more complicated than that, but that's what makes both of these movies so good. The Dark Knight aged like fine wine, and The Last Jedi will do the same."
405,7,Much better story than the other two.,Rain Johnson can write a surprising story and people of complicated characters.
406,1,Fooled me again!,So much potential. Wasted.
407,9,A star wars 5/6 in one movie,"This film is the echo of one of the best star wars, the empire strikes back. <br /><br />but also some parts of the 6 <br /><br />There is the classic two stories in same time. With a space and scum/rebel story and the most important one, the force with the major characters."
408,6,"Rey is hot, Leia turned into Magneto, and was it me, or is this another redux of EMPIRE\ ROTJ?","Hollywood has not been able to come up with a fresh new idea for a script of any kind of fantasy in a long long time, as in a galaxy so far far away. This one proves it. It Wasn't a bad movie, but it was seen before in other movies. Rey is super hot in the movie, without her it dies. Luke was made into a, ""I'm getting to old for this blank."" Also half of the plots fell flat or left empty. There was also this wasted half and hour of getting the code breaker to take down the shields of another Dread Naught? What the? What about Leia turning into Magneto\Mary Poppins in outer space? What the? I swear someone must have been drinking something when this movie was being made. So here is my question, who is Snoke anyway? Is Rey going to be Kylo Rens girlfriend or what? Man, I wish Star Wars would go back and start over and create a Qui Jon Jin and Obi one kenobi movie before episode I. Or some Kinghts of the old republic movie, or go into the Clone wars with Anakin and Obi one kenobi, I would love to see more on Gen. Grevious and Count Dooku. The beginning of episode III was spot on in my opinion, not so much afterwards, but you know, whatever...Disney please for the sake of the franchise, just hire me for a creation of a really good movie to be made. There is hundreds of plots that I could come up with to make Star Wars incredible again if i was given time to think about it. Otherwise you have yourself another Mummy type movies is all, great fun but not a whole lot to them."
409,2,An Honest Review,"Some of the praise, at least from the fans is because of the deviation from Star Wars tradition which, honestly, I have an issue with out the door. We are watching it because we want to see a Star Wars film."
410,,Not good,Worse than the prequels. They destroyed the Skywalker legacy. So sad how this turned out.
411,8,Not bad at all,Fan boys here rate it a 1 but i think a 7.5 is about right. Overall score is i see a 7.5 so glad the little fanboys lost out. Certainly worth watching!
412,6,More wars,"But some only cared about the new ""species"" that got introduced here. But worry not, they are not the new Ewoks. No the Porgs may be displayed a lot in this movie, but they still are just there to have a new toy to seel. If you think this is cynical, you are very gullible. You think anything being made for a big budget movie is not being slated for mass production? Of course kids need toys, so you could try to see it as a win/win."
413,10,One of the most misunderstood movies,Let me preface this by saying that I am basing my review on what could have been if The Last Jedi was not retconned in Rise of Skywalker. Here are some of the things that left me on the edge of my seat by the end of the movie:
414,7,Something new that got destroyed by toxic fans,"I reccently watched the movie again after 3 years and I have to say that I was really impressed. I had forgotten how good a movie was. Yes, it totally had flaws but was good. So let's go:"
415,9,Can the rebellion survive?,"The Republic has fallen and the First Order are on the ascendance. The latter have caught up with the surviving rebels and managed to track them through hyperspace. There seems to be very little hope; the only tiny chance is if they manage to deactivate the tracking system. To do that Finn and mechanic Rose Tico must rack down a master hacker and then head to the lead First Order ship to deactivate the system. While this is going on Rey has found Luke Skywalker to seek his help... something he seems unwilling to give because of what happened when he tried to train his nephew Kylo Ren, formerly Ben Solo, as a Jedi. Somehow Rey and Kylo seem to be linked leading her to believe that she can bring him back to the light side of the force; it will also bring her to Kylo's master, Snoke."
416,7,A disappointing film that divided the fans,"I grew up with ""Star Wars"", I venerated the original trilogy, I lamented at the sequel trilogy and I was given false hope for the prequel trilogy. ""The Force Awakens"" led the new series with expectations of greater things, knowing that Mark Hamill would reprise his legendary role in the 8th episode. I came in with high amounts of optimism after reading the reviews for ""The Last Jedi"", where critics praised it as one of the best of the franchise, being compared as an equal to the original films."
417,5,hell-bent on dissapointment,"After seeing The Last Jedi at the cinema last December and being somewhat underwhelmed I was stunned to find out yesterday how little replay value this newest installment in the sprawling space saga holds. I literally couldn't make it through that dragging excuse of a story. Everything the rebellion does is either downright stupid or totally in vain or both. It's a long drawn out exercise in failure peppered with too many bits of comic relief and incessant soulsearching. The prequels were lacking in almost every respect, but at least I enjoyed revisiting them from time to time, they were fun, the storyteller's intentions seemed honest. Not so with the sequels, especially The Last Jedi. It's not only downbeat and endlessly meandering but also mean spirited in its attitude towards the source material. It's willfully disappointing viewer's expectations in the crudest and often least original way possible. You start to choke as if Vadder himself was extending his force grip over the audience. It's all so pointless and half-hearted. The rebellion gets decimated to literally a handful people, but it all seems to be fun and games for the characters, even the bad guys, with a lot of naive pep talk about the spark of the resistance thrown in every ten minutes or so. It's like the director undertook to disappoint viewer's expectations so radically, that we the audience end up with nothing but this choking feeling of disappointment. In fact, the narrative strategy forever flip-flops between those failed expectations and the constant lip service that is paid to the loyal fanbase. It's a schizophrenic experience, one that I'm not too keen to repeat because it leaves the distinct impression that a product is being sold here."
418,10,"The best Star Wars movie, so far.","Star Wars: The Last Jedi takes place immediately after the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens(2015). Rey(Daisy Ridley) begins her Jedi training, under the mentoring & guidance of Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill). In the meantime, the Resistance & the First Order come up with plans to get rid of each other, for good. "
419,6,Good Sci-Fi movie... TERRIBLE Star Wars Movie!!!,"If this movie didn't have Star Wars in the title, I would have given it a much higher rating. But it does, and with that comes the history of the movies before it."
420,1,"Every user review is 1 or 2 star, but overall score is 7.2?...","I guarantee you there's some meddling going on in the IMDB scores for Disney's Star Wars movies. Check out the user review scores - the highest I found was 5/10, and 90% were 1 or 2 out of 10. And yet, the cumulative user score is 72%? Yeah, right! Nothing dodgy going on here at all! Disney, stop making utter cash-grab garbage movies, and you won't have to pay IMDB employees to bump up your scores."
421,,How to Kill a Francise,"Kill off your viewers childhood heroes. Push your incorrect and flawed political and social views. Forget character building and a realistic and intriguing story line. Make the most important objective feminism even at the cost of destroying important human values. This is the worst expensive and built up movie I've ever seen destroying a precious franchise. Everyone involved in this trilogy needs to be fired and a serious rethink needs to be done. This franchise has been going downhill since the original trilogy, except for rogue one. This movie threw it off the cliff."
422,10,Suprise,"Not a big fan of Star Wars Saga, actually not a fan at all. The first three movies I like. Movies in 90's (episode 1, 2 and 3) are boring. The force awakens is good so i rated it with 8. But this one I really thought it will be boring as hell. And to me it was really good. I loved this one maybe the most by now. I have not seen yet the final chapter to this saga, but after this one I think it will be a great closing chapter."
423,7,You will like it or hate it. No in between,"Ok so my wife and I watched this one opening day. I will say it is not my favorite Star Wars movie but I appreciated the story. You must go in with an open mind. This is not a story focused on Luke and Leia. This is about Rey, Poe, Finn, and Kylo Ren. You can be a fan of the original and like this one too. BUT if you go into it thinking your theories will come true, you will walk out hating the movie. Just go in with an open mind and all will be well with the force."
424,9,The Last Jedi: An Unexpected Yet Masterful Episode VIII,Rian Johnson's take on the Star Wars franchise is the first Star Wars film since George Lucas's era that actually feels the most personal. 'The Last Jedi' is not only a deconstruction of the saga but rebuilds it together with a 3rd act that is full of hope in the midst of a film that is full of darkness and dire circumstances.
425,6,This isn't the Star Wars film you're looking for,"I like films. Actually, I really like films. I also really like TV and I really like novels. I like drama, action, fantasy, I like low-budget art-house films where nothing happens, I like gore-fests and I like psychological horror."
426,9,Bringing the Star Wars back on the table,"I have seen the whole SAGA throughout my childhood. I was there with you guys and girls, we were all there, we all love Star Wars for the same and some individual reasons, but overall we all know what Star Wars is about and what makes it Star Wars."
427,6,How much did Disney pay you for your ratings?,"I can't believe this movie rated so well. It was yet another re-hash of what's been done before with weak character development, poor acting, pointless love story. Far from the best star wars movie since the original trilogy."
428,1,The prequels were bad but this. . .,I did not think these can get any worse. But whomever greenlit the story and script should not work in the movies ever again. 
429,8,"""Your just a bug in the system""",After I saw The Force Awakens back in 2015 I honestly thought the rest of the series was just going to be a cut and paste of the original trilogy but The Last Jedi proved me wrong by upping the stakes and giving the perfect mix of a slow build up to the story then hitting hard with the action keeping the tension high while not lacking story and narrative which is hard to do when people are complaining there's not enough action or that there's to much of it.
430,7,I liked it and I don't feel guilty about it,"No it's not as good as any of the movies from the original Trilogy , so what ? This can't be any good ? I don't understand why so many people seem to hate it . It was entertaining , it had a good plot ...."
431,3,spoiled franchise,Spoiler alert:<br /><br />episode 7 is the same as episode 4
432,,Could have been so much better,"I finally watched this movie last night after months of hearing and reading mixed reviews online and in real life. I watched the entire saga this summer so I could better judge this movie. I am sad to say that this is my least favourite movie in the Star Wars franchise (note: I haven't seen Solo yet). I was bored and found myself looking at the clock throughout the movie. My issues with the movie have already been touched by so many other reviewers here. I think it would have been much more interesting to have the Empir...sorry, I mean ""First Order"" rise to power in Ep 7, take over in Ep 8, and be defeated (or something) by the rebelli...sorry, ""resistance"" in Ep 9. "
433,9,They got it absolutely spot on with this one,"The 'Star Wars' series has always been a funny one for me. I find them passable entertainment when I watch them and then barely think about them again until the next one comes along. Most people it seems like to obsess over them for days, weeks, months, and even years after they come out. And that's great when you care about a film series enough to do that. That's certainly not me though. "
434,7,After the fanboy rage died down I almost laughed... this was actually very clever...,"After coming out of the theatre I was more than willing to rant and rave and agree with all the haters... but on the walk home I came to a starling conclusion. This movie is not Empire, it is not a New Hope as the last one was similar to it represents the point where something we have all grown up with and lived with for so long... has changed... and BOY did we hate them for it."
435,8,The split in the series,"This movie pretty much split the fans, some saying that it ruined Star Wars, others saying that it saved it. For me, it was simply the next installment in the same awesome series, and I enjoyed it. But this movie suffered from a lot of stuff in the middle where it was just the rebels running away from the First Order, a lot of relationship development between Rey and Kylo, and a ton of exposition from Luke. Strangely enough, I don't remember people complaining about pretty much this same thing happening in Empire. You can't praise one while criticizing the other for the same thing. But unlike Empire, it had more action sequences and plot points in the middle of all this so there wouldn't be such long stretches of data dumping."
436,6,An ultimate lack of knowledge in what Star Wars is by Disney,"Number of reasons:<br /><br />The ""Marvel"" jokes, horribly timed and unnecessary. (only joke that felt like Star Wars was Leia asking 3PO to wipe the nervous expression of his face)<br /><br />Changing the rules and ruining most of what The Force Awakens had setup.<br /><br />Completely changing the character of Luke."
437,10,Underrated,"I personally loved it. It was very well-made, looked super real, had great dialogue, and contained lots of great scenes. No movie will ever please some of these star wars fans, they overlook the amazing parts of the movies and whine about the nitpicky things until they end up hating the movie."
438,6,Debated a 6 or 7,I was so hyped with this movie and the end result is just good. Some parts drag a just a little and this type of story has been told before but at the end of the day there is some cool ideas and action scenes presented in this movie.
439,4,"Simple reasons why this was a failure, which no one can dispute.","Sadly, the anticipation for this film was not rewarded in the least... Others have already written detailed reviews, so I will simply focus on 2 specific reasons, which made the film a failure:"
440,9,A Fitting Sequel,"If you like Star Wars, you'll really like The Last Jedi. If you don't, you won't. It doesn't do anything to bring new fans into the fold, but it does reward the faithful with some of the most masterfully acted performances in Star Wars history, at least in film. "
441,7,The best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back,"Say what you will about George Lucas and the way he took the Star Wars franchise dangerously close to laughing stock territory with the prequels, but he was certainly a man with a plan. The original trilogy told a satisfying story, but Lucas always knew what came before, and what would come after. As stilted as the prequels were, they never faltered in telling the story that The Phantom Menace had mapped out. When the rights to the franchise were sold to Disney in 2012, Lucas passed on his ideas of an all-new trilogy, set after the events of Return of the Jedi and bringing in characters both old and new. Although elements from these early drafts made their way into J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens in 2015, it became clear that Disney had their own ideas, which are, as Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi would suggest, to make it up as they go along."
442,5,Porgs are cool. The Last Jedi is not.,Be aware - spoilers ahead.
443,,Who Directed this?,"A film student still at school?? Honestly, and I am not just saying that because all the women in this film were designed to repel male audience members, even if the directing was good the actors and actresses are so untalented that it would not have rescued this monkey."
444,8,This flick tries to answer the flaming question . . .,". . . ""Do holograms dream of shimmering sheep?"" After surviving Mr. Ren's twenty-one hundred gun salute, Luke Skywalker's astral projection seems pretty stumped about what to do for its next trick. Blow up a Death Star? No, that would fill Hyperspace with too much needless debris. Take over the wheel of the Millennium Falcon from Han Solo's icy grip? No, again, the chicks have beaten him to that assignment (though it could plausibly pass as a Wookie now to sit in the copilot's seat). Just hang out and chill with Yoda? Wrong again that would be. It's as if Dorothy has returned to Oz, only to find that the Cowardly Lion has died from old age, the Tinman has one foot in his grave, and the Scarecrow's coming down with Alzheimer's. Sounds pretty grim, Huh? Maybe the Disney folks can find a way to monetize Youth. With Today's CGI, why can't they hire fresh young blood to say the 5,132 different words making up 99% of all movie scripts while performing the 78 basic Screen Movements and 41 possible facial expressions in front of a green screen? Then, by copyrighting these exclusive and versatile young talents forever, they'll have stars just as durably ageless and incorruptible as Steamboat Willie (aka, ""Mickey Mouse"")."
445,7,"A Suprise to be Sure, but a Welcome One",Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.
446,8,Better on second viewing!,"I saw this in the theatre, and was slightly disappointed. I never felt the goosebumps or magic that I normally feel watching Star Wars movies. I think I was tired or distracted or something, because watching it at home I enjoyed it much more. The effects are amazing, as is the music. The story is good with some holes, but mostly good. I didn't love everything, but there were a lot of great moments and surprises, and I did get chills the second time. I'm excited to see where the next one goes. Overall, not as good as the originals, but better than the prequels. The Force Awakens was better, but I'm ok with that-I always thought A New Hope was better than The Empire Strikes Back as well."
447,6,maybe not for all star wars fans,"I didn't like The Force Awakens, I thought it was lazy, predictable and badly thought out. And I didn't think Rouge one wasn't any better. "
448,8,"Very uneven in quality, but has some of the best moments yet seen in the franchise","We have had the newest Star Wars films for a few weeks now and it has become abundantly clear that this is the great divider of the whole saga. Some people absolutely love it, some despise it unlike anything else - including Jar Jar."
449,7,"Don't let the ""helpful"" reviews dissuade you!","With The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson tried and succeeded to do something different. It's such a shame that all the sad, angry nerds out there that wanted their safe fantasy movie didn't get what they wanted. Boo hoo. This movie was not, by any means, the worst Star Wars movie evarrrr. Oh, you didn't like that Rey's parents were nobodies? You wanted to know where Snoke came from? You wanted Luke to train Rey like Yoda taught him? Well, too bad. Take your impotent butthurt somewhere else. This film had its issues, such as the humor being a bit too silly and broad (more Farce than Force, as it were), even for a historically silly fantasy franchise, but it was enjoyable and visually stunning. I particularly like how several characters took advantage of what they knew of the temperaments of those around them to further their various goals. Kylo fools Snoke, Luke fools Kylo. I also like how Finn and Poe basically fail at almost everything they try, and it is the women around them (Leia, Rey, Rose, and especially Holdo) that get stuff done. So don't believe the cadre of idiots circle-jerking the reviews here until only the 1-star ones show up. Give it a shot. You'll probably like it."
450,1,The Truth Is Right In Front Of Us,Star Wars fans should burst into LucasFilm/Disney headquarters and expose the sith that have taken over and control that studio. I guarantee that the offices will be exposed as the den of the sith from where they have corrupted and destroyed Star Wars from within.
451,10,It's pretty perfect,"This movie opens up with an awesome action scene that perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film. I remember a review saying that this was the funniest ""Star Wars"" movie ever. I'd have to agree. It's funny how a lot of films that work great as serious movies have great funny moments too. They're intentionally funny. This movie actually does not pick up exactly where the previous one left off. "
452,6,Independent from it's Predecessor in All the Wrong Ways,"This movie was one I found to be a convoluted mess of a film. Not only did it fail to follow up on the unexplained portions of the first film, it also had pointless and unfinished subplots that did nothing to move the story forward or develop the characters in a meaningful way. All pointless"
453,2,The spoilers and trailers great editing... it really fooled me!,"From the start I loved the original trilogy, 'New Hope, Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi"". only Rogue One which I thought was good cemented the new and old together."
454,,The force is not strong with this one,"Where does one begin to review Star Wars: the last Jedi? Having sat eagerly awaiting the next installment of a Franchise I'd grown up with and enjoyed, (at least the original 3 movies and most of the Force Awakens at any rate) finally seated in a gloomy cinema watching as the opening scroll so familiar traversed across the darkened screen ended my enthusiasm for a movie that was so poorly written to be almost infantile in its execution. That may seem like a harsh criticism but allow me to explain: "
455,9,"Deep, inteligent, thought provoking, no wonder so many don't like it","Once again, I go against my own rule and write a review for a movie with over 1000 reviews as of now (over 2000 says the number oa the bottom). I'm writing it because I've got a bone to pick with many Star Wars funs, and I already know this review will be disliked from here to eternity by most of you, but I believe in speaking my own opinion as is. I believe in explaining my own opinion to the best of my ability and that's what I'll do."
456,7,A very good Episode Five-prime,"The Empire Strikes Back was a well-done bridge between the original film and Return of the Jedi. Likewise, The Last Jedi occupies the same ground within the third trilogy."
457,8,I can't complain with The Last Jedi.,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is not that bad once you get use to the action and humor at the same time. I enjoy it pretty well, but what happen is the lightsaber duel, it did not deliver the clash and bash. The humor in the film didn't bothered me at all, because the humor is almost like the same as the Force Awakens, in a different way, but what really bothered me, is the lightsaber duel. It never delivered, and here I thought Rian Johnson would deliver the lightsaber duel like I thought it would, and everybody thought about it too. But no! Now Star Wars: The Last Jedi, May have flopped at the box office, but at least it's not better than the Force Awakens. I hope J.J. Abrams directs another Star Wars movie instead of Rian Johnson."
458,6,The lost Jedi...,I'd like to preface this by stating that this is the first of the numbered SW films that I did not see in the theater. 
459,10,The best since Empire Strikes Back,Rian Johnson I salute you. This movie created so much potential for the story. The fact that this potential was ultimately ignored or negligently handled in the garbage that followed it shouldn't detract from the achievement here. A masterclass in movie making.
460,6,"A disappointing, but still acceptable sequel in a series trying to find its roots","Director Rian Johnson's Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is easily the grandest and epic film to have come out in 2017. It boasts a balanced cast of series veterans and newcomers along with outstanding production quality. However, what was supposed to be the Empire Strikes Back for the new trilogy has come up short in key areas such as an exciting plot and engaging characters that limit the film from being anything above average. "
461,1,Done with it,"Star Wars franchise is dead to me now. Rian Johnson killed it, Disney killed it."
462,10,A Star Wars Review,"Also, the fight scene where they fight each other the guards Rey and ren fight each other ren assassinates the dude. Awesome. And the sleeping giant hyperspace-kamikazi yea... We did wanna see that"
463,6,"The filming was awesome, but the plot a disaster","The jokes are ruining some good quality scenes. They seem like taken from a comedy show or from a marvel movie and then randomly put in this universe. And don't get me started with the plot holes, the story just doesn't make any sense. The exchange of liders in the rebellion is just absurd. I don't know, there are so many bad things about this but at the same time I loved to get another Star wars movie so I can at least enjoy the effort put in the environment, the battels, the creatures and the Fighting scenes i missed so much. If you watch it, don't expect too much and just enjoy the way it is filmed."
464,3,I Know How Disney Can Save Face,"After this galactic turkey I know how Disney can save face. In Episode IX (which we will stream for free instead of paying a cent to Disney) Luke wakes up from a bad dream in a sweat. He is waking up from a nightmare and look around. He looks around for a cup of jasmine tea. The emo kid, chubby Asian and mary sue were just dreams. A dark side vision to torment him. In reality they do not exist however. Now back to hope, integrity, action, story and STAR WARS!!"
465,,What Was This???,"Politically right-wing capitalist need to make money money money, socially inept piece of capitalistic garbage! It was riddled with Asian love interests and men not understanding anything (hey, I am a man and I still do not understand how Mary Poppins survived the void). Being a Star Wars fan now is a embarrassing as wearing those made in China MAGA caps."
466,8,Basically a remake of the original,"This film, more than others, felt like a remake. With a plot that on the surface looks different, but still the same underneath, just with a new batch of heroes and villains. With random elements (that is out of place though very cute aka porg), it's really just more of the same."
467,6,"Liked it, didn't love it.","I admire Rian Johnson for basically saying ""F#ck You!"" to the Star Wars fandom and its expectations while introducing some fresh new concepts that test the characters' ethics and morals, but the final product is an unfocused film and story (that doesn't really go anywhere) with too many sideplots, characters (spewing out cheesy dialogue *cough* Rose *cough*) and a horrendous last act. Loved the ideas and intentions behind the film more than its execution, but overall the good far outwheigh the bad for me (a light 7/10)."
468,10,a seed is sown in the force as a fallen legends a to z in the force finds new light sparking the resistance but a darkness is rising more powerful than ever,"Director Rian Johnson (Looper) sets the controls for surprises and shocks in The Last Jedi,<br /><br /> putting the characters through the existential ringer like no filmmaker before him.<br /><br />There are times when the wow factor and compelling be.hat said, the double whammy <br /><br />of an ending more than makes up for paunchiness elsewhere<br /><br />This film continues on from the force awakens rey seeking the find out how powerful she is or does luke really wants to be left <br /><br />alone with his porgs.

469,6,Good if you don't think about it.....otherwise disappointing,The Critics scores before this movie was released gave everyone very high expectations. It seemed this was going to be the best Star Wars of them all! 
470,10,Good movie,"There are so many people who are mad about absolutely nothing on this page, and it's ridiculous. The Last Jedi is, in my opinion, the best installment of the entire series. Was it perfect? Close, but no cigar."
471,7,Not the franchise film you're looking for.,"When The Last Jedi first came out I, like many, had... opinions on it. Despite any initial thoughts I had however, I decided to hold off on cementing them until the conclusion of the trilogy, since it is only a piece of a whole after all. Now, having recently seen ""The Rise of Skywalker"" and the end of this saga, I can confirm that... Disney, and Rian Johnson to a lesser extent, botched it."
472,3,Not easy to ruin Star Wars but seems did it.,"Almost fell asleep at the end not knowing when the movie will end or how it's going to end. There's a lot of twists in every outcome. The original plan was to get the Codebreaker, without even making eyecontact they get locked up, and team up with a new dude who turns out to be a fraud, like Disney who only cares about ""business"". There were some extraordinary scenes and landscapes, but too much twists as people don't know what's a Jedi anymore, they're all illusionists."
473,10,The Last Jedi Goes in a Different Direction With a Focus on Character Development and Shocking Plot Twists,"The beginning of Disney's Star Wars universe was marred by controversy and criticism. I really loved the Force Awakens but I don't feel the need to argue about it or challenge people on their opposite opinion. Its not perfect (just as this movie isn't) but I dug it anyway. Rogue One was also really good and as much as there is so much debate around these movies, I was still excited for this. Rian Johnson is a respected filmmaker and although I'm a little mixed of his filmography, I wanted to give him a shot. "
474,7,The Only Good Star Wars film in the Disney Era,"Rian Johnson gets a lot of hate, but he did something that hasn't been done since George Lucas had the realm of the franchise, try to make something different. Sure, it has similarities to other films in the franchise. However, Rian didn't play it safe. He tried to make a film that wasn't a carbon copy of the films that came before it. The Last Jedi wasn't about fan service, it was about taking the movies forward and in a lot of unexpected ways. I think this was a brilliant move. The other two installments are nothing but fan service with mindless action and incoherent story. This movie had everything that makes a good Star Wars film. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars is that the Canto Bight scene seems so unnecessary and derails the films momentum. I actually skip it and don't miss anything from it. Overall a great movie. Better than the other rubbish Lucasfilm has pushed out since joining the Disney family."
475,3,"""It's time for the Jedi, and for Star Wars... to end.""","The Last Jedi is one giant cinematographic anticlimax. Each sequence had a twist for the sake of a twist. Each time, the chosen twist was always the lesser of the interesting possibilities the resolution could offer. Each scene had a build up that lead to an anticlimax.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />1) Set-Up: Luke gets his blue light saber back. The biggest buildup at the end of The Force Awakens. Two years in the wait to see what Luke is going to do.<br /><br />Anticlimax: Luke throws the light saber away over his head in a slapstick manner.<br /><br />2) Set-up: Is Admiral Holdo a traitor?<br /><br />Anticlimax: Apparently she's not, she just wanted to hide her plan (of saving The Resistance) from everybody without any apparent reason, creating forced conflict.<br /><br />3) Set-up: DJ explains the war economy to Finn and Rose and shows that the weapon dealers sell weapons to both The First Order AND The Resistance.<br /><br />Anticlimax: Finn and Rose ignore it completely and pretend this discussion never happened.<br /><br />4) Set-up: We finally meet Snoke, the new biggest Dark Side villain of the galaxy. Who is he?<br /><br />Anticlimax: He's nobody, Snoke is killed off in the most anticlimactic and convenient way possible; and this in the middle of the movie!<br /><br />5) Set-up: Rey is finally getting the answer of who her parents are.<br /><br />Anticlimax: She is a nobody. Her drunk parents sold her to Unkar Plutt when she was a child. They then died and were buried somewhere on Jakku in a mass grave.<br /><br />6) Set-up: The big climactic build-up of the battle on Crait where Luke walks towards The walkers of The First Order. The music builds and Luke is ready to do some serious force-s***.<br /><br />Anticlimax: Luke was using a projection of himself, Force-broadcasting it from Ahch-To to leave some time for The Resistence to escape. This drained his energy and killed him apparently.<br /><br />The Last Jedi felt like making love to the woman of your dreams, and right before you come she stops you, pushes you away, and tells you to leave for not apparent reason. You are just dumbstruck thinking ""What!?""<br /><br />The Last Jedi is a mix between Return of The Jedi and the prequels. It had the potential of becoming ""something truly special"", but like the prequels, all the decisions that were made were the least interesting and in some cases the most ridicule ones. For example: The whole crowd started to lough in mockery when Superwoman Princess Leia flew through space... Casting A-list actors like Benicio Del Toro for small roles is another example of a weird choices.<br /><br />The rhythm was off. Wen the subplot started about Finn and Rose going to Canto Bight, the movie started to drag. Then, when the Crait battle started, everything was rushed. All the interesting questions The Force Awakens asked were answered in a rush.<br /><br />The Last Jedi is a ridicule movie, a 2h32minutes long awkward an weird cinematographic experience."
476,,2/10 because I gave The Farce Awakens 1/10 (deserved 0/10),"So many plotholes<br /><br />So many inconsistencies with Star Wars' lore<br /><br />No I am not talking about the childish wise cracking of this and other Disney products. I am talking about the sad acting, the addiction of Disney to sequels and Disney's endless Mary Sues that people pay to watch. Give it up now."
477,8,Divided Empire,"Luke trains Rey in the way of the Jedi, meanwhile Kylo Ren has pretty much dismantled the rebellion and has them on the ropes, but Luke has a secret as to why Kylo Ren hates the Jedi. The Last Jedi actually divided my friends, now I actually enjoyed this far more than Force Awakens, I thought it was more ambitious, I thought the idea of Kylo Ren representing neither the Dark Side or the Jedis was intriguing. In fact if I have a complaint is that we didn't learn more on this plot angle, cut out the nonsense in the Vegas planet and gimme that instead. That said my best friend hated it,but my wife loved it, go figure. It seems to cut this way down the middle. I do think Luke Skywalker should've been more mythic, philosophical and more Yoda and less Anakin. That said The Last Jedi's biggest strength are the scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey, I for one found these sequences to contain intrigue as you're not sure if Kylo Ren can turn Rey or if They can turn him. I also find Kylo Ren far more interesting than most of the other characters as he bares a family connection to the original characters and again I would've liked a scene with him and Leia, even in flashback. The fight in the guard room is very impressive and overall the movie's weakest element (Aside from the Vegas planet) is in fact Luke's overall bitterness subplot. I totally get then why many fans hate it, as Luke went from being one of the most idealistic heroes to angry hermit, but overall I liked that they tried something new."
478,7,A Mockery to it's own Nature.,"I was in high hopes after my debate for 'The Force Awakens' that there would be some if not any uplift at all, what we got was a complete shambles and an insult to the world of Star Wars. Rian Johnson didn't care for the fans at all, at least J.J. Abrams tried to some sense."
479,10,The Best Star Wars movie ever made,"Why in my personal opinion, Star Wars: the Last Jedi is my favorite Star Wars movie. Just to be clear, I love Rian Johnson, and what he wanted to do was burn Star Wars to the ground. Not because he hates it, but because he loves it. He loves it so much that he wants to cleanse the garden and allow something fresh and new to grow. The Last Jedi is not concerned about what fans think. It wants to challenge you and make you question what Star Wars is and what it can be. Subverting the tropes of s very predictable franchise, and making it something that stands out, something that people talk about, is so much better than just another Death Star. TROS for me is such a bad misunderstanding of what was supposed to come. This movie laid the groundwork for something completely new, and all J.J. and Chris Terrio could think of, was to have a thousand Death Star super weapons? Really? Rain Johnson should have done Episode IX. But I digress, From its opening scenes, The Last Jedi makes it very clear where it stands - everything you thought this movie was going to be is incorrect. The symbols you hold dear, the symbols that J.J. Abrams held so dear in your stead, are being deliberately stripped of their power. If that shakes you, if that upsets you...well, that's just Rian Johnson preparing you for what's next. Abrams left him with an ellipsis, a ""to be continued"" that felt like a specific path. And Johnson takes a hard left turn into what he wants to do. It's so great, it's so refreshing after The Force Awakens played it so safe. The irony is that Rian Johnson isn't your typical Star Wars fan, he reads the extended universe material, he watches Red Letter Media, and is known for stripping away the tropes of genres and making them fresh and new. I genuinely don't understand why people hate it, to me it's perfection"
480,7,A significant improvement,"We are finally far from the utter blandness and laziness of ""the force awakens"", which was kinda painful to watch at times. This second chapter is definitely more fluent and rich, enjoyable even to me, who knows something about the saga but is far from being an hardcore fan<br /><br />. The visuals are gorgeous, with bright reds and incredible palettes, the battles are epic, even if the story basically revolves around the usual schemes and some parts are weaker than others .I can see something popping out tho, there is a distinct identity that I missed in j.jabrams movie and that I gladly found in here."
481,8,The most divisive film in the saga,"Despite all of the hatred this movie got, I still think it is a standout film."
482,6,It wasn't a bad movie... just a bad Star Wars movie,"I enjoyed bits and pieces of The Last Jedi, but as whole it was lacking in many areas. I felt the plot was a bit half-baked and the direction was at times misguided. For a series so well known for its iconic villains it was baffling to me how at times the villains were portrayed in such a comedic manner. I don't recall Darth Vader ever being involved in a cheap laugh, or for that matter any of the villains in the original trilogy or the prequels. The cheap laughs involving the villains in The Last Jedi really undermined their credibility and left the final movie without a true antagonist. "
483,1,"Oh dear...Star Wars ""the last movie""","Really do not know where to start with this one...<br /><br />I am not a megga star wars fan although I was a fan of the first 3 movies from the 70's & 80's for great story telling, pure escapeism and fabulous entertainent. Sadly there are non of these qualities in star wars ""the last MOVIE."" The story makes no sense & zigs around all over the place. There is no back story about why Luke is living as a hermit on an isolated island. Poor Carrie Fisher (God rest her x) is a faded shadow of her former Princess Leia character as she flies through open space like superwoman & the whole movie is so drowned in the mire of political correctness & feminist virtue signalling it really is cringe worthy! Unfortunatly we live in an age where PC overkill has absolutely ruined most media entertainment, for the sake of the powers that be ""elite"" who still think we must have more liberal globalist propaganda shoved down our necks & so they have now ruined Star Wars too! How has Rey become the most powerfull Jedi with no training? Why is Luke, former hero now reduced to a quivvering space eunuch who tosses his lightsaber over his shoulder? Did Luke meditate himself to death? Look, I am a woman who thinks it's fine & dandy to have heros both male & female but emasculating Skywalker is beyond stupid. I felt like I was watching another character entirely! No wonder Mark Hamil had questions about appearing in this. Men have good & bad qualities & so do us women! I must admit after seeing this great pile of whatever, I will never again pay to see another star wars movie & to be honest I blame Disney. My final question is about the 7.2 rating this movie has on here? Just a quick glance through the reviews shows hundreds of ratings at 3 or less. So what is going on there then? Anyway, no more star wars for me, thank you. What ever happened to making movies that ENTERTAIN? Sadly entertainment has been sacrificed on the high alter of PC by powerfull billionaire liberals a long time ago...in a galaxy, not so far far away!"
484,8,my notes,"Really awesome movie. not as good as the force awakes ans an overall movie but certain elements were even better. was debating between 7 and 8 stars. Decided on 8 because of how well made this movie is. the action in this movie is fantastic. the cinematography is amazing, visually stunning with so many mesmerizing shots. the story was great, and i loved all the directions they took this movie in. great characters, great acting. well done (2 viewings 1/1/20)"
485,6,DIffering opinions,"I always avoid movie reviews before seeing a film and therefore didn't realize how much controversy this film had raised. It seems the Star Wars fans are very split about the quality of the film. I am probably in the minority on here who saw the original films at the cinema. Probably in the majority who found Episodes 1-3 less engrossing than the 4,5 and to a lesser extent 6. Episode 7 was a real return to form and therefore hopes were high for Episode 8 The Last Jedi. "
486,1,Total junk,"This movie not only ignored the interesting questions posed in Force Awakens, it totally spat on characters we have loved for decades. "
487,,The Worst Star Wars Movie Ever Made,This review contains spoilers: 
488,10,The Force in the Balance,"I loved ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"". ""The Last Jedi"" is about redemption. Also Writer and Director Rian Johnson's ""Last Jedi"" redeems this ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Unlike its predecessor ""The Force Awakens"", ""The Last Jedi"" is original narrative and tone, surprising in a great way. Daisy Ridley as Rey and Mark Hamill as her Jedi Master Luke Skywalker are awesome. Johnson eloquently deepens his characters in the story long, long ago in the galaxy far, far away. Adam Driver is welcome strength returning as the Dark Side Force's Kylo Ren. "
489,6,What happens when Star Wars tries to be a Marvel movie,"The story pics up right where Episode 7 leaves off but with a different director. A director who seemed more concerned about corny one liners of the sarcastic tone that felt very Avengers like. The movie starts off with Poe in his little X-wing fighter taking on an entire Imperial fleet. Poe gets into a tit-for-tat with the admiral that may as well have had Poe say ""Dorks say what?"" with the admiral saying ""what?"". Too sophomoric for a Star Wars film."
490,10,"You're right fanboys, it destroys the last Star Wars","For those who absolutely hated the last Force Awakens gibberish by JJ Abrams, this movie borders on a miracle: how can anyone pick up from where so many unlikable, moronic characters have been spawned? Well apparently Rian Johnson, that's who. He turns everyone into an acting genius, with the deepest character development I've seen in ages. Even an unredeemably childish Kylo Ren becomes some kind of grunge rock star. Genius. Johnson even takes on the unbearable cute animal props. It almost seems like Disney told him 'hey we need X,Y,Z in there but you can do whatever you want with the story other than that.' Oh boy, he sure did.<br /><br />It's basically as if the characters woke up and asked themselves what they were doing in this fake universe, and trying to adjust to it as much as they could."

492,10,Will say I did like the different take on the story,It had a lot of great things going on. Especially the rebels evading the alliance best they can. Other worlds and how it seemed hopeless at one time but managed to get away from it after all was said and done. I was satisfied with how it started to how it ended.
493,6,An absolute triumph and among my top 3 Star Wars movies!,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi - What starts out as promising but somewhat unfocused and a bit disjointed affair, quickly turns into an ABSOLUTE TRIUMPH!(not being sarcastic here, I dunno what movie the haters saw..) It obviously isn't perfect and has flaws, but the great stuff far outweighs the few weak moments. See it on the big screen, and may the Force be with you, always! ...Also the reviewer who complains about beloved characters being ruined and keeps talking about someone named ""Leah"" is too damn funny!"
494,2,It's over,Star Wars is over.
495,10,A Star Wars for adults ... Finally!,Thank you Rian for making a Star wars film for Grown ups. I'm glad the franchise has stepped out of the kiddie-widdie realm of shallow fantasy and been reinvented with non-cartoon cutout characters. A breath of needed fresh air.
496,7,Gets It Done,"You will see this out of rote habit or not at all. The good news is that, having largely recapitulated the cinematic clips in the last one, in order to prove that it is SW, there is some reference to other, previously untapped older cinema, such as Three Outlaw Samurai, there are a few visual bits that are very attractive that were novel to me. I particularly liked the Etch-a-sketch battle. Those who have seen the movie will know what I refer to."
497,1,"Awful on first viewing, worse on subsequent watches","By this point, everybody has already torn this film to pieces and said how bad it is, so I don't need to do that. I watched this film in the cinema at midnight on opening day. It was a special showing back-to-back with The Force Awakens. Personally, I loved Force Awakens - yes, it was practically a remake of the first Star Wars movie with another hero who doesn't know who their real parents are escaping from a desolate dustbowl planet to go on an adventure across the universe and blow up a planet-killing spherical weapon. But it was a GOOD homage that introduced more new things than it relied on old. Last Jedi takes all that was good about the preceding movie and flushes it down the toilet. The tone is all wrong. Nothing that happens makes any sense. Watching it back-to-back with The Force Awakens was really, really jarring - the change in tone was so stark it just doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. Not even one-third of the way into it and I was thinking ""this is terrible"". But, I did think that perhaps, like some films, it would improve on second viewing. This is why I am writing this review almost 2 years after that horrific night - because I just watched it again in anticipation of the final installment of this trilogy and it is STILL as bad as I remember, if not worse. It annoys me that, even if they manage to ""fix"" the storyline and deliver a good film to conclude this trilogy, this painful-to-watch installment will remain part of it."
498,,Unfunny Comedy,I am all for interracial relationships... honestly they are a beautiful thing... but this one was so forced and out of nowhere that boggles the mind.<br /><br />Then the coincidences: they happen to have a robot with the.. they happen to be thrown in the same jail as... they happen to have matching speeds...
499,10,Most Grounded and Poignant Star Wars Movie,"First, lots of negativity here guys, damn! Who hurt you? "
500,6,I Guess the Jedi are Truly Dead from a certain Point of View,I am a longtime Fan and for me this is the worst Star Wars movie and the most disappointing! And after seeing Rogue One (which was great) i was expecting a better movie and a lot more answers!<br /><br />Rolling Credits started saying the resistance was already overun by First Order Army Offscreen between Epi 7 and 8! Sadly i wanted to see some of the Fight and in 2h30 hours movie they should include it; Then the movie starts with Poe Dameron being heroic or suicidal teasing Hux or Hugs; 1 minute of the movie saying i want to speak to General Hugs! And Hux replies: This is Hux are you not hearing me? Hugs is what a Teddy Bear? (Hux really acts like a Ted being the most useless and ridiculed villain of all time so Hugs is a good Nick for him)<br /><br />Guess what? Kids on the theatre didnt get the joke!<br /><br />Poe was gaining time to prepare a attack but shouldnt the First Order just shoot on sight a easy target such as 1 Tie-Fighter!?<br /><br />Then Poe Alone starts destroying every Turret in a massive Ship!<br /><br />Reviews criticize the Avengers type of jokes but i personally think those werent exageratted and because the movie as such low pace were a comic relief to what was happening on screen (Han Solo made a lot of one liners and they were the best) so i can escuse this! A lot of scenes in like Epi 7 were rehashed from previous movies; this time scenes from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi!<br /><br />Examples: Beggining of the movie starts with a evacuation like Epi 5 but we dont get to see a lot of it in this movie!<br /><br />Luke training Rey is a copy-paste of Yoda-Luke training in Epi 5: Training with rocks! theres a cave of the Dark Side and even Luke like Yoda before refuses to Train Rey;<br /><br />The scene in the Throne Room between Rey Kylo and Snoke is a direct copy from Return of the Jedi;<br /><br /> Snoke tries to convert Rey and tortures her the same as luke with the Emperor and Rey acts the whole time like Luke (You still have a conflict i can fell it there still good in you)<br /><br />The Problem is that this scene in Epi 6 was the epic Climax Ending and this time is in the Middle of the second movie of a trilogy wtf! Complains: <br /><br />The Movie almost happens all the time in Space with Two Ships Persuing one another and on Lukes Island! I actually liked Canto Bight the Casino World but what a missed opportunity for a Lando Calrissian Cameo (hes a known Gambler) The Scriptwritters didnt answer any questions from Epi 7 in a satisfying way!<br /><br /> This movie as No Climax! There is no Real Lighsaber Fight the action in this movie is really weak and character devellopment is pretty short for everyone!<br /><br /> The FX were on par i even think that Epi 7 had better effects! <br /><br />The Ending of the movie is disapointing with the Battle of Krait being the lamest battle of all Star Wars Franchise!!<br /><br />Key Characters Role:<br /><br />Hux: Is he a General? Both Snoke and Kylo ridicules him in front of his troops when he makes a mistake and Ragdoll him like a Teddy with the force! Glesson is not a good actor at all and being the character a fool doesnt help;<br /><br />Phasma: Why put her for 2 minutes just to die again in a ridicule way? Ok we got to see Gwendoline Eye this time! What a lame villain she is just Cannon Fodder! Talks bla bla fights a few seconds and gets blown up! Disney you got a action figure;<br /><br />Finn: His backstory is interesting; a Renegade Stromtrooper who left the First Order because he doesnt want to be a part of genocide! <br /><br />The problem is instead of having a Badass Character wanting revenge against the First Order we get a comedy character close to Jar Jar Binks! In this movie he is a moron and i didnt found him funny at all! The Canto Bight Trip was entertaining even if it was a Wront Turn in the end; When they enter the First Order Ship with Dj i was expecting for Finn to wear is old Stormtrooper outfit like luke and han did in Epi 4; that would have been really cool;<br /><br />In the end Finn tried to Redeem by Sacrificing himself to save the Resistance in Krait by going Kamikaze against the mini Deathstar Cannon Thingie! But Scriptwritters in the name of Disney Kids ruined the Ending for me! It would have been a dignifying death for Finn and a better ending for this boring Battle; But No he is one of the Good Guys and cannot die! Lets make the Finn and Rose Kiss instead! <br /><br />Also Phasmas battle is almost as big as the scene shown in the trailer; but in the the trailer it has a lot more impact! Im not lying! <br /><br />Rose: A new Character with great moral values and we got a satisfying backstory about her in Canto Bight; Also her sister get a heroic death in the beggining of the movie in that Bomber! The love interest for Finn is kind of forced; so she admires him for being a great Legend (What? For how long i mean? He was in a coma for 2 months maybe?) And she works on maintenance but in the end she is also a Pilot!? <br /><br />Shes the best develloped character and that shows how weak the plot is;<br /><br />Dj: Benicio Del Toro the little time he had on screen showed that he is a great actor! Dj seemed to me the closer we will get to a Han solo character (a scoundrall) His intentions were only to save his own ass but in that scenario that is pretty acceptable; and he says to Finn that being noble leads to nothing! Hope Dj returns in epi 9;<br /><br />Maz Kanata: Loved her in Epi 7 and i thought that in this movie we would learn why she was so Force Wise! But she only appears in a hollogram for 1 minute and yet she shines being a Badass!<br /><br />Poe Dameron: Scriptwriters make Poe the best pilot in the universe even better than Darth Vader ridiculous!! Alone he can take all the First Order fleet for Fools; and contradicts all the leading Woman not obeying any orders! (After Leia the Chain of Command is followed only by women) It just doesnt make any sense is actions; he acts like a crazy strong Jedi but without the superpowers! I have Bb8 on my back and i am fearless! <br /><br />Chewbacca: Besides interaction with Porgs he gives Luke a Hug and thats it; poor Chewii he lost Han and the scriptwritters respect!<br /><br />Yoda: When he appears he looked like a lunatic! But what Yoda said to Luke made perfect sense and he even said lines from the past movies; so i liked him for returning even for just 2 minutes! Yoda CGI was strange;<br /><br />Holdo: Has Pink hair! Says a few motivational words to the crew and Sacrifices herself by throwing the Ship against the Ships of First Order in Lightspeed!? Wtf! If that is possible why dont they throw a few Kamikaze Tie Fighters instead? Also doesnt the ship have auto-pilot? RIP Admiral Ackbar is Dead now the only Male to rule the Resistance! <br /><br />Leia: Shes ok most of the time! But the Scene shes blown into Space is terrible & the CGI is really bad and Leia is not Force Strong enought to do that magic! She started to frozen so it would have made a lot more sense that the Force would create a bubble barrier and kept her in a suspended sleep till someone rescued her; it would have been unrealitic but much more believable!<br /><br />And i dont understand why she lived? They could let her die in this scene in space making it a emmocional scene and it would have been a lot more respectfull for Carrie Fisher; because she past away now they will have to make a Offscreen Death in Epi 9 or make a CGI Leia and i believe that wont work at all!<br /><br />Luke Skywalker: Mark Hamill is the best character and actor in the movie! Hes a Bitter man and feels responsable for the Downfall of the Jedi Temple and the Rise of the First Order & i accept that he went to isolation on a island gave up and closed himself from the force! People hate that Luke throws the lightsaber away! Say it is Offcharacter but in the context of him refusing everything from the past its a logical reaction! The scene with R2D2 (Easter Egg) is very touching and humanizes Luke making him to decide to train Rey! But why didnt Luke go with Rey and help the Resistance and have a Final Clash with Kylo like Ben vs Vader did? That would have been Amazing! Instead we get a Force Projection where we tricks Kylo and avoids him all the time only for the Resistance to escape Krait and by consequence drains Luke Lifeforce and he Dies absorbed by the force like Yoda and Bem! Luke will Return as a Force Ghost in Epi 9 for sure;<br /><br />Rey: We still dont know who she is or where her force powers come from! I Believe that Kylo lied to her and i think she was made how Anakin was made; The Mind Conection with Kilo Ren was weird like platonic atraction and that was strange to me!Because they are Rivals & Kylo killed Han (a Father figure she like) and yet shes ready to forgive Kylo who is a Psychophat Maniac?? Not Believeble and i still dont know what Disney want from this!? And what a great training she got from Luke Lol<br /><br />Snoke: Gets Killed by Kylo Ren in the Middle of the movie Wtf! For me this is a Twist! I think hes still alive and is Darth Plagueis; the momment before his death he was feeling Kylo and Rey thoughts it seemed that he was in perfect control; manouvering Rey like a puppet her force powers and kylos were no match! This was a test for Kylo Loyalty! Because if Snoke really died without any answers of who he really is and where he came from this will be the worst Plot i have ever seen!! Why all the mistery in Epi 7 behind Snoke? Scars cuts & being Tall and Thin all matches Plagueis description and Snoke speech is almost identical for the Emperor lines;<br /><br />Kylo Ren: He didnt learn anything! Proof is Krait were he looses control and orders everyone to shoot Luke and attacks his Projection without any Tactic just Raw anger and blindness! A well trained Jedi with good lightsaber skills would defeat him easy; even the Red Minions in the Throne Room (Maybe Knights of Ren?) were hard to defeat! Hes just a Vader Wannabe with anger management and daddy issues; hes no Leader just a bully with powers! I really prefer him with a Mask on!<br /><br />Overall i give Epi 8 - The Last Jedi a Score of 6. Please Disney listen to the fans and Give us a EPIC ending!<br /><br />PS -I hope AngryBirds will kill all the Porgs in Star Wars
501,9,Very enjoyable!,"Ignore the bad reviews from disgruntled nostalgic fans/others. I saw the 2D version last night and thought this film was both very entertaining and absorbing. I grew up with the original trilogy and Episode IV has always been my favourite. However, 40 years later it's time for Star Wars to move in a new direction for a new generation. Of course we all miss the original characters but It's time to see some new ones too. Good to see nice solid performances with real props once more. Episode VIII is a very enjoyable film and succeeds on many levels. Probably my favourite of the post-original trilogy films."
502,6,I'm Conflicted: A Great AND Bad Movie,"This is a very odd film. It has so much going for it in terms of incredible scenes and ""moments"" while it fails to be a great movie overall. It's strangely disjointed even with the long runtime. I'll explain...."
503,9,Brilliant film!,"I've watched this movie only 3 times. It was never boring, nor terrible during each sitting. I'm not a huge star wars fan either, but in all honesty, I found this movie fun, hilarious, and exciting! I may not be a fan, but I still don't understand the hate towards the last Jedi. IDK if it contradicts previous film entries, or it doesn't stay true to the comics, I have no idea, no do I care. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an excellent film, that I will never get tired of. Deal with it."
504,7,The old man dies. The new is reborn,"A movie full of fan service, incredible scenes, great art direction and technically above the level, but it's also a movie that has its problems, often appearing as a movie of scenes that work well in isolation, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi ""It delights the most loyal fans of the franchise for its"" Ahhhh, that's what I wanted to see ""moments, but in a cooler view, we have script, rhythm and development issues. The script makes the first two acts of the film look like great fillers, because it does not walk, the intention was to develop the character of Rey, which does not happen, we see only 2 acts of discussion, thoughts and training, everything half played and superficial, in the lack of depth of the legendary Luke Skywallker, or in the character of Finn who is wonderful in the first film, with dramas and dualities and here he is played on a cliché secondary mission, with a romantic cliche, following the traditional journey of the hero that adds little in the movie, the only character you notice some development is Kylo Ren, even so, he ends the film still in a certain conflict, we do not feel confident in it. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" is a legitimate half-story film, a movie that will serve as ground for Star Wars episode IX. The highest point of the film is his art direction, which explores a new fauna, and features gorgeous costumes, extra costumes and absurd attention to detail, as well as the classic Star Wars soundtrack, the soundtrack is great and not for a second, dictating for many times the pace of the scene, without fear of open plans or zoom in's, the camera behaves very well, always trying to bring the maximum of wealth to that world that really gives an impression of being alive and the rhythm of the film's assembly of the one compensated in the pessimo rhythm of the script. The performances, which in episode VII are one of the great highlights, here are obsolete and cloying, but stands out for Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver and Carrie Fischer, in addition to the great screen presence of Mark Hamill. Finally, it's a movie that cardboard fans will love, like me, and the movie has very good things outside the direction of art, such as the exploitation of force and all the symbology that is exposed around it, or the bridge of communication that unites the Jedi, or even the clean of the past seeking a renewal for Star Wars, that renewal, which is happening even though it is difficult to detach from the characters of the past, and this movie was where it had to happen part ""boring"", to serve as the basis for what will come. Lastly, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" may even leave a wish, but nonetheless, it's an absurdly exciting and entertaining film."
505,4,"Uninteresting, Lack of Heart","This film was not what I expected to be. So much hype was built around it, that I was excited to watch. When finally watching, I was so dissappointed. I was expecting it to be on par with The Empire Strikes Back, except this was no where near as great. <br /><br />What this film contained was many side plots that were very unnecessary and many awkward moments within the characters. The original characters even lacked the charm they had in the original trilogy.<br /><br />1. The romantic plots? Really? It's just awkward. 2. Kylo trying to pursuade Rey to join him? I felt like I was watching an awkward porno when the step brother tries getting it on with his step sister when Mom and dad aren't around... yeah, no, weird.<br /><br />3. Luke Skywalker is no Ben Kenobi. Ben was a nice old man. Luke is as grumpy as Red Foreman from That 70s Show. <br /><br />Being a Star Wars fan for the last 22 years, I am greatly disappointed. There is no heart, nor great story to this addition of the series. The actors seem bored, and Kylo is just another Anakin Slywalker, whiny.<br /><br />Overall, if you have kids and want to watch a decent action film, go ahead. If not, who cares?As many people have said, Disney has ruined Star Wars and it shows. <br /><br />I give this a 4 because realistically, films aren't 1s, and it's mainly for the original characters and the ending."
506,10,"A New Perspective, But An Unexpected One","The Last Jedi is a fine example of Rian Johnson's skill for subverting expectations. For the last two years, Star Wars fans have been theorising endlessly about the possible origins of certain characters, their true allegiances and their ultimate identity. Meanwhile, Johnson has been forging an entirely different perspective of the franchise we all love - one where his methods as a filmmaker help to elaborate on the lore of Star Wars and the feelings of its characters."
507,7,"Not perfect, but it's by far the most innovative Star Wars film.","The Last Jedi is by far the most controversial film of the Star Wars saga, and not without good reason. Rian Johnson takes the franchise to new heights, pushing the boundaries of what Star Wars represents. Granted, the risks Johnson takes aren't always successful, but when they work, they REALLY work. The Last Jedi is a great film with incredible visuals, an all-star cast, and a ton of good old-fashioned adventure. It's not a perfect film by any stretch, but overall it's an enjoyable film. 7/10"
508,1,That's it. I'm done.,"You've broken my heart too many times SW. It's not me, it's you."
509,,"The sound of millions of fans suddenly crying out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.",This is the only....ONLY Star Wars movie I've ever seen in the theater where the audience didn't cheer at the end. They just got up and walked out in stunned silence.
510,8,Everything everyone says about this movie is right,"I was very curious about Last Jedi due to the weirdly polarized reactions. Some described it as just more of the same, some as brilliantly subversive, some as a betrayal. All of these views are legitimate."
511,6,never ending movie,"Movie started out great, battle sequence was one of the best of the franchise.<br /><br />Then the silly plot line starts with Finn and Rose where they had to go to some planet in search of a code-breaker(DJ) another boring character, the whole purpose of doing this was waste. It was just for setting up an explanation of idea of FORCE that was briefed by Luke(i,e jedi can be anyone/anybody can use the FORCE).<br /><br />Then there is killing of Snoke by Kylo Ren, you never get to know who he was.<br /><br />Rey is just the same, no character development. The FORCE connection between the characters was bit odd. And the movie was too long.<br /><br />Luke and Leia were just fine.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Kylo Ren, General Hux were great.<br /><br />Amazing background score.<br /><br />Great action sequences."
512,10,Even better than the last,(Note: this movie is a 9. I rated the Trilogy as a whole with 10/10)
513,6,Running out of ideas,I watch these new Star Wars films with the full realization that these are just cash grabs. New story lines are just muddled rehashing that lower the overall quality of the franchise. The feminist agenda is also very clear here too and seems to be the only purpose of this latest set of movies. Yet another 100 lb waifish model kicking everyone's butt. Puhleeze.
514,9,One of the best Star Wars movies,"This is a great movie. The parts of Cameo Bight and the codebreaker are not particularly interesting, but otherwise it does pretty well."
515,6,A story it has!,"Not a Star Wars fan. Never payed a penny extra to watch this and never will. Reading other reviews this has a lot of bad reviews, and I can understand why. This part had quite a lot of story in comparison to other Star Wars movies (apart from part 3 perhaps), sometimes even compelling! So more interesting for me instead of the war war war, fights and sabres you would expect. As always a visual fest, but with content this time."
516,1,Please stop making these films,"JJ should have stuck with star trek and stayed away. Film failed on all accounts, acting, directing and especially writing. The story is a rehash of old star wars films."
517,8,"Different, Bold, Refreshing.............at last !","Wow where do you start with this film, there is so much to process and figure after this marathon of a film. This film is certainly surprising and a breath of fresh air for the Star Wars Universe, from my point of view. However I get the feeling this film will be divisive and is definitely not for everybody, this is not your conventional Star Wars film.......at last."
518,7,Godspeed Purple Hair Lady,SCORE: 7.0/10
519,1,Fan have been waiting for since the trailer and look what they got,I m a huge star war fan from the trailer it look promising and exiting to see finally luck back but What just I see is not the star war that I remember when I grow up with this I find this completely opposite .i respect the director vision but it was not the right vision as fan expected
520,,You Think This Is Bad??,"I give this 2/10 because every time you think things cannot get worse they can and they do. look at Donald Trump. Every time you think the idiot cannot push us more towards economic and political abyss, think again! He does."
521,10,Absolutely Superb,"I really don't understand the bad reviews, what were you really expecting? Kylo Ren is mental, Luke's death is dignified and Rey has both the dark and light side of the force, I'm thinking Emperor Palaptine or Obi Wan."
522,7,I honestly liked it,"It is the fact that the presence of the Disney company is clearly felt in the film. It is also a fact that the story has more holes and illogicalities than the previous parts of the franchise and that at times it is over-the-top ridiculous. And it's also the fact that, while watching the movie, I did not pay attention to any of this at all, because I completely enjoyed the entertainment. Only later, when I was browsing reviews on the internet (which almost unanimously rate this movie one or two out of ten), with every argument I read I was rewinding the movie in my head and realizing that the criticism is valid. But even though the things haters wrote about it are accurate, I really liked this movie. If not with the story, with audio-visual experience and even overall atmosphere, ""The Last Jedi"" quite satisfactory respected the legacy and spirit of the franchise. It took it a little time to catch the momentum, but when it really started it kept me at the edge of my seat till the end. Comic reliefs may be too frequent and exaggerated for hard-core fans of the franchise, but, in my opinion, they are quite good and have excellent timing. Yes, they give this movie a bit of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" kind of feeling (Marvel is also Disney), but as I like ""Guardians"" more than original ""Star Wars"", it just made it more enjoyable for me."
523,8,Not dissapointing.,"As star wars movie go it was good, there are and always will be flaws with every star wars movie. The biggest problem is Leia flying through space randomly and the best scene was Luke distracting Kylo Ren. I think people didn't like it because Reys parents were nobody's and Snoke has no back story, but not everything has to connect in one big way it would be stupid and forced if Rey was Luke's granddaughter or if it stopped and said Snoke was Mace Windu."
524,6,What the hell,THIS FILM IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING FILM EVER IT DOES SOME STUFF WELL BUT ALOT OF STUFF IS JUST SO BAD. KYLO REN IS GREAT THE FIGHT WITH HIM AND REY IN SNOKES ROOM IS GREAT I DIDNT EVEN MIND WHAT THEY DID WITH LUKE. BUT FIN AND POE JUST LOST ALL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS FILM WHY DIDNT LAURA DERNS CHARACTER JUST TELL THEM WHAT SHE WAS DOING THERE IS SOME REAL CRINGE MOMENTS IN THIS. The film looks really good though.
525,10,The Stunning Last Jedi,Star Wars: The Force Awakens
526,7,The Force Remains Strong!,"When Disney and Abrams restarted the Star Wars saga in 2015 with Force Awakens, they gave us a delicious, candy-like confection that gave us everything we loved about the space opera: adventure, earnestness, humor, and lots of space action. Now, with venerated filmmaker Johnson at the helm, Last Jedi is something decidedly-less immediately pleasing, though undoubtedly heartier. The nature of good-and-evil, the import of passing-time, the difficulties of truth. Sure, it's not quite revelatory, but it reaches for it...and is plenty of fun along the way."
527,1,Resembled a TV Sitcom,"""Spaceballs"" (1987) meets ""In Your Eyes"" (2014)"
528,9,flawed yet interesting,"This is probably the most hated star wars movie to date it's actually sad to see this much negativity around just this one movie, it's embarrassing because the movie is nowhere near as bad as what they say it is, the movie creates conflicts within us something that i've never witnessed in a star wars movie since the empire strikes back."
529,7,"all over the place, kind of weird, uniquely subversive, heavily controversial","For the first ten minutes of this movie, I was left unamused and mostly disinterested, and prepared myself to regretfully hop on to the more mild mannered back of the 'Last Jedi is trash' (mostly internet) bandwagon, but as the film went on, my opinion totally flipped around. I was entertained and surprised and I fell in love w/the film's strange, messy style. It was so horribly flawed, yes, but that added to the charm. It didn't feel like some kind of cash grab, it felt more like an actual movie made by human hands. And, regardless, it was super fun to watch. And the characters became much more complex and interesting since the last time around. The character dynamics were well fleshed out, various inner conflicts added a certain layer of more impressively thought provoking material that was, to me, very unexpected. I even loved the casino planet material. Although it had no real ""reason"" to be there, I thought it was super entertaining and enjoyable to watch. It is true that a lot of the humor unfortunately falls flat, but I did genuinely laugh a few times during this film (mainly during one great, totally out of the blue sequence featuring a long lost, long loved character I will not name), although sometimes my laughter could have been unintentional oddly enough, but even when this happened I was being entertained. So, even if my opinion is enormously controversial, I refuse to back down from defending this fearlessly bizarre and surprising installment of an over saturated saga that should have ended over 30 years ago, as its originality and ridiculousness and just overall sense of fun (that doesn't really get in the way of its more dramatic material) feel like they practically saved 'Star Wars' from all of the over marketing and the disaster that was 'Rogue One', despite the fact that MANY seem to have expressed an exact opposite opinion!"
530,3,I mean... from where to begin? 3/10,"This must be the worst star wars film ever. Let's take a closer look over this cinematic failure:<br /><br />Luke Skywalker's character being completely ruined.<br /><br />Finn's story arc being pushed aside or not well made, which is disappointing because finn is a really good character.<br /><br />Too many turn points in the film.<br /><br />Characters like rose tico and admiral holdo who weren't fun at all.<br /><br />The whole throne room scene before the fight happened, snoke and rey and kylo talking and stupid stuff happening. Really bad scene.<br /><br />The whole part of rey and kylo ren, first being allies then enemies, then they're fighting each other. Really complicated.<br /><br />If I would have split the movie into parts I would have done it this way:<br /><br />First half was terrible.<br /><br />Second half a bit better.<br /><br />The end - stupid."
531,,Mixed Review,THINGS I DISLIKE
532,8,And again pure 10,"I just saw it once more. This time in full HD. And I love it even more. All those faul critics, they just don't get it, they are simply looking at horizon. They can't see now and here...<br /><br />The movie has all Star Wars elements: drama, adventure, character evolving, bit of action and bit of mystery. Also a lot of homage of original Star Wars trilogy.<br /><br />If you don't see it or don't like, just watch it again, but this time with the clear mind and open eyes. I'm looking forward to next movie."
533,7,An unbalanced sequel,"The Force Awakens brought back Star Wars to the big screen and it did so with style and excitement. However Star Wars: The Last Jedi did not strike as hard on me as I thought the movie in general was unbalanced. To see Mark Hamill again was an amazing treat and he played a weary and wiser Luke Skywalker in a very good way, however sometimes it felt as if perhaps the character was a little too depressed for the storyline and in a way that seemed unfitting the brave and determined Luke that we heard last time in Return of the Jedi in 1994. "
534,8,"Good, but still flawed","So, I enjoyed The Last Jedi. I felt it to be a fresh take on the Star Wars universe. While nowhere near as good as ANH or ESB, as a Star Wars film, there's a lot of good about this movie. But I found more problems with it as a film than I did as a part of the Star Wars franchise."
535,7,"Still not great, but an improvement over Episode 7","This movie had more of a ""Star Wars"" feel than Episode 7 did. By that, I mean it invoked a little more wonder and charm with Star Wars elements rather than solely relying on nostalgia to carry the film."
536,8,"""The Last Jedi"" makes smart, risky choices to break old patterns and bring fresh perspective to ""Star Wars""","""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" reacclimatized fans to a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away by serving paying homage to decades of tradition, reuniting us with old friends and building a foundation for ""the next generation."" This blueprint presented Lucasfilm and ""Episode VIII"" filmmaker Rian Johnson (""Brick,"" ""Looper"") with an opportunity in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" - continue to tread lightly and keep the biggest sci-fi/fantasy franchise of all time close to its roots, or jump to hyperspace in a bold new direction. Well, just as there must be balance to the Force, Johnson finds a balance between these options."
537,7,An Entertaining But Slightly Flawed Sequel,"The highly anticipated eighth episode of ""Star Wars"" is finally here. I can say that this is a solid and generally well-made film, although it has its imperfections and struggles a bit to fit in with the rest of the franchise to a certain degree. The plot picks up almost exactly where ""The Force Awakens"" left off, and chronicles the ongoing battle between the Resistance and the evil First Order."
538,4,The end of the greatest story ever - and not in a good way,"In 2015 we - us 'Star Wars' fanboys - finally got treated to more 'proper' Star Wars (and by 'proper' I mean with characters we actually cared about in a story set after the events of 'Return of the Jedi' rather than prequels or spin-offs). 'The Force Awakens' opened to almost completely positive reviews, most completely overlooking the fact that it was a thinly-disguised reboot of 'A New Hope.' Yes, I too enjoyed it, but never really went as far as to claim it was as good as many were making it out to be."
539,8,"Enjoyable to watch, less so to reflect upon","I actually like this movie. It dared to challenge expectations, it's beautifully directed and the dialogue is the least cringeworthy in the entire series. Plot holes and inconsistencies? Of course... but no more than in any other Star Wars film ever made. Let's face it... the entire series is trashy 1-dimensional pulp."
540,6,An Interesting Turn for Star Wars,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has proved to be a very divisive film for understandable reasons, with the choices Rian Johnson has made for the franchise being very bold and intriguing. In the end I quite enjoyed the film."
541,3,The last disaster !?,This is a movie written by people that don't care or don't know about star wars. Much has been established with the star wars universe during many years but not much in this movie respect this.
542,,Probably the worst Star Wars movie ever!,"I hated it. Although, there are many reasons but the one I would like to point out is lack of character development for Snoke, no backstory and origin and then killing him just like that. Same thing goes for Rey's parents, for two years they were trying to tell us that who are her parents, then we found out they are basically nobodies. Casino scenes were so pointless. Leia flying scenes, wtf was that!? and slapstick humour every 10 minutes...I mean, there is a time and place for funny moments, but even serious scenes are getting ruined by so much jokes. It's like I was watching a parody of Star Wars and I like watching parodies but Star Wars movie should feel like a Star Wars movie, you know like dark and gritty. Overall, the movie in this trilogy felt like 'Attack of the Clones' rather than 'Empire Strikes Back'."
543,8,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER.,"Though some view this as disappointing, the includes some very neat plot twists and action scenes all throughout. I think the movie was good, but it could have been better. The entire casino plotline with Finn and Rose was absolutely pointless and only added more runtime to an already long movie."
544,7,A Good Divisive Film,"I am almost at the end of my Star Wars film reviews and the next film I have watched is Episode 8 The Last Jedi and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Rey attempt to convince Luke Skywalker to teach her the ways of the Jedi, while Kylo Ren & The rest of The First Order attempt to destroy the rest of The Resistance fleet."
545,10,Helps to rewatch,"After having given this movie 6 stars after leaving the theater, I tossed this movie aside as at best mediocre."
546,7,"Not a 'franchise killer', but not the most satisfying movie","I was really disheartened by the reviews by users after having seen the glowing critic reviews of this title. Words like 'franchise killer', 'worse than the prequels' and 'mindnumbingly bad' were being thrown around like wildfire. Avoiding the spoilers was like trying to avoid grass in a field. This review will contain spoilers to back up my statements."
547,10,An Interesting and Different Story in the Star Wars Saga!!!,"I honestly didn't think this was as bad as a lot of the Star Wars nerds are making it out to be. I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan in the world, but I like them. I was entertained, that's all I care about. If the story is interesting, and it has cool battle scenes, then I'll enjoy it. "
548,7,"Better than VII, and 30 minutes too long","Much as we all thought The Final Destination, a/k/a Final Destination 4, would be the last, and final, existential foray into what Death penultimately wants from us, I am sure we all saw the first teaser for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and collectively subconsciously rewatched ""Looper"" and ""Brick"", Rian Johnson's promo-wheels as his audition to rewrite cinema."
549,1,"Bad. Just so, so bad.","Disney brings back Star Wars and we get TFA. Nothing special but not a terrible movie. Next comes Rogue Ond and it was great! Then we are handed this sad excuse of a film. The plot was full of holes, and even without them, the basic premise is just bland and boring. The directions they took with nearly every character were terrible. I didn't mind what they did with Kylo Ren, but all the other choices were awful."
550,8,Better after the sense of anticipation a leaves,"When I first saw the last Jedi, I didn't necessarily like it. I didn't think it was hot garbage like a lot of hurt fanboys think, but I didn't love it."
551,7,"I never liked Star Wars before, BUT I have always liked Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Laura Dern and Benecio del Torro. These great actors make this story enjoyable to watch!","What makes this edition positively enjoyable are OSCAR ISAAC, ADAM DRIVER, LAURA DERN AND BENECIO DEL TORRO."
552,3,The reason why the Prequels are popular again,"As of now, it's been a long time since the Last Jedi came out in cinemas, in such time we've seen the release of the final instalment of the sequels, the end of the magnificent Clone Wars TV show, and the start of the Mandalorian series. We've had time to reflect, slowly accept but mostly reject this film, because if there's ever been a more divisive piece of Star Wars lore, I can't find it."
553,,This can't be real..,This film on its own has completely killed the Star Wars name
554,10,You have to watch it twice,"Don't judge this movie from one viewing. They put a lot of stuff into it - It is just thick with plot, effects, and characters developing. It is just too much going on to take in the first time. It trust me - you will like it more the second time."
555,6,Hollywood mediocrity strikes back...,"...and crushes the new hope that J.J. Abrams gave us with his fresh yet nostalgic take on the franchise. I liked virtually everything about The Force Awakens, as well as everything else that Disney has done with Star Wars up to this point (SW Rebels, Rogue One). But The Last Jedi left me speechless for all the wrong reasons."
556,8,New and unique,"The Last Jedi is a really good movie and it's a shame that people are so caught up in how it disappointed them to see that. It is not without its problems, but that does not preclude it from being one of the strongest films in the series and the best of the new trilogy."
557,7,Not so far away from the galaxy but far from the prequels,Surely a fun film for the starters and surely a depressing film for the fans!!! The fact that there are not much of light saber fights is personally disgusting me!<br /><br />Some characters don't have a purpose for their existence in the film and the death of captain phasma and snoke is super silly to me.
558,10,This is it - the one we've been waiting for!,"The last jedi is not a usual star wars movie. It will not please the DIE-HARD-NOTHING-IS-EVER-GOOD-AS-THE-ORIGINAL-TRILOGY fans (as nothing ever will), but it will please almost everyone else. The force awakens presented a new vision of the Star Wars universe, but unlike the prequel trilogy (that had it's good sides), felt and looked like Star Wars. So logically, The last jedi continued down that path."
559,6,A fundamentally flawed film,"There are an awful lot of upset fans out there, and rightly so. The film is laboured and it's clear that the writers did not have a well thought out plan to take them to three films. Or that it was the result of a 5 year olds brain-storming session"
560,3,"All style, very little substance.","This movie had the potential, the runtime and the budget to be the greatest modern ""Star Wars"" movie and expand upon the mythology and new characters that were introduced in the last one. But this movie sadly makes marketing itself to children and throwing stupid comedy at the audience it's top priority, which means that plot, character development, consistency and logical sence always come dead last."
561,8,"Genius Johnson's , Intelligent Movie","""The force awekens"" is good movie its doesn't do anything new in star wars....but ""the last jedi "" very Original and Deeper movie... Johnson's love about Star Wars we see in every scene of this movie...."
562,7,This may not be the Star Wars you are looking for...,"OK! This will be my LONGEST EVER iMDB review... As such, I am going to break it down into sections - YES THERE WILL BE SPOILERS... It is necessary to try and explain how I have come to my conclusions."
563,4,The hell was that?,"I have no idea what I just watched. It was all over the place. I didn't care for a single character. I didn't care for the Star Wars universe. I completely zoned out, I just wanted it to end."
564,,As a die hard star wars fan... I hated it.,"Star Wars has been a staple in my life since my childhood. Every movie, game, book, and toy I have collected and cherished. Until now. This movie was more than a terrible let down. Honestly, from a life long Star Wars fan Save your money and don't go see it, If you do wish to see it wait until it comes out for $5 to rent on amazon or google play. It's honestly worth the wait, you will only be dissaponted in the end."
565,9,Don't Believe the Haters,"I cannot for the life of me figure out the negativism in so many reviews out there. I'm a 40 year SW fan and know the good movies from the bad. I swear there must be a Russia-backed fake social-media campaign going on here. If critic and rotten tomatoes scores are high... it can't be a one star movie. If you have criticisms, that's fine, please register a rational 3 or 5 (out of 10), not a childish 1-star. IMHO, This is a good SW movie. Extremely good in fact. That doesn't mean it's without flaws, and I'm sorry if you felt it violated esoteric elements of Star Wars cannon, but get over it. Compared to the Force Awakens, this was absolutely fantastic, especially in that it did new things vs. making a hash out of old themes. Things moved forward. Characters were developed, new locations were seen, old characters gave strong performances (Mark Hamill has learned to act!). Weak or has-been characters were removed. (yes sorry at some point everyone in the original trilogy has to die!) Sorry. Don't be a baby about it. The script is well thought out. The dialog flows and is witty. We learn new things and they improve some old things. Yes there are a few cheap plot devices but please realize they existed in the old movies as well. I and my whole family (age range from 17 to 51) enjoyed it immensely so, don't believe the haters."
566,6,Good but the spectacular is annoying,"The movie is good but when the action scenes are there; i become really not interested and im getting bored. The story continue where it left and we meet again Luke Skywalker older and the character asked for help. The new Vador its pretty convicing and what i like its the contrary of Dark Vador; he is in the Dark side but he will join the Jedi. We met also others familiar faces and the end let us know that new characters will take the fight against the darkness: the ""New Generation"". Good but want more. Maybe in the next movie? Need to see."
567,10,Well work Rían Jhonson,But I would like more if Luke would fight with Snoke..
568,7,A huge disappointment!,"I always hate it when people write bad things about stuff I love, <br /><br />now I'm going to do it myself..."
569,10,Barrel roll,The Falcon makes another barrel roll! If you like Star Wars you'll like The Last Jedi. Loved it.
570,6,Intellectually intteresting but a really flawed movie,"All the themes always touched by the franchise are done with a more sophisticated perspective. Sometimes it contradicts the ""truths"" of the Star Wars saga. Good and evil is a bit more complicated of an issue. There is more than rebels and empire, a class of people that benefits from it. The knowledge of ""The Force"" shouldn't be only in Jedis hands. The ego in trying to be heroic vs. the real heroic act of sacrifice without wanting to be recognize for it. Etc."
571,3,I'll never mock those people who were in denial about THE PHANTOM MENACE sucking back in 1999 ever again,"My keenest memory of seeing this in the theater back in 2017 was during one of the ""Force skype"" scenes between Rey and Kylo. A kid in front of me leaned over to his father and asked in a tone of weary exasperation, ""Is the movie gonna be over soon?"""
572,10,This is the Star Wars you're looking for...,"In my opinion, the greatest Star Wars movie. Made me feel like an 8 year old watching the original trilogy back to back in my local cinema back in '85.<br /><br />From the opening battle and escape. To the epic fight in Snokes throne room. The wise words of an old friend. Each characters journey, facing fear, anger and conflict takes you on an emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />Canto Bight aside, which isn't awful, it serves a wider purpose of showing more than just Rebels and First Order. The Vegas of Star Wars. Says it all...<br /><br />Force fight, Finn/Phasma fight and a Light Speed collision idea finally come to light in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />Final battles are equally spectacular, again playing on the ""fear leads to anger"" trope, the heart of every Star Wars movie.<br /><br />And a twist of self sacrifice (nod to Obi wan)... The swell of JW score, the beautiful visuals of the western stand off and that reveal... Wow! It still resonates on the 2nd, 3rd and 8th viewing as it did when the cheer went up on opening day.<br /><br />All wrapped up to a satisfyingly emotional end to a tense and very simple Star Wars movie, but leaving you yearning to see ep9...<br /><br />Bring it on JJ..."
573,7,"""Leia sent me here with hope"", but will Skywalker return the favor?","""Star Wars - The Last Jedi"" (2017 release; 152 min.) brings the continuing saga of the ""next generation"" of Star Wars heroes. The movie opens with a bang, literally. The First Order reigns supreme, and the Resistance is scrambling to escape their base. That results in a dazzling 15 min. sequence where there are ever more detailed and complex battle scenes. And did I mention it is loud? Meanwhile, while all this is happening (and picking up directly where ""The Force Awakens"" left off), Rey is trying to convince Luke Skywalker to rejoin the ranks of the Resistance. ""Leia sent me here with hope"", she tells Skywalker. Will he? At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out."
574,3,The Last Jedi annoys me,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a mess in my opinion. While The Force Awakens isn't my favorite at all, I liked most of the plots, characters, and performances.<br /><br />The Last Jedi does have the plot between Rey, Kylo, and Luke which keeps me interested in what happens next. I love that.<br /><br />However, the other main plot, with the other characters being chased by the First Order, is overlong and boring imo.<br /><br />Then Finn (whose been stripped from greatness to mediocrity) goes with new character Rose to Canto Bight. Anything involving Canto Bight, I hate. They have to find this guy who can get them into the First Order. They don't find that guy and instead find this other guy who eventually betrays them. So what was the point of that and saving space horses?<br /><br />Along with adding terrible plots, The Last Jedi also concludes plots that were introduced in The Force Awakens. Rey never turns to the dark side, Finn vs Captain Phasma is quickly finished, Snoke is killed and is never brought up again in a good way, and Rey's past is never explored and gets worse in The Rise of Skywalker.<br /><br />Also, there's annoying and unneeded porgs, Luke dies, elements are stolen from The Empire Strikes Back, new characters suck, Finn's and Poe's development are lessened, the villains besides Kylo are still underdeveloped, and the comedy is atrocious.<br /><br />2.5/10. I hate this film. It feels like it's in a different trilogy than The Force Awakens. It would only get worse."
575,,"It worked for Bobby Ewing in Dallas, so...","'Episode IX : The Awakening' will see a close up of a sneering Snoke with the final seconds of TLJ playing out in his eyes...the final moments of a Jedi mind trick on the universe designed to break the spirit of an unassuming Rey, the final blocker to overcome the force."
576,10,Best Star wars for me!,"I saw Star wars- The last Jedi in the cinema. I know that this Star wars is differrent from all the previous Star wars films. The main characters are acted by Daisy Raidley(as Rey in the Star wars), Adam Driver( Kylo Ren), John Boyega( Finn), Mark Hamill( Luke Skywalker) and Carrie Fisher ( Leia Skywalker).<br /><br />It is an action packed film in which you don't know how it's going to finish till the last minute.<br /><br />The usual Star Wars films are about the battles between the dark and the bright side of the power, and of course this isn't missing in this part either. The story is dramatic, sometimes humorous and romantic.<br /><br />The characters act as positive or negative heroes but you also find the characters that betray their own people.<br /><br />The effects are great according to me, especially in the war scenes. The best effect, however, is a light sword that appears very often in Star wars.<br /><br />The main heroes are representatives of the dark and the bright side of power.<br /><br />Rey fights and learns with Master Skywalker. Later, she joins Kylo Ren who is a Snake- trained apprentice. This Star wars is the best Star wars film ever."
577,6,It was entertaining!,"I have been reading a lot of biting comments from others and I just didn't hate it. I had a good time! Was it one of the best movies I have ever seen? No. But it was entertaining and fun! A great way to spend part of a holiday weekend with family!<br /><br />I do believe some of the plot points and battle scenes could have been cut/shortened to reduce the film's running time to under 2 hours.<br /><br />But the cast is great and the addition of Benicio del Toro (one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern added a lot, for me.<br /><br />I enjoyed the humorous parts, and the creatures and special effects were great! <br /><br />I have seen every Star Wars movie, but I am not obsessed to the point where I found this movie as ""offensive"" as so many others have. <br /><br />I will close by saying this was a fond farewell to Carrie Fisher. May the Force be with you always, Princess Leia!"
578,8,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,"The Force Awakens was a brilliant comeback for the successful space franchise, peaking as the third highest-grossing movie in the world, and good for Disney who paid millions to acquire it; naturally, hopes were high that the second instalment in the return series would be as good, directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper, Knives Out). Basically, following the battle of Starkiller Base, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, in her last film) is leading the Resistance forces in evacuating their base when the First Order fleet arrives. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) goes against orders and leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) cannot bring himself to fire at the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia is on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into space but survives by using the Force. While Leia recovers, Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) takes over command of the Resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order. Meanwhile, former storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) wakes up from his coma, and he asks for Rey (Daisy Ridley). Rey has just arrived on the planet Ahch-To with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee) on the Millenium Falcon to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Luke doesn't want to see her or know who she is and why she has sought him out. After initially saying that the Jedi should end, he hears what happened to Han Solo, and is encouraged by R2-D2. Luke has a change of heart and agrees to give Rey three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles them both. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power. Luke confesses that he thought about killing Kylo, sensing that Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) was corrupting him. This prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order, and caused him to disappear and self-exile himself. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library but hesitates when the spirit of master Yoda (Frank Oz) appears. Yoda uses the Force to summon a bolt of lightning to destroy the library and encourages Luke to learn from his failure. Meanwhile, Poe entrusts Finn, mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), and BB-8 with a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device. Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) directs them to the casino town of Canto Bight, where they meet the hacker DJ (Benicio Del Toro). The local security pursues them, but they escape Canto Bight with the help of stable hand children and racing animals they set free. Finn, Rose, and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship but are captured by Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie). Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts. Holdo plans to evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transport vessels. But Poe believes her plan is cowardly and futile and leads a mutiny. Leia recovers but also wishes to proceed with the evacuation and stuns Poe with a blaster. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on Crait. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and the First Order fleet fire at the evacuation transports, with many being destroyed. Kylo is ordered to kill Rey, but instead kills Snoke and defeats his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the Dark Side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. She refuses and they battle for control of Luke's lightsabre, with the weapon being broken. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose who fight Phasma, she is defeated and falls to her death, and the pair join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw TIE fighters away in the Millennium Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon. The Resistance and First Order are surprised when Luke suddenly appears on the battlefield, allowing the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, but they fail to harm him. Kylo and Luke engages in a lightsabre duel, but when he manages to strike Luke, Kylo realises that Luke is not physically present, but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the Falcon. Luke has exhausted his power and dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again. At Canto Bight, the stable hands recount the story of Luke Skywalker, and one of the children is seen moving a broom with the Force and gazing into space. Also starring Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Billie Lourd as Lieutenant Connix, Veronica Ngo as Paige Tico, Justin Theroux as Master Codebreaker, Adrian Edmondson as Captain Peavey, Mark Lewis Jones as Captain Canady, Chewing Gum's Michaela Coel as Resistance Monitor, Ralph Ineson as Senior First Order Officer, Shauna Macdonald as Temporary Command Center Resistance Pilot, Andy Nyman as Jail Guard, Lily Cole as Party Girl Lovey, Warwick Davis as Wodibin, the voice of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Slowen Lo, Gareth Edwards as Resistance Trench Soldier, and Edgar Wright as Resistance Trooper. The late great Fisher and Hamill remain as likeable as they were in the originals, Ridley and Boyega continue to delight with their breakout roles, Isaac is given a bit more to do, Driver gets more depth as the villain, and there is a terrific supporting cast, including recognisable talents like Dern, Gleeson, and Edmondson. I'm happy that this direct sequel continued to meet and fulfil my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase, fight and battle sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, another triumph and I cannot wait for the conclusion in this new trilogy, a splendid science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Original Score for John Williams, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"
579,7,Stands the pressure,There is life in the Star Wars saga still. Writer-director Rian Johnson brings a somewhat more nuanced depiction of the forces of good and evil and there's an interesting dynamic between the characters of Rey and Kylo Ren. And Adam Driver - wow!
580,10,The Last Jedi is most impressive!!! Rain Johnson takes big risk and turns out it can be a wild visually exciting ride!!!,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi does pack a wild science fiction punch being a strong emotional, visually exciting, and a great second film in the trilogy with the direction by Rian Johnson. Also, one of those films it is best knowing less and avoiding spoilers cause there are a couple of twist with the characters directions or reveals. I will try avoid giving away much details besides it was a spectacular film overall. "
581,7,Dares to be different,"I'm still not sure what to think of TLJ, so this review is all over the shop. The Rey and Kylo parts are exceptional. The Rose and Finn parts are cringeworthy despite the revisionists now mistakenly embracing Tran's performance. The planning over three films goes off-road, leaving Finn and Poe largely irrelevant. The throne room fight is breathtaking. And Hamill was right about the script messing with Luke's legacy. It dares to be different, but only succeeds in parts. 7/10."
582,2,This movie is the worst thing a movie can possibly be - BORING.,"Before I went to see this movie, the only other Star Wars movie I had seen was ""Rogue One."" The only reason I went to see this movie was because my dad made me see it. "
583,10,Top 5 Best Star Wars Movie,"Don't listen what the others said about this movie those people are garbage, this movie is awesome and I love how Luke Skywalker is training Rey and the final fight in Crait when the Millennium Falcon enters to the battle I love that scene!!!"
584,7,A mixed blessing that this will be the final trilogy.,"On the plus side, this film had the long-awaited return of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. Not to mention, the debut appearance of Supreme Leader Snoke in the flesh (so-to-speak, as it's really a CGI version voiced by Andy ""Gollum"" Cerkis), as well as a further development of the Force-enhanced psychic bond between Ren and Rey. And, of course, the ironic final appearance of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.*"
585,2,STARWARS IS RUINED,"I'm sorry but this movie just isn't starwars. For one, there was WAY TOO MUCH comedy. So much so, it made the serious scenes have much less of an impact. The comedy style had a Guardians of the Galaxy sort of feel to it, but it didn't fit in a STARWARS movie."
586,,The Last Jedi or.....Harry Potter In Outer Space,"STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. Middle films in trilogies can bring some wonderful movies - GODFATHER II and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are key examples. But, they can also be problematic - see IRON MAN II and ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Unfortunately, THE LAST JEDI falls closer to the latter than the former. Since everyone reading this has likely seen JEDI, no need for a summary. Suffice it to say that it picks up right after THE FORCE AWAKENS and ends up with a lot of open strands and questions. "
587,8,I loved it,The movie was great. <br /><br />Comedy was too much and too obvious though.
588,7,Don't trust the critics...or the fans,"Well, I may not have loved this movie as much as many critics...but I did not hate this movie nearly as much as many fans either. There were moments that really worked: arguments over destiny, epic lightsaber battles, and some plot misdirections that kept you guessing. More than anything, there were some cool risks that paid off with some of the most memorable moments in the franchise's history. But in between the humor often felt forced and the twists often felt too convenient. Long story short: there was a movie in there I liked (Rey's journey of discovery) even if there was a movie I liked less (Finn's adventures across unnecessary sub-plots). Even the best Star Wars movies have some flaws."
589,9,If you're new to Star Wars you will enjoy this,"This movie looks amazing, sounds amazing, has great acting and a compelling relationship between the two main characters. It is a pity that this was not the first in the prequel trilogy as it has the feel of a ""middle movie"" and the director is wasted only making the daring 2nd part of what ended up essentially being a J.J. Abrams trilogy. This was the only movie of the three that had real substance and, judging by many fans reactions, that is not what Star Wars fans want. However, I have been a huge Star Wars fan since the 80s and I loved this. I think it will be appreciated more in time, when fans get tired of the blatant fan-service of The Mandalorian etc and realise that Star Wars had to change - but Rian was maybe changing too much, too soon for some."
590,7,Staying Within the Lines,GRADE: B- 
591,9,One of the most emotionally heavy films in the entire Star Wars saga and easily one of the best in the franchise,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the second installment in the Star Wars sequel trilogy and the eighth ""Episode"" in the overall series. Written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper), it is one of the most emotionally heavy films in the entire Star Wars saga and easily one of the best in the franchise."
592,7,"Good, but not what I was expecting","Now, I know I haven´t mentioned this yet but I alove the Star Wars movies, and, let´s be honest, who doesn´t love them, I know people don´t really like the prequels and a bit of The force awakens, but I still like all of them despite the Force Awakens being critisized by most people and Rogue One being my least favorite of the series. But now, is time to talk about The last Jedi.<br /><br />The plot takes place after The force awakens where Rey is off to be trained by Luke Skywalker, meanwhile, Kylo Ren is I think dealing with decisions in his life if he either wants to stay in the Dark Side and kill his mom, or if he wants to abandon the Dark Side and join the good side, Finn is currently on a mission and Poe Dameron has to deal with a new leader after Leia gets injured. Fwww, that is a lot of plots for one movie, but I´ll talk about that in just a second.<br /><br />Now, you might be thinking, why exactly is this in the good 2017 marathon, well, because it´s a pretty good movie, it has lots of good action scenes, the acting is fine for a Sci-Fi blockbuster, it does have some funny moments and does expand the world and characters of the Star Wars universe, like giving Kylo a backstory and having a galaxy centered around cassinos and horse-racing, yet still, while this is a good movie, there are still some issues: First off, the plots aren´t very good, for starters, Rey and Luke´s plot felt dissapointing, mostly because in the whole plot, Luke doesn´t train Rey as the trailers said he was and Luke is just portrayed as a grumpy old man who barely listens to what his young cricket has to say, granted, Yoda does appear in this plot but it´s not made up for the fact that this plot is extremely dissapointing, Kylo´s plot is also dissapointing because instead of Kylo joining the good side like the trailer said he would, he just kills his master and becomes bad again after a lightsaber fight with Rey, Poe´s plot serves no purpose to the story other than showing that George Lucas ran out of ideas, to have a repetitive moral of being yourself and to have a tense near death of Leia that says that Carrie Fisher herself isn´t in Star Wars, oh wait, she already died, so what was the point of having her come back to life in the first place, and Finn´s plot serves no purpose to the story either other than to come up with an inviormental message about not abusing animals and to deliver a romance that´s completely pointless other than to add the inviormental message. Another problem is that there´s a lot of filler in this movie, like, for example, the part where they were chasing the snow wolfs who barely appeared in the movie. <br /><br />To conclude, The Last Jedi is a good movie, yet it´s not enough to be recomended, while it has it´s pros, it´s definetly not what we expected since the announcements, if you want to watch it for yourself, then go for it, but I suggest watching it on Netflix rather than wasting your money on a Blu-ray or DVD."
593,3,Star Wars in a new and worse direction sadly,Star Wars the Last Jedi.
594,8,"Jedi are like chips, you can always make more","Not being a big fan of most of the Space Wizard franchise, I really like the newer movies (E7, Rogue One)."
595,7,Another solid Star Wars blockbuster,"Great action sequences and a fast moving plot make it a quite enjoyable visual, but some sequences seemed quite unrealistic and contrived to create drama, particularly the Snoke death. All in all a good, respectable but not memorable blockbuster."
596,3,I made an account just to say how disappointed I am,"This didn't feel like Star Wars. Now, I know people said that after viewing The Phantom Menace, but the prequels, despite their flaws, delivered a picture of a larger and more complex galaxy than the one we were introduced to in the original trilogy. The prequel characters were poorly written, scene direction felt off at times, Jar Jar existed, but at the end of the day I'll take the prequels over the new Disney films because they painted a universe. They made me want to see more Star Wars, and I appreciated the original trilogy's story arc even more after watching them. "
597,,"the last stage, according to Joseph Campbell","This is a mess, born in a messy time, i suppose."
598,10,This is my personal favorite star wars movie.,I actually Kind of liked Star Wars:The Last Jedi. I'ts not that bad
599,6,Lack of strong relationships,"I watched The Last Jedi (TLJ) twice. Discussed it with the family, then read other reviews. I did enjoyed quite a lot of it and may watch it again but my overall opinion is, sadly, negative. Spoilers are coming."
600,10,This one is for her...,"The first trilogy was for my elementary self.<br /><br />The prequels were consumed by my son while in elementary. He still prefers the prequels.<br /><br />The sequels, Force Awakened and Last Jedi, are absolutely for my daughter. "
601,7,Didn't seem to be much new,"The title sort of says it all in a fashion. There didn't seem to be much new about this episode, except that the audience is introduced briefly to some cute cuddly alien creatures, though even in trailer scene in the upcoming Annihilation (2018) has some even more startling creatures. The theme of self-sacrifice is seen over and over again and the same scenario is repeated like three times throughout the movie. The inclusion of the light charm and witty dialogue from the original Star Wars franchise (1977) is sort of like attempting to bring together the raw grit of Daniel Craig's James Bond's character from Casino Royale (2006) and Roger Moore's light-hearted James Bond from Live and Let Die (1973). There are also logical lapses in the storyline in order to maintain the pace and action, such a necessary delay in reacting to a lethal obliteration of the rebel cause or the cavalier ability of a single rebel fighter to take down a monstrous weapon. The movie sort of has cross between Karate Kid (1984), Gettysburg (1993), and the more formidable fantasy epic Excalibur (1981). The storyline is deliberately somewhat convoluted but for the most part predictable and Princess Leia (?)...well that's whole other quandary. David Lynch's Dune (1984) still retains a manner of sacrifice, convoluted mega-multi-planetary, galactic intrigue, evil power, and the relational bonding and betrayal all wrapped up into one movie while the Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) retain the epic charm of a total immersion into a magical world along with betrayal. Coming of age, and relational bond on a global scale."
602,10,Now this is more like it,"After the destruction of Starkiller Base, The Resistance is on the run from the First Order. Finn joins with Rose Tico to give them a fighting chance. Rey is trying to convince Luke Skywalker to train her but it's an uphill battle."
603,7,The flaws awaken.,Star Wars: The Last Jedi
604,4,My Personal Least Favorite,"I watched this movie twice in the theater and I just can't enjoy it. Here's the thing: If you like the movie, great! More power to you! You have found enjoyment in something that I couldn't which is honestly awesome! But I just really don't."
605,9,Why all of the hate?,"I saw TLJ on its opening night, and no one I spoke to afterwards had anything bad to say about the movie, at least not anything about the product as a whole which would lower their initial review beneath 8/10 stars. So, I was very surprised to wake up this morning and read not only in my local newspaper, but across various social media, that the movie was not well received by so many fans. As such, and to defend this very enjoyable movie, I felt the need to write a review for it."
606,7,The Saga Continues...,"12/30/17. Finally got to see this in the theater. It was worth seeing on the big screen. While it doesn't break any new ground, it does manage to keep the Star Wars story going. Unfortunately, it does work towards eventually leaving the Star Wars universe with only the new and younger characters it has introduced in what is the third trilogy of Lucas's original concept. On that note, none of the newer/younger characters have what I would consider a charismatic hold on the audience like Solo, Leia and Skywalker. Well, possibly, Ridley, but that's about it. Still I look forward to the Episode 9 in a couple of years."
607,4,I find your insistence on 'subversion' disturbing!,"I don't know who it was that came to the realisation that Star Wars needed to be different. So many interviews around The Last Jedi focussed on how this movie would challenge and subvert our expectations, but who was ever asking for that? So many things feel awkward, and some things just feel downright forced, especially the humour. There is no narrative line to the writing of this trilogy, and this comes at the expense of the characters we care most about."
608,,I am giving this 2/10,Because The Farce Awakens is a 1/10<br /><br />Simple as that<br /><br />Disney sucks.<br /><br />Simple as that.<br /><br />This film was boring and not Star Wars
609,8,"It wasn't that bad, jeez","The movie that divided the fandom, it really is not that bad of a movie, you fans are overreacting. It's not a perfect movie either but I enjoyed it"
610,7,Not The Worst Star Wars Movie,"To all those saying that this is the worst Star Wars movie of All-Time, they are Wrong, and why? does anyone remember the Holiday Special, or the two Ewok movies. if so then you'll know that whoever says this is lying."
611,8,Force Awakens Hater Loves The Last Jedi,"I didn't like The Force Awakens very much. My critique was entitled ""Majestic pastiche bordering on retrospective parody."" "
612,7,"Seven stars, but with caveats","As a movie, this one was pretty good. Seven stars seems fair. If you go into it wanting to see a movie, you should be pleased and I think that is what Disney was going for. Unfortunately. As a Star Wars movie, this was atrocious. Possibly worse than the Phantom Menace. As a Star Wars fan, I'd give this movie three or four stars. Nothing goes the way the previous 7 movies indicate it should. At the end you are left wondering how they can possibly make an episode IX that anyone will be interested in. They gave Rian his own trilogy for the future. At first I thought this was terrible, however, in fairness, His own Rian-Wars trilogy may be fine since it will not be expected to fit into an existing story-line."
613,10,The Ultimatum of all Star Wars movies,"I'm as much of a fan of the original trilogy as anyone is. I also dislike TPM and AOTC as much as anyone else. But unlike a lot of people, I enjoyed TFA and TLJ. Why? These movies tackled new ideas. They show how easily heroes fall. They make the audience believe that none of it matters. Everything has to collapse at one point. TFA set up as many cliffhangers as TLJ took down characters. The last two years were spent, wondering who Rey and Snoke really were. But TLJ showed me that they didn't matter. Snoke was just another wannabe Sidious. Snoke was blinded by his own power and confidence and it resulted in him predicting his own death. It's about time Star Wars got off of sucking the ""Evil Dude rules and Jedi will take him down"" d***. This is something different. Both Ren and Rey are two opposite sides of the same game, of trying to create a better order in the galaxy in their own twisted ways. Rey was a nobody, who came from nothing, and she knew it all along. She just kept it buried, deep down. Ren has powerful Skywalker potential in him, and all he's trying to do is restore order to the Galaxy, even if it means killing his own father to submit to the Dark Side to do it. And the mind talking sequences are beautiful. When their minds bridged, their opinions were challenging each other, about what the situation really is. Okay too much philosophy. Back to square one. Star Wars The Last Jedi is an amazing movie with visual effects stunning as ever. The twists in the story are heartbreaking and unexpected. The story is flawless, and extremely awesome. I feel that Star Wars fans need to lower expectations and stop following the Hate Bandwagon. Nothing will ever be as great as the Original Trilogy. But that shouldn't mean that they bash on every little detail in the new ones, and comparing them to the Originals. 10/10. I will watch it again, and again, and again."
614,7,"Yes it is flawed, but it's not the disaster the fake negative reviews claim","This is the first time I realize how fanboys, haters, bots and trolls influence public opinion (on false grounds). I grew up with the original trilogy, and the new trilogy didn't do much justice. As much as Rogue One was a surprise, TFA was nothing more than a copy from ANH, which is why I believed the negative reviews about TLJ and I went with little to no expectations to the cinema today."
615,1,How is this film still at 7.1,"I'm sorry but it doesn't deserve this rating,it needs to go down even further,6.1 would make a lot more sense.Imdb,plz fix this mistake"
616,10,"Bold, authentic, refreshing.","After two trilogies' worth of two-dimensional classical nostalgic Star Wars plot, Rian Johnson dares to defy expectations and create something daring and thought-provoking. ""The Last Jedi"" manages to break all formulas and still keep the epicness we're all so fond of. It brings some fascinating character development along with stunning visuals and some of the most amazing soundtracks by our one and only John Williams. No light, no dark, just balance. Just a force."
617,7,"Well, not the one that I expected (a little bit disappointing to me as a huge Star Wars fan), but hey, at least it doesn't just copy ""Empire Strikes Back!""","But some elements from the original trilogy (especially ""Empire Strikes Back"") will still remain recognizable to fanboys and fangirls from all around the globe such as the giant-but-ineffectively-slow-four-legged-metal walkers, the attack on white-hued-rebel/resistance-base planet, the stranded Jedi Master in a faraway uncharted sacred planet (both are running away from the war to find the best way to die peacefully), the last Jedi candidate training with the said Jedi Master, the reckless way the last Jedi candidate to avoid his/her friends/allies/loved-ones form certain death in the hand of the enemy by stupidly facing of the main force behind the Darkside (directly) while he/she isn't even ready yet (for their training is incomplete), the union of the aforementioned Jedi Master with the Force, and of course, the attempt of the rebel/resistance to escape from the empire/first order reach that happens from the beginning of the movie until the closing credits."
618,1,Disney has killed Star Wars,"Well, this is the end of Star Wars for me. "
619,,"Rian johnson Thought To Himself ""Why Should I Even Try?""","""After all JJ Abeams trashed and cloned Star Wars and made a billion dollars... so heck I can do another crappy job and do the same..."" and he did."
620,8,Every word in that sentance is wrong,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (PG-13 - 2017 - US)...You are no Vader!!"
621,7,A great Star Wars film - Ignore the hate on here!,Having seen this at a midnight showing in the UK (my tenth opening day Star Wars cinema release) I can say that the people who claim to be ultimate fans on here writing negative reviews are a joke.
622,9,"The power of justice seems small, but it is huge","It looks better than expected, the plot is rich, and there are many reversals. Compared with the previous one, it is a qualitative leap. This one, whether for decent or villain, is reshuffled, the end of the older generation, the maturity of the new generation. Especially the son of Han Solo. Sweeping the decline of a literary youth, it has finally become a charming villain. Light and darkness coexist, belly black, and changeable. Of course, it would be more perfect if you could send less fire."
623,7,Somewhere Between Revenge of the Sith and Empire Strikes Back,"It is unfortunate that The Last Jedi isn't quite up to par with Empire Strikes Back. However, it's just as good as Revenge of the Sith, which in my opinion is the best of the prequels."
624,9,Laurel or Yanni,"Come on... it's obviously ridiculous for anyone to rate this as a 1 or a 10. Sure, some people hear Laurel while others Yanni... both are simultaneously ""right"" and ""wrong"", but those who went into this without expectations, can hardly be disappointed. The rating spectrum is really more objectively in the 6-9 star range, depending on personal perception and taste."
625,7,not horrible,"Too long, too loud but overall pretty good. Not my favorite Star Wars movie."
626,3,Star Wars The Last Jedi,"The movie was very disappointing. The movie corrupted Luke Skywalker, making him a bad character, Finn and Rose, the worst thing in the movie, and all of their events were very bad. The action scenes in the movie were excellent, but it is not enough for this bad movie."
627,10,A well done addition to the Star Wars saga,"I went into the theater to see the Last Jedi with high expectations and was not disappointed. This film is everything I expect from a Star Wars film, conflict, deceit, action, suspense , sacrifice, and comedy. It was also great revisiting original characters like Luke Skywalker, Yoda, Chewbacca and Princess Liea. Daisy Ridley is also great and quite capable of carrying furtger the legacy of Star Wars. Much better than the Force Awakens. I would have loved to see a Han and Luke reunion, but understandably that could never happen. This film had the feel of the original trilogy and It will rank as one of my favorites in the entire franchise."
628,6,Shut off your brain and enjoy the pretty pictures,"This was my least liked of all the Star Wars movies so far. What has Disney done to this franchise? Okay so here Rey is with Luke Skywalker on an island in (Ireland) she is meant to be learning the ways of the force but Luke is pouting and perpetually grumpy, its boring, Rey then develops a telepathic bond with Kylo Ren who is struggling to master the dark side and has ditched his voice modifier which was the most interesting thing about him. Meanwhile Princess Leia floats in space (WTH was that about?) Finn goes on a risky mission behind enemy lines to a casino where he makes no effort to blend in, frees some space horses but ignores the slave kids."
629,2,Disney strikes back,"Congrats for killing another franchise. The movie was horribly edited, half of the things happening on screen are literally pointless and theres NO character development whatsoever. Rey becomes a jedi after a 15 min meditation session with Luke, Kylo kills Snoke (wich was supposed to be stronger than vader and sidious) and this somehow doesnt change anything AT ALL. But hey, the 2.5h of screentime are filled with poe doing poe things, finn and a forgettable chinese partner going to the forgettable space-las vegas and doing pointless things that have nothing to do with the plot except giving benicio del toro some money, and leia somehow flying in space. Oh also dont expect explanations for the multple questions you may have had after seeing TFA. 13/12/2017 is the day Star Wars died, good job mickey mouse."
630,,Kathleen Kennedy's crusade against the patriarchy #Imwithher the movie,"When the movies poster looks like a period stain, you know there is no one competent at the helm anymore. Star Wars has been dead since the prequels. Everything about this movie doesn't make sense, and is merely cosplay, these are people playing at being the part, all toe further ""representation"", but the result is that they and the narrative becomes a superficial hollow shell. Look a girl with force powers, a girl storm trooper, a girl commander, who needs to explain anything, they were ""empowered"" women, don't question it, don't think, you are paying for propaganda. I never thought there would be star wars films so bad they would make me respect Lucas's prequels, as bad as those were, they actually felt like star wars. This, just spits on the corpse as it feeds on it, because that is all these social progressive types can do, infiltrate and copy and subvert, they do not create anything genuine because its simply about power, and Kathleen Kennedy is going to destroy the value of the star wars in 2 films after this, and then she will take a swipe at destroying Indiana Jones. This is what happens when you give the #imwithher crowd free reign, they seek to destroy the ""patriarchy"" which really means they seek to destroy all things good. They don't understand what makes a good narrative, mythic archetypes and all traditional things be damned, they seek to destroy it all."
631,10,Best Star wars,"I saw Star wars- The last Jedi in the cinema. I know that this Star wars is differrent from all the previous Star wars films. The main characters are acted by Daisy Raidley(as Rey in the Star wars), Adam Driver( Kylo Ren), John Boyega( Finn), Mark Hamill( Luke Skywalker) and Carrie Fisher ( Leia Skywalker).<br /><br />It is an action packed film in which you don't know how it's going to finish till the last minute.<br /><br />The usual Star Wars films are about the battles between the dark and the bright side of the power, and of course this isn't missing in this part either. The story is dramatic, sometimes humorous and romantic. The characters act as positive or negative heroes but you also find the characters that betray their own people.<br /><br />The effects are great according to me, especially in the war scenes. The best effect, however, is a light sword that appears very often in Star wars.<br /><br />The main heroes are representatives of the dark and the bright side of power. Rey fights and learns with Master Skywalker. Later, she joins Kylo Ren who is a Snake- trained apprentice. Foto medzi, this Star wars is the best Star wars film ever."
632,7,The kitchen sink of Star Wars movies,"It's far better than the retread 'The Force Awakens', but there's still something awkward about this latest trilogy in the Star Wars franchise. It's a bit of a 'kitchen sink', where writer and director Rian Johnson throws everything he can at us, whether it makes sense or not, and should have tightened it up. The plot requires contrived delays in time, such as when Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) go off to look for the codebreaker. There are aspects which feel derivative, such as the aging master, Luke Skywalker, disillusioned and bitter - which also has Star Wars fanatics feeling disillusioned and bitter. And there are moments which feel just wrong, such as Yoda and Luke enjoying a nice bonfire of sacred Jedi texts (ugh). "
633,8,Much-needed Improvement,I just got out of the new Star Wars and I am very impressed! The story felt fresh and original unlike the Force Awakens. There wasn't a single plot point I predicted was going to happen that did in fact happen. The movie also expanded on the characters and the conflict they're facing as the story progresses. It seems like we're finally getting some solid character development. I was also surprised at how very funny the movie was in some scenes.
634,7,Better Than Episodes 1 and 2,"Somewhere there should be a review from one of us who gave this a positive scor - mine 7/10.. The re-intro to Luke is a bit ho-hum. Indeed, the first half of the movie is a bit substandard. But the action picks up in the second half and the story is advanced. It's visually stunning, and there are some things unexpected that apparently upset the rigid Star Wars nuts. Still I give it 7/10 and rank it ahead of Episodes 1 and 2. Now the hardcore can go after my lack of Roman Numerals. For the record, I rank the episodes: 5, 4, 6, 3 (all 10/10), 7 (9/10), 6 (7/10), 2 (6/10) and 1 (4/0) Episode 1 is the only bad movie of the Saga."
635,10,THANK YOU,FOR RUINING STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE YOU RIAN JOHNSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
636,7,"A visually appealing movie, with a great soundtrack, but with a strange plot.",WARNING: SPOILERS.
637,1,LOL XD,"Leia flying threw space, ROSE, the ""save-the-animals"" scene, the ""space-chase"" plot, the botched Luke vs Kylo fight, the disappearing dice...I wish I could give this movie a negative-star rating. XD So horrible, it's kind of hilarious. So much potential with the whole Star Wars universe...and THIS is the best the writers/directors could come up with. Hire the EA people who make the SWTOR cinematics to make the next one. You get more excitement from their 5-minute game trailers than you do from this whole trilogy."
638,10,Best Star Wars yet,"If you are thinking of going to see it, just go ; don't read any reviews, including this one."
639,7,"Dark and Daring, The Last Jedi is a Busy, Unpredictable Step Forward for the Franchise","Luke Skywalker takes center stage, returning to the screen (and the rebellion) after what seems like a lengthy hibernation in his family saga's long-awaited eighth episode. Of course, it's a creative wonderland, as all Star Wars movies are. Loaded with brilliant new settings, refreshing spins on old ones, wild unseen alien races and explosive action scenes, it retains its roots in an artistic sense. One particular scene, a lightsaber melee in Snoke's deep crimson throne room, sticks with me as one of the best-directed fights in the series. But there's much more to this picture than mere aesthetics. The Last Jedi constantly defies expectation, seemingly delighting in the chance to throw passionate fans off the scent. From character actions to fake-out non-revelations to the plot's relatively small scale, none of it is quite what I expected. More than once, I caught myself holding my breath, ready to be let down by a decision that seemed inevitable, and each time the film bucked me in a direction I hadn't considered. Sometimes that works to its benefit and sometimes it doesn't. It's a slower, more contemplative take on the franchise, particularly in the first act, which leads to a longer running time (longest of the entire series) without feeling too strung out or overly indulgent. Unlike The Force Awakens, Episode VIII uses its front-and-center returning cast to enrich and enhance the newer faces. Where Han Solo thoroughly dominated the screen, Luke and Leia use two very different methods to help Rey and Poe grow into heroes worthy of taking the spotlight. That's of crucial importance, and that it's missing from Finn's stalled character arc is a problem. Kylo Ren sees significant growth, too, successfully navigating a very delicate balancing act as his interactions with Rey, his light-side counterpart, gradually unfold. Not every gamble pays off, and it's hardly a film without faults, but I appreciate how often it was able to surprise me and its ability to wrangle so many threads together into a cohesive narrative. My first impressions have it a hair above the preceding episode, and on equal footing with Return of the Jedi."
640,1,Total Plonk,"This was supposed to be the film that propelled the saga forward into a new direction??? What was wrong with honoring the direction and legends it started?! All this movie does is crucify a heroic character we all loved from childhood, and then leaves us completely unsatisfied with Rey's storyline. Are we honestly expected to believe ""anyone"" can be a Jedi?? Disney needs to stop controlling this ship! It's not supposed to be part of the ""Disney Princess"" history. What a shambles!!"
641,,Those Who Don't Learn From History....,Are Bound To Repeat It.
642,9,The last jedi is the best star wars movie since Empire strikes back in my opinion,"The last jedi has definitely my favorite star wars movie since disney bought lucasfilm. Ep 8 is also the most surprising movie of the saga since empire. It is the funniest one by far, which you would not expect from seeing the trailers. there is definitely some beautiful shots in here that i will definitely consider as my wallpaper. Very beautiful movie, especially the fight scenes and lighsaber scenes."
643,7,A frustrating middle chapter to a disappointing trilogy,"Out of all the movies in the sequel trilogy, The Last Jedi is the most frustrating. I say this because I can see glimpses of a great movie buried in the version we got. The Last Jedi simultaneously has the best and worst moments in the sequel trilogy."
644,10,Ignore what people saying about this movie. THE MOVIE ROCKS. !!!,"The movie has everything a real Star Wars fan wants to see.<br /><br />Lightsabre fights, explosions, music background through out the whole movie, plot twists, unexpected scenes, funny scenes, awkward scenes.<br /><br />I mean this movie has everything."
645,7,Pretty Good Star Wars Film!,"Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, John Boyega. Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac and Carrie Fisher star in this 2017 sci-fi sequel. This installment picks up where ""The Force Awakens"" ended with Rey (Ridley) finding Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Hamill) who trains her. Meanwhile, Finn (Boyega) and Poe (Isaac) help the resistance attack the New Order. New Order leader, Kylo Ren (Driver) is not only determined to find Rey and Luke, but Rey tries to get him to turn away from the dark side. Fisher also makes an appearance as Leia Organa. This is pretty good, the cast & score are great and like the previous film, there's nice nods to the original trilogy."
646,9,Amazing movie,"The Last Jedi is the best star wars movie by a landslide. The way Rian Johnson wrote and directed this movie was brilliant. This movie tackled the hypocrisy of the Jedi better than any other piece of star wars content allowing for a much smarter feeling movie. Not to mention the final hour of this movie was incredibly entertaining and action packed. The scene where Luke projected his body with the force on Krayt is probably the best put together scene in all 11 movies (as of June 2021). It is exactly the type of sacrifice a jedi would make, no one got hurt, he taught a lesson, and he saved the resistance. Some things could be better though so 9/10."
647,6,The worst thing about this franchise is the fans,"People need to stop overhyping this stupid franchise. Star Wars has never been masterful at storytelling, they're just dumb, entertaiting sci-fi movies, with great and compelling characters. Except for the prequels, those suck."
648,1,Don't just like it cause it's Star Wars branded,"So to give you an idea of where I come from: The original trilogy, INCREDIBLE. Star Wars (not a new hope, jeez) 10/10, the Empire Strikes Back (possibly the best movie ever made) 10/10, and Return of the Jedi 10/10, fantastic ending despite the Ewoks. <br /><br />The prequel trilogy? AWFUL. I can't even explain the disappointment. Completely geared towards kids. Basically cartoons. <br /><br />The Force Awakens? Absolutely loved it! An homage to the OT with new characters that felt like Star Wars worthy. Granted my cinematic idol was killed in it, it was a fantastic beginning to the final 3......until The Last Jedi destroyed all the momentum. I will not get into the details that the other ""fan boys (and girls)"" harp on, but I will say this. Luke Skywalker's character was destroyed. We waited two years to see this great Jedi that we glimpsed for 30 seconds in the end of TFA. I'm not so much upset with him being a recluse and a pessimist as I am upset that he was not essential to the story. He trained no one. He fought no one (unless you consider that Skype call with Kylo Ren a fight). Just poor writing and a terrible imagination on that directors part. Leia was also a non factor. Although who knew Jedi's releatives can fly through space? Laughable. And as for Rey, Finn and Poe, why bother expanding on their stories. Who wants to know what Rey's linage really is when we have those little seal/penguin things to laugh at. Oh and sweet casino planet scene......NOT (Borat inflection). <br /><br />Overall the move sucks. And sucks badly!! Star Wars in the title makes it money. Call it Battlestar Galactica and it is out of the theater in a week."
649,8,Not as bad as last thought,"Now, this is a controversial opinion but, Last Jedi was a good film, not great, but good. This is a sort of Indie star wars film with Rian Johnson at the helm. Now if you don't like Johnson's directing style, you won't like this film. As mentioned before it's very indie and meta witch is not everyones cup of tea. I believe this film takes the series back to the New Hope era where it was just fun experimentation and creating a fun film."
650,7,Good,"""The Last Jedi"" is a brave and gorgeous film that takes the Star Wars franchise to unexplored ground, even if it's filled with flaws."
651,1,Someone has payed trolls to rate the movie better...,"This Movie is just bad. It is inconsistent and the characters more than poorly written. A few months ago, this movies had like 5stars and does definitely not deserve more... I gave it 1... Ruin and Kate just murdered the franchise and I cannot imagine that I will watch the last one in cinema... Don't even give this a try and waste your time. It is realy more than a bad movie..."
652,,Be A Person With Class And Taste: Stop Watching These Retarded Movies,"I watched it (do not worry I finally watched it for free). I cringed. It is sad and pathetic. It has nothing to do with Star Wars. ""laser swords""???? These films are for 8-year-olds who don't know any better. They are not just not good. This film was insultingly rubbish. It made no sense, had no continuity and shows you Disney Star Wars is like licking a toilet bowl. Wow it was stupid. Disney makes a billion from Star Wars and still needs to bring in Chevron as a sponsor. The video calling portion was sponsored by Skype/Line/Blackberry Messenger/FaceTime."
653,10,"Great film, great action!","I have just watched Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi and I would like to share my thoughts related to the film. <br /><br />First of all, I think this is THE MOVIE of the YEAR - amazing scenes, interesting plot and well-developed main characters. Adam Driver/Kylo Ren steals the show with this great performance - his character is so unique and you can't correctly foresee his actions. I love Darth Vader, but I think Kylo can be even better than him in the next movie. The relationship between Kylo and Rey is also well-developed and their connection is something new in the whole Star Wars saga. 10/10 for Ben Solo and Rey from me!<br /><br />Although there were some ridiculous scenes and characters (General Hux), I think you must watch this movie! I know that most of the fans expected more from Luke and Snoke, but their role in the movie was quite good. The soundtrack is once again out of this world!<br /><br />Overall, this is the best film of 2017!"
654,6,1 step forward 2 steps back,"For the record I really enjoyed Force Awakens, I had my issues with it but despite it treading old grounds the movie flowed well enough and got to the end with me wanting to see more after it finished."
655,9,"Ask not what Jedi will be last, there is always another hope; wonderful film!","Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a faraway island planet and she asks for his help. As most viewers know, the universe is in jeopardy again, for after the Rebels got rid of the Empire, the new First Order arose thirty years later. As the supposed ""Last Jedi"", Luke is needed to fight Supreme Ruler Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his nefarious sidekick, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But, alas, Luke has not been in hiding for no reason. He blames himself for Kylo Ren's transformation from his nephew, Ben Solo, into the evil henchman. Nothing doing he tells Rey. Meanwhile, the remaining Rebels, commanded by Princess-General Leia (Carrie Fisher) are being pursued again by Snoke and have very few options. There remains a main ship of ""good guys and gals"" with some lesser transports and Tie-fighters. Very brave, they leap into lightspeed, only to find the First Order has somehow tracked them. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and new gal Rose seek out Maz (Lupita N'Gongo) for a code breaker to help them find the Order's weaknesses. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren and Rey have disturbing long-distance talks, for they alone can see each other through time and space. Naturally, KR wants Rey to turn to his dark side and she wants the opposite. Snoke, meanwhile, is unhappy, at times, when Kylo Ren and General Hux (Domnhall Gleason) fail in their quest to wipe out the Rebellion. Can Rey and her companion Chewie persuade Luke to help them with his powers? Can Kylo Ren be turned back to the ""light"" or does he have other tricks up his sleeve? This amazing film is beautiful, exciting and full of fine performances, including Fisher's last. The script and direction are top flight, although a sharper edit would have prevented some slower spots. Nevertheless, to miss this masterfully made movie would be a crime of the first order."
656,7,"It's Star Wars, but it's inconsistent Star Wars.","Directed by Rian Johnson (who directed 2012's novel and sometimes brutal Sci-Fi epic ""Looper""), ""The Last Jedi"" picks up just before where ""The Force Awakens"" finishes with a dramatic and action-packed recreation of a WW2 bombing mission, featuring Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, ""Ex Machina"", ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") in fighter-pilot mode. With perhaps the exception of ""Rogue One""'s finale, never has the heroism and loss of the plucky rebel band been better portrayed."
657,8,I love most of this movie...,"The only part I don't like in this movie is the Cantobyte with Finn and Rose but all the other stuff I love. The Cantobyte sequence could have worked if done differently. Standout characters include Rey, Luke which is a realistic evolution to his character, Kylo Ren who is probably the most interesting character, and Poe. Love all the scenes with Luke and Rey on Ach-to island. The Resistance being chased sub plot is not the best but gets the job done. When the Resistance abandon ship for Crait the scene where the Vice Admiral light speed rams the First Order Star Destroyer is awesome but could have been better if Admiral Ackbar did it instead of his lame death. The Praetorian guard battle scene with Kylo Ren and Rey is my favorite Lightsaber fight of all time. Snoke's death was a real shock. The battle of Crait is so EPIC and one of my personal favorite Star Wars battles. Plus that Luke and Kylo Ren scene is so awesome. Don't see why this movie gets so much hate."
658,7,Star Wars: The Last Jedi...Kinda let me Down!!,"Now I've been waiting for this movie since the time I heard about and when I went to watch this film in the theater, I was disappointed. Now I am a Huge Star Wars Fan and my all time favorite are Star Wars Episode V and VI. And when the movie came out, all the reviews then said that this was the next darkest film after 'The Empire Strikes Back'... I DON'T THINK SO! I believe that it was over-hyped a bit. And there was not that much of suspense. And what I mean by that is, 'SPOILER ALERT'... when Luke Skywalker passes away, I don't know about you guys but I was not surprised or I didn't find anything suspenseful about it. Only because you saw that coming. And they tried to make the fact the Rey Is the Last Jedi a big thing but it didn't workout well. When I was watching the film in the theater, I thought this movie was amazing. But No it ain't that good enough."
659,3,What's going on?,"A boring, action packed movie that doesn't want to tell me what the hash is going on."
660,8,I Hear The Opening Music And Am Already Happy :),I did really enjoy it but it does have faults (perhaps more than I would like to think about!).
661,7,Better than the Last one,"I really enjoyed this movie, and I didn't care for ""The Force Awakens"" at all. "
662,2,Is it a parody?,There are some well written and comprehensive reviews on here already so I won't waste your time in the details. 
663,,THANK YOU RIAN JOHNSON,"I had hated this film when it was released, comes out of the Cinema completely disappointed and hurt.... but after watching again and watching chapter IX just have to say THANK YOU RIAN JOHNSON FOR SECOND BEST STAR WARS MOVIE CURRENTLY because the first one will always be Rogue One"
664,10,Another one,This one was pretty good too. Not great but I'm pretty generous with my stars
665,6,Really! Nobody Could Find Anything Positive To Say About This Film?,"I can't believe all the negative reviews about this film. Yes, I agree it is the weakness of the sequels; but it wasn't a bomb. I believe those giving The Last Jedi terrible reviews had their minds made up, before seeing the movie."
666,10,A seemingly misunderstood masterpeice,"It's pretty shocking that I feel the need to defend The Last Jedi when all I want to do is praise it. This is an amazing and epic film, one that has many amazing individual moments and some great action. But it's also very dramatic and works as any middle chapter should, a story of tragedy and loss. So many things go wrong so fast for these characters. And yet it's the very fact that this is a film about personal stories and the lessons that come from failure. So why do people hate the film? I would be lying if I didn't say I didn't understand why. But the film is solid and sound. I won't get into a debate, but say that the movie is entertaining, clever and beautifully made. Time will be kind to it."
667,7,"Not without its flaws, but well worth your time (NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)","Though more daring and original than The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi suffers from pacing issues, a lopsided, needlessly-complicated structure, and the problematic deaths of two major characters (the first character is killed abruptly, prematurely, and unbelievably. The second character's death isn't unbelievable so much as it's unexplained. It's really not clear what the second character dies of, or why he dies. He just kinda dies). Anyway, the scenes with Rey and/or Luke are quite good, but much of the rest of The Last Jedi is adequate at best, and, at worst, inferior. That said, the cinematography is stunning, the performances of Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill are outstanding, and the finale is brilliant."
668,10,The Last Jedi,The Last Jedi is now what i call a great film to enjoy. Every second of this movie is great. The 3D was amazing as well. This movie was worth the long wait to go see. This movie is fun for the whole family to go enjoy.
669,7,Not as bad as what people say it is,Yes if you compare this to the force awakens and the original trilogy this is not an outstanding movie. But I thought it was really enjoyable yes it does have it flaws which I will listed here below.
670,4,I hesitated to give this four stars,"This entry into the Star Wars franchise was an utter dud and will, sorry to say, be ranked as the worst movie in the saga. And rightfully so. After the last movie, this one was set up with so much potential to be great and it failed. Period. "
671,10,The best star wars since the first one,Answers all the questions left behind from previous movies:<br /><br />Where do these guys get all their weapons?
672,7,It doesn't follow the reverse character structure,"It was good, but went on too long with a few too many characters. Yoda didn't need to be in it. It did have good action scenes and laughs. It didn't follow the pattern of the series since it doesn't reverse order from when the characters appear. The Korean girl and the bad guy with the sideburns didn't go anywhere either. Nor did Leia's concussion cure very quickly."
673,2,An okay sci-fi flick - but a terrible SW film.,"Stunning visuals, garbage character development/assassination, amazing audio, and a complete dismantling of the entire established universe. No point of any of the previous 40 years of Star Wars even makes sense after the siple-minded contrivance in this film. And all of this set to the exhilarating pace of two old ladys in a walker chase. Simply astonishing what was crammed into this film."
674,,"If movie sucks, is it ok to ask for your money back?",Something has to be done to make those guys stop making this dumb s... movies.
675,8,"For better or worse, my favorite of the new trilogy","When it hit theatres in 2017, ""The Last Jedi"" opened to critical acclaim, and audience chagrin; I remember sitting through the two and a half hour film, and at its end being, well, flabbergasted. Where was the fun, galactic adventure, multiple locals, and high-octane space action from the other films? Why was there a 20 minute subplot about visiting a casino planet to find a hacker? Why does the movie seem to move at a snail's pace, and why is the plot basically a drawn-out two hour long chase scene? All of these questions, and more, boggled my mind, and at the films end I concluded that it was a massive failure. As you can see by my rating, my opinion has changed after repeat viewings."
676,6,Entertaining and Star Wars. Yet mediocre.,It felt too commercialized and the dialogue was sometimes like some TV sitcom. I was half expecting to hear fake laughter and some points.
677,10,Inspired star Wars Review Review.,"I have recently been inspired by the most recent star Wars Review I have read (a few seconds ago) let's start a change petition to take midichlorians out of star Wars because nobody really needed that. Thanks but no thanks. Like the guy said, if you're going to make a movie about something - don't make up your own movie , make it inside the story, where Star Wars is majic. It's spelled with an j."
678,6,I didn't hate this movie but was very dissapointed,All in all it wasn't The Phantom Menace... I hate those three movies even exist. So when I watch these new movies I can't help but say...well that sucked but it was no Phantom Menace.
679,10,Most underrated film of the series,"This is the most underrated film of the Star Wars Series. Why? Ok, let's see: First, the development of Luke Skywalker as a somewhat broken hero is very interesting and Mark Hamill's portrayal of this is actually very nice. Probably everyone who has watched the other films, me included, expected something different. While I was, at first, annoyed by this like many others, this development has actually grown on me: Imagine alternative versions of the story where Luke happily joins the Rebels once more and does great things from the beginning - wouldn't that feel kind of boring and, given the story of The Force Awakens kind of implausible. Just imagine an alternative version of Star Wars V where Yoda joins the rebels on Hoth - wouldn't that kind of make Luke superfluous? In the end, Luke manages to save the rebels some time with a very powerful force projection in a very powerful scene where he fights Kylo Ren, but only after he had to learn throughout the film that passivity, after all, is not the solution to the problems of the universe. Before that, we see two different versions of the final moment between Luke, as a teacher, and Ben Solo/Kylo Ren as his apprentice, one from the perspective of Luke and one from the perspective of Kylo Ren through they eyes of Rey - which provide some credibility to Luke's withdrawal from the world.<br /><br />Second, Daisy Ridley as Rey is really, really great! Her dialogues with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, also great!) via the Force are really intense and provide some variety to the tempo of the film. Also the scenes with Rey and Luke at times are funny as well as serious enough to provide room for both characters to be developed further. Also, the scene where Rey seeks answers in the well are well designed and acted and provide an appropriate feel of mystery.<br /><br />What I don't care for is the opening ""joke"" with Poe Dameron and General Hux, but that is quickly forgiven as this sequence progresses with the introduction of space bombers and the excruciating scene where one after the other bomber is being destroyed. With this scene, the opening of the film already manages to provide a thrilling battle scene, which is apparently no easy feat, and there are many more to come in the film.<br /><br />Also, the The Last Jedi is visually very convincing and innovative as well. Think of the scene where Admiral Holdo jumps into hyper-space in order to crash into the fleet of the First Order. Or, think about the battle-scenes on the salt-planet with red beyond a white surface culminating in Luke's battle against Kylo Ren or the lightsaber battle in the throne room. These scenes feel very intense as well, due to the convincing choreography (one can actually follow what is happening) and the impressive scenery they are set in.<br /><br />In sum, Rian Johnson manages to tell the story in a way that feels intense - both emotionally with respect to character development and with thrilling action sequences. Also, he manages to bring some feel of mystery back into the force (also thanks to Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill) which was largely absent from the prequels."
680,6,the only thing missing is the 20th century fox tune,"I'm a Star Wars fan. Just a fan, not a fanatic. And I loved this movie. What a thrill! Much better then Episode VII.<br /><br />Well, the story is, on the surface, what can be expected, nothing special, but hey, it's Star Wars. (James Bond will also always be a spy.) It has everything it needs. Action, drama, romance, humor. And, a second layer. You probably have to watch it at least twice to see and understand that deeper level. But it tells us something about what can be expected next.<br /><br />An other great aspect: for the first time I felt that 3D brought something extra to a movie. It was great to be in space with all my favorites.<br /><br />John Williams, again, composed a beatiful score. And every now and then an old tune comes along. How does he do that! <br /><br />The 2.5 hours were over in a flash. I even watched all the titles at the end again. I just didn't want it to end. Just great!"
681,2,Why would I watch the third one? There is nothing left I want to know...,"First of all, I'm a big Star Wars fan, and I think the prequels were good, because they were building up to something, Vador. But this... Where is THIS going...? It's the first time in my live that I've taken the time to write a review, because there is no way this movie deserve his 8.1/10 rating. And five years old kids don't come to rate movies on IMDB, so people were clearly paid to rate this movie past 5 stars."
682,8,Star Wars Turned into Drama Series,"Just watched The Last Jedi from the latest Star Wars Trilogy and I really enjoyed this episode. I loved the beautiful cinematography, the music, the vintage science fiction set, the relatively new actors, and their interaction with the renowned, older cast. "
683,7,A mediocre addition to the saga but still an important one,The eighth instalment in the genre-busting sci-fi saga sees characters new and old come to terms with big reveals and lacklustre revelations.
684,4,"""The Last Jedi""? Hopefully it's ""the last one"" in this franchise. But no, they have to make Episode 9 don't they? Why bother?!","""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" (2017), and I thought Episode VII was bad! Before I get into the real meat of my review, I must talk about Carrie Fisher. Knowing that Carrie Fisher died right after completing her work for this ""movie"", I was hoping she would go out on a high note in this ""film"". But no, her character was unconscious throughout most of the ""movie"". Don't even get me started on Leia embracing her inner Mary Poppins by floating through space! One thing that could have maybe (MAYBE) redeemed this ""movie"" somewhat, is that they could have had Luke and Leia back together. They do have a scene with both of them together on-screen. But, in the actual ""story"" Luke is not really there. He is only appearing there using the force, that really aggravated me. I hate how they depicted Luke's character in this ""movie""! But, we'll get to that later. All I have to say to the spirit of Carrie Fisher is: I'm sorry that you had to be involved in such a travesty of a ""film"" for your last role. I promise that I will stick to Episodes 1-6 from here on out, the real ""Star Wars"" movies. Rest in peace, Carrie Fisher. As for the rest of this ""movie"", it's boring, dull, obnoxious and once again a waste of casting. Especially on Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher's part! The only good qualities are the soundtrack and the special effects. The sets/locations are boring, the acting is all over the place, and the story? What story? What did I just watch? Probably the thing that infuriated me the most about this ""movie"" was how they depicted Luke. His character does not care about the Jedi order, and he made the Episode 7 cliffhanger entirely pointless. Also, he refuses to help save the resistance. Unbelievable! Right? This is not the Luke I know, where did the real Luke go? Even Mark Hamill himself, who plays Luke, regrets being in this ""film""! What does that tell you? To anyone who likes this ""movie"", please get a brain-scan. If you have seen this, and hate it like almost everyone else with a functioning brain does, I just have to say I'm sorry you had to see it. I'm not even going to bother with Episode 9! I give this ""film"" only 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this ""movie"", just go and watch the real ""Star Wars"" movies (EPISODES 1-6) instead. You'll thank me later!"
685,,The Last Jedi stands out like a sore thumb,The opening sequence of The Last Jedi begins as The Force Awakens ends; and in doing so creates a timeline overlap that only goes to amplify the jarring and blunt style transition taking place.
686,10,Pure Star Wars lore,"I went in the theater not knowing what to expect since I saw headlines in the newspapers saying that the critics loved it but not so much for the general audience.<br /><br />I watched it and enjoyed it thoroughly. I thought it was essentially a return to classic Star Wars lore. In other words, it respects what I would expect from the original universe, the force and the struggle between light and dark sides.<br /><br />Essentially well developed characters, great battle scenes, lots of interesting plot turns and, lots of touching moments. Acting seemed so natural that, at times, I wondered about actors being so much into their characters to achieve this level of realism. And finally, no, I am not a great Star Wars fan. I like fantastic movies in general. I am more of a fan of good movies, and I think this is a great movie."
687,7,"An ok sequal, but needed something else",This film was ok. It wasen't blow my socks off good like rogue one was. Even the first film in this trilogy had a lot of nostalgia. Most of that of which is gone with this film. It was nice to see princess leia and bitter sweet seeing carrie fisher in this role but what a great job she did. This film is not the same without han though. It was good seeing luke skywalker more but he felt uneeded. Just like snoke I felt there was no reason for them. I like rose though I feel she was a good character to add. But really I can't talk about how the plot worked as I felt there was nothing really in it. Sure there were some good action scenes and characters. And only a slight hint of character development in rey. Apart from that though still enjoyable to continue on the franchise. But not really needed in the grand scheme of things.
688,10,Not what I thought it was going to be but I loved it!,"I disagree with some of the reviews on here and I felt I had to write about this movie. I don't think it's as bad as some people made this out to be. It sort of mirrors the original Trilogy, like Empire. Some people didn't like Empire strikes back, complaining it was too dark. I'm not one of those die hard Star Wars fanatics that wait in long lines desperate to see a new Star Wars film. I am not sure why some of you are complaining a movie's direction when there were so many likable, interesting characters, I get it, it has a darker theme compared to Force Awakens. What I like about Rian Johnson's direction of Star Wars was that it was not meant to be produced in a way to make star war fans angry (I actually felt Luca's prequels were far worse). There were many similarities with past Star Wars movies with this one. Many of the characters in this movie were so ordinary and end up as unlikely heroes and you really feel for the characters. <br /><br />Johnson also said, he wanted to open up the possibilities for more Star Wars stories in the future. "
689,7,Improves slightly over the previous film & takes some narrative risks. A little crazy too. 70%,"Following on from the previous movie in this final (?) trilogy, whose name escapes me right now (looking it up on Wikipedia now...ah, yes, ""Star Wars: Episode VII""...just kidding...""Star Wars: The force awakens""...actually, it just came to me now...I didn't even need to look it up!), we get to find out what happens when our young heroine, Rey (I had to check the spelling of her name on Wikipedia) meets Luke Skywalker, who may prove to be the Resistance's final hope (I had to Wikipedia what they were called...I initially typed ""the Alliance"") in staving of the wannabe New Empire (The First Order?). Things get complicated between them. The good news is that the film doesn't suck. The bad news is that it doesn't reach any great heights, although it does have more going for it than most of the other films in the series (especially episodes I and II, and, to a lesser extent, episode VII. Of course, there will be battles with the New Empire or whatever they're called. Anyway, I suppose I'll be happy enough to see this trilogy through to the end, as it is improving slightly on each outing. ""The last Jedi"" was tracking to score about 65% for me, but a little bit of daring on its part as far as what happens to characters goes pushes my score out to a flat 70%. In other words, I liked how the film created certain character expectations and then subverted them."
690,10,The best for true and devoted fans of the franchise!,Star Wars: The Last Jedi did everything right.<br /><br />All the negativity on the internet is absolutely appalling and those negative nancys who call themselves Star Wars fans and write these rediculous childish reviews should not be allowed to do so.
691,6,Nice,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a direct continuation of Star Wars The Force Awakens, but with a difference, the direction and script were in charge of Rian Johnson who amused fans with a lot of fanservice but failed to deliver a grand sequel to the new trilogy. Usually the second film is the highlight in a trilogy, but in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, director and screenwriter Rian Johnson was unable to maintain the grandeur of the universe that was presented to us in The Force Awakens, leaving shallow characters that were presented to us in previous movie. The only ones that were well developed were Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), the others were not treated as in the previous film with depth having two layers with a background that made fans create theories. Starting with Rey and Kylo Ren, where Rey was reduced to a girl who can't do anything on her own, unlike the fearless girl who solved everything with her own hands, not forgetting that they summed up the character's past with just one line from the villain. Kylo Ren is a difficult character to deal with, and now with the outcome he had in The Last Jedi it only gets worse, we don't know if he's a villain or a future hero, we don't know if he's powerful or if he's just a spoiled brat. Adam Driver's lack of charisma on paper was masked by the character's grandeur and characterization, and that was deconstructed early in the film. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) were also downplayed by side-quest assistants who are of no use at all, while the ""powerful"" Leader Supermo Snoke was just a CGI doll (very well done by the way) spoke only using sound words. A villain worthy of Star Wars who was left out without even telling us who he really was. All of these negative points are in the account of Rian Johnson who gave us a confused film, with many script holes, with a confused edition, and moments that border on Marvel Studios jokes, and as a Star Wars fan, this was not what I expected. What was shown during the release of the film was something different, more dense and serious, remembering that The Last Jedi shows the Rebel Alliance being decimated, with our hero Luke Skywalker needing to use force again to save the few that are left. But the film was not just that, it also featured scenes that touched those in the cinema, and full of fan services that pleased those who saw the session. This is very pleasing, since we are fans of Star Wars and we always want the best, I really expected much more from this continuation and thanks to the Force, director JJ Abrams returns to finish this trilogy that has everything to bring new fans and please longtime fans ."
692,1,How to kill starwars,"Rian Johnson doesn't appear to be a fan of the original films at all. He takes the main hero and turns him into a fool. Perhaps he did this so that luke wouldn't out shine Ray, or perhaps he doesn't like Mark H. Either way this film should never have been made. We waited 30 years to see our hero on screen again and to see how powerful he had become with the force. Instead we saw a chacter we didn't recognise and one that made the first three films seem pointless. Thankfully his character is saved in the mandalorian. This film is out of touch with the rest of starwars. It has stupid scenes that are meant to be funny. But are bad slapstick at best. Oh and leia can now survive in space. This film is just a mess. If you watch it, it may ruin your love of starwars."
693,8,In equal parts great and disappointing,You either love or hate The Last Jedi. There seems to be very little middle ground with this film.
694,7,Fun and beautiful...,"Looks absolutely beautiful, with great cinematography. Obviously had a lot of thought put into the costumes, editing and lighting. Star Wars always has opportunities to show fantastic locations on screen. "
695,4,"Don't waste your time, remember Star Wars as it was.","I might have thought ""The Force Awakens"" was slightly disappointing when I first saw it. Well, I must change my mind. <br /><br />From the unfortunate perspective of a viewer of ""The Last Jedi"", I feel obliged to reconsider my previous opinion. The first movie of this unnecessary postmodern Star Wars trilogy seems like a masterpiece if compared to the absolute tragedy of the last chapter.<br /><br />Cheap humor? Incoherent dialogs? Clichés? <br /><br />What happened to Star Wars, the innovative, mindblowing, legendary franchise that made poeple dream, shiver and sigh?<br /><br />Nothing more than the mere name survives.<br /><br />The authentic vibe of the old trilogies is now so irremediably lost under a pile of easily sellable garbage, that not even a miraculous change in the next chapter could bring it back to life. <br /><br />Which is bitterly ironic, considering that the only purpose ""The Last Jedi"" seems to be aiming to is to live shamefully in the light of the six glorious prequels (yes, even ""The Phantom Menace"").<br /><br />On a less sentimental ground, I must add that, incredibly, the plot of this new movie does not add anything new or meaningful to Chapter VII. The only substantially unexpected events (Snoke's death and Luke's poetic dissolution into the Force) are, but I am not even surprised anymore, treated without the necessary emphasis or the dramatic touch that these moments need. <br /><br />On the other hand, useless characters (I am referring to those played by Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro) and CGI monstrosities (crystal foxes, screaming penguin/hamsters or whatever they are) spend way too much time on the screen.<br /><br />And then one last, unforgivable error : Yoda.<br /><br />Why did they have to use the grotesque, puppet-like figure of the Jedi master which appeared in the first trilogy, while the little green hero as portrayed in the second one was a renowned success worthy of imitation? <br /><br />There are too many questions to be answered regarding this movie, while in the past the only one was : ""when will I watch the next chapter of Star Wars?"".<br /><br />Today, I don't even want to know if and when Chapter IX will be out. <br /><br />My conclusion is deeply pessimistic and personally surprising :one can undoubtedly say these last two movies were ineffective and trivial, but they did have at least a relevant effect, that is killing the most perfect science fiction saga of all time."
696,,The worst ever!,"This didn't feel like a Star Wars movie at all. The whole Canto Bight scene was horrible, Luke went from hero to isolationist and didn't even actually appear on Crait. The Force projection was just lame, and the lightsaber fight wasn't much of a fight at all. Sabers didn't touch. Disney has no idea what to do witn Star Wars. At all."
697,9,Worst Star Wars Movie; Best Movie in the Star Wars Franchise,"First of all, the amount of hate that this film has received is unnecessary. People who claim to be Star Wars fans say that this ruins the universe that was previously established. Those self-proclaimed ""Star Wars fans"" mistake the skillful expansion of the Star Wars universe and its possibilities with bad writing and an incoherent story. I have seen this multiple times in theaters and feel confident in saying that this is the most stunning action film to see in theaters, followed closely by Thor: Ragnarok. The cinematography and action scenes are some of the best in the franchise. They all serve the plot and are also wildly entertaining.<br /><br />While The Force Awakens was happy, fan-pleasing adventure, The Last Jedi has its sights focused on advancing the characters, story, and universe to a place that no Star Wars film has ever been to before. The Force Awakens took pleasure in the old cast members and did their legacies justice. While that was what worked perfectly for that film, The Last Jedi is not as concerned with honoring the original trilogy's characters. The Last Jedi is entirely focused on the new Star Wars and what it holds ahead of it, if that wasn't clear by the fabulous last shot that inspires not only hope, but excitement for what is next to come in the Star Wars franchise. <br /><br />Rian Johnson brought new life and energy to the Star Wars franchise at just the right time. The plot is the most original one since A New Hope, or The Empire Strikes Back. <br /><br />At first, my main gripe with this film was that some characters' final moments or last scenes feel dissatisfying. Upon rewatch, I realized that their final moments worked perfectly well in the context of this film and this film only, not the rest of the Star Wars franchise. Rian Johnson is merely concerned with making this Star Wars film for what he thinks a Star Wars film should be, not what everyone else wanted or expected this to be. Not every Star Wars film can be a fun, simple adventure with a death Star storyline. Rian Johnson knows that more than everyone else.<br /><br />Kudos to you, Mr. Johnson, and to everyone involved.<br /><br />9.5/10"
698,7,An interesting sequel,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is a decently good feature. Acting is a plus, highlighted by an inspiring performance from Hamill and intriguing acts by the main leads. The central storyline is therefore quite pleasing. Great dialogue is present during various emotionally heavy scenes concerning these characters, enhancing the film's intensity and meaning. Unfortunately, the other subplots of the film are deeply unsatisfying. Character insights are highly poor and the introduction of new characters fall flat on various fronts. The themes attempted are utterly frustrating and cringeworthy. Ultimately, the entirety of what occurs apart from the main cast is highly questionable. Between the slowness of what happens to the ridiculousness that ensues, the conclusion to the subplot neither feels like a payoff or can redeem the poisoning plot holes created. The supporting cast simply was not written into the story well. Fortunately, the visual effects and sound are stunning throughout. The central plot saves the feature, presenting wonderfully choreographed combat scenes and intriguing newfound abilities. In particular, the resolution is epically awesome and at least leaves the feature on a satisfying note. Overall, this was an oddly disappointing, yet fulfilling film that had amazing pieces nearly set off by the poor writing that at times befalls it."
699,8,Goodbye to an old friend,"Star Wars, or as the rest of the world came to know it, A New Hope, was the very first movie I ever remember going to see at a drive-in in New Jersey when I was a kid. Immediately it captivated me and for the last 43 years has maintained that captive hold on my imagination. Essentially a story about good versus evil, it is the way in which the story is told, along with the mystical powers of the Jedi and Sith that makes it so appealing. There are a lot of amazingly awesome characters thrown in along the way, and over the course of my life these pretend people have become like family to me. Anyone that give any of the movies in the Star Wars universe a poor review is not a true fan, in my opinion. Each and every movie is a new adventure. Granted there are some movies that are far superior to others, but they are all good and enjoyable in their own ways. Removing the creator, George Lucas from the telling of these stories was probably not the best decision, but I cannot find any reason to hate these films, nor go on here or any other form of social media and bemoan how awful they are. Each death of a main character is like a punch directly to my heart."
700,7,A mediocore Star Wars.,"Rian Johnson wrote and directed ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" With his indie debut, ""Brick,"" in 2005, he established himself as a serious filmmaker. This latest installment was billed as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for the new trilogy."
701,9,The best of all time....,"Parts of this movie were deeply inspired. Some of the best material since The Empire Strikes Back in some places, particularly the scenes between Luke and Rey. The movie does not disappoint, visually stunning action sequences, which were typical but beautiful and fun to watch. The anticipation built up from the months of waiting, about what could possibly transpire between Luke and Rey on that island, will be satisfied about as well, if not better than expected. Story choices were made involving Luke Skywalker that, lets just say, make his character___________ (You'll see)."
702,6,The Last Jedi proves,"The Last Jedi proves that the franchise will never be the same again. This is a completely new film from its predecessor, both trilogies and Rogue One. Prequels, wacky storylines just to keep the characters busy while the force squabbles among themselves, they are completely leveled by the huge balls of director Ryan Jones, who was not afraid of the possible reaction of the fans, nor the risks, nor the revenge of the adherents of the Dark Side Never before has any Star Wars film been so authorial, and while not everyone will like the director's vision, the film deserves to be part of the world of the Jedi."
703,2,I'll give it 2 stars because it hurts to give it the 1 it deserves,"The UK should deny Kathleen Kennedy a visa to stop her inflicting this SJW trash on us. It's obvious that every time she lands in the UK her political madness creates mayhem, re shoots, directors being fired and incompetent morons like Rian Johnson being kept on."
704,8,"I enjoyed the film, keep scrolling to see other negative reviews.","The Last Jedi, the most crontroversial movie of the Star Wars saga, I think, and I think a lot of people agree with me on this. Well, back in 2017, I remembered that people already started to look at the film negatively because of the ""Jedi must end"" line that appears on the early trailer of the movie. Before its release, the film was getting positive reviews. The critics liked the movie, so nothing to worry about. The buzz started when the leaks, with all spoilers, popped up in reddit. 'Everyone' was mad about the portrait of Luke in this film. Why he would even think in kill his nephew? And the idea of Luke dying received a surprising amount of hate. Then the film release, received blacklash from the fans, I remember a youtube channel doing 50 or more videos per day talking about how bad The Last Jedi is, and that's happens till this day, a lot of channels still talk abou that movie. For the best or for the worst, the film is still discussed 2 years after its release. A director's dream, or nightmare in this case, I think."
705,7,Couldn't Wait For The End,"Glad to see the tribute to Carrie Fisher,but this film was too long.It's okay if you can pause or repeatedly visit,but watched it on a flight from UK to USA.Put me to sleep.Mark Hamill was right to express concern of the direction of his character.Lovedthe story with Kylo Ren and Rey.Needs to be up to its usual standards for the series continuation."
706,1,Absolute rubbish,"This was one of the most disgraceful displays from a director I have ever seen. I think it should go down as a case study for inspiring filmmakers to study the script and the way the movie was directed and to learn what terrible directing is. To learn how poorly it was made, and to learn how some people can say they're directors but have zero clue about what they're doing. To think that any studio would continue to hire the director for future movies is just shuddering. Anyone hiring the director after this effort must have rocks in their heads."
707,,"If this movie didn't fulfill all your theories, you have only yourself to blame.","""This is not going to go the way you think."" is an understatement. I rarely ever write reviews, because my opinion doesn't matter. However, I feel the need to address the vitriol against this movie.<br /><br />For the last two years I've listened to countless theories; Snoke is definitely this person, Rey's parents have got to be such and such. It's been relentless. Some of the theories were decent and plausible. The majority of them were idiotic. I admit that even I got caught up in a couple of them, but I wasn't committed to any particular theory. When finally watching the film, I feel my experience was partly ruined because when certain things happened I kept thinking ""Oh no, that's really going to piss people off."". Then I snapped out of it and realized that I didn't care what people think. I loved every second of this film and now that I've had time to process it, I'm glad they went in the direction they did for the majority of the big ""mysteries"". If you've been discussing, deconstructing and committing to certain ideas of how the movie is going to play out, you've just set yourself up for major disappointments. "
708,10,Best movie Of 2017 And All Time -A Calmer Star Wars Flick But With Great Characterization/Twists,"Watched my favorite Movie of All time Movie Star Wars :The Last Jedi which in The Greatest Movie of All time.

709,7,An uneven film and a somehow different review from Greece.,"I waited for the smoke to clear and , after hundreds of raging reviews from fans, I thought I'd write one as well."
710,9,Goes and goes merry-go-round,"It became a sort of new hobby of mine. ""Reviewing this title"", this specific one, since for some reason they won't post my review. Anyway, back to it.<br /><br />The 8th episode is the best of the sequel Star Wars trilogy. Unlike The Force Awakens it's not indulging ridiculous fandom by copying the original trilogy, instead The Last Jedi introduces new concepts and ideas despite of hateful fanboys who ridiculed even George Lucas' prequels which had nothing wrong with them.<br /><br />And the 9th... don't get me started on the 9th. Clusterfrick (to put it mildly) is what it was since J. J. wanted to compromise and destroyed not only new good things but all the old as well turning Star Wars into cartoon basically.<br /><br />Lots of viewers complained how some things Rian Johnson included were ""wrong"" and ""corrupting the lore"", but you know what? No. If you worry about the lore and integrity of the vast universe collectively created by tons of books, games and so on you should blame Disney that destroys everything it touches.<br /><br />However it makes sense they ignored the majority of ""uncanonical"" stuff leaving only the 6 movies to work with. It's easier, wider audience to get to buy the tickets etc.<br /><br />Here is the thing: what I personally like about the first 6 episodes the most is the personal approach. Yeah, it's epic, there is the prophecy, the chosen one..., but (even though the force is strong in Skywalker family) the characters didn't seem like omnipotent demigods/superheroes, they faced their fears and we believed them. The 8th is trying just that by making Luke broken and Rey all alone and confused. Plus, not everyone should be someone's daughter/son/grandparent, sometimes heredity is not all that important.<br /><br />And it's like Luke said to Rey ""the force doesn't belong to the Jedi"", same goes for the story, this magical world Lucas created long time ago."
711,6,The Starwars Spirit is gone.....,".. just like most of the old cast and what's left of it is a mediocre production by Disney! Too much talk-fest, too little on topic and too many memories of the past. I watched it to the end even it was not great!"
712,10,Without a doubt. The BEST Star Wars film from Disney.,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi sees Rey (Daisy Ridley) trying to learn the ways of the force from Luke (Mark Hamill) while Leia (Carrie Fisher) leads the surviving Rebels on a dangerous escape route from the First Order. And Kylo/Ben (Adam Driver) faces his self-conflict.
713,7,Amazing film but not great star wars film,So when i did my first review it was when i watched it in cinema i gave it a 10 and now iv watched it a couple more times on dvd iv realised that this is a terrible star wars film but a beautiful movie on its own.
714,2,Exhaustingly Boring,A truly disappointing film in every way.
715,9,"This movie is one of the best Star Wars movies yet, ignore the hate!!",I love this movie! This movie has some of the greatest scenes in the film like the throne room scene. Mark Hamil was great reprising his role as Luke Skywalker. This had some of the best action in all of Star Wars and the characters were much improved. The performances were top shelf and better than TFA's performances. Also people hate on TLJ because there stupid theories about snoke and Rey's parents didn't happen because snoke gets cut in half and Rey's parents are nobody's. Also Luke's sacrifice was awesome and completely shocking so ignore the hate and keep watching Star Wars!
716,7,My Review!,"Being able to feel nostalgic is one of the best feeling there is. In this case, this movie. The story is a wonderful combination of everything that we have seen and today's generation graphics. It all blends so well. There are a lot of things that I miss from the original trilogy, but nevertheless, the actor's, the graphics, the sound effects have done a fantastic job of keeping the undying OST alive and all that comes along with it. 🙂"
717,3,Disappointed,"The first time I watched this movie I left the theater feeling completely disoriented. I recently watched it again for the first time since seeing it in theaters and time did help me any. I have come to realize that if you watch the first and third movies of the trilogy, this movie doesn't have any relevance to the other two and was completely unnecessary to the story."
718,,Awesome/awful,"The Force Awakens was better but The Last Jedi's worth seeing for the photography (truly cinematic - deserves an Academy Award) and for the awesome scenery, and the scene at the end (although it kind of rips off the planet Hoth scene in The Empire Strikes Back + the final battle in Return of the Jedi). Good to see Mark Hamill (he was good in this). Overall, it was about what I expected; awesome and awful; if only they didn't have those annoying, little, cutsie penguins; Chewy's trying to fly the Millennium Falcon, and fighting a battle and these penguin thingy's are sitting on the dashboard: WTF!? This is becoming like Transformers; those movies would be okay if it weren't for these annoying little toy transformers thingy's buzzing and hopping around; it spoils the tone of the film. I noticed this in the The Force Awakens; Chewbacca looks CGI or not as good somehow/too good/too polished compared to Chewy in the early Star Wars movies."
719,10,lot better than i expected!!,"After reading reviews I thought that it will be bad. But it was not! I really liked the movie. I don't understand why people never appreciate anything at all. <br /><br />There is no need to compare this movie with previous trilogies. C'mon! we all know that nothing will be the same. People have to get rid of their biases.<br /><br />If you really want to compare, just see how visual aspects had improved. <br /><br />And also I think the last jedi is even better that force awakens."
720,7,Star Wars 3.0 Finds Its Footing,"Star Wars has been an interesting ride since the Disney acquisition, mixing financial success with timid artistic expression. Thank George Lucas for creating a universe that is very hard to get right, and for personally demonstrate how horribly wrong it can all go when one strays too far from the winning formula of the original trilogy (by creating the lamentable prequel trilogy). Disney has struggled so far to tell a compelling new story while remaining on safe ground: episode VII captured the tone perfectly but felt like too much of a reboot in terms of plot, while Rogue One tried something new and got bogged down in a dour mood peppered with weird fan-service. Measured against those two offerings, The Last Jedi is another step in the right direction. It still contains a bit too much that is familiar, but, for the most part, succeeds best when it tries to be different."
721,10,Great movie; genuinely confused by the backlash...,"I'm genuinely so utterly confused by the terrible ratings of this film. I can understand it not being your fav SW film, or being disappointed with the approach to the way that some of the questions we had were answered...but ratings of 1 and 2?! Are you kidding? "
722,7,"Not a perfect movie, but still enjoyable","I personally liked this movie more then The Force Awakens. The stakes are higher and it feels like there is actually a threat, that needs to be overcome. But i most say that some of the characters storylines feels like filler. All in all i enjoyed myself and the visuels are incredible and it is hands down the most beautiful Star Wars movie i have seen."
723,10,Rian Johnson saved my childhood,What to say...
724,7,Great star wars movie but has room for improvement,"Beautiful filmmaking, Luke Skywalker is found again by Rey and new secrets are revealed about his past training with Ben Solo and his transformation to the dark side, Yoda makes a return and Rey faces Kylo in an extremely well choreographed fight sequence, Princess Leia is great in the film and Rey continues her journey to become the next Jedi warrior."
725,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever,"Worst Star Wars movie ever, continuing the destruction of Star Wars franchise started in the boring failed reboot: The Force Awakens. Between Rain Johnson and JJ, Disney made all the wrong calls. Gareth Edwards who did the only good one of the bunch Rogue One, Should of been in charge of all four movies instead of one.<br /><br />Like the failed force never re-woke movie. It trashes everything established by the classic originals and the prequels."
726,10,Finally Star Wars Drops Formula And Gives Us Something Fresh & Exciting,I am blown away by how amazing The Last Jedi is. Do not pay any mind to the butthurt DCEU fans that seem intent drive the score down for this film. They vow to do likewise with the upcoming avengers. Wise up people and check this movie out if you want to see it. You will not be disappointed. It's filled with twists and turns and exhilirating action. I've seen it twice already and I'm seeing it again tomorrow.
727,6,the story is getting repetitive and the dialogue silly,If You watch all the star wars movies in time sequence (the real one) it is curious how the constant improvement of the special effects corresponds exactly to the impoverishment of the story and the dialogues ... as if the money can only go here or there :-)<br /><br />Sadly it's true that we are in the age of images and not of words ...
728,1,How To Express My Disappointment,"When I saw the trailers my heart sank as I wondered, did they make the same mistakes of the prequels? Then I saw the professional reviews come out claiming ""Best Star Wars since Empire"" or ""Best Star Wars Ever. That's it. It's that simple"". Wow was I let down when I found the answer to my question was a resounding YES and that all these glowing reviews were completely wrong. Totally disappointed."
729,,Was a pain to watch this piece of c**p,"I didnt really like TFA much, but there was still some hope for the trilogy to become good (despite Mary Sue and Emo Ren..).<br /><br />After this movie there is only one way for Disney to save Star Wars and that is if in the first minutes of IX Luke wakes up on i.e. Tatooine, where he has his new jedi school, cold sweaty and realises those mushrooms he ate yesterday gave him some really crazy hallucinations. And hereafter episode VII and VIII will be remembered as ""Lukes bad dreams"""
730,9,Wow people really missed the boat,You will have to see this movie a 2nd time.. so much to process after 1 showing. Once you see it a second time its an amazing film. So many chances taken in this Star Wars film.. Some pay off and others may not. I applaud them with is movie. Bravo and I can't wait to see what trilogy Brian Johnson will be heading up in the near future.
731,7,easy to spot Disney was involved,This episode do has it moments but there was a bit of boredom too for me. I lost it after 90 minutes but luckily it picked up again. It wasn't full of action and there was a lot of blah blah going on.
732,10,Second only to The Empire Strikes Back,"What Rian Johnson accomplishes here is nothing short of a rebirth of the Skywalker saga. Like The Empire Strikes Back, Johnson focuses this movie on relationships and character arcs while completely subverting expectations of what Star Wars ""is""."
733,7,"Worth watching, but could be better","I give this film 7 stars just as I gave 7 stars to the third one...out of respect to the work put into into it and because I liked Kylo Ren and Rey characters and stories, and the intrigue between them. It was enough good to keep me interested despite many other flaws. But apart from this there is not much to watch the movie for...A lot of scenes feel like fillers and they are annoying because they add nothing and delay the interesting part that was too short to make a moview. If you throw all the unnecessary and boring stuff out, I believe it's possible to make one good episode out of these 2.<br /><br />It's still worth watching, but if I was to watch it again, I'd skip 1/3 of this episdode and 1/2 of the next one."
734,8,"A short review of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017)","I'll never be able to love ""Star Wars"" the way its lifelong fans do. After the unexpected magic of the first three films, the subsequent movies almost always seemed to me to be just space fantasies for kids, formulaically developed to hit all the right notes and sell licensed merchandise. (The exception would be last year's generally excellent ""Star Wars: Rogue One,"" which uniquely felt like a genuine, human story that a creator wanted to tell, rather than something brainstormed until consensus in a corporate writers' room.) With that said, I'll happily report here that ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was actually very good - as someone with little favorable bias toward the franchise, I'd rate it an 8 out of 10."
735,7,Did not need the casino,"To me, The Last Jedi was awesome in theatres, less awesome on home release. Mainly, it was ruined by Canto Bight. I remember sitting in the theatre feeling a sense of dissapointment I somehow did not notice until we bought a home release of this movie. I'll go into that right now."
736,2,What is this crap?,"A flick full of character misrepresentations, where the lore is ruined and nothing makes sense. Its sole purpose was to push an agenda."
737,8,"I feel the critics, but still loved it.","As I am getting older, I get less critical I would say. I see the intention of the movie and there is a lot to love, learn and feel good about this one."
738,7,"An ""ok"" movie if you have an open mind about it.","Given the 40 years of a legacy that Star Wars has, it is unfortunate that general filmgoer audinces have a limited criteria on what is alowed to actually happen in a Star Wars movie. (That only contributes to half the pressure of being the director of one of these things.)<br /><br />If Star Wars could also be ""a made for TV crime thriller"" like that of Breaking Bad then sure! We could be open to such twists and turns.<br /><br />But for a Big Blockbuster Space Opera that has growing story over mutiple movies... This a strait up middle finger to those expectations...!"
739,2,25 reasons why The Last Jedi is a FAILURE,"I had relatively high expectations of the Episode VIII. Unfortunately, ""The Last Jedi"" has so many plot holes, inconsistencies, ripoffs from previous movies, annoyingly flat and underdeveloped characters and dialogs... It definitely deserves all those bad reviews that it receives from the public. It could have been so much better..."
740,,The Best Entertainer you get at the year end..,"Pumpa pe pepepepi pe pepepepi pe pepepepe.. :D The Great, Legendary, John Williams' One of The Best Themes.. This is the First thing you'll hear when someone says ""Star Wars"", Isn't it.? ;) And our Desi awards stole even that :P"
741,10,Undeserved hate for a truly great Star Wars,"Guess you can say that I am a fan as I even saw ""A New Hope"" and its follow ups various times at the movies, whenever they originally came out. I really did not like the prequels (1-3) and I was okay with ""The Force Awakens"". This one, I loved again!"
742,6,"A missed opportunity, disappointing and frustrating.","The Last Jedi tries to do both: adding something new to the Star Wars series and rehashing pieces of the old movies. The result, however, feels very uneven: Lighthearted humor and awesome action on the one hand, disappointing and in some parts infuriatingly frustrating writing on the other hand."
743,8,Star Wars Schadenfreude!,"Well, well, a Star Wars for grown-ups."
744,7,At least it's less derivative than the previous was,"The First Order continue to track down the resistance, yet things certainly get unexpected toward the end and a big change occurs for both the Resistance and the First Order. I personally thought this was better than Episode VII in many ways. The story is a bit all over the place and a bit too long like most people have said, but it was still more unexpected than what Episode VII offered. I honestly liked the moments that didn't feel much like ""Star Wars"" moments (like the gambling planet scenes) because of how different they felt. Character development could maybe have been better, but to me it wasn't all that different compared to VII's development. Overall another decent, but not excellent, Star Wars film."
745,10,"My last but new hope to Luke Skywalker, overseen by the master observer, Terry Howletrax","The constitution, of the inverse of the eerie having illogically developed from the ordinary, isn't the meaning, of Luke Skywalker's astral projection to the planet of Crait from Ach-To on its own, but is the meaning of his said astral projection in relation to his earlier encounter with Yoda."
746,7,Ambivalent Reaction to One of My Favorite Director's Foray Into the Star Wars Universe,"I waited until after my second viewing and I had some time to fully digest the movie before penning my thoughts. These are not all of my opinions on the film, just the highlights."
747,3,It is time for STar Wars to end,"Sometimes there is the situation, when you want to say or do something, but not knowing why, you do the opposite. The same must have been with the Disney executives, who read the script of The Last Jedi by Ryan Johnson. They wanted to say something like ""What?!?!"". Instedy they uttered: ""Excellent! Let's do this!"". Here is how The Last Jedi buried the Star Wars franchice once and for all."
748,10,it has porgs,The movie has porgs... and good characters .case closed
749,7,"Nothing new, but entertaining","The film has many script holes, which has been around since the beginning of this new trilogy. It seems to follow the same line of the main trilogy, it doesn't bring anything very different. Ignoring these factors, it is a film with great special effects, the actors are good at the characters and fulfill the role of entertaining."
750,1,"Tried hard to like it, but I just can't unfortunately","I watched this in the theatre, convinced myself that it was a good movie. A couple of hours after the showing, I sensed there was something not quite right about the movie. Then it was released on bluray, and I gave it another chance. Same thing happens.. I got disappointed once again,. I tried to watch it with the director's opinions and responses (after the mass criticisms from fans) in my mind, but still something doesn't feel right about the movie. I read most of the reviews here on imdb, and I have to say I agree with most of the people here that rated it low, as their opinions made sense. The funny thing is that a lot of the reviewers here on imdb that rated the movie high, do not state the actual reasons why they think its good. Probably because there is no way to defend the illogical points of the movie, other than that the director tried to go a total different route of what fans expected of the storyline. When you get over your head and try to be too creative with the storyline, this is what happens..plotholes all over the place. And I believe the people who liked the movie, might have overanalyzed it and the director's vision. In reality I do not think he intended such a deep meaning with the storyline, most of it could be coincidence. And his later explanations of intended deep meanings of the storyline might just be based on what other people overanalyzed after watching the movie. I mean, if it was that good and respected storyline from the beginning, Mark Hamill wouldn't have expressed such negative opinions during the productions. You can almost see the man bursting in agony in various interviews, but obviously he cannot speak too freely for some reason. I do hope episode 9 will redeem the damages that have been done..sigh.."
751,,What happened?,Can anyone tell me what happened in this movie? I'm still lost.
752,10,Star Wars The last Jedi Teachings,"Let start that this movie is the end of a new beginning and many people that are star wars fan will be disappointed but for those that know that is the end of the line for the Skywalker family. This is the end and is the perfect beginning for a new trilogy. Director and Writer Rian Johnson did an amazing work together with the Disney story writer team. <br /><br />I went to the movie not expecting what I saw, specially Luke story Arc that was enough for me to prove that the movie had a point to teach us about Failure. Yes we don't have the heroes that we grow up seeing is true I wont take that away, but heroes to can fail and be weak and that is the greats teach in this movie. To accept our failure and take on responsibly of our mistake, Luke run away to hide from the mistake that he make with Ben Solo( Kylo ren) creating the monster that he so much fear.<br /><br />Another point that I want to add is that many people are disappointed with who Rey real parents are and I even wonder did you really watch the FA because it was state very clear that her parents were No body. This also teach us that you don't need to come from a very special blood line to have that type of raw power, untamed power.<br /><br />And that in mind is the main reason they gave the next trilogy to work on to Rian Johnson. He will bring a new generation of force user stronger than before in the force, he will bring the balance to this new uncharted territory of the universe of star wars.<br /><br />I will have to say that performer wise Luke , Rey and Kylo were amazing and beyond my expectation the throne scene what a scene it was amazing and the slow motion that make my poor lungs to stop breathing for a second or how good and stratify was to see that scene breath taking. Humor level was good I enjoy Poe much more this time than in the FA. Finn and Rose story arc it was good and safe play, that what I felt the majority of the time that I was watching it, I even though for a second that I step in back in Hunger Games but let no go there. Leia last performed was amazing it was more of Carrier Fisher personality in this movie than Leia. "
753,6,Flying Casually In a Non-Spoiler Last Jedi Review,"Since J.J. Abrams' THE FORCE AWAKENS (albeit criticized for being too unoriginal) introduced a band of endearing, worthwhile characters, Rian Johnson obviously knew he had to make the second new STAR WARS get right down to business and, although the first fifteen minutes halts more than flows, there's a point where things open up nicely..."
754,8,A great film that shows what new and fascinating things can happen in the Star Wars universe.,"After the success of Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015), director Rian Johnson had to strike a fine balance in the following sequel, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017). Since The Force Awakens was essentially a flashy, rehash of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), The Last Jedi needed to separate itself from the predictable path already laid out in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Unfortunately, the formula employed in Empire Strikes Back has become so integral to sequels that deviating from it could prove to be disastrous. While I'm curious where Episode IX will go from here, I hope it builds upon what Johnson has done here. The tensions of war helped drive the characters into interesting moments of growth, defiance, and desperation, but much of the story was well wrapped up by the time the credits rolled."
755,6,Just... Um... Fly Casual,"Since J.J. Abrams' THE FORCE AWAKENS, albeit criticized for being too lightweight and unoriginal, did introduce some endearing, worthwhile characters, Rian Johnson obviously knew he had to make the second new STAR WARS get right down to business and, although the first fifteen minutes halts more than flows, there's a point where things open up nicely..."
756,9,This is Chewbacca,"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed Last Jedi Haters Club, I have one final thing I want you to consider. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about it; that does not make sense!"
757,7,"Acceptable, but some things weren't very logical","I agree with a lot of the points of the really low rating reviews, yet I also disagree with some and think overall the movie is acceptable. I won't get too deep into it, I want to keep it Spoiler-free."
758,1,The Last Jedi is a Disgrace to Every Star Wars Film That Came Before It,"The Last Jedi is obsessed with the fallacious idea that in order to move forward you have to destroy everything that came before. It is as if someone walked into the Louvre and said ""you guys need to stop holding onto the past,"" and then threw a torch down, cackling as hundreds of years of irreplaceable works of art burned to the ground, and then, standing triumphantly on the ashes, drew a smiley face."
759,8,Luke is the good part,"Not a fan of how Luke is? Oh, I guess you didn't realize many years and harsh realities of life could harden people. I love the portrayal and the turn around. The rest of the movie... Well... Ya. Let's not talk about that"
760,7,White supremacy at it best suppliers,Fin who is black shows himself to be a coward <br /><br />And his one good deed doesn't happen because this movie can't let black people save the day<br /><br />What no one mentions <br /><br />Admiral Ackbar the beloved character who was there when the death star blew up and other great moments dies with no fanfare<br /><br />A who cares moment just so the a white lady can try to save the fleet and the end of then movie <br /><br />You only have 4 characters you might care about<br /><br />all white<br /><br />Kyle<br /><br />Rey<br /><br />Poe<br /><br />And the general
761,2,Mixed feelings (contains spoilers),I just got back after watching the last jedi and i still dont really know if i found this movie good or bad. 
762,,"Never mind the plot; watch for interesting characters, brilliant set pieces and nostalgic moments","The original Star Wars trilogy (1977-1983) created a new escapism universe ""far, far away"" that gave Middle Earth a run for its money. The second trilogy (1999-2005), a prequel, was generally considered a disappointment. This grand conclusion, starting with ""The Force awakens"" two year ago, was a successful launch of a mission impossible, continuing the saga when there appeared to be no more stories to tell. The magical combination of vitality of the new and nostalgia of the old worked! ""The last Jedi"" has proven itself a worth follow-up. "
763,9,"One of the best Star Wars yet! First half of review is spoiler free, then the spoilers are clearly marked","I'm surprised to hear about all the criticism this film is taking. It only seems fair then to start this review off by looking at what the general criticisms have been and my take on them, and then we'll move on to the rest of the review. And for anyone who hasn't seen the film, most of what I'll talk about can be gathered from the trailers, and I'll save any spoilers for the end and mark them off clearly, so you can read on without a nervous eye. With that said, although the trailers don't ruin the film, I was glad I avoided them before watching the film (and the first thing I did after watching was go back and watch the trailers to see if I did in fact make the right decision)."
764,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,"An enraged Luke Skywalker, a ritzy Cantina revision, a few out of place comic bits, an occasional whipping camera movement from the guy who made Looper. That's some of the things you'll experience if you take in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (my latest review). "
765,10,Just a Legend.,"The Star Wars films are a unique and unusual anomaly in an otherwise saturated lineup of blockbusters in its entire long running history. Other than the fact that it is a huge global phenomenon and the sci-fi classic that most filmmakers wouldn't have possibly conceptualized, it also has a drawbacks because of this status. It's almost as if each movie now have to live to the lightning that the original trilogy caught in a bottle. That there would be certain rules, expectations and certain events that must take place in order for it to be accepted. However, here comes Episode VIII, a film that unequivocally subverts and challenges the very foundations of an already 40 year old saga. It's one of the first Star Wars films, since Empire, that makes us question more about the fundamental themes that drive this saga, while crafting a film that is bold, elegant, emotional and completely thrilling."
766,6,Solid Meh,"This wasn't the worst thing to happen to Star Wars like some are saying (that would be the prequels) but it certainly wasn't great either. It felt like they simply took moments from ESB and ROTJ and copy/paste rearranged them. You had the base escape from ESB only here it was at the end, you had the confrontation with the ""emperor"" character from Jedi only here it was 2/3 through, you had the training from ESB only here it was the beginning, etc. Overall there were some totally terrible moments, i.e.) Leia floating through space that were laugh out loud bad, a completely pointless Finn whose entire sub plot could probably have been cut, and still no explanation as to who Snoke was, or how he came to power, or anything. Then Luke was a whiny coward and Leia had the worst smoker's voice imaginable. Overall there were some things I liked, some things I hated, and it left me not caring as much as to where it's going whereas TFA left me wanting to see what was coming next. Turning Luke into a ghost ... hey, where'd I see that before? Oh yeah, ANH ending... ugh. How about something new please?"
767,8,It's not that bad!,"Jeez, guys, come on. I don't like writing on here but some of these reviews, ""I feel like America is finished"", that's just hilarious. "
768,7,TLJ is the second best Star Wars film,"I watched The Last Jedi. Before you start hating this review, let me be honest. Star Wars 8 is the SECOND best Star Wars film. I know Luke Skywalker(you know what)at the end of the film. But, Star Wars does not only focus on three characters. Sometimes, to boost up the ratings, they decide to add new characters."
769,1,Member for 13 years and this is the first time I have to review.,"Where to start? <br /><br />I've no idea, literally none. When your film is massively inferior to The Phantom Menace you know you have a bad film on your hands. The first thing I'd like to point out is the worst case of man-hating on a film I have ever seen. Literally EVERY single woman in the film is a superhero (Super Leia is the best example) Even the one female baddie is depicted as someone you should pity, but without exception every man is either stupid/cowardly/sinister/insane or pointless - even to the point when a man tries to do one heroic thing he gets stopped from doing by a woman for, reasons. Plot holes galore (How does someone who has no substance in one scene embrace someone in another?) The ripped off new hope in the last one, and this one tries to do a greatest hits of empire and jedi but manages to make it completely uninteresting. Disney please stop this, just make a normal film for a change, we the public are sick of agenda movies."
770,9,Fun sci action,After really enjoying the force awakens I was glad that a second part was made for this it's great to see all the characters from the last adventure back for a new journey.
771,6,Masterful; 2nd time's the charm.,2 weeks ago in a theater not that far away... 
772,3,"DONT WATCH IF YOU ENJOYED ""A New Hope, Empire, and Return of Jedi (SPOLERS BELOW!!!!!)","Waited for this to come out of DVD, and watched it with my brother. Was really really excited for this movie. I was looking forward to finding out who Rey was, what Luke Skywalker found out in his search for the last Jedi Temple as said back in Force Awakens, and who Snoke might of been."
773,,The actual worst Star Wars movie,"It's insane that The Last Jedi managed to be worse than The Phantom Menace. Where can you even start? The only positive thing about the entire movie are the effects and that's not a selling point in 2017. People like to hate on The Force Awakens (rightfully so to some degree) but this movie not only renders TFA completely irrelevant but it also managed to make everything worse. Plot points that were established in the previous movie are simply ignored or finished in ways that contradict important lore. Luke Skywalker was completely ruined as a character. Maybe they tried to simplify him so that he fits in with Emo Ren or Rey Sue, there is no logical explanation for his sudden change of personality and goals. Mark Hamill was extremely unhappy with the direction his character and SW itself is going but they just ignored him anyway. It's hard to write a review without spoilers so all i can do is repeat what Hamill himself said about TLJ: ""If you think you're gonna go into the movie and recapture your childhood, you set yourself up for disappointment"". The trio from the OT signed their contracts before Disney acquired the IP. They were all extremely unhappy with that decisions. Now they are finally free from the devil. Let's hope our suffering won't last much longer."
774,9,Hope kindles as the last Jedi lives,This one many elements deciphering the power of the force and its impact upon the mind. As Leia and her resistance offer a challenging fight to the first order Rey finds her way to Luke to train as a Jedi. The force is felt for deeply by her.<br /><br />Snope plays games through the minds of Rey and Kylo Ren. The weakness of Rey into searching for her parents is used more than once but she turns out victorious.<br /><br />Satisfying moment was Kylos killing of the supreme leader but this did not last long as he decided to continue with the dark forces.<br /><br />Among the interesting moments were Luke's heroic arrival at the end to save the small group of resistance escape. Poe's bravery was halted by the patriotism of the new Vice Admiral. Her sacrifice in helping the resistance escape was touching.<br /><br />Few moments of disappointments were also there like Rey's arising as the Jedi all of a sudden but then it's a fantasy! This part makes the viewer much tempted into watching the next part. Much awaited.
775,7,"Good Enough trip to a galaxy far, far away...","If you have seen - and enjoyed - a Star Wars movie, then THE LAST JEDI will be an entertaining way to spend 2 1/2 hours. Most of the ""old standbys"" are there - space battles, heroes in peril, interesting creatures, above average acting with characters that are watchable on the big screen and special effects that are as good as anything you will see in the movies."
776,9,Star Wars The Last Jedi,"Star Wars Episode VIII is truly mainly about the denouement of the story of Jedi master Luke Skywalker who Luke´s own Jedi master makes a cameo as a spirit of the force and assuages the conscience of the conflicted but always good Luke. It is a wonder and awed spectacle each time the elderly countenance of Luke Skywalker appears in the screen, every time is it as awed impressive as the first time Mark Hamill face appeared to see at Rey in the mountain island, the sacred temple island of the Jedi where there are the ancient canon texts of the Jedi, the tree of the Jedi and even a dark side cave under the sea. To see Luke Skywalker in the Last Jedi has the same feeling as in The Force Awakens when Luke grizzly face appears for the first time, now in the Last Jedi is a joy to see Luke Skywalker, and to understand that Luke is played by the same actor that 40 years ago appeared in a New Hope in 1977 and how Mark Hamill had grown old with his character Luke, truly this is one of the best cinema experiences that had transpired as a cinema lover. Now after all this good feelings of joy to finally see Luke Skywalker again and he does speak this time, it is time to get to the film. Again this is Luke´s story and how he has to see what Yoda saw in him so many years ago, when like Luke was now, Yoda had run away after the failures of the wisest of Jedi masters, to stop the rise of Dark Sideus in The Revenge of the Sith. Yoda exiled himself like his student does now, when Luke after his own failures exiled himself in the ocean world island, Yoda and Luke are similar and there is a lot of hope that now Rey who eventually like Yoda did with Luke, now Luke also does with Rey, he reluctantly would become the master Jedi of Rey who would become a Jedi knight and now a Jedi herself, Rey finally can have the teacher and also like Han Solo before, the father she never have. Luke is disillusioned, saddened, depressed, defeated after his failures with Ben Solo, his nephew, he cannot forgive himself from failing to avert the rise of the First Order, and like Anakin before him, Ben Solo followed his grandfather footsteps to make the Sith liked First Order rise in power like Darth Vader did with the rise of the Empire. This is in fact very interesting as is a fact that the creator and the genius who created Star Wars, George Lucas had read 10 000 books in his library and he had read a huge amount of history to create a hugely complex political world in space. One of the themes of the Last Jedi is that although History does not repeat itself, History continue to happen in similar ways, like a wise Levant king once said, there is nothing new under the sun, that is in fact History and George Lucas as the creator of the Star Wars universe, and seeing the complexities of both the rise of the Sith Empire with the help of Darth Vader and the rise of the First Order with the rise of Ben Solo or styled himself Kylo Ren, it can be seen that the director and producers clearly are learned men and women who grasped the historical significance of George Lucas masterpiece. <br /><br />Luke lives in the island like Yoda, because he wants to escape as far away as he could from his failures in this case Ben Solo, Luke knows he failed him as a Jedi master, he was Ben Solo teacher, and he was his nephew and for a mistake Luke makes when he saw how much darkness was inside Ben Solo, the drama is explained in three great scenes of the Rubicon moment, the no turning back between Luke and Ben Solo, the scene is depicted three times, first as the Luke perspective of the events, then Kylo Ren more visceral version and then most likely the truth of the event as the confrontation between Rey and Luke when Rey demands the truth from Luke. When the story is told finally with veracity, Rey sees wisely that Luke should forgive himself, and that Luke did not failed Ben Solo, the fact was that Ben Solo failed his master, also the same way Anakin failed his master and father in Obi Wan Kenobi in Revenge of the Sith. <br /><br />Luke is a good man, has always been a hopeful man, he is the man who believed in the Dark Sith Lord Darth Vader in the Return of the Jedi, Luke´s hope has always been vital to Star Wars, and now seeing Luke a broken man, without faith or hope, it is melancholic and sad but all hope and all fight is not gone from the Last Jedi as he will fight one more time. The answers of Rey´s parentage are not given and it is obvious that the corrupt, insidious, malevolent, liar, pernicious Ben Solo, Kylo Ren is not saying the truth about Rey´s parents. The questions of Rey´s parentage and heritage are not given, and one wonders when if ever the questions will ever be answered, who are Rey´s parents, that question keeps Star Wars fans awake at night and the answer is still not given evidently and Rey wonder still who her parents are and although Kylo Ren tells Rey that he knows who Rey parents are, there is little and actually no reason to believe a liar tongue Ben Solo, there is more in Rey´s parents question and hopefully in Episode IX the questions will be answered at last with no gray area with definitive faces as the origin of Rey, everyone wants to know, Rey too wants to know, Star Wars fans demand real answers. <br /><br />Well, as good as the Last Jedi is, the other parts of the movie when Luke, Rey, are not in are not as good, those scenes are hard to watch, boring even, without much of anything happening. This at the end of the movie becomes a dual match between the two sides of the force, the light and the dark side, represented in Rey´s hopeful side and the hateful and resentful and unforgiving dark side of Kylo Ren and Ben Solo. Overall the Last Jedi is a great movie that is not a masterpiece because of the weaknesses of the other characters and the scenes where there is not much of anything happening, this must be attended to by the producers and directors of the next movies, as there has to be an investment and good writing to make the other character´s arcs and scenes and stories better than the ones in the Last Jedi, perhaps that is the chatter about some fans are talking about in the media, the movie can be better. But as a Star War fans of the older movies, there is a need to tell the truth, if you loved the young Luke Skywalker learning from an elder Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope and now you see an elder Luke Skywalker teaching Rey, the new Jedi, you feel happy that the Last Jedi is a great epic poem about one of their heroes, Luke Skywalker and when Luke Skywalker again walks in the sky and in a powerful and beautiful scene when there is the sun, the heat of life, the sun is beginning to dusk and the twilight, nightfall and before the sun goes down, Luke is there in the sky fighting in a astral form and in another plane, with his great power and concentration, he can even change and touch events millions of miles away and when Luke Skywalker, a great Jedi master finally like the sun light at twilight needs to rest, when Luke helps the light and uses the force once again, there is like one of his students say, the new Jedi, that Luke had finally find the peace and the purpose that he had wanted all along, like Obi Wan Kenobi, Yoda before him, the force is one with all and Luke hopefully will teach Rey more like Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda continued to teach Luke all along, the Last Jedi is a potent, powerful love poem for one of Star Wars heroes, Luke Skywalker that in a defeated stated said that the Jedi because of their hubris, arrogance had made possible the rise of the Sith Empire in the zenith of their power, and now it was time for the Jedi to end, but the last Jedi saw Rey and perhaps he saw in Rey himself, and against his wishes, the Last Jedi did not let the Jedi order to end, the Last Jedi taught another student, a Jedi knight, a new Jedi to take his place in the sun, and Rey does promised Luke that she will not be like the disappointment student Ben Solo, that Ben Solo failed Luke, and Rey promises that she will not fail the Last Jedi, that she will be a good students, and seeing Daisy Ridley comely, nice, innocent face one believes her and there is hope for the Jedi and for Luke´s legacy and that there could be balance again in the force, Rey is hope, Rey is light like Luke before her, now it is Rey´s time to shine in the light."
777,6,Need the Force to Watch This,"I went and saw this today. I read reviews and they were not stellar so I went to see for myself which is the ultimate individual test. Hmmm. The magic is definitely lacking both Disney and Star Wars magic that is. However the viewer is in need of magic-wanting badly. What happened here? The characters are not interesting, the tired plot is the same and with all this technology people still fight with hand guns? Even jumping to light speed is old and boring. There were so many we are running out of time scenarios that one wonders why there is no time management? What really woke me up is two scenes where they show the cockpit of a fighter with toggle switches that go click? When Luke Skywalker the hero of all the old-time Lucas movies finally comes on screen I was expecting some really nice mastering of the Force that even puts Yoda to shame. But alas, the Force appears to be tired, lacks motivation and even when they wish each other the famous phrase ""may the force be with you"" after watching Luke I wonder what good is this to wish for? We need someone with vision to step up and really use the force that we all know and love and grew up with. To the credit of the film, it will bring in 1 billion or more and set-up Star Wars themes at the Disney Parks but for how long? Bring back the old reliable formula that works namely you"
778,8,People are overseeing the details,"I get it. You either hate this movie, or you love it. It's totally understandable why people tend to hate it, but we have to see beyond what we ""expect"" and what our first impressions are. There is more underneath what we apparently see..."
779,6,R.I.P. Carrie Fisher(1956-2016).,I am writing the review for Star Wars The Last Jedi out of respect for the late Carrie Fisher who tragically passed away due to a heart attack on 27 December 2016. Her legacy will forever be immortalized in this film. I also want to say that I'm a big fan of Mark Hamill who plays the iconic character Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars franchise. This marks his fifth appearance following Star Wars The Force Awakens(2015). I respect him very much. He was my childhood hero - and still is. He gives his last best performance on screen.
780,2,Maybe Storytelling is a Lost Art,"Bottom Line: The Last Jedi was a pointless story with pointless character deaths that undermined the Star Wars universe.<br /><br />Maybe Disney knows how to make money and good movies are just not the way. This new trilogy is doing very well for Disney, but is a mashup of recycled clips that completely miss the point of why they were there originally. Middle movies are always difficult, but The Last Jedi was particularly devastating to the Star Wars universe. As a Star Wars fan, I'm a little tired of the ""good guys"" being the underdogs and fighting the big evil. These movies would have been much more believable and interesting if the Republic was starting to reestablish itself and the First Order was becoming a credible ISIS like threat. Snoke ended up being a non-player in this new universe, so they should have skipped him completely and had Kylo Ren as a want-to-be emperor instead of a want-to-be Darth Vader.<br /><br />These movies have no discernible theme, so far. The original 6 were about the redemption of Anakin through a prophecy that said he would destroy the Sith, but left out that he would destroy the Jedi and himself in the process (the force needs balance after all). The Jedi were the imbalance and Anakin set the force right by embracing the dark side and destroying them all. These larger themes are forgotten in this new trilogy leaving them hollow with little more to think about than what merchandising will come from them. What is more difficult to grasp is that most of the plot elements dead ended leaving you with the feeling that you wasted all of that precious screen time.<br /><br />One of the greatest tragedies was how R2-D2 was left as a nostalgic prop. In the original 6 R2-D2 was the one who guided the fate of the galaxy by subtle influence on everyone else, and was the only character who knew the whole story from beginning to end. In The Last Jedi he is nothing more than an old robot and his significance was missed completely.<br /><br />A few interesting things that occurred if we view the movie as a series of clips, Force Skyping was an interesting addition to a universe that did not have this type of communication in 1977. The concept of good and evil being a matter of perspective, how arms dealers sold to both sides, and how the Force is bigger than the Jedi were more realistic elements then the black and whiteness of the original view of the world.<br /><br />There are too many ridiculous plot elements to go through here, such as the resistance fleet very slowly getting away for the entire movie, and Rey being upset by Kylo Ren not wearing a shirt as if the destroyed AT-AT remnant she was living under in the desert her entire life as a scavenger had strict fashion protocols.<br /><br />Overall, it's another mish mash of recycled concepts that miss the point. Just watch the original trilogy again and sit this one out."
781,10,Very much a Star Wars movie in the tradition of the original,Non spoilery party: 
782,7,Not everything is fair in Star Wars,"I'm fan of Star Wars for all my life, i don't remember the first time I saw Episode IV. So when I see something I don't like in Star Wars I try to act as if someone familiar had done something wrong, trying to look the bright side and defending him with every argument I have. But there are some kind of things you just can't ignore."
783,1,I wish there is a way to delete this movie and do again from scratch,"Poor story, full of inconsistencies and stupid jokes.<br /><br />Some ideas are so wrong that they made me wish for skip entirely this story and do the last episode as nothing happened."
784,,"Such a terrible movie, Disney has put nail in the coffin for this one","All we have wanted was explanation for the plot from ep VII. ep VII was bad, and this one should have made things much better, but oh boy, was i ever so wrong. This movie is terrible. No character development, no story, cringy jokes and worst of all no backstory or explanation for anything that's happening. Everyone, Luk, Leia, Snoke, Rey, they all had terrible terrible scenes that completely ruined their characters, i can't believe it. I was so angry when the movie had ended, i almost cried because i don't want to hate Star Wars, i love Star Wars, but this, this thing has ruined Star Wars experience for many people!"
785,8,why so much hate...,Just saw this and though it was better than the last one....Han's kid got real strong real fast no more mysterious than the girl in the last move.....I liked it
786,7,I ABSOLUTELY understand the Hate,"Let me be frank, I ran for A New Hope and Empire once I was done watching this over-inflated film. BUT, I can't help but feel it was attempting to tread on new territory and build on what was already established. Unfortunately, it carries the burden of a 7 movies before it, so a LOT of comparisons will be drawn to it. This is very much like Empire. She goes to train with a reluctant Jedi master as her friends are fighting to stay ahead of impending doom. We even get Lando's doppleganger in Benicio Del Toro. If you ever wanted to get a sense of Lando and Han's relationship...this seems to be an echo of what may have transpired.<br /><br />I don't blame Star Wars fans for blasting this. The jokes are pretty much parody of itself. The characters do dumb stuff. And lead characters are separated. My guess...to introduce more people into the new universe. Why am I giving it a favorable review?<br /><br />It's so well made. Much like the Spielberg/Lucas teaming, you can tell Rian Johnson makes...films. Rogue One seemed to be movie by committee. Though I don't think Johnson has the pixie dust buoyant touch of JJ Abrams, I can tell he is adding much more academia to future episodes. So this is more about the hope of better things coming up rather than what I've seen. Take that for what it's worth. As a film, there are heartbreaking moments that I won't get into. But it tugs at your memories in a good way. You sense Han Solo's presence, but...it seems so long ago. And how they handle Luke and Leia made me misty for the ol' days. Forget the underlying political junk of this era if you can. To me when we age out, it's always a sense of moving forward."
787,10,lord of the rings in space ...best star wars movie yet,"Okaay ...I am here as film lover and addict more than being a star wars fanboy...all I want a great film ...star wars saga has great films ....I went looking for something themetically rich ..high in drama ....action ...some comedy...darker tone ...innovative plot .....after leaving the theatre I got all of this and more than expected...so why many star wars fans didnt like it ....well to be honest the film is more of a film than a starwars film ...which in my opinion makes it even greater...I accept fans will not like because they wanted the legacy of star wars to continue which btw opposes the film idea ....the film's has so many themes about present past and future and parentage and the idea of becoming special .....this film is DEEP emotionally as it explores the idea of being special at a diferent angle ....I generally hate the idea that someone is special because he is son of ""...."" or he is special because he has lots of power ....the movie totaally opposes that idea ...the film in my opinion made star wars a lot better instead of relying on the originals it is a film that wants became something new ....the problem that fans hates anything new they want reboots of the originals that is the truth ....this film however is something on its own separated themetically from other starwras films and building its won stiuation and ideas on its own .....for me as scifi fan and also a lover for great star wars film ...this is an epic scale entertaining adventure with darker tone filled lighthearted moments and poster like images that sticks to your head forever with high concepts and better world building .....it is totally unforgettable ....BEST STAR WARS FILM EVER MADE because it solved in my opinion many problems in the entire saga and made it more richer and more entertaing than before a thousand times however people will hate it because it is less star wars than before ....which makes it my opinion better star wars"
788,7,Disappointing,The saga continues as the First Order try to finally crush the rebellion.
789,9,The Last Jedi: A Force to be Reckoned With,"Attention all Star Wars fans and general audiences alike! The Last Jedi is a galactic adventure that is not to be missed. This film continues the story of the Skywalker saga with an unexpected plot, beautiful cinematography, and jaw-dropping action scenes."
790,7,"Where There is Light, There is Dark","The level of anticipation was overwhelming. Between being a life long, die-hard Star Wars fan, and falling in love with 'The Force Awakens', the stage was set for a gargantuan sequel. There are positives, there are negatives, light and dark. Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (TLJ) ultimately has left me much like Kylo Ren; conflicted."
791,2,Utterly shambolic.,"This film is just awful. It's a real insult to Star Wars fans and casual cinema goers alike. The story contradicts previous films, in particular makes a mockery of Luke's journey to become a jedi. There are several characters who serve no purpose to the story and are simply annoying. The story goes off on pointless tangents which just waste time and detract from the flow of the movie. Finally there are multiple continuity errors which are really obvious and just plain sloppy and unprofessional on the filmmakers part."
792,10,Very well done!,"I really do not understand the hate. As a Star Wars fan (and by fan I mean both movies and video games, yes the classics too) I thought this was very well done. Yes I was dissapointed with a specific character but it really depends on what is going to happen in episode IX. The story is good, the movie is a ride from the start to the end. It's spectacular, unpredictable and frustrating in a good way. If you go to the movie to just hate it you better stay home. If you really go as a fan you will 100% enjoy the movie. I might say it's one of the top episodes of Star Wars! "
793,7,A Good Movie with obvious problems.,"I have always been a Sat Wars fan,and the events while a fan doesn't necessarily want to see, i understand we need to. I will start with the good points, great acting, a decent and mostly like-able plot and while it is similar to Empire Strikes Back, it does a good job at being different. It' entertaining, keeps you engaged and the characters offer great growth."
794,1,I came to see this to have a good laugh,"But it is so gray and long and boring and idiotic, it was horrible, i couldn't even laugh at it. Whatever, alright, Leia is a superhero now, why not, let's see---oh she's gonna be in a coma for the rest of the ****you movie."
795,,Very disappointing,I thought Star Wars happens in a clean and fun star. What was this? I am a clean Canadian woman and I had to take my niece and nephew who live with us because they wanted to see it. I don't know why. I guess they share a bed and they get ideas from each other. Anyway I told both Mary Sue and Billy Bob that this is it. They need to grow up and stop watching these films. Woman this woman that minority this sequel that.
796,10,"A unique, but masterful entry! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com)","With the longest runtime in the whole franchise, the 2 hour and 32 minute duration strangely feels a lot shorter than that, which in this case is a good thing! There isn't one scene or act that bored me, and the excellent direction and narrative, by Rian Johnson, keeps you captivated instantly. The characters of Rey, Finn, Poe, Luke, Leia, and even BB-8 are fleshed out and explored thoroughly, we even learn more about their interesting pasts, and this is particularly important with the newer characters to the series like Rey and Finn etc. With The Force Awakens, we hardly knew anything about our main heroes, and you couldn't feel attached to them, but The Last Jedi excels at creating multi dimensional and layered characters; they don't seem like cardboard cut-outs in any way."
797,7,Tasteful,"The movie may be criticized for it's lack of connections to the original movie but at the end of the day it's Star Wars and no matter how bad it gets we are all going to watch it, I knew it wasn't going to perform well but it's good to re-live the old times of Star Wars with a new story and new places, so if you are someone who wants to enjoy a nice lighthearted space adventure I would recommend it."
798,8,Mark Hamill is a great actor - the only worthy point in this movie,"First of all, this is a well-made movie, better than most out these days.<br /><br />On the other hand, it has absolutely destroyed another part of Star Wars. And well, nothing else left from now on. "
799,6,Stars Wars The Last Jedi: Episode 8 is all about heroes and legends.,"Fantasy Sci-fi adventure, which picks up directly from where 'The Force Awakens' ends. The film starts with the distinctive, unmistakable screen crawl and straight into a space battle action sequence. "
800,10,Thrilling and Captivating than previous chapters,"The story unfolded to the unexpected death of Snoke, Luke's final showdown, multiple battle scenes, animated creatures and extraordinary graphics. The new resistance is here and darkness will fear it"
801,6,The installment that divided the Star Wars fandom completely,"I must say that this film seemed to me something simple and basic, with a lack of development. There were more interesting things to know about Star Wars, but here it felt like a forced sequel. The only positive thing I can say is that at least it's entertaining and why Kylo Ren became a Sith wasn't bad, but I think more context was needed. The saddest thing is that it was from here that the fans and the companies ended up falling out. With episode 7, everything was going well, but the change of course in the new trilogy did not improve things. I don't know what else to say, but without a doubt this is the lowest installment of the saga and that cannot be discussed. My rating for this movie is 6/10."
802,1,Dissapointing,The franchise has always been a favorite but after this i am actually done...
803,10,Rey's parents are...now a matter of record.,"Two years after The Force Awakens rocked the sleeping giant to life, and left audiences with so many questions and so few answers, the franchise fell into the lap of Rian Johnson. As a director known to not be afraid to take risks, this second installment in the new trilogy proves his pedigree."
804,6,Very Shaky Start Still Leads to a Satisfying Second Half From Amateur Writer Rian Johnson,"What made Rogue One: A Star Wars Story so compelling is that is was a superbly written, ORIGINAL story. It masterfully filled the small gap before ""A New Hope,"" and that was largely what made most fans love the film."
805,1,"After seeing it for a second time, I think this is the worst star wars movie ever!!!",Stay away from this movie and stick with the originals and don't go see The Rise of Skywalker.
806,,Spaceballs 2,"Oh, man. what are they doing?! The Force Awakens was deeply flawed but showed some potential of where they might go with the rest."
807,9,Incredibly bold sequel,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is an incredibly bold sequel that delivers a Star Wars film that's bold, thrilling and unpredictable, subverting expectations in extremely enjoyable ways. Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega once again give incredible performances. Mark Hamill gives the best performance of the film and his best performance as Luke Skywalker yet. Rian Johnson's direction is incredible, staging thrilling action sequences and one of the best lightsaber fights of all time. The music by John Williams is once again incredible and the CG is flawless. Newcomers Kelly Marie Tran, Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern all give great performances. The film also has a good balance of nostalgia and bold new decisions. However, the opening is a little too slow."
808,7,Every Review of what you just wrote was wrong.,"This movie is underrated. People need to forget about its flaws and focus on what really matters. Luke may not have returned as a triumphant hero, but now, its up to Rey. So please, stop insulting the movie. It will not be the last Film"
809,8,I'm hardcore sw fan and it aint that bad...,"This ones better than the other 2..rogue 1 is the only true to sw film outside 77,80&83...and is a belter!!!! This is ok though..."
810,6,Star Wars : The Last Jedi was more of a visual spectacle then narrative storyline.,"Although The Last Jedi meets a relatively high standard for franchise filmmaking, Johnson's effort is ultimately a minor disappointment. That doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Rather, despite the success of ""The Last Jedi"" at supplying jaw-dropping visuals and a hall-of-fame-worthy lightsaber battle, audiences could presumably skip this film and with a low Rotten Tomatoes audience score, maybe something went wrong with the film. Never the less, The Last Jedi keeps on the saga of Star Wars Series and I can say, I am waiting for Episode IX"
811,9,Resistance is on the brink of destruction.,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Resistance is on the brink of destruction. And again, a distant, distant galaxy. Luke Skywalker returns after a huge number of years, back to the screens, and it's hard to judge whether it turned out well or badly. The film itself was shot perfectly, the script also turned out to be fascinating and almost 2 and a half hours fly by unnoticed. What caught my eye was stupid and unnecessary jokes in many places. When the intensity of passions seems to be already at the limit and such a joke flies out and immediately everything goes out. Otherwise, The Last Jedi is a good continuation of the franchise with, as always, a lot of fights and various planets with creatures."
812,7,Star Wars something: The Black and Red One.,I am a proud nerd and a Star Wars fan and a movie buff and I've already forgotten which number this is.
813,1,This is not the movie you're looking for........,Complete and utter trash written by a complete and utter moron who has no understanding of Star Wars or the myths and philosophies behind it's creation.
814,8,Bold risk-taking that mostly pays off,'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is written and directed by Rian Johnson and stars most of the same cast from the previous installment with one new addition of Kelly Marie Tran who plays a character named Rose. This is the first Star Wars film written and directed by one person since the prequels with George Lucas- An important point to make since one can definitely sense that there is a singular vision at play here. The visual style is unlike anything we've seen before in this franchise and that is most likely down to Johnson's sensibilities. There is breathtaking moment at a certain point in the movie where all sound is cut out and you're just left with the images of an epic moment and it is really something to behold. 
815,7,The difficult middle film is still ok,It's always hard to pitch the middle film in s trilogy especially one as high profile at this but this film does ok even a few years on.
816,1,Sick to my Stomach,"I'll go ahead and give this movie one star, and that is the absolute best I can do for it. I suppose there were a few flashing instances of goodness about it, but overall, I can't help but say that I am more than disappointed, I am sick to my stomach."
817,,Where's the Story arc?,"It's a trilogy linked to another trilogy, as well as spin-off movies. How can Rian not understand what a story arc and not understand how to create consistency with the other movies."
818,9,One of my favorite Star Wars films,"I really liked the film,i appreciated that they tried something new and are expanding the universe a bit by adding other sides to the force we have't seen before. Absolutely beautifully shot and the music is on point as always with Star Wars"
819,7,"Not The Best, But Ok",Enough with calling TLJ a failure. I watched it. I would not consider it a failure. It was OK. I think they are running out of ideas. I would put The Last Jedi at 3 on my favorite Star Wars movies and 8 on my favorite films.
820,8,Episode 8,Star Wars The Last Jedi. The controversial entry in the Star Wars saga and I have to say I love this one in my opinion it's just as good as The Force Awakens and it tells a bold story and tries to take this trilogy in a new direction.
821,7,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi review,"Kathleen Kennedy cooks the Golden Goose that is the Star Wars franchise, eats it, and then excretes it in the latest entry of the Social Justice Trilogy; The Last Jedi."
822,8,Really Nice Movie,"I went yesterday to see the movie. As per usual, I check Imdb scores plus see reviews to get a general opinion and I was confused, since I understood that the critics liked it and at the same time, the general crowd did not.<br /><br />Upon seeing the movie, I was frankly quite amused. The actors were great in playing their respective roles. It was serious, but had moments of levity. The action was really enjoyable and visually entertaining and must I add that for the first time it is Star Wars, as in we get the most amount of space fight in a Star Wars movie ever."
823,6,The New Force,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) <br /><br /> <br /><br />Forty years later, <br /><br />Change is inevitable, <br /><br />New generation. <br /><br />See veteran characters, <br /><br />Plus feisty new ones, <br /><br />In this film with a message. <br /><br />Kylo Ren and Rey's <br /><br />Intense on-screen chemistry, <br /><br />Yoda's cameo, <br /><br />Luke's controversial moves, <br /><br />Finn with new love Rose, <br /><br />Princess Leia's last hurrah. <br /><br />Upgraded cantina scenes, <br /><br />Gorgeous galaxies, <br /><br />Spacecraft we'd love to explore, <br /><br />Droids that make cute sounds, <br /><br />Cute birds that do nothing else, <br /><br />Epic lightsaber battles, <br /><br />Familiar themes<br /><br />Like good and bad, light and dark. <br /><br />Somewhat selling out, <br /><br />But the message is quite clear: <br /><br />The Force is still strong <br /><br />Presenting the new Star Wars, <br /><br />The Rebellion is reborn. "
824,2,How many beloved characters and potential can we destroy? A lot.,This is the anti Star Wars movie that feels like a comedy that just happens to be set in the Star Wars universe. Almost like a parody of empire strikes back. And it's the highest rated Star Wars movie on metacritic. What a joke. We all know what they did to Luke skywalker but I am not gonna talk about that. Instead I want to talk about the potential they wasted.
825,9,Rian Johnson delivers an epic space opera that does the saga justice.,"Carrying on from where The Force Awakens left off, Luke Skywalker's peaceful and quiet existence is brought to an end when Rey, the young would be Jedi arrives and attempts to convince him to journey back to the Rebel Aliance who are very much in need of his presence. Learning of her strong connection to the Force, Luke with reluctance eventually chooses to train her. Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance commanded by Princess Leia are fending off the The First Order, led by Kylo Ren and General Hux who direct them in to battle. "
826,7,How much is too much?,"So, the most anticipated film of the year, the film that had to defy the pressure and had to take us by surprise after so many fan theories. And did it work?"
827,1,This won't be cannon in a future,"Lack of history ... awful dialogues, 0 personality of Star Wars universe, basically a script made by high school cinema students, a copy and paste of old movies."
828,,good intentions,"...and more than intentions. for a part of critics and public - remarkable to the best. for me - an ambitious experiment. with all the virtues and the errors of an experiment who has as essence to discover and explore all the sides of a story well known. bicks near old bricks, explanations, heroism and solitude, refuges and impressive fights, the past in clash against present. all as result of noble and good intentions. but I amitt, the basic question remains the meaning of other trilogy. out of financial interest. all what must be said was said. so, ""The Last Jedi"". and its mix of stories."
829,9,"The most ""STAR WARS"" of all Star Wars... but not what you expect! *No Spoilers","I've been a Star Wars fan since it first came out in 1977, so basically, all my life.<br /><br />I am also a huge Sci-Fi movie fan.<br /><br />I NEVER considered Star Wars to be a Sci-Fi movie. For me, these movies are Western movies, Samurai movies. <br /><br />The original Star Wars drew its inspiration from Kurosawa movies. Unfortunately, back in the 70s, Lucas had just a couple of millions to realize his vision on screen.<br /><br />THE LAST JEDI is just that: big budget Samurai-War-Western movie that takes place on alien worlds. <br /><br />It brings the essence that inspired the whole saga to another level. It's the ANTI-prequel movie. It will anger Star Wars fans that read all the books, the comics and see Star Wars as Sci-Fi flicks.<br /><br />It will confuse A LOT of viewers... children will often be lost with that one.<br /><br />It is gloomy, full of symbolism, artsy...BOLD. <br /><br />I never felt that way about a Star Wars movie since parts of Empire Strikes Back...and not in a ""cliché"" way. <br /><br />It has some POWERFUL and MEMORABLE scenes that will leave you speechless. That will stick in your minds for a long time.<br /><br />Characters arcs are fascinating and SO WELL WRITTEN! <br /><br />Actors are on top of their game. <br /><br />Mark Hamill's performance is a TOUR DE FORCE. Easily the performance of his career.<br /><br />Like I said, some fans and casual moviegoers will hate the movie.<br /><br />I have the feeling that 10 years from now, it will be seen as one of the best Star Wars episode ever, maybe even the best one of the bunch."
830,6,Wow. Spot the prequel fanboy !!,"I thought it was average. After the travesty that was the prequel trilogy, everyone clamoured for "" more Star Wars "" and that was exactly what Abrams gave us, down to a virtually cloned episode 4, but that was what was being called for. Thankfully, this was not another Empire, much as I like that movie. This was well thought out and well executed, with an ensemble cast who, for the most part, can actually act out good dialogue. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and this , together with rogue one, is making the prequel trilogy a distant memory, thank goodness !! People can say what they like about Disney, but they DO know how to employ people who can actually write a coherent script."
831,10,WOW,This movie is just amazing. Some people are just never happy. They said TFA was not original enough and now they are saying TLJ is too original. I appreciate the humour in this movie as it really complimented the overall darkness in the movie. A must watch for viewers young and old
832,7,Not all that bad but worse the the previous one,Detecting a downwards trend here. A few interesting moments throughout but not enough. Most of this stuff is filler. I liked the previous episode better. 
833,9,Episode 7 was a travesty for children! This one is close to being an all time masterpiece!,And it comes sooo close. I am going to be honest. This movie is a gem in the Star Wars Universe. And I am going to tell you why. Let us start with the few negative sides of it.<br /><br />
834,7,Its time for the movie reviews.....to end.,"Overall I enjoyed the movie, but I did have a few gripes. For starters, some scenes were too silly. For example in the beginning theres a scene witth Hux and Poe that felt like something an SNL sketch would do. It felt a bit out of place for this universe. Also, a lot of the casino scenes (and characters) reminded me of the prequels. And by that I mean it was kind of kiddish. Like, you remember how silly Jar Jar was.....kind of like that. The porgs. Yes, they are cute. But they literally serve no purpose except to sell toys. I could be okay with them being created to sell merch if they at least did something in the movie. They honestly do not add anything and the runtime could have been shortened if they just cut them out. There was also a dumb scene with Leia where she basically became Starlord for a moment. It probably would have been better if she had just died in that moment or if she got injured in some other way. The scene felt kind of silly to me. Those were my major gripes. I still have a couple minor ones like R2 still not having much of a presence in this movie but it didn't bother me as much as the ones listed."
835,3,THEY RUINED LUKE SKYWALKER IN THIS MEDIOCRE SEQUEL,"I was incredibly disappointed with Stars Wars: The Last Jedi (TLJ). I cannot believe some people are saying this is the best one since Empire, bcoz it's not even close. There are so many problems with the movie; the writing, the poor structure, the lack of innovation and focus."
836,9,An underestimated movie,"This movie is not well received from a big part of the audience. The main critic is that this movie, completely ""destroys"" an old beloved character. I absolutely disagree, with those opinions. <br /><br />Personally, I think this star wars movie is a good example of progression. Progression and evolution, from the three previous films that introduced as to the world of star wars. The way it was chosen to do this, in this film, was to ""mess up"" with one of the most known characters of the franchise, and that is totally fine by me, since it was done in a decent manner.<br /><br />The previous movie, although it was a good movie, it seemed to me far more boring than this one. It was like I was watching ""a new hope"" again, but this time with far better effects. ""The last jedi"", tries to shake things up a bit, and this is why I think it is a better movie than it's predecessor.<br /><br />However there are, some weak points that cannot be overlooked. First of all, one weak point was the scene with Leia after the attack of the first order fleet to the resistance's vessels. It was pretty bad and excessive, but I I don't want to say any more, you'll see for yourselves. The other point, was the acting of Domhnall Glesson. His acting reminded of a more comedic role than a villainous one. This is a bit of a disappointment, since in the previous movie his acting was so much better.<br /><br />All things considered, I think this is a pretty good movie with all it's flaws, which do not take away anything from it. The good thing about it, is that it enters a new world of possibilities, bringing finally something new in the franchise."
837,6,mini review of Star Wars The Last Jedi,"Went to see Star Wars The Last Jedi, I always get sucked in and end up regretting. This one is no exception to that rule. In the words of the immortal Princess Leia, the spark is gone although the budget is still more than handsome and the cash registers are singing happy returns. We know what that means, another sequel to the sequel or to the revamped series after the original and the prequel. It's a sure fire money maker so why bite the hands that feeds you, certainly not George Lucas.<br /><br />There is one word which kind of sums it all up for me: debris. Lots and lots of debris, especially in 3D it's coming right at you that plus three strands of a story which do not coalesce into a satisfying whole.<br /><br />One theme endlessly repeated: the light and the dark and who will conquer but meanwhile let's all enjoy the neverending war. Apparently there were cameos of people I missed Lupita N'yongo, Gwendoline Christie plus a wasted Benicio del Toro, an OK. Laura Dern looking suitably gungho and severe in an appropriate outfit.<br /><br />Still there was something bittersweet knowing that Carrie Fisher's bright light had dimmed but she will be remembered forever here even if the movie itself was a thorough disappointment. Maybe I'm just not a Star Wars fan or I've simply outgrown it. In the end I found it overly long and boring. Once they start shooting each other out of the sky it's hard to tell who the friends and foes are and frankly my dear I don't really give a damn. Reviews have been mostly positive but with all the hype surrounding the release and the hush hush scenario it's not all that surprising. I did enjoy Adam Driver's performance, definitely can hold the screen and one's gaze. His Modigliani face is hard to look away from. My grade: C+"
838,1,This movie is insulting.,"Blah blah blah, about how ""well made"" this movie is. This movie is a straight up insult to Star Wars fans, that completely derails the trilogy it's meant to be set in. It's insulting to the lore of the universe, it is disrespectful to the legacy characters it is supposed to be celebrating, it REEKS of arrogance from a man on a mission to divide the fanbase because he thinks it's funny."
839,,Save The Planet. Stop More People From Watching This Film,"Every person who watches this (so-called) S*ar W*rs film vomits. With each additional person who views The Last Jedi more vomit is thrown up. If more and more people watch this film a flood of vomit will cover the earth and we, as a species, are in danger."
840,10,Rian Johnson gave this franchise the kick it needed,"This movie did not play it safe like Force Awakens and it does not care what you think a Star Wars movie should be, and thank goodness for that."
841,7,Actually entertaining,The force awakens was good movie but was not quite different from the rest of the star wars. I thought the last jedi was pretty good entertainment flick.
842,9,"An Absolute Blast, giving Everything you Love about Star Wars and More!","A LOT has already been said about this movie, for the good and the bad. Mostly the bad, because that's what the internet is changing into nowadays, but there is still good. I am pretty confident that I love Star Wars just as much as every other fan, and will solely judge this movie on my own experience while I watched it. ""agenda's"", Disney and SJW won't be discussed here. Now, my immediate thought on this movie? FORCE, I LOVED IT."
843,7,Star Wars: The Last Duel of the Fans (Spoiler Alert - it won't be) (TLJ Spoiler-free Review),"Star Wars: The Last Jedi makes for an entertaining watch - if you can abide by some very poor screenwriting. The hype is definitely misleading. To the detriment of the series, this instalment ultimately does (irreparable?) damage to its own mythology, leading many ""hardcore"" fans to rebel and call for the episode to be struck from the ""canon"" - a call answered by more than 70,000 incensed audience members. Although I wouldn't go so far, I can't imagine exerting myself very much in defense of the story and the characters' motives. Sure, I enjoyed my cinema experience. Would I suggest it to others? Likely - if exclusively for an effects-heavy ride through intergalactic space. For an intensely emotional experience, I am inclined to direct one to Revenge of the Sith. The Last Jedi has its strong moments, but the worse ones dominate the better ones. Abrams surprisingly set up an exciting, fresh premise in The Force Awakens, and Johnson (curiously applauded by Disney for his less-than-amazing work) promptly tore most of its framework down again. "
844,10,"Great film, surprised by some negative IMDB reviews","We are star war fans and thought this was just as great an installment as The Force Awakens and original trilogy with well-loved trademark elements mixed with better quality next generation story telling/film-making which gives this trilogy a great unique edge - I personally think this makes the final trilogy relevant both from its original theme and for the new generation of films we see (the acclaimed ones rather than the overdone franchises out there). There are great contemporary characters and storytelling with morals to learn in this film too that you don't get to see done so well or even covered in most mainstream movies, one thing I particularly love about Star Wars. "
845,7,"Good Not Great, Let's All Be Fine With That",Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2017/12/review-star-wars-viii-last-jedi.html
846,2,Garbage,"I can watch any star wars even the prequels many times. This piece of garbage I watched once. I want my time back. To say it is awful is an unstatement. I had high hopes coming from force awakens about a new direction for the franchise and new characters being introduced. What we got was every one of the interesting new characters were destroyed the writing of them was against everything set up in the force awakens. These writers and directors had no idea where they were going. It seemed like they had never seen force awakens or even any star wars movie. Whom ever was at Disney to manage these movies for the company should have been fired, and black balled from Hollywood so they won't throw away money from any other movie company. The one after this isn't good either but this is unbelievably the worst movie with a budget I have ever seen."
847,8,It was better the second time,After I came back and watched this I realized that I hated this movie a lot less it's not perfect and there are many things that I don't like. (How they don't give Jon Boyega the time of day to show off his ability to act) but all in all loved how Luke was portrayed in this. He was 10/10. I was disappointed that nobody lost a hand that was truly disappointing.
848,7,Messy execution but still good!,"I have NO problems with the creative decisions in the movie! However, sometimes the execution is kinda bad and a there are a few cringy lines. Nothing to get triggered over...it's not worse than the prequels! Does it deserve a 90% on rotten tomatoes..mmm..no. But it doesn't deserve a 44% either! The fact that Rian Johnson mixed Empire and Return of the Jedi into one movie and it wasn't a trainwreck is IMPRESSIVE! Let the past die so The Rise of Skywalker can fly baby! Woo! And if JJ makes another Death Star I'll (CENSORED).<br /><br />Oh, and btw, for all the people that sent death threats to the crew....I hope you get a disease..........HA"
849,3,With great CGI doesn't come great story telling,"Daisy Ridley bears a resemblance to another well known British actress: ""People have always said that I look like Keira Knightley,"" she told Yahoo. ""It's like, 'Why do i have to be like someone else?'"". The irony being in the Star Wars universe Keira Knightley was Sabé; Padmé Amidalas decoy, protection, and loyal bodyguard, pretending to be the future mother of Luke and Leia during the Battle of Naboo, etc, while the Queen was off doing other things. For all we know, Anakin and her could have hooked up, had kids, and she's Reys grandmother, making Rey and Kylo cousins!"
850,,Complete tonal miss... hate that.,"Remember when, at the end of The Force Awakens, at the end of an arduous journey and after suffering great loss, we see Rey reach that breath-taking summit where she stands with Luke's lightsaber in her trembling out-stretched hands, tears in her eyes as the music swells and we finally catch a brief glimpse of the legend that is Luke Skywalker? We waited two years to see what would happen next."
851,9,"""2 thumbs up"" (Siskel & Ebert) review# 96","The Red title indicates that the sith are ready to get back into it with Kylo Ren addressing his issue of whether or not he is suitable for heir apparent of Darth Vader & ""A fait acompli"" - Wayne Gretzky deal 8/ 11,1988. Have passed the century mark with how many times viewed this movie because those of us who participated with Celebration from the Windy City with Star Wars IX - The Rise of Skywalker just want that lifetime membership. Though one particular scene with Lea & her son as she is waiting for his decision to destroy what he has to in becoming a dark side user.<br /><br />His worthy ness is no longer a constant to Supreme Leader Snoke when he brings yours truly front & center. He just seems to still have conflict when it comes to his mother. Big ups to director for not letting this be the end for the General of the resistance. The powerful force user was able to side step this land mind & get going. Though she knows in her heart that it wasn't her creation that almost led to her demise. The story does fall off when Rose & Fn 2187 aka Finn lead this adventure guided by Maz Kanata.<br /><br />Upon arrival on Canto Bight, we get to see the chain of command change hands until Vice Admiral Holdo shows why she was trained by Lea. When she makes the decision to better the 400+-remaining resistance. The quiet before the storm brings the dramatic turn of events that the light remains. Reminisce of those college days riding on e in the 1991 Chevrolet Silverado up in the Bay area crossing the San Francisco bay bridge not knowing the outcome of happiness. Although she knows very well her intentions & finally gets Poe to react. He leads this team to the abandoned base & the old fashion western showdown. With all involved in the Sith & all involved with the Jedi, who will win? Keep these coming Disney & thank you George Lucas (get @ me Frida Cinema in Santa Ana, Orange County). ""...Until then, the balcony is closed"" (Siskel & Ebert)"
852,6,"Vastly Inferior to ""The Force Awakens""","I was never into Starwars but watched the Force Awakens a couple of years ago and absolutely loved it. I could not wait for this installment. I knew about thirty minutes into the movie it was not going to be able to touch The Force Awakens. Characters I loved in the other one I did not find as interesting in this one. I also thought that Rey, Kyle, and Luke were all underwhelming in this movie as they spent so much building up their appearances and back stories on the last movie. There were questions during the last movie left unanswered which left me longing for this one to get answers to these questions. This movie seemed to provide a very bland explanation and those questions had no relevance to this movie (for example, Rey's parentage). I also thought they made Kylo more of a wimp than a menacing, interesting character and Skywalker more of a joke than anything else. Not bad, but no where near the previous installment."
853,9,"Seen it three times, loved it each time","People say this movie is really bad. Well I've been a huge Star Wars fan since 1996. When it comes to the original trilogy, I still prefer the original versions over the so called ""Special Edition"". I'm not that crazy over the prequels, although Revenge of the Sith was by far the best of those three movies. At first I was skeptical over Disney making new Star Wars movies, I thought they would end up being big disappointments. I was very wrong, when I saw Force Awakens, it blew me away, it felt great seeing old faces and being introduced to new, likable and mature characters who are willing to learn. No arrogance at all in these characters, something that Anakin Skywalker had a lot of in the prequels. As for the Last Jedi, there are some parts that are questionable, but this movie still kicks so much butt that it makes you forget it. The characters have so much personality, the story has so much drama and suspense, the CGI is outstanding and has so much action. I'm sorry people who hate this movie, but this movie is outstanding. I think if you're going to give a movie a 1 out of 10, that means you are comparing it to something like Manos: The Hands of Fate and that's very unfair. Movies should only get a 1 out of 10 score if they are not only abysmal, but they are also offensive and would have a horrible influence on the youth. I love The Last Jedi and I feel like 9 out of 10 is the right score for it. The good does definitely outweigh the bad and it's easily one of the best movies in 2017. I cannot wait until this movie comes out on Blu-ray and I'm really excited for Episode IX. I also want to wish Carrie Fisher a peaceful afterlife. She may be gone, but she is now a part of the force and will never be forgotten. Rest in Peace Princess Carrie."
854,6,Part 2 of Disney's Star Wars Trilogy,"Disney's acquisition of Star Wars has led to the production of further pictures, starting with a new trilogy."
855,10,"Despite the hate, the spirit of the Original Trilogy shines more brightly than ever","I must admit that after this year's disappointing sequels (Blade Runner 2049) and utterly bad ones (War for the Planet of the Apes), I was dismayed by the amount of hate that followed the release of this film. Especially having in mind Lucas' ""prequels"" and ""edits"" in the 2000's."
856,6,Franchise That Has Gone On Too Long...,I wouldn't call it a bad movie. Just forgettable. It seems like the Star Wars world is running out of ideas. It has gone on too long. Frankly I was bored.
857,1,"Rian Johnson, please don't make any more Star Wars films",I could put a long boring post here about why The Last Jedi is a poor Star Wars film but there are so many similar reviews it would be pointless.
858,10,This is not going to go the way you think,"Sure one of my favorite star war movies. Great kylo character development give me chills when he cut snoke in half.I like how the storyline going, it is different from the old ones and that is why is so good.The only thing I disliked a little was how they destroyed luke and that he died and he didn't even gave us one last badass scene he was a force ghost in the end."
859,6,Could've been so much better,"This movie was very interesting, but a lot of things happened that made this movie hit it's own breaking point. I would say the series should stop being continued and hopefully its left alone. I know a lot of people enjoyed this movie, but a lot of unrealistic impossible things have happened in this movie and should probably start getting fixed."
860,2,uhh,"Wow, Lucasfilm is tone deaf and out of touch. Lot's of pretentious moral finger pointing by the writer. It's just trash. Skip it. Skip Disney Star Wars."
861,,Cinematic Fail,"While this movie has good visuals with all those Disney Dollars at work, it fails horribly in every other aspect."
862,8,Fun movie. Enjoy it for what it is,I won't go into a critique. <br /><br />The movie was enjoyable. Don't forget what movies are. Is it TESB? no. Is it even TFA? no. Am I disappointed? No. I was entertained. There were parts of it where I was left holding the bag. wondering what we were doing. So what? 
863,6,The Legacy of Luke Skywalker: Now naught more than a Disney cash-grab.,"While I am a Star Wars fan, I am not a fanatic. I would, however, classify myself as a purist, as I refuse to watch the ""remastered"" original trilogy, as in my opinion, not a single change made the films better and many changes made them worse. I only own Episodes III-VI and Rogue One, as Episode I is a drag that adds nothing of import to the Anakin story arc, and Episode II adds important points but is still hard for me to watch. Episode VII had equally terrible acting, script, and plot contrivances, not to mention being a glaring knock-off of Episode IV, and I have no qualms about standing nearly alone in saying the Force Awakens was a relatively terrible movie."
864,9,Amazing,"One more time this franchise surprise me with a great plot that give sense for the disappearance of Luke, here as a teacher who will help, and we have more about Kyle, our relationship with Rey is more explored, have a great action and emotional scenes."
865,6,ah well,"The last Jedi is, like the previous movie was a copy of star wars 1, in many aspects a copy of the empire strikes back movie, there are so many similar elements. Sometimes they have a little twist, but is all there, a fleet on the run, a battle between twe two forces in front of the emperor (in a ridiculous setting), a pupil to be trained to Jedi (and a confrontation with self), very big battle ships that are unable to handle small ships, etc.<br /><br />There are the usual ridiculous things we already know from Star Wars, like storm troopers that can't hit anything, a tracking device that can't be tracked by the empire, a deserted base which is fully operational in minutes with people dressed up for the battle, the people of 6-7 remaining carrierships all fit in the millenium Falcon...ok ok.<br /><br />als this is put in a blender and made a slightly amusing movie: mix some left-overs into something new. Put your mind at 0, like with all star wars movies, sit back and let it come over you and it is pleasant enough."
866,8,Delves deep into the saga,"I remember watching The Last Jedi at the cinema and as always, watching a Star Wars film at the cinema is exciting! You can feel the energy of the audience, everyone started clapping when the film began. Amazing feeling! The last Jedi is a different style of Star Wars film and I say compares closely to the prequels in a great way! It expands the universe, provides more lore and additionally mirroring previous instalments. It keeps the heart of the Star Wars franchise we know and love. My only dislike was the Luke milk drinking scene, there wasn't much need for it. I do remember a sense of not knowing how I felt about the film, I didn't know if it was great or not as it was all so unexpected but I believe the Internet is to blame with all the theories. Now I've come to the conclusion that it's a enjoyable middle film, which will benefit once Rise of Skywalker is released. Its not the best Star Wars film but it is what was needed."
867,7,A good film but ending on another downer is just too much,The Last Jedi is certainly an improvement over the shallow Force Awakens. It's a far more textured affair all round and there is plenty here to get lost in. The effects are stunning plus the surprises are many and unexpected which makes for a good viewing experience.
868,1,Star Wars: The Worst Said I,"""What we've got here is, failure to continuate..."""
869,10,It's much better than a 7.2,I'm going 10 because I don't understand the vitriol that this movie caused. I think it's more an 8-8.5. One of the better Star Wars. I preferred it over eps 1-3 and the force awakens.
870,7,Not the best but certainly the most overhyped,"As the Rebellion tries to evade The First Order, Rey asks Luke Skywalker to teach her the ways of the Force. Meanwhile Kylo Ren is still a whiny POS."
871,1,Yet another aweful rendition of Star Wars .. avoid like the plague!,"How to ruin Star Wars? Sell the rights to Disney!<br /><br />This movie is yet another massive disappointment following Force Awakens, which as much as I disliked it was a tad better than The Last Jedi. There is nothing left here of the Star Wars universe except for the non-Jedi's repeating the ""May the force be with you"", which they say with such conviction you can tell its just some lame tagline they implemented so the viewer wouldn't forget they were actually watching a Star Wars movie.<br /><br />In 'Force Awakens' I actually enjoyed the prospect of there being yet another massively powerful Sith overlord, Snoke being introduced to the story as some massively shadowy figure, turns it out its just a malformed humanoid with force power who despite his incredible ""power"" missed the all-too important detail of a lightsaber being moved by the force right next to him, as if he had suddenly lost his force power or become blind to it, both being just as improbable and ludicrous to any actual Star Wars fan.<br /><br />The whole thing about wanting the very concept of ""Jedi"" to die out seems a tad shortsighted as that won't take away the force which is supposedly a universal force (like ""gravity"") and the universe will still yield force sensitives over time, leaving them without guidance and knowledge seems like a sure way to have them seek guidance with those that still stand, the Sith. <br /><br />Yoda finally learning to talk is beyond everything, why stick with continuity when you can screw everything around by changing its most memorable and enjoyable feature? Its like if Arnold Schwarzenegger suddenly started speaking with a perfect high class British accent for no apparent reason. This shows just how little concern Disney has for the Star Wars ""world"" and how ready they are to reshape it to their liking, using the fact that they can stick ""Star Wars"" on it to guarantee sales. They just don't care about the actual, pre-established Star Wars universe.<br /><br />I don't get their constant need to keep going back to Maz as if she was the universe Wikipedia. Got a question? ""Maz"" it! (you know, instead of ""Google it!""), for reasons unknown, she'll have all the answers. It just comes off as way too easy a solution to people's quandaries.<br /><br />Furthermore I really don't like how Disney has even redefined the whole Jedi movement and what they were able to do, it seems like a completely new thing now than the normal ""Jedi""-ism we're used to, now it involves levitating and meditating leading to out-of-body projections, of course, why didn't we see that coming?! <br /><br />Luke's sacrifice seemed unnecessary at best, it just seemed to mirror Obiwan Kenobi's sacrifice from Episode IV. And it was quite unluckily planned as Carrie Fisher passed away, both twins will be missing in the next movie, unless of course they decide to go the CGI way again to resurrect past actors (which I hope they won't do as the renditions from Rogue One were extremely creepy and very unsettling to watch, couldn't they find any actor on a planet of 7 billion people that could do the parts? did they even look?)<br /><br />I could go on dissecting this rather large heap of dung which is 'The Last Jedi' but the Disney Star Wars have already sapped enough of my time, time I'll never get back! I cry for the death of Star Wars as we knew it, why it had to be sold to Disney before completing the last trilogy I will never understand.<br /><br />Poor movie and completely beside the point in case you're hoping for something related to Star Wars."
872,,Bad movie,This movie ruined what was Luke Skywalker. The plot is boring especially the casino scene and the new characters were not developed properly. Hi abrams did a good job introducing them but I no longer cared for them after this movie. Rian Johnson should be embarrassed by this garbage.
873,9,no expectations,"I have read many reviews of films. I notice in this that many times people are caught in expectations. They don't see the film anymore because they have their own idea how the story should enfold. For this reason many beautiful films are neglected, beautiful visions, ideas not seen. "
874,6,Very good film,I think this was a good film. It has a good story line and even though lukes death was sad it was needed
875,9,Enough with the hate,"Im so sick and tired of all these crybaby Star Wars fanboys who whine and complain still to this day about how Last Jedi killed Star Wars or it ruined Luke Skywalker and it's the worst thing to ever happen. Enough! It's simply isn't true. The Last Jedi isn't awful, it's very underrated in the sequel trilogy"
876,6,Aside from all the SJW stuff...,...It's just plain horrible.
877,9,Why so much hate???,This review will be full of spoilers so beware.
878,6,I enjoyed it.,"I thought it was decent enough. Linked all of them together but again, same old story of disabling something in a ship that slightly large."
879,3,Unfortunate: No spoilers,"I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie I didn't enjoy, but this was it. The ideas/characters/lore that made Star Wars one of the strongest film franchises in history was completely thrown away. Additionally, parts of the film actually began to get boring and seemed useless to the plot (I.e. side quest to the war profiteering planet). It seemed like the director/writers were more concerned with pandering to social issues rather than creating the next film in the Star Wars timeline. "
880,10,Mind is blown,Star Wars is back and its once again great. You learn a lot about each individual characters especially kylo ren and rey. There are many characters in this story and the script manages to balance them. the script and the direction by Rian Johnson is amazing . This movie is better than the force awakens and i would say it is one of the stronger entries in the star wars series.There were many twists that manged to keep me at the edge of my seat . I would recommend this movie to all.
881,6,"Another Disappointing ""Star Wars"" Movie","""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was a huge disappointment to a long time ""Star Wars"" fan such as myself. Okay, here we go."
882,3,An embarressing script. Disney should be ashamed.,"First, going back a second... I loved the newest characters from SW 7 (Rey and Finn), but was disappointed in the movie. SW 7 had a good story, but that was because it was the same one George Lucas gave us in SW 4, and that was the problem, it was the SAME story. After waiting almost 40 years, in the end, we just got the original movie, with new characters plugged in for the originals."
883,,"A terrible film, written for a generation that have been let down, left, right, and centre.","What a terrible, terrible, film."
884,9,"Good action, humor, and many exciting moments","In the Force Awakens, it felt like a remake of the old movies. This time the plot had some uniqueness. I think most of the negative comments here are just fans that take it too seriously, like it's some sort of a bible, where the plot needs to make so much sense. If you are just looking for a fun movie, with good humor, and good action, you will enjoy this one. If you want to find things in the plot that doesn't make sense I'm sure you can find that as well, but I think it's true for most movies."
885,7,A disgrace to the original trilogy,"This movie was a disgrace to the original Star Wars trilogy. The plot was absolutely terrible and it seems as if all the deaths were just unnecessary. The force awakens was a nice addition to the trilogy, however, this is just not cutting it. The action scenes in this movie are quite good however, and the acting is quite powerful and you can see that Mark Hamill still has his skills."
886,8,"Visually stunning, narratively satisfying.","The eighth episode in what is now being dubbed the Skywalker Saga, The Last Jedi takes the space-opera series into darker, less traditional territory. The nostalgic adventure of Force Awakens is replaced by a harsher, more ferocious tale of good and evil. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is beginning her Jedi journey with a gruff and reluctant Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver) fractured psyche is worsening as his ambitions clash with his past; General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) struggle to keep the Rebel Alliance alive; and Finn (John Boyega) continues his self-discovery with the help of newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). Obviously there's a lot going on, which causes the runtime to balloon out, but writer-director Rian Johnson balances it relatively well, fleshing out a raft of characters and plotlines whilst ensuring the overall story arc is compelling and cohesive. It's definitely the most intense (and arguably the most unpredictable) Star Wars instalment since Empire Strikes Back, the Rey-Kylo-Luke connection a harrowing deep-dive into guilt, vengeance and pride that's as intelligent and mature as it is emotionally hefty. Johnson kicks the action up a gear too. The opening space battle is suitably epic; a silent light-speed sequence is breathtaking; a heroic Luke-centric set piece is spine tingling; and the climactic melee (with vibrantly contrasting reds and whites) is a fittingly awesome finale. There are some flaws, however, that stop this movie from being brilliant. Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is criminally underused again, whilst thief DJ (Benicio del Toro) and Leia's second-in-command Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) are odd additions whose screen time feels like it was reduced heavily in the editing room. There's also a strange subplot that delves into class divide, a very unwise decision to have Finn and Rose ride on horse-like CGI creatures (in a completely unnecessary set piece), and a ridiculously mawkish final scene that feels tacked on by the studio. He doesn't get it right all the time every time, but when he does-and that is pretty often-Johnson crafts a Star Wars outing that is exhilarating, poignant and dramatically satisfying. The Last Jedi is well worth a trip to the cinema."
887,6,I kept looking at my watch wanting it to end,"I am a big Star Wars fan (not including those three hideous ones) and I was really looking forwards to this one. However, I wasn't long into this film when I felt that something may not be quite right with it. The storyline felt very static and was reliant on cheap gags that made the film feel a little cheap."
888,8,A Star Wars film that deserves multiple viewings.,"""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" comes from writer and director Rian Johnson and continues the story of Rey, Finn, and Luke Skywalker in their quest to find answers and fight off the first order helmed by antagonist Kylo Ren. Building upon its predecessor, this film takes the story and characters in very new and different directions that may challenge the viewer's expectation on how a Star Wars film should be handled. Divisive to its core, this newest installments is one of the boldest and most memorable sci-fi/action films in recent memory. "
889,6,"I hated it the first time, I loved it the second time","I have been a Star Wars fan since I can remember. I was six when I saw Empire Strikes Back in theaters and eight during the night that I watched Return of the Jedi. After that came almost two decades of watching the Star Wars trilogy over and over again on video. So you can say that for me Star Wars is as essential to my life as my own blood. I read all the novels, the comics, and heard the soundtrack all the time. And you know what, in a certain way I believe in the Force. And then came the prequels, where we knew what was going to happen at the end, and then came Force Awakens, where we were given a recicled version of the original Star Wars, and we were happy, because I knew everything about the Star Wars Universe. It was my universe! Then, on Friday night I went to see Last Jedi and scene after scene I watched as they turn everything that I knew and felt familiar with upside down. When the end credits started rolling I jumped from my sit and left the theater so disapointed and I swore I would never see another Star Wars movie again."
890,2,"What you get when you blend a cash-grab, a re-boot, and an actual story","This movie, like the rest of the trilogy, is bad. The thing is, it's not bad for the reasons that were publicized and discussed over social media ad nauseum. It is bad because, at its root, the third trilogy was a studio cash grab. There was never really a need for it, and if there was, it would have been better to follow episode 6 closer in time. But, Disney bought out Lucasfilm and decided they wanted more money."
891,8,Under-appreciated by the overly-critical (Spoiler-Free),I'll get straight to the point.
892,7,Drives you through a way but...,Drives you through a way that you love but then it breaks it justo like that and the story gets boring again.<br /><br />Also the directing and CGI is so good.
893,3,"i disagree with every writing choice made for Luke, just like Mark Hamill.","To clarify before beginning my review, I'm a 34-year-old lifelong female fan (not a misogynistic racist fanboy as some people assume of those who are unimpressed with this movie's outcome). The characterization of Luke and some of the others was downright WRONG, especially to those of us who loved the OT. And let's be clear, I'm not an OT purist. I will defend Revenge of the Sith to my death. I watched the Force Awakens 5 times in theaters. I thought Rogue One was one of the best Star Wars movies ever."
894,,A Sith Hiding In Plain Sight,"""In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way."""
895,8,A recommended watch; The Force Awakens truly here.,"It's Episode VIII, but it feels like Episode V, all over again. I mean it as a good thing. As a teenager when i had started watching Star Wars movies, what appealed to me were few elements. The Last Jedi has, it seems masterfully studied each of them and planted them seamlessly into the narrative, while staying true to the central theme."
896,7,why?,"So I caught the midnight showing of Star Wars The Last Jedi, by complete accident mind you(it pays to check the AM and PM after the time when booking your tickets online) but hey I've been holding out for this movie for a long time and what's a few extra hours sleep between showings. Now I make it to the cinema(I'm excited at this point, more so then I would have had admitted if asked), I'm a huge fan, since the beginning and I'm old enough to admit that I mean since the beginning, the really big fans are all dressed up and the anticipation in the air is contagious.<br /><br />and then.........<br /><br />the first WHY? came rather early on but id heard that this was a new vision and that director Rian Johnson had thrown some spin on the ball so hey who am I to complain. Surely this was just some light hearted humour and god knows the world could use more laughs.........But.....<br /><br />When one of the most beloved characters not only in this particular universe but in the entire movie universe expresses breast milk from something that has four udders and takes a big drink, just like Rey I had to look the other way, I didn't get much time to gather my thoughts on the matter before dinner was being caught with what could only be described as a massive whaling harpoon.....Why?<br /><br />So much of this movies 2and a half hour running time is absolute Star Wars gold. some of the best moments that this entire saga has offered up happen in this movie, hands down, in that respect Rian congratulations, truly wonderful stuff, and you knew this was coming ..... But at a time when the devoted are scathing other films for not being long enough and feeling rushed, my feeling is that this film could have done with a closer shave(if you get that then I've found my audience) quite easily 30 to 40 mins could disappear from this and I don't think anybody would have noticed, it then truly could have been the equal of if not the best in series. Bring it home with episode 9 J.J, its yours to lose."
897,10,This is not going to go the way you think,As a starwars fan I believe you will either love or hate this new addition with no ground in between. I personally loved it and thought it was absolutely brilliant. This film completely subverts everything we've come to expect and I think it works wonderfully.
898,6,same line than ep7,"Completely agree with everything you said, but I sill consider this movie much better than the infamous prequels. Episodes 1,2,3 don't exist for me"
899,9,The Last Jedi Subverts Any and All Expectations,"The Last Jedi has the least amount of time elapsed since the previous instalment (you could make a case for Rogue One into A New Hope, but I'm not really sure that counts). The resistance, after their victory against Starkiller base, are now fleeing their own base as The First Order arrive to bombard it. We also pick up on Ahch'to immediately, with Rey handing the lightsaber over to Luke. The story that follows, in broad strokes, is pretty much just the Resistence running away from the First Order as they keep hot on their heels. Meanwhile Rey learns about herself, Luke, the Jedi, and digs deeper into Kylo Ren's psyche on the hidden planet."
900,7,This is not going to go the way you think,Star Wars :- The Last Jedi
901,1,"Let the old world die, destroy it if you have to","From the opening scene, I knew this movie was going to be an absolute disaster. As soon as Poe made lame childish jokes about ""hugs"" and your mother I realised star wars had descended to a low, thoughtless, mainstream product, devoid of the charm it was once known for."
902,10,"Either You Love Star Wars or, You're Wrong!!! And this film is Amazing!","After 40 years of capturing the hearts and minds of people from every corner of the world, it's amazing just to think how far Star Wars has come as a franchise. Even beyond the involvement of George Lucas, it's fair to say 'Star Wars' is still alive and kicking hard at an unprecedented rate, the franchise couldn't be at a better place in time than now."
903,6,Not as bad as the all the other user reviews imply...,"However, in my opinion the worst SW of the lot. I'm a huge SW fan having grown up on episodes 4-6, and I never had the issue that the hard nosed fans had with 1-3. All episodes in my opinion have been solid 4 out of 5 star ratings- all good in their own right (ok ESB is still the best!) - but this drops to a 3 star in my book, largely through its bizarre plot holes. Hoping I'll enjoy it better second time around."
904,1,A bunch of feel good scenes not a movie make!,"I watched this movie when it came out in the theaters and had an opportunity to re-watch this in Disney +. Since I have an account now, i thought I'll leave a review so that some other poor soul might benefit and save three hours."
905,,Is this worse or the farce awakens?,I am not sure. Maybe this is a tad better because JJ Abrams did his usual stealing and cloning thing. So while both so-called Star Wars from Disney sucked at least this one tried to have its own story.
906,9,People cannot accept change,There is one storyline I do not like in this movie. The rose and Finn subplot. It was not needed and it's the only thing that is regrettable.
907,7,"It's worth a watch, I guess","I think The Last Jedi is pretty interesting. When I first saw this in theaters a few years ago, I thought it was decent. The storytelling was good, and the dialogue was interesting. The characters are amusing. And the effects are great. While this is not one of my very favorite movies, it's a very good film."
908,10,The force is strong in this one,"The Last Jedi is simply another Star Wars masterpiece. I have watched it three times now and each time I find more depth and intrigue. This film packs so much in that you will possibly like me need to watch it again and again to fully absorb the intricacy and mythology that writer and director Rhian Johnson provides. He has masterfully constructed a genuis film in its own right while forming the bridge between The Force Awakens and the next installments, continuing to develop the mythology of ""The Force"" and in particular the relationship between Rey (Brilliantly portrayed by the exquisite Daisy Ridley) and Kylo-Ren (Exquisitely portrayed by the brilliant Adam Driver)."
909,7,A seven star performance,Not all americans are bad.
910,8,stupid movie but...,"People have made this movie the scapegoat for everything that was ever wrong with star wars. People see the original trilogy as an absolute masterpiece without flaws, and while there was nothing like the original three movies when they came out, the way people worship them is bothersome.<br /><br />Now, i also recognize a lot of the things wrong with The Last Jedi, there is a lot of 'stupid' in this movie, and the setup this movie gives for the one after is absolutely atrocious. How is a sequel to this movie supposed to surpass this one, or even live up to anything the first two already set up, without being forced to do a lot of 'stupid' on its own?"
911,7,This movie made me make an account on here.,"I'll try to keep this short and sweet. I love Star Wars. To be specific, I love the original trilogy, the prequels and the KotOR games. I'm not into the books or anything else like that. I just like to see good vs evil, the Force in action and lightsaber duels."
912,3,Horrible!,"What intersectionality can do, destroy... a postmodernism view... and make heroes look and act even worse"
913,9,"The second best Star Wars film, easily!","I teach film production and screen writing, i have an honours degree in both subjects and have done the job for a decade. In my dispassionate and professional point of view ""The Last Jedi"" is the second best Star Wars movie. It's well shot and aside from the Finn fools errand section it's very well written."
914,6,Basically Empire Strikes Back,Think about it. Escaping a planet from an evil force meanwhile a character is learning the ways of the force from a former Jedi. It's literally the Empire Strikes Back!!!
915,1,The worst star wars film.,They threw continuity out the window while simultaneously adding loopholes.
916,,The Reason IMDB doesn't allow 0,And that there is a special 'mathematical formula' to calculating ratings...
917,10,Best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back.,This is hands down the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back. Don't let everyone's negativity deter you from watching. They clearly can't grasp the concept between new ideas that expand the Star Wars lore.
918,6,"Visuals are stunning, dialogues are stale, story is okay.","This movie is the perfect example that a visually stunning movie with a decent story line can't be saved because of poor dialogues and some bad acting. Conversations between characters rarely rise above that of the average soap on tv, also it tries to be funny but most of the time they simply miss the mark. Mark Hamill reprise of Luke Skywalker is disappointing, not convincing at all... but other characters like the one played by Laura Dern are uninspired."
919,10,when you think it couldn't get any better and they actually did,"Amazing, how some of the actors who we first saw in the previous episode have grown into their caracter. Fantastic, even Mark Hamilton did better I think than in the first 3 in which he played! ""Finn"" finally gotshape from some coward to a real hero now, and Adam Driver finally has become the vilan you expect hi to be. A critical fan of Disney (Not everything that Disney touches become magic, like the awful thing they did with Coco where the original is 1000x better) I think they let the director and producer go their own way which lead to a fantastic result. I found myself a few times sitting at the edge of my chair, and the only thing I could say at the end was ""wow"". And believe me, with 55 I don't say that easily anymore about a movie. There is much to say about special effects, costume design, small and big roles, exiting moments and the one and only shot which I thought they could have left out. But my conclusion, (for the first time in the history of the Star Wars saga!) is, bring onthe Oscars. they deserve it!"
920,7,Undermines The Force Awakens,"This movie isn't entertaining to me because of the constant undermining of the Force Awakens. Literally as soon as we start this movie it undercuts the ending of Force Awakens, which is just not a good look if you ask me. Also, the way Luke Skywalker dies is just there because they needed a good twist, and I feel like if they thought that he needed to die, it should've been at the hands of Kylo Ren, cementing him as an out-of-control villain. Overall, this is a disappointing sequel, to what looked like a promising trilogy."
921,8,This movie is a star wars movie,Star Wars the last Jedi was a really great movie I loved the fact how dark it was I like movies that do that I really feel some questions where answered I really think some characters really looked better than TFA I liked Rey kinda she looks good with her hair down Kylo Ren was ok he wasn't bad he wasn't bad he was ok Luke seemed more like a retired old man at first than he turned more into the Luke like a new Leia was cool I really did love her in this finn was just their he didn't really do anything except fight phasma Rose was ok she seemed out of place Poe seemed a little bitchy the vice admiral holdo ehhh I didn't like her at first then she did something cool I liked the visuals really so to wrap it up Star Wars the last Jedi gets a 9/10 good movie but weird ending
922,7,"Nonsense plot, cheap dialogue/characters, but still entertaining",Spoiler-free review as maybe there's someone out there who's still not seen it and not read any spoilers (as if!).
923,2,Worst thing to ever bear the Star Wars name,"When I watched this movie in the cinema I was beyond disgusted, my disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined. I have no words that can accurately describe how terrible this movie actually was. The ONLY redeeming thing about this movie is Mark Hamill and the fact that the title says Star Wars."
924,10,Reinventing!,"The Last Jedi moves Star Wars in a creative new direction. It is bold compared to it's arguably safe predecessor, and the risks it takes pay off."
925,7,Did Obi Wan give up on the force when Anakin turned?,"Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting for my Luke, the Luke of my childhood, my hero, to return. Luke was always bold, always hopeful, always caring, but alas it was not meant to be. Here are some questions I have, that I have already seen asked here, but they need to be heard:<br /><br />1) Why the build up of Rey's parents, if they were nobody?<br /><br />2) Why the build up of the other parts of the Force, if they were not to be explored<br /><br />3) Who was Snoke, and why does no one seem to care in the Star Wars Universe?<br /><br />4) But the only questioned that mattered when I left the theater was ""where was Luke"" this was certainly not him. I would understand if he was upset about Kylo Ren, but to have given up entirely? To show a defeatist attitude about even the attempt of bringing the light to bear. This was someone who was pretending to be Luke, someone who did not know anything about who Luke was and what he was made of. Did Obi Wan give up on the force when Anakin turned? No....and neither would Luke..."
926,1,I still can't believe that Last Jedi has a high rating on rotten tomatoes.,"It amazes me that this film has a high rating here and in rotten tomatoes, what did they see that I didn't. This film is just awful and it has nothing to do with the diversity that is just nonsense or Russians or whatever excuse people are coming up with. I can put a few Marvel film or any Game of Thrones episode against this movie in terms of quality. The film look good in terms of visuals, as far as story direction and questionable characters and decision making is what killed this film, how they use Mark Hamil was insulting. May avoid the last film altogether. I'am no longer a Star Wars fan."
927,,"Oh Disney, What have you done?!","Worst Star Warszawa film, ever! The writer clearly dont know Star Warszawa."
928,8,Worthy addition,"So I finally got to chek out ""The Last Jedi"" last night and maybe because I had heard some of the more divided reaction to the film, or I still had some prequel hangover, I went in with a little more muted expecations than I normally do for a Star Wars film. I came out thinking that I was not very surprised that people had negative feelings towards the film, but that I personally thought it was great."
929,6,Polarising,"I was very intrigued walking in to the cinema to see this film. I had avoided spoilers like the plague. I felt that now that we removed the 'training wheels' that was The Force Awakens, we would be opened up to something new and original."
930,8,Just a Whole Lot of Fun,"I still vividly remember watching the beginning of the first Star Wars movie as the introductory words scrolled up the screen. And then, as the underbelly of the spaceship came into view, a chill went up my spine. I was mesmerized by the details as the ship grew bigger and bigger until it's form filled the entire screen. Then the story kicked in and I was hooked forever on the ongoing battle between good and evil and the wonderful cast of characters engaged in the Force."
931,6,Laura Dern?????,It's fine. In the tradition of the franchise. But Laura Dern? The hippie Laura Dern? Cannot compute....
932,8,An exciting and emotional addition to the Star Wars universe,"In every way this film improves on its immediate prequel, The Force Awakens. I attribute that to the previous film's careful, almost shot-for-shot recreation of Episode IV, the original SW film. While I enjoyed TFA a great deal, and I understand the reasoning of essentially rebooting the franchise by reintroducing all its main themes and plot points, it did feel a bit over-familiar to a long-time fan. But The Last Jedi takes off from that beginning at top speed and delivers an exciting ride full of twists, dangers, spy missions, humor (rather a lot of that!), possible romance, and drama. Mark Hamill is excellent as a bitter and reclusive older Luke who slowly rediscovers his hope for the future. The new characters all step up to stronger roles, with an intriguing subplot between Rey and Kylo Ren and a great turn by new arrival Rose. There are important discussions on the workings of the Force and the place of the Jedi, and an ending that seems to leave the Resistance at its lowest ebb but contains great hope from unexpected sources. I did think it tried a bit too hard to be snarkily funny, and it plays very fast and loose with physics, but i don't think those are major flaws in a film that is so very much fun."
933,6,Was it better than The Empire Strikes Back? No. But it could've been a lot worse.,"I went to see The Last Jedi with high hopes and excitement after waiting for 2 years. Was I disappointed? Yes. Were some scenes unnecessary? Yes. Were there plot holes and uninteresting characters? Yeah, but this movie could have been a lot worse. At least J.J. Abrams is going to direct Episode IX."
934,1,Killed Star Wars,"This may be the movie that destroys the Goodwill of the Star Wars name for good. None of the plot points that were brought up in the force awakens were continued into this movie. This movie is basically a big middle finger to all the longtime Star Wars fans, even Mark Hamill said that he fundamentally disagrees with Luke Skywalker's Direction in this film. Mary Poppins Princess Leia, the entire plot of this movie with Star Wars ships now having fuel tanks????  Also you could take out the entire casino world part of this movie and you won't be missing anything. There are so many plot holes continuity issues, and useless characters. JJ Abrams has a lot to live up to for the last episode of The Saga to save this franchise from itself"
935,10,emotional and intricate,"Minor plot holes are easy to look past with a more humanized and intricate face of Star Wars. A variety of characters whom move past archetypes into individuals helps this become the most well written yet, along with masterful cinematography, this may to be the superlative of all post-trilogy films in time."
936,7,Movie Review By MsClashKing YT,"The Last Jedi is really well shot and made film , the cinematography is really good but it fails at being a star wars movie . The Last Jedi is a great movie but makes some choices that can bring down the experience for star wars fans . 8/10 B+"
937,2,Youngsters logic : good graphics= good cinema,This movie is saddening than Alderaan's destruction.
938,,It's a disney family comedy for a weekend movie night.,"For everyone who doesn't know Star Wars, and just wants to see a comedy late night. I don't even want to write down the list of disappointments in the movie, because it would be longer the than number of the actually good scenes."
939,10,Loved it,"Been a fan of Star Wars since 1980 when I was two years old and saw empire at the cinema.<br /><br />It's been a big part of my life ever since, in fact I think about Star Wars every day and have done since I was two years old.<br /><br />I did enjoy the prequels but they were missing something... well actually quite a lot.<br /><br />However, the new movies are fantastic and the last Jedi probably the best of all of the Disney ones so far and I think the best since empire!"
940,7,I previously gave this a bad review,Second time viewing was much better.
941,10,Fantastic and Daring,The Last Jedi is the most divisive film in the Star Wars Saga with fans either loving it or hating it. I personally love it and after rewatching it I think it is one of the best films in the Star Wars Saga.
942,7,Earth shattering disappointment!,I came out of a midnight screening really deflated.
943,8,Not bad and not great,"I watched The Last Jedi now multiple times, but I still don't know exactly what I should think of it."
944,6,Not bad but expected a lot better,"Just came out from the theater...got some mixed feelings. It was more of like a connecting film between TFA and the one(s) that will come next. Not so much as a standalone episode. Felt like they weren't sure enough on what to do with Kylo Ren/BenSolo. I understand his torments and past but Johnson kinda played with him, resulting some sort of inconsistency. First half was quite flat but liked the 2nd half, particularly the finale though. Overall, not a bad film at all but expected a lot more twisted & entertaining.<br /><br />Among this new line of films (JJ Abrams era), here's my ranking:<br /><br />1. Rogue One<br /><br />2. The Force Awakens<br /><br />3. The Last Jedi"
945,1,LOL,"We don't win by destroying who we hate but by saving who we love, or something like that - says the girl who's sister sacrificed to save the ''rebellion'', then after that, everyone they love dies ( seemingly at least ) and she kiss the guy who almost killed. Hahahahahahahaa<br /><br />This movie is BAD."
946,10,Don't give into the Dark side...see it with an open mind,"First off, let me just say that I understand why star wars purists would hate this. It's because Luke didn't do what the fans wanted him to do. But what people need to ask themselves truthfully is who is Luke? Give us an honest answer."
947,6,Defies Expectations,"No, seriously, ""defying expectations"" seems to be the only thing they wanted to do in this film, and you can take that in just about any context you like. Serious scenes had gags, lighthearted scenes had serious casualties, ""the one thing we need to do"" was several ""one things"" that never happened, the ancient Jedi religion wasn't so important, the entire mission with the new character was a misdirection, Luke was rumored to go bad (and didn't), Rey was supposed to learn the Force and her history (she didn't), the showdown with the Sith was both brutal and slapstick at the same time (and not in a good way like Army of Darkness), and a significant portion of the movie (and the casualties) could've been avoided if the senior Rebel leadership took 20 seconds to explain the plan to key leadership. "
948,1,Just about the absolute worst science fiction film of all time,"Why on earth do they have ships dropping bombs in outer space that have to fall onto the enemy via some nonexistant gravity at an extremely slow speed endangering the entire ship if one of those bombs gets hit, when they have tons and tons of perfectly good ships of many other varieties that are far less likely to get vaporized within 15 seconds of the battle commencing, and why is the entire film this dumb? Also it undermines every premise the series is based on and for what?"
949,,"Better, but honestly....what's the point?","A significant step up from the mail-in that was The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi (for a start) does not feel the urge to jump into lightspeed with back-to-back action sequences that are as predicable as they were visually incomprehensible."
950,8,Not understanding the hate of this movie.,"Frankly, there are very few films that I'm in love with. That being the case, I'm confused by all the hate. The only thing I can come up with is that fan boys/girls had ridiculous expectations of this movie. "
951,7,Never thought I'd say this...,"But this movie made me miss the genius that was Jar-Jar Binks. There were a few good moments here and there, but overall I don't know what this was supposed to be. It did absolutely nothing to advance the stories of the previous saga films, and instead turned the mythology everyone loves about Star Wars into bantha dookie. It's time for Disney to end."
952,8,survival of the Force,"Me and 'Star Wars' was not a love at first sight story. I remember myself watching the first series created by George Lucas in 1977 and being quite confused. What was the big fuzz about? I was a big eater of science fiction literature, '2001 - A Space Odyssey' and 'Solaris' (by Tarkovsky, of course) were in my personal film tops, but Lucas' universe was not what I had expected - maybe because it was too low-tech, maybe the fairytale atmosphere and the characters reminded me too much the comics magazines of the childhood I had emerged from not so long time before. It took me watching and then rewatching the next series to begin to understand the charm of this galactic saga, to understand its rules and conventions, to integrate into this world while watching. I haven't become a fan, I don't dissect every sequence and every character, I don't participate in discussions in dedicated groups on the Internet, and between the 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars' series I still prefer the first one, but I understand it enough by now, it seems, to enjoy watching 'The Last Jedi' or 'Star Wars VIII' directed byRian Johnson, which seems to have deservedly earned the title of best film in this cycle in the 3rd millennium."
953,7,Don't let the poor reviews sway your opinion...,"The Star Wars franchise covers too many decades for everyone to agree if the story was appropriate. I am NOT one who complicates my movie enjoyment by over <br /><br />thinking a scripts, cinematography, plots, or whether a character should have been utilized differently. I want to be entertained and Episode VIII is definitely worth seeing in the theatre."
954,9,Loved it,"It was funny, action-packed, and gets you right in the feels. The visuals were stunning and frankly, the movie wasn't bogged down with some silly romance which is what kills it for me in other sci-fi movies. They keep that to a minimum and ramp up the humor a notch instead. Without giving away too much, they've toned down Kylo Ren a bit as well and actually make a tongue-in-cheek joke about that as well."
955,7,Why The Last Jedi is a Game Changer (or at least why it was so unsettling),"After watching the 8th installment of the Star Wars story, The Last Jedi, I wasn't quite sure how to respond. I just knew I needed to process it. Thankfully, I watched the film with my friend C.P. (If there's anything particularly insightful in this post it's probably because of his contribution)"
956,4,What on earth happened?,"This was the movie where the new trilogy had to come into its own, and God knows Johnson tried (even though the skeleton is Empire Strikes Back), but like the prequels it fails.<br /><br />Unlike the prequels the fault is not in the direction or the acting, but solely with the script.<br /><br />The plotholes are so huge you can drive several tanker trucks through them - sideways. Character motivations are practically non-existent or are so horribly shallowly explained they don't resonate at all, and the force is now basically a deux ex machina where characters can pull force powers of hitherto unseen or unheard of strengths out of nowhere simply to facilitate the plot - or get the writer out of a sticky situation. <br /><br />Add to that a subplot that goes nowhere and means nothing, simply to have specific characters in a specific location at a specific time, and you've got nothing short of a contrived mess of a script.<br /><br />This is a shame as this movie has a lot of potential and with a better thought out script could have been really good.<br /><br />Now I can only feel for the poor people who has to make a conclusion to this mess.<br /><br />With all that said, I did find it entertaining, but only when I shut my brain off..."
957,10,Don't believe the fanboy crybaby haters,"While the movie had it's flaws, I thought it was amazing. It's a shame when people think they know what is going to happen and then throw a temper tantrum when things go differently."
958,7,"Not what I was hoping for, but not terrible.","I was a big fan of Force Awakens, and although I didn't like Rogue One as a Star Wars film, I thought it was a decent movie. This film feels kind of like a weird blend of those two, and that doesn't always work out. "
959,1,Does Rian Johnson work for Jar Jar Abrams??,Just when you told things cannot get anymore cheesy and stupid here comes Rian to make Jar Jar Rip Off look good. Well nothing will rescue Episode VII but this episode is truly boring and sleep inducing.
960,,Worst Movie Ever Made,"The story was weak and segmented, with side stories that took away from the nonexistant plot to make political jabs at successful people. Director Rian Johnson literally raped the Triligy, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. Luke Skywalker hero of he Galaxy was portrayed and a piss stained, vagrant, milking sea cows for blue milk that doesnt have the force and turned to the dark side to try to kill kylo as a child at night while he was sleeping as a child. Luke single handedly tookout he old emperor without turning to the dark side and was the symbol of good but now hes bad in this lame movie. Director made Fins character a cowardly wimp running quitting the resistance, Poe was turned into a treasonous idiot, and Kylo Ren a wimpy emo whiner that cant beat a girl that never trained in the force that she just picked up a light saber 3 days ago. and the Feminin heros Social Justice Warior garbage was weak and undeveloped. Everyone and anyone can have the force now in this new PC Galaxy Far Far Away, instead of working for it. The purple haired woman got everyone killed before she decided to turn he ship around and crash into the Empire Cruiser, as if it was planned all along to wait intil everyone was dead except for Leia who did a Marry Popins through space with the force. How stupid is that. Shes dead in life and they didnt kill her so we have to watch her created by bad CG next movie and in a world where the men are weak, and everyone can use he force. Horrible. Do not watch."
961,8,"""This is not going to go the way you think.""","It can't be denied that the original STAR WARS trilogy is one of the most iconic cornerstones of filmmaking -- an ambitious mixing pot of space-blasting action, alien cultures, and mythological nuances that has captivated so many audiences for years. The namesake suffered something of a stall, however, with George Lucas' flawed prequel trilogy, which, with the exception of REVENGE OF THE SITH, couldn't live up to the reputation of the original trilogy. In a bizarre twist of fate, Disney of all companies purchased the rights to STAR WARS, beginning work on a new trilogy with other movies to come in the subsequent weeks. 2015's THE FORCE AWAKENS, handled by J.J. Abrams, while perhaps too much of a copycat of A NEW HOPE, was nonetheless breezy, flashy, and entertaining -- a great love-letter to the trilogy (with the exception of one character death). The subsequently released ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY was arguably even better: a thrilling tale which was arguably everything the prequels should have been."
962,7,The movie Star Wars fans dont know they need.,"This movie is already being criticised and largely hated as people declare ""Disney has killed Star Wars' ""This isn't the Star Wars we all love"" I myself was sad watching the movie, not because the movie was bad but because I knew people wouldn't understand why this film is so important and what a genius thing Rian did with the universe of Star Wars as a whole. Yes this is the end of Star Wars as we know, and the bold new step into something new and exciting. It's no longer just the dark side vs the light this film ingeniously throws that black and white morality out the window in one harsh move and declares that Star Wars is evolving into something deeper. This is a movie that can very easily be spoiled but the spoilers aren't superficial like someones parentage or secret name instead the spoilers are the things that set off this change in vision. This is all summarised in Kylo Ren who in this film evolves into the most fascinating Star Wars villain we've ever seen it's as he said in the trailer ""let the past die, kill it if you have to its the only way to become what you were meant to be"" and thats what Rian Johnson does here, he lays Star Wars to rest only for it to rise again more spectacular than ever. The old Star Wars bows out in some of the most beautiful scenes we've seen in the franchise with Luke and Leia both having their finest hour. It was indeed time for the Jedi to end and for something new to be born and continue the legacy of the galaxy far far away. Let's just hope they find someone a little more interesting than Rey to do it because unfortunately she is the biggest weak link and any semblance of character she had is dropped and she is now the Mary Sue we all feared her to be, this is a negative in an otherwise wonderful cast of interesting characters. In conclusion Last Jedi is not the best Star Wars film but it will be the most important one for decades to come and I sense that all the backlash it's getting for having the courage to do something new and controversial will one day turn into the admiration I and many others feel as we see this movie for what it is."
963,8,A fun addition to the star wars saga,"I went into this movie expecting a 'dark story'. I remember reading that it 'darker then Empire'. It is not. This movie is a very light movie with few if any truly dark moments. There were too many jokes taking away from otherwise serious scenes which I felt hurt this movie overall.<br /><br />But this is not to say that this is a bad movie, just not what I expected. It is a very enjoyable if you are looking for a fun movie that can watched with all audiences. I cannot help but compare it to a marvel movie - light, fun and accessible to everyone but missing depth in some areas.<br /><br />Overall I believe that some of the terrible reviews that this movie is facing are completely unwarranted. It is visually stunning and a great addition to the star wars universe. Just don't go into this expecting something like Empire."
964,7,Rian takes a new approach.,(Originally written Dec 2019)
965,10,Most Underrated Film Ever,"What I love about this film is that it actually has the balls. It makes bold decisions and takes the franchise in different directions. Sure there are problems, but it's just a movie. It can't be perfect, I believe fans expectations for this film were insanely high. There is no possible way that they were going to do anything like Snoke being Plagueis or Rey being a Kenobi. While it would have been cool it makes absolutely no sense, and means nothing to the story. Not even Luke or Leia knew of Darth Plagueis. They wouldn't care, but the audience would. You shouldn't ever be making a movie for the audience, You should make a well made, and good film, for yourself. And it doesn't matter what fans think, but Disney didn't care at all about that aspect. This is an amazing, well made, beautiful film, with amazing action, humor, and insanely great character development. And I might be the only star wars fan in the world who likes this movie. But i dont care. I love this movie"
966,6,A cinematic rollercoaster for both good and bad reasons.,Plot holes abound. The pacing is clunky. There are whole spans of the film's runtime that just drag.
967,1,Absolut trash,"This movie is the undoing of the whole star wars universe. It's so bad on so many levels it boggles the mind. The people who made this movie seem to have absolutely no clue what the story is and where this is all going. The core idea ""a star destroyer is very slowly chasing another starship is probably the worst idea anyone ever had"". Everything is so stupid. I wish i could ""unsee"" this movie. I haven't watched ""Rise of Skywalker"" because i know it is cut from the same cloth."
968,10,I don't understand the bad reviews,"I just watched this film last night, and I was absolutely hooked from the first amazing scene. It's a non-stop thrill ride with enough excitement, twists and depth of character to keep any fan going."
969,6,Basic Filmaking Flaws,"Although there were elements within the movie that I enjoyed, particularly those concerning Rey/Ren/Luke, I disliked this movie. The problems for me had nothing to do with how a beloved character was treated or how the force was presented. This movie had basic filmmaking flaws: pacing, plot, structure, character development. I was bored for most of the film, even though I was watching characters that I love. It wasn't until the final act that the pacing picked up as the plot lines merged. I'm genuinely shocked that this was the film that Lucasfilm loved so much that they didn't demand re-shoots or edits and gave the director his own trilogy."
970,1,Rian Johnson choices,"Rian Johnson has made extremely poor choices with Luke Skywalker's character and many others. Also Rey learning to master the force in 10 seconds is completely ridiculous..<br /><br />Not to forget about the purple hair lady telling her plan is ""HOPE"" to Poe which is completely dumb and makes Finn go waste some time on a casino planet to bring back an untrustworthy guy that will obviously sell himself to the highest bidder.<br /><br />Kylo Ren is still a crappy emo teen bad guy but now he has sexual tensions with Rey..<br /><br />Finn chooses to save the resistance by sacrificing himself but his new girlfriend Rose decided to save him by crashing into him(alright this would make them both explode) saying ""WE NEED TOSAVE DA ONES WE LOVE"" while the resistance base is being blown up in the background because of her..<br /><br />Then he drags her  on foot all the way back from being right in front of the enemy to the base with 0 issues.."
971,,Do or do not. There is no try.,"Got very mixed feelings about this. I'll just adress the parts That gave a disturbance in the force:<br /><br />Snokes death: pros: he was never that intriguing to me anyways. His arrogance killed him much like it was the case with Palpatine. Cons: regardless of him being a stereotypical uber villain, he did seem to fill the part of main opponent, since Kylo Ren seems more like a study in angst. With Snoke, starkiller base and Snokes flag ship out of the game I have difficulty seeing the typical sense of things to take care of for our heroes in episode 9. <br /><br />Lukes death: pros: Actually liked the grumpy old man approach... cons: But spending Lukes life the way it was done seemed utter wastefull, regarding 35 years speculating what he'd be able to do as an old jedi master. It was, to me, a lack of ideas that made them spend him in an attempt to mirror Yodas serene death i RotJ. <br /><br />Hyperspace kamikaze: pros: looked cool. Cons: it changed the ""rules"" of all future space battles in Star Wars... The next time the rebel fleet is hopelessly outnumbered, hyperspace kamikaze as an option seems required. <br /><br />Reys family background: pros: Anakin came from humble beginnings also. Cons: dont serve up mysteries and then kill then so backhandedly as it was done. <br /><br />The gambling planet detour: pros: none. Cons: overall this side plot served no purpose at all other than screen time for main characters, introduction of benicios character which I didnt come to care for anyways and his final betrayel as a result was so anticlimactic. <br /><br />Captain Phasma: Again a totally wasted character... She be ""killed a third time"" in episode 9, as I cant imagine that falling into flames present her bigger difficulties escaping than being locked in a trash conpacter on an exploding superweapon. <br /><br />All in all this movie reeked of a director not liking the setup given to him from episode 7, and thus disposing of same for cheap surprizes rather than working with it."
972,10,Most of these reviews are bots.,"Don't feed the trolls. This is an excellent, sweeping epic with subverted twists and turns that even the most arrogant of Star Wars fans wouldn't have expected. Rest In Peace, Carrie Fisher, to us you will always be royalty."
973,7,so so,"To be honest, I am not satisfied with this one, which is much worse than the rumored Grand Theft Auto One. So many high ratings in North America seriously suspect that the emperor's new clothes can't be moved. The story processing is simplified. I really ca n't talk about the motivation of some two roles, especially criticizing the heroine 's acting skills, it 's almost the level of the dragon mother 's possession, and the second Asian female hero can finish it. The best movie is only when Luke Skywalker returns."
974,10,"Of all the Star Wars films, since the OT...","Am seriously dumbfounded... Not by the newest Star Wars film, but by the number of people that dislike or hate it. Go figure... <br /><br />Maybe I am a more 'casual' fan, light-years from the cosplay, buy-every-action-figure, comic book, and read every SW novel type of Super Fan... But I am a '1st Fan', having seen each SW film since the very first one premiered way, way back in May of 1977. I loved the first movie so much, a high school chum and I even hid out in the theater restroom, right after seeing 'Star Wars', just so we could see the next screening right away... yup! Oh, what memories...<br /><br />Now, am only going here on my one and only viewing, so far, of The Last Jedi, but I enjoyed it... A lot... In just one word, after it ended, I could only say was: ""Whoa!""<br /><br />Yes, oh yes, there is a lot in this film that came almost out of nowhere, or maybe from some wormhole in the screenwriters deep-dark imagination... Like the burning of the Jedi Texts (hey, I love old books, so the burning of ANY books, especially ones with mystical/spiritual and other esoteric type of knowledge, just rubs me wrong!). And the part of Leia 'Force-Flying' (?) back to the rebel command ship soon after being blown out into space... well, that was more unexpected stuff, but hey, she is a Skywalker after all, and the other half of Yoda & Obi-Wan's 'Last Hope' (Episode 6, ROTJ). Mostly, I just took all this and more into stride, and simply just watched what was a very cool, action-packed, fantasy/science fiction-filled adventure... I had gone in hoping the movie would be good, but not expecting any certain things to happen, or not happen, in the story or on screen. Just watched SW:TLJ with an open mind & heart, and had a great time... And, I found so much to like in it, like the many new aliens & creatures, vehicles, etc. Basically, it was just a 'Fun Time At The Movies', which was all I really wanted... I got that & more! And so, for now, like Stan Lee says: ""Nuff said!"" (...and May the Force be with You!)"
975,6,"Chaotic, no better than previous part","I am neutral, not die hard fan of the franchise. For me, SW starts with SW: F. Awakens... which was more solid and story was holding together. Here, the story is boring, too lenghtly stretched into many lines, where you must find yourself thanks to big jumps from line to line...For example Finn´s storyline is boring, Rose is ULTRA ANNOYING.. Humour is 90% childlish but i give you that some of em were very funny. Final battle is joke, so many cliché (phasma preparing to execute hostage like 10 minutes) , Rey was put aside and despite hard training she had ONE action scene against snoke and thats it ? Only good thing for die hard fans is character development - huge step forward for Poe and Kylo Ren.. Those two are main pillars of the story.. Overal - boring, more childlish, dissapointing, but i accept that high score, cuz the movie is playing with your emotions and 95% of our planet are people with weak emotions, so score is that high..."
976,9,Loved it!,"I don't know what all the angry people here are about, but this movie was awesome! It was exciting, it was funny and sad, we laughed and cried and cheered and just had a blast!"
977,7,"At most, a mediocre movie compared to some of the older episodes",Pros:<br /><br />
978,1,The Last Review,"Where are all the 10/10 reviews? Where? Maybe just the 8/10s, how about those? I mean, they must be somewhere right? Because this movie has 7.4/10 on IMDb, 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, 85% on metacritic... So where are all these positive reviews to be found?"
979,10,Fake reviews?,"Honestly the only  reviews are the people giving it a 1/10 to try and bring down the score, the actual people who didn't like it are giving it like 3 or 4 opinions that matter and with reason, 1/10 just makes the people criticising the film look like a bunch of idiots which they are, realistically the movie for me is a 7 or 8 but I'll put the 10 to try and regulate the score"
980,7,So torn,Spoilers ahead. You've been warned.
981,4,I am not a star wars fan.,I am not a star wars fan. But the movies were fun. The films had their own world. this movie is not star wars. <br /><br />It's a very bad movie.
982,,Disappointing..,After watching The Force Awakens which was not a bad movie I watched the Last Jedi hoping for another roller coaster ride but this was a pretty big downer.
983,8,"Different, but welcomed.","I give full credit for the Telegraph's review of this film when I paraphrase them here: this is more Star Wars as you never felt it, than Star Wars as you've never seen it before. The film feels different to the rest of the Saga, largely in a good way. It does a far better job of developing the characters than The Force Awakens. There are some terrific scenes between the central characters. I will admit, however, like Ep7 the film does not do enough to develop all the characters. Phasma is again completely under-utilised, and now supposedly gone forever. Laura Dern's character also deserved more development. A waste, in my opinion, of a fantastic actress, despite her heroic, epic demise."
984,6,What a let down ....,From Princess Leah flying threw space to Snope being destroyed without any indication of where he came from or his lack of knowledge about Luke Skywalker. SW is now just catabolizing itself. I hope Solo is a better movie. The Last Jedi was disappointing.
985,8,Incredible movie...,"Just got back from the theaters watching The Last Jedi. Incredible. Not a dull moment in the movie. I loved the excitement and humor, the characters old and new. Moments that surprised me and the plot twists. I looked at the opening weekend and what it's made so far as world wide...very impressive. Over 1 billion. If I were George Lucas, I might be regretting selling the franchise to Disney...but that's all in the past now. I have seen some haters out there posting 1 stars and one even quoting that the movie was...POINTLESS. Wow. Someone didn't get enough hugs as a child. Anyway, I guess that person is entitled to his/her opinion. Mine, though...is incredible. I was impressed and the numbers don't lie. People love Star Wars and more movies are on the way. I for one, will be there for them. Go watch this one folks. Peace."
986,7,Loser fan boys need not read.,"It's so pathetic the reviews on here. God forbid a movie doesn't come out the way you want. I love Star Wars. Yeah there were a few parts that I didn't like, and were not necessary. But to trash the movie so bad and to sign a petition to remake the movie??? LOL!! It's laughable. If you don't like the movie that much, move out of your parents basement, and move to Hollywood and become a movie producer. Until then, grow a set and sit back and enjoy the movies. I can't wait for the next one."
987,9,Not what I expected....but liked it!!,After the initial viewing I felt a little let down as The Last Jedi seemed a little confused and left more questions than answers but after a second viewing (3D this time which doesn't add much to the visual experience) questions are answered and the plot becomes more enjoyable and makes more sense. <br /><br />There's 3 main story lines which eventually come together to set things up nicely for the final instalment. Some characters like Snoke could've been used more plus a bit of a background story would've been nice. <br /><br />There's the usual spectacular Star Wars set pieces and lightsaber action and some of the dialogue is spectacularly cheesy. There are plot holes but hey ho it's not based on fact is it!!! It certainly isn't a stand a lone film and a viewing of The Force Awakens would be beneficial as TLJ carries on straight from the end of TFA. Overall it's a very enjoyable ride!
988,7,Star Wars is dead! Long live Star Wars!,NO SPOILERS
989,2,Great movie! Leia is Mary Poppins and Chewie is a vegan,You'll love The Last Jedi if your idea of a great movie involves:
990,10,"The ""Seinfeld"" palliative is wearing off ...",And these reasons ultimately will be revealed to be Karmic.
991,7,A few things come to mind ..,SPOILERS !!!!!!
992,3,It's not original. It's the same structure as Empire,"I watched this and empire back to back recently, to compare the two, and I noticed how similar the two are. The chase in space, the protagonist being taught by an old grumpy jedi, a smuggler who betrayes our characters, a battle with AT-AT's on a white planet. The fact it copies so much from its counter part shows how unoriginal this film is."
993,,I honestly don't get the hate. Watch it and judge it for yourself.,"First off, I would honestly like to say if you loved or put up with the Star Wars prequels, I honestly believe you should have no problem with the newest Star Wars films, otherwise... you're in my opinion a hypocrite."
994,8,"Patience people, patience...","I am writing this review mainly to refute those venomous posters on IMDB that displayed frustration with the movie's lack of clarity and dismissive storyline. <br /><br />Let me start by saying that The Force Awakens was less of a sequel and more of a second act in a larger story. <br /><br />I too was hoping for more answers after the enticing seventh episode (The Force Awakens) and was initially mildly disappointed when I left the theater with more questions than clarity. <br /><br />After digesting the movie for a couple days, I have come to the conclusion that we might just have to wait another couple years to learn more about some of the more mysterious characters and plot-points. No, we didn't learn a darn thing about Snoke, but that doesn't mean we won't in the final installment. No, the Knights of Ren were absent, but I also believe this will come to fruition. <br /><br />Taking on the Star Wars brand comes with tremendous responsibility, and Disney has done a remarkable job as chief caretaker since taking over in 2014. Much of the negativity from hardcore fanboys comes from an emotional perspective, and I can sympathize with that. However, it's important to trust the process. Things will flesh out and we will gain a better understanding of TFA after the Eposide 9 comes out in December of 2020. Think of it this way: You can't fully enjoy a piece of art until the entire picture has been painted. It's pretty much that simple.<br /><br />Now, as a movie, TFA was technically flawless. The visuals, transitions, battle/fight scenes and imagery were excellent. The acting was top-notch and the sound was, as always, inspiring and realistic. I was a little disappointed with Luke's character, and the milking scene was a little ridiculous, but I don't think he was portrayed as terribly as many people are saying. The movie dragged on a bit as well. Three different times I thought it was going to fade to black and roll credits only to have another climatic 10-minute scene. I'm not saying I'm upset with his, merely making an observation. I mean, the more Star Wars, the better, right? <br /><br />My biggest struggle as a fan is the fact that Luke and Han are now gone and Leia is on her way out as well. The Skywalker story has run its course and the ever-nostalgic Star Wars fans have to re-adjust and embrace the new generations of characters. It's going to take some time, but we'll get there."
995,6,A huge garbage compactor fire that destroys the Star Wars universe,This is the worst Star Wars movie. 
996,9,First New Star Wars Movie Worthy of the Trilogy,"'The Last Jedi' is the first post trilogy movie worthy of the originals. I wasn't very pumped to see this movie and was waiting for it to start rehashing old ideas or just sucking outright like most of the new Star Wars movies have. Well, while I was waiting I started getting engaged in what was going on and then I actually started enjoying the movie. What a pleasant surprise. There are some iconic scenes in this one. Also some real bad-ass moments. Daisy Ripley is very good, though they should make her smile more. She's got a really charming smile. The rest of the cast was great. It was a little rough seeing what was an obviously CGI created Carrie Fisher in some scenes but I'm guessing she would've approved or did before she died. (Very sad about losing our Princess, still)"
997,7,Rian Johnson Disney Attempt,"As a viewer we could feel what Rian Johnson was attempting to do. A very different feel to what JJ Abrams brand to us in Episode VII, much more colorful and lively. However, this was not close to meeting our expectations in my opinion."
998,8,Thank God George Lucas sold Star Wars,"The Force Awakes, Rogue One and now the last Jedi have completely removed the taste of garbage (the prequels, especially Phantom Menace) from my mouth."
999,6,It's as if they purposely wanted to disappoint the fans,"I can't believe what i just watched. It had potential from the start and then ruined everything it could have possibly been. Snoke's character written off poorly. Luke's character written terribly and never should of ended like that. Rey a mary sue as always. Terrible effects, editing too messy, rushed and boring in the middle. You have disrespected generations of fans Rian and Disney."
1000,1,Was this George's plan all along?,"George Lucas is truly a genius. After seeing The Last Jedi I will never again mock Lucas' vision for Star Wars. I will watch the prequel trilogy with a new appreciation. I won't roll my eyes at the lame humor, or laugh at the horrible acting, or mock the bad CGI and Jar Jar Binks (okay, I'll probably still do that). The Last Jedi has done what I believed to be impossible. It made me long for another George Lucas Star Wars movie. Right now I would give almost anything for his version of episodes 7,8, and 9. I can't help but think this was George Lucas' hope from the start. He somehow knew the only way to win back the fans (and make a quick buck) was to have someone else ruin Star Wars worse than he ever did. And that is exactly what happened. Now George will be remembered as the hero, and Disney will be remembered as the villain who gave us The Last Jedi, aka the worst Star Wars movie of the bunch (and there are some clunkers in that bunch). "
1001,8,A new bold chapter in the Star Wars saga,The Last Jedi is a Star Wars film full of twists and unexpected events.
1002,6,Star Wars 8: Review,"After Force Awakens which left me a lot of questions, i hoped star wars 8 would answer most of them in a satisfying way. I would just like to say that i am a huge star wars fan and i am not being paid to write this, the originals have always been my top 3 in the franchise, the first 2 prequels were not truly satisfying, the third one was one of the best, seventh was entertaining if unoriginal and rogue one was not bad at all. i am not a porfessional reviewer so i will just write out the good and bad qualities of this film<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />. Rian Johnson creates a film that is distinctive in tradition and humour to the rest of the franchise which is interesting to see<br /><br />. Performances are brilliant, particularly Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver<br /><br />. Visual effects are still awesome(It is Star Wars obviously)<br /><br />. Good messages and themes of atoning for ones mistakes<br /><br />. Brilliant action scenes, if not as innovative as the prequels and originals.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />.Humour is sometimes overused, which sometimes affects the emotional weight of the film<br /><br />. The plot is lacking and contains some plot holes particularly inconstencies with the previous installment.<br /><br />. Finn and Poe's subplots are lacking<br /><br />. Some characters lack development<br /><br />. still asks more questions than it answers<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this film to any major star wars fan and sci-fi fan, however this film will not agree with any star wars fan but my advice is just to give it a shot and see for youselves. Originally i had mixed thoughts on this film but after watching it a second time, it grew on me."
1003,1,"Wow, one of the worst movies I've seen in years.","I saw TLJ yesterday (12/15/17) after hearing glowing reviews from the critics and a huge fan boy friend. I went in hoping for the best, I almost walked out it was so bad. "
1004,,Star Wars is getting so lost the more movies they roll out,"I've never written a review for any movies ever, but Star Wars has always been a special place in my heart. However, the film disappointed me so much that I just got to write a review bout this film."
1005,9,Fight the dark side of criticism,"I should honestly give it an 8, but I've rarely seen a good work attacked like this one is.<br /><br />If you like Ep.7 you should like this one too, although it is not quite as good. <br /><br />I could argue long and hard with harsh opinions, but I did not like the previous trilogy, which was pretty to look at but did not move me. I've found this new trilogy, so far, closer in spirit to the first trilogy. Vador's grandson doesn't split the screen, that's too bad, because the british cast is good and both new generation of Jedi are supposed to be future ""Yoda level masters"". <br /><br />Initiation, humour, spaceships,action : It's there. Not the alchemy between the characters that was there in the previous episode, they build themselves apart from each other, which might be good for the third episode.<br /><br />It was good. getting a 3-D machine gun pointed at you right from the start is still a bit compelling and totally Star Wars..."
1006,6,"Eh.... Didn't live up to the hype, hopefully Episode IX is better","The storyline was interesting. The action was cool yet, bland. The whole Leia floating through space was stupid. Snoke so called ""Supreme Leader"" was killed with a single lightsaber blow! Seriously?! Why didn't we get to meet Rey's parents?<br /><br />The movie was not as bad as everyone says it was I'll give you that. The soundtrack is pretty cool. Rey kicking butt with Kylo Ren was pretty cool. Captain Phasma was defeated as she added little to the plot in this movie as well as The Force Awakens. Not bad, but not good."
1007,9,"Not perfect, but must see","Star Wars: The Last Jedi has already divided Star Wars fan to two camp, those who love it and those who hate it. Me myself belongs to that camp, who can not dislike any Star Wars movie. Biggest problem in The Last Jedi is it's fragmentation and focusing to tell too many stories. After all it is story of Skywalker family saga. Movie doesn't fixate enough of Skywalker story, like the original trilogy. For example leaving Rey out of the family drama even she is in the middle of story telling is a little baffling. Although it may be deliberate and the next movie may contain some big surprises. If so this is easy to forgive at this moment."
1008,7,"Solid film, but won't knock anyone's socks off","At the end of the previous Star Wars film, we were given the ultimate tease and pseudo-promise: Luke Skywalker would train Rey to become a Jedi and she would eventually lead the Resistance against the First Order."
1009,9,Finally somebody had fun making a Star Wars sequel,"Very refreshing to see this film after decades of disappointing post-original trilogy follow-ups. I felt the director and actors livened up for this outing, freed themselves of some of the pressures which might have marred the last two (The Force Awakens and the bleak spinoff Rogue One), films that felt stiff and unimaginative in comparison. Whereas I left the Force Awakens sorely disappointed at lack of new vision, I left the Last Jedi reinvigorated with hope that this franchise can actually live to bring new imaginative layers to the Star Wars universe. "
1010,7,intresting enough,I went to see this movie in hopes of loving it but it turned out I actually kinda got bored during the movie it was a nice time and there was plenty of action some 0of it was just dry in some parts its a good fun movie and family friendly don't get me wrong but I for one just wasn't as impressed as maybe I should have been and that's a big thing to me I did lobe rey and some other characters but it just was stail and flat in a few parts
1011,3,This Movie Wipes It's Backside With Star Wars,"This is Star Wars in the Universe of Gender Studies. Luke has been tragically transformed into a bitter white make stereotype. Girl power rules the day with a ""Jedi"" who has received zero training yet demonstrated a rather unnerving mastery of the force. Admiral Third Wave entirely misleads the rebel fleet and only redeems herself and her purple hair with a kamikaze dive into a super duper Imperial Star Destroyer."
1012,9,"It Takes Risks, And I Appreciate That","I believe this film is divisive because it's different. Some people like the risks it takes, and some people think it deviates from what Star Wars is. Personally, I appreciated its boldness and its willingness to take risks. One of my biggest problems with The Force Awakens was that it pretty much followed the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope formula. In my eyes, it played it safe. But I do understand why some would be turned off by The Last Jedi. It does try new things, and that won't work for everyone. However, I personally found the good outweighed the bad, and there was a lot more good in the film than bad. But there will be people who disagree specifically on what are the good parts and what are the bad parts. The Last Jedi, moment by moment, asks itself what the complete opposite thing anyone would have expected them to do is, and then does it. But this isn't simply for the sake of doing so, but rather it all serves the story and the narrative Rian Johnson has crafted. The things that happen in this film come completely out of left field. If you had told me what happens in this movie prior to my seeing it, I would have been angry. I would have thought that it ruined the movie, and it was a disservice to the characters and to the brand. However, upon seeing it in context, and seeing how every choice, no matter how different it may be, serves the story, I'm on board. It's not the story I would have chosen myself, but it ultimately works and I like the direction they are going in. It's not often that I get to sit in a movie theater and genuinely have zero idea of what is going to happen next. For the eighth (technically ninth) entry into a single franchise, having this level of unpredictability and originality is incredibly refreshing..."
1013,7,"More aliens, please","I don't really get why so many people hated this movie. As a Star Wars entry, it's pretty decent. <br /><br />I only have one complaint: it needed more aliens. Star Wars is a space opera. A big part of the magic of the first movies was being transported to a universe bursting with alien species interacting with each other and humans being thrown in the middle of that endless ocean of space oddities.<br /><br />This movie is too human-centric. Where are the Yodas, Jabbas, ewoks, etc....? (yes, I even almost missed Jar-Jar Binks... almost). Even Chewbacca was relegated to being a f...ing extra in this movie. I'd be surprised if his total screen time exceeded five minutes.<br /><br />Star Wars is not Battlestar Galactica. Bring back the magic! Make the next one more epic!<br /><br />Like I said, this one was a decent Star Wars. Better than the prequels, not even close to being as good as the Empire Strikes Back though, despite what's been said by some idiotic critics. Could've been better but it was nowhere near franchise-destroying as some would have you believe."
1014,1,This needs to be de-Canonized.,This is not the trilogy George Lucas created. This is disrespectful to the Star Wars community and to Lucas. This movie must be de canonized.
1015,,"a Disapointing Mess, but Not Irredeemable.","This film doesn't derserve 7.2, it deserves maybe 6.2 at most. Calling critics(or anyone else for that matter) of the film racist(or sexist or bigoted) is a lazy, dirty, and cheap tactic to silence those who disagree with you. Have more respect and decency for people who don't share you opinion. Everything is a not ground zero for your social justice campaigns, pull your head out of your bum and live in the real world please, if this is something you regularly do. One of the problems with this film, outside of illogical plot points and stupid character choices, and and insistence on killing people off for no good reason, is it tries to change certain things about the original films, making them less fun, and puts an overemphasis on feminism(which I am willing to look past, unlike those calling other sexist and racist) and other silly modern issues that have no place in these films."
1016,8,Not one of there strongest but still worth the watch,"I could tell you now I'm a star wars fan<br /><br /> Thi one was ok. Not their worst, but not the best<br /><br /> Acting was pretty good, God rest Carrie Fisher, I just felt that story wasn't the best, but better than the prequels from 1999. I did like it, but the originals will always be their best"
1017,7,A huge but un even rollercoaster ride of entertainment and disappointment,"Star Wars the last Jedi is a very long movie, and there was ample room for cuts, witness the jarring and completely pointless scene of Luke drinking raw seal milk on the beach... uh... yeah...."
1018,8,"Not for the hardcore fans, terrible subplot yet few great stuff. Could be better, but....","Everyone has to agree to disagree: this is a transition towards a new generation. So newbies will love it, hardcore fans will hate it."
1019,7,"""The Last Jedi"" is a good, well-made film","I'm writing this review to mainly target against those who gave the film a 1 and such. Personally, I don't see it being that level of bad. Even if I were going on the basis of my personal enjoyment from the film, it would still be a 6."
1020,10,Could Not Stop Smiling Until I Gasped In Delight,I was gripped within the first moments. It held my heart in its hand till the end. Then left me both satisfied and wanting more. 
1021,7,Only Disney Star Wars that comes close to George Lucas,"I don't understand the hate for this movie. In my opinion it is by far the best Disney SW movie and the only one I wish I had seen in theaters. Echoes of The Empire Strikes Back for sure but not a hack remake like The Force Awakens or a B-movie with a blockbuster budget like Solo or Rogue 1. The new actors are fine, Mark Hamill does a good job and so does Carrie Fisher. Luke's island and the casino are visually cool. Is it my favorite Star Wars movie? No, not by a long shot, but it's the only Disney one that tries to be anything more than mindless entertainment. After TFA I almost didn't even watch this but I'm glad I did and I'm actually excited now for the conclusion to the story."
1022,1,"If low speed chases are your thing, look no further.","Boring, illogical, pointless..... and that's just Laura Dern."
1023,9,Unbelievable action non-stop,"Unbelievable action non-stop. Right from the get go after the scrolls roll through the way they enter the planet was both innovative and creative as hell! Yes, he made some controversial mistakes so from a Star Wars passionate fan's perspective I get that. You don't think a wanted a longer fought out battle between Luke and Kylo, the flesh and blood like. But honestly, watching it again and again it's up with one of the more entertaining movies !"
1024,6,This might be the beginning of the Star Wars franchise collapse,"So,when I heard that Star Wars The Last Jedi will be release this year I really wanted to see the movie and to see if it will be better than Star Wars The Force Awakens.And it is as good as the prequel,not better and not worst than it.<br /><br />The thing is that,if the company as well as the directors of the upcoming Star Wars movies will continue in this direction than the hole Star Wars franchise will soon be ruined and hated by the fans.<br /><br />What do I want to say by that? Well,by that I want to say that if the directors of the upcoming Star Wars movies will continue to kill the major characters as well as the minor ones from the old Star Wars movies,than the franchise won't survive with the characters from the new Star Wars movies.<br /><br />They already killed in just two Star Wars movies 2 major characters from the old Star Wars movies and those are Luke Skywalker and Han Solo,not to mention that,got rest her soul,Carrie Fisher died just after she finished filming for this movie.<br /><br />So be ready in the 9th film to see her character,Leia Skywalker to die and with her death we can say goodbye to the major characters from the Star Wars movies,except C-3PO,R2-D2 and Chewbacca.<br /><br />But let's not despair,there's still hope for the new Star Wars characters like Poe Dameron,Finn,BB-8,Rey and Kylo Ren to become the next big Star Wars character,who will become almost as great as the old characters.But that will take a lot of time and it will depend on the directors of the upcoming Star Wars movies.<br /><br />Overall,I enjoyed watching this movie and I found it as being just a good SF movie and almost a good Star Wars movie. I think that what I didn't liked was the fact that Mark Hamill's characters was undervalue by the director of the movie and i think that Mark Hamill's character deserved more than we've seen of him in these 2 movies:Star Wars The Force Awakens and Star Wars The Last Jedi.<br /><br />Again,in the future I hope that both the company and the directors of the next Star Wars movies won't repeat this mistake again or they should be ready for what will come next,if they'll do it again.By the way,I think that the only great thing that didn't make this movie to be bad is the great performance that Adam Driver is doing with his character,Kylo Ren."
1025,3,Not My Star Wars,"The movie might've turned out ok with another movie title/brand attachment completely removed from the ""Star Wars Galaxy"". The plot's razor thin and there's nothing to this story. The less said of the inordinate amount of screen time to ""Rose"" the better. The treatment of the original legacy characters was beyond horrible. The special effects look great and the actors do well considering what they have to work with. I've viewed this movie ONE time & it was more than enough, I don't have plans on watching it again. I have no desire to watch ""Rise Of Palpatine"" anytime soon."
1026,,It sucks!!!,"Ok, you don't need to watch this movie. You know why, because it's the worst. You know what don't watch the sequel at all. This movie shows how bad Kathleen Kennedy is at making movies. Did you know that she hadn't even watched any Star Wars movie. Even the legend Mark Hamill made it pretty clear that he hates this movie. Okay, so just stay away from this movie and the whole sequel trilogy. Plus, those who rated this movie have a big problem"
1027,9,A film that is part of Star Wars canon and therefore must be respected,"This film is part of the beloved Star Wars canon and was made by professionals employed by a competent and successful organisation known as Disney and spent millions of hard-earned dollars to make this film great so this film has to be respected. It may not be for everyone but people can't just dismiss it as non-canon when it was made by professionals who clearly love the Star Wars franchise, otherwise it just gets silly to the point everyone is dismissing each other's points due to pretending everything they don't like or didn't prefer isn't canon."
1028,7,"If you liked The Force Awakens, you'll like this one too","I'd rate this exactly at the same level as The Force Awakens: A solid 7. Whereas that film was populist and safe, this film is ballsy and unpredictable, so I slightly appreciated this more, and rewatched it for novelty's sake, whereas TFA was a one-and-done affair."
1029,9,Stellar,"An excellent entry in the ever growing Star Wars saga by writer/director Rian Johnson, who manages to create the most beautiful shots in a Star Wars movie and is able to write a very interesting plot about what happened to the characters of the sequel trilogy while honoring the veterans that came before it. Brilliant music by John Williams improving on his previous 'Force Awakens' soundtrack. Brilliant performances from the entire cast, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill standing out as the best. The film pays respects to the legacy of the original trio and pushes them in an unexpected direction that fans who are open to change will be eager to see. Not without its problems the film is boggled down by Canto Bight scenes, not by the ideas, but by the execution. Rian Johnson is able to create excellent ideas but sometimes struggles to execute them well."
1030,7,Am I Not Entertained??,"I am entertained. I watched it 2 nights in a row and I still want to watch it again. That's more than I can say for AOTC.<br /><br />Still there are quite a few nagging bits, in no particular order.<br /><br />1. Why are trained people dumb as knobs? Poe turned off HIS radio, not the whole communications network right? So when Leia said to retreat they ALL heard her? Why did they continue?<br /><br />2. Speaking of Poe.... He's supposed to be the ""Han Solo"" right? Was Han ever that big of a... wad? (I don't know what the language restrictions are here.)<br /><br />3. We watched Obi-Wan confront his dark side padawan. Watching Luke do it with Ben is not riveting.<br /><br />4. Finn is a loser of epic proportions. I don't know how they expect a franchise to succeed with him in it. Also don't know why Rose is hated more than that loser.<br /><br />5. Speaking of Finn and Rose, they wasted time and resources on saving a ship that was destined for destruction and got the resistance killed. Who's writing these stories now? Depressing much?<br /><br />6. The Supreme Leader was cut in half. Who are those red dudes fighting for at that point??<br /><br />7. Luke....I can't even go on."
1031,9,Another stellar episode,"It took me a while before I decided to go and see this eighth chapter of the Star Wars saga and the reason is mainly one: I was afraid, afraid that all those comments and all those reviews of all those disappointed and angry fans were truthful.<br /><br />But, finally, I went to the cinema, and I never expected what my eyes have seen, perhaps having read all those negative opinions and all those positive opinions allowed me to go without knowing what to expect and certainly they brought me in that movie theater with one but important certainty: ""The Last Jedi"" would have upset the future of this extraordinary saga.<br /><br />And it's true, it does.<br /><br />Before seeing it, I told myself that in any way it would have gone, that is, if those changes would have liked me or not, Rian Johnson had great courage and this had to be done, changes had to be made.<br /><br />Because if the seventh chapter was a real tribute to the original trilogy, a film made by a fan (JJ Abrams) for fans, that was fine (I liked it a lot) because it was no longer a prequel but a sequel waited for almost forty years; this chapter had to give something new to the new generation of future fans of the universe created by George Lucas, had to give them their ""Original Trilogy"" something that in the future can be honored in turn, and this need of change, of fresh air was more than satisfied.<br /><br />It was virtually inevitable the division (which then took place) between the vast and growing Fandom, which was divided between those who loved this film and embraced the changes it has involved, and who, however, has detested it and has not at all appreciated the distortion of the plot and especially of the original characters, primarily Luke Skywalker. I was terrified of ending up in this second group but, fortunately, it didn't happened.<br /><br />Honestly after seeing it I do not understand most of the criticisms that have been made: it is true Luke is different from before but this is called development of a character, he can not always remain the same character, it would be monotonous, now he is aged, is a Luke who has spent many years in voluntary isolation, who has been disappointed by himself and by others, who is afraid of being seen as a failure, a Luke who remains stranded amid the mistakes he has made in the past and, above all, in this new phase he must not and is no longer the protagonist but a young person named Rey. In my opinion this is a splendid change of character.<br /><br />And it is right, as the film says through the voice of Kylo Ren, that the old dies and the new takes its place.<br /><br />And speaking of Kylo Ren, he in this film, undergoes a really crazy development, turns out to be a much more complex, intriguing and profound character than you could ever think and the same is true for Rey, who is the real protagonist that puts a lot more in the shade Finn, who still manages to find his place.<br /><br />And also the comedy, so much criticized, of this eighth chapter finds the right place without ever exaggerating or being too disruptive to divert attention or distort the whole thing, also because in reality the comedy has always been part of the universe of Star Wars already from the first chapters; certainly a different comedy and less childish but ""The Last Jedi"" adapts to the success trend, that is the one brought by Marvel and I do not see what wrong is in this, the current generation wants this and in fact this can be seen from the results at the box- office.<br /><br />Indeed, from all the criticism that I read I would have expected much more comedy, much more childish, and I was afraid, and instead I must say that the comedic timing, as well as being spot on, are well calibrated, are not too many and even for this can make fun and laugh at the right point and with the right dose. In addition, there is the darker component that characterized the fifth chapter and that can be perceived again in several scenes.<br /><br />Scenes that really leave you speechless, many have thrilled me, others amused, some anguished and still amazed by their flawless technical, visual (extraordinary special effects) and sound (a wonderful soundtrack that, in addition to resume historical themes of the saga, adds new awesome musics that diversify a lot the score of Star Wars) quality.<br /><br />Rian Johnson directs everything with extreme precision, but also with a lot of imagination and desire to entertain, have fun, and amaze the audience through breathtaking sequences.<br /><br />I think this is what a Star Wars movie really needs to do, especially now that we've reached a total of eight films + spin-offs.<br /><br />Like the V, this expands the universe more and more with new creatures, new worlds and new characters.<br /><br />Of course the film is not without problems: there are some things that deserve an explanation (first of all the scene of Leia that ""flies"" in space and the character of Holdo) but I think and I hope that these various small holes are plugged in the following chapters. On the other hand, we waited almost 40 years for a big screenplay hole to be tapped and then Rogue One arrived, so hope is the last to die.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this is the best Star Wars on a par with the fifth chapter."
1032,7,Within this cluttered mess lies epic scenes.,"TLJ undoubtedly peaks during it's assortment of battle sequences which are mostly thrilling ventures, something which is most evident in it's spectacular opening sequence."
1033,1,This movie sucks.,"How Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy treated Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker, Tom Kane and Admiral Gial Ackbar disrespected the legacy of these actors and characters. Killing offAdmiral Ackbar and Luke Skywalker is also terrible. This was a disrespect to George Lucas's creation of Star Wars."
1034,10,This is new Star Wars and you'd better just to accept it,"After watching The Last Jedi again I have made a conclusion - this is one of the best Star Wars films. Yes, people criticize it like hell, but have you ever try to find its best sides? I can re-watch this movie just to see this scene - the scene of punishment of lost and betrayed apprentice. This is still star wars, and keep in mind that it just cannot be the very same movie you used to enjoy in late 70s and 80s. I love original trilogy as well and I love the prequels, the new Star Wars is to be loved as well, and I came well prepared for some changes, bit it still the old Star Wars we need, this is the story to see, despite millions of people offer their own plot and characters development. And what the score - this music just runs through your veins and gives you real goosebumps. I believe Disney will develop Star Wars universe and also bring another stories from old republic era. Cant wait it on Blu-ray!"
1035,7,Good but not Great. One last chance to get it right,"As with the Star Trek films JJ. Abrams has a few blind spots amidst all that storytelling genius. And it seems that Rian Johnson shares a couple of them. Result? Action heavy, depth light. They both operate on a formula that says, offer action first, then explain who the characters are later, or at best try to explain them in snappy one-liners. It doesn't always work. It's much better to care about the characters before putting them into danger. It makes the danger real and draws the viewer into the action. But when filmmakers just show you spectacular action before you know you know, connect with, or care about the characters, then it's just CGI spectacle, never real. And not impactful. The latter happens too often here "
1036,5,Made me reevaluate my opinions about TFA,"Man oh man. I really really disliked this movie.<br /><br />I was so annoyed I reevaluated my feelings about TFA. What i thought was a ""first clumsy step"" was actually the building blocks for a wrecking."
1037,,Exceeds all expectations,"The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars movie I've seen where I really didn't have an inkling of the plot as I entered the cinema. As a result, everything that unfolded during the epic running time was unexpected, breathtaking and brilliant. "
1038,8,"8.5 Stars for me, Loved the good parts, was so so on some other things","Overall a very good movie. Non spoiler review first: 1/3 of the comedy didn't sit well. The casino felt very not Star Wars and was off putting. The action was great, beyond great, spectacular! The the Luke, Rey, Kylo dynamics were incredible... very excellent writing and acting. The story was really good, I like where they are going with everything and how it is fresh material. "
1039,6,Another flawed but gripping film In the Star Wars saga,"""Star Wars- episode VIII: The last Jedi"" is directed by ""Rian Johnson""."
1040,8,Legends become tangible Human Beings !!!,"In my review of 'The Force Awakens', I wrote that the major theme of the film was the reaffirmation of the myths and the legends of Star Wars. The irony is that the sequel, 'The Last Jedi' stands on the opposite end of the thematic spectrum. This film is all about the subversion and the deconstruction of the myths, the legends and the force. If 'The Force Awakens' is 'Stagecoach' or Leone's Westerns, then 'The Last Jedi' is a revisionist Western like 'The Searchers' or 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller'. We get to see some beloved characters as tangible, flawed human beings instead of the flawless idea of them as legends. Luke Skywalker's arc and storyline in the film is absolutely brilliant. Johnson doubles down on underlining Luke's dilemmas, insecurities and fears. To me, Luke's descension from the status of the legendary Jedi Knight/Master to being a vulnerable human being made him all the more admirable. Johnson deconstructs the character of Luke, but never disrespects him. But as a non-hardcore Star Wars fanatic, I can clearly see how my opinions regarding Rian Johnson's choice with Luke's character might not be the same as the opinions of a die hard Star Wars fan. For me, this is the first time that a Star Wars film has completely committed to delving deep in the murkiness that lies between the broad strokes of the light and the dark. I loved the explanations given regarding the origins of Kylo Ren's decisions. The film shows how a small moment of weakness viewed from differing perspectives can lead to misunderstandings and subsequently potentially devastating eventualities. I loved everything that Johnson did to connect the three characters of Rey, Kylo and Luke together."
1041,6,"Controversial Redemption, and Evolution.",STAR WARS IX TLJ REVIEW: <br /><br />*WITH SPOILERS*
1042,10,The best Star Wars movie I have watched.,"This is the best Star Wars movie I have watched till date. This coming from a person who was never big on the Star Wars hype. Yep, this was awesome! Last Jedi is awesome to say the least."
1043,6,Too much action without meaning,The Skywalker saga deserves a better plot and/or a better storyline.
1044,3,The Last Jedi? We can Hope,"The films lack of focus from a narrative perspective is perhaps the most obvious and daunting problem posed by this mess of a film, but it is also aided by Rian Johnson's many failed attempts at humour and fan service that fall well short of the original trilogies energy. Dare I say even Attack of the Clones, possibly the most condemned Star Wars film to date, at least had structure and relevant character development. The Last Jedi however falls flat on its face time and time again throughout its unnecessarily padded runtime, with dozens of 'shocking' and 'dark' moments: quite obviously Johnson's nod toward a darker Star Wars film akin to Empire, which are so overused and rushed in setup that I myself was completely desensitised by any impending twist. <br /><br />From the off, issues with regard to story and editing were prevalent with each scene plagued by over-dramatisation and poor pacing. The very first scene featuring Paige Tico's untimely death is indicative of sequencing throughout the whole movie, with her character kicking that ladder for what felt like a million years before the remote finally fell for an unnecessarily dramatic catch. However Paige's death is just the beginning in terms of exaggerated melodrama, with 'THAT' Leia scene following not long after..."
1045,9,The Star Wars fandom is dead.,"I saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time when I was four years old. I barely remember it, only vague images of Yoda hobbling around in a fire-lit hut, talking with a funny voice. In the subsequent years, I discovered that Empire was a sequel, and saw A New Hope and Return of the Jedi as soon as I possibly could. "
1046,6,Hope? There is no hope with this path...,"This film is all set about a director/writer who made a Star Wars film unlike any Star Wars films... because.. It doesn't seem a Star Wars film without the known transitions between scenes, the fights, with no dialogues, very flat line.. <br /><br />Ryan Johnson made a movie without his personality like J.J.Abrams did (thank god he is the frontrunner for the last chapter)."
1047,2,Giving Battlefield Earth a run for it's money,"Finally caved and pulled this off the shelves at the library.<br /><br />I expected awfulness, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />Watch:<br /><br />Loose message about the evils of eating meat (from a character who likely could not support himself without it)<br /><br />Physics become further irrelevant in space (nice job stealing from Battlestar Galactica with the ship flip)<br /><br />Physics become suddenly important in space (fuel... almost as bad a McGuffin as a trade federation)<br /><br />More newly discovered force powers - ghosts aren't blue and fuzzy any more!<br /><br />Domestic violence - or, why it's ok for Leia to slap Poe, but not for Poe to slap Holdo<br /><br />Further gender disparity - why it's ok for Rose to sacrifice herself but not for Finn to sacrifice himself"
1048,,Worst Star Wars movie ever!,"Rian Johnson ruined the Star Wars for many true fans by making Luke a cowardy crep, who is thinking about ending his nephew's life while he is sleeping. Luke's character was way off and Johnson's idea was not a twist but a cheap trick to ruin him for what purpose exactly? He lost many audience for his future Star Wars projects."
1049,8,"Not the best Star Wars movie ever made, but better than Rogue One and TFA","There are a lot of negative reviews on this movie. And honestly I do not feel it's deserved. While yes, the movie is flawed, it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. <br /><br />The acting is great, the effects are great and when this movie is at it's best it's really up there with A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. However when it's bad it's as bad as the prequels."
1050,6,A fantastic movie in many ways,The extremely negative reviews here feels like they were written by the same person and they really dont contribute much. 
1051,9,"Not what I wanted, but still good","While I was disappointed with the direction things went in the Last Jedi, I still enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining and solidly made. Yes Johnson did make most of the important build up from the previous movie die to be filled with blatant political commentary, but I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie nevertheless."
1052,6,Grow The F up people. Quit rating this movie a 1or 0,"It's a good movie. I didn't like it that much the first time I saw it, but really liked it the second time."
1053,9,Never a dull moment!,"It took me a week after its premiere, but I still watched it. It does have its similarities with Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, but it's still enjoyable. I'll keep it spoiler-free and leave it at that. There's plenty to see and it's not as talkative as the prequels. This is my new number-one favorite Star Wars film under the Disney banner. Rogue One comes in second. It's a little different, but as Homer Simpson would say, ""It's still good! It's still good!"""
1054,6,Please Make them Shorter,"Maybe I'd have felt differently if I'd seen this in a less crowded theater where they didn't play 10 or so trailers before it, but this felt about five hours long even though I think it was two and a half. We were practically being held hostage. And yet, with it being so long, they deliberately withheld the answers to questions like Rey's parentage to manipulate us into seeing the next one! I fail to see how a story can be meaningful if it just keeps going without a definite, planned end. "
1055,1,Pathetic,"There was so much that I wanted from this movie and it's predessesor. After looking forward to a follow up for decades, this is the pathetic garbage they come up with. Start to finish, it's just pure disappointment. If by some miracle you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a huge favor and stay as far away from this filth as possible."
1056,8,We Are What They Grow Beyond. That is the True Burden of All Masters.,It's incredibly difficult to write a regular review for a film like this without spoiling anything. So I'm going to come right out and say that this will be a SPOILER heavy review. Last warning.
1057,6,A fireworks and explosions show,"It looks like Hollywood is no longer betting on anything unlikely and the big master Disney that now seems to run the industry of entertainment is turning conservative even more. Star Wars Episode VIII is the latest quintessence of this new order. Where there is just a small room getting thinner for risk. Along with all Marvel movies, sequels, prequels, spin-offs... a new trilogy (the third one) of the once rule breaker George Lucas universe was set to be produced. The formula works, a massive phenomenom with such a fandom behind would bring thousands to the movies. The nostalgia invades the room and creates new generations of followers. Episode VII, released on 2016, was such a shameless self-copy that I wonder if it is an unofficial remake. This time, we may be talking about a different kind of drama, the drama I call 'none'. Someone asked me about what this new movie was about, expecting a long and developed answer, and I could not give more than a five second response. The movie is, get ready, about the rebels escaping from the First Order (once known as 'The Empire'), that is it. Two hours of just the same with a different name, a plot so simple and so predictable that it even gets boring. The lighting and bombing space spectacle is guaranteed, that is for sure. Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher (rest in peace), were brought back to life from who knows where to play Luke and Leia, and looking at their interpretations, they should have remained as legends for the sake of Star Wars epic, but hey Disney, that would bring more people in, right? The old background drama feeling was far gone with Episode VII, but this one has spit on its grave with cheap jokes that turn The First Order into a bunch of clowns. Han Solo, we miss you so much. Overall, I have to be honest, I enjoyed the movie because I include myself in the fandom, but it is sad how Disney is shrinking the drama and turning Star Wars into a light and fireworks performance, starring the Rebels and the First Order."
1058,2,So bad it makes JJ Abrams look like a genius.,"I read a lot of ""Star Wars for a new generation"" reviews giving it a 10. That's code for ""A movie only a Millennial will love"". Yet again, Millennials ruin everything they touch. Yet again I return to Hulu to watch shows from the 80's and 90's. Nuff said."
1059,,An utter travesty. *minor spoilers*,"It comes to something when the best thing one can say about a Star Wars director is ""he 'almost' got Yoda right"". The ""iron joke"" was laugh out loud funny though, to be fair (although there's something very telling about that). I reckon I can edit it down to (maybe) an hours worth of a good movie. Just be grateful that Kennedy had the wisdom to beg JJ to direct the final episode."
1060,8,Subtly one of the best Star Wars films out there!!,"Now when this film was released there was great clamor by diehard Star Wars fans that this film was terrible and it was ruining the saga of live action films. Fans were saying that there was no way that Luke Skywalker (played well by Mark Hamill) would be uncooperative in his attitude towards fighting against the evil First Order and plot lines such as Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) almost being buddy-buddy/if not an item in the film were too far fetched. Concepts, concepts, concepts, but the more that you watch The Last Jedi the more that you see the genius of director Rian Johnson. This is the type of film that is like fine wine, it simply gets better with time. It's also the type of movie that you see something different in it each time you watch it, take for instance the last time I saw it I caught the subtle scene when Rey and Ren were communicating through the Force and their transmission ended, a wet drip appeared in Kylo's glove & was not a tear but rather a drop of rain from Rey's atmosphere. It's little things like that that make you want to see Johnson's masterpiece again and again not to mention THE BEST lightsaber fight in the live-action saga when Rey and Ren team up against the Red Guards. Good acting, good writing, good directing, an exceptional soundtrack, and just a plain old sense of fun make the Last Jedi a great way to spend a couple hours. 8 out of 10 stars!!"
1061,7,Could have been better,Story of how the two main characters find their way. Both choose the path that they think is right while there is a losing war waging between the resistance and the republic. There could have been a lot more action especially involving Luke since he should have been the highlight of this episode.
1062,10,"Original, Unexpected & Epic","I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and The Last Jedi left me speechless. I literally couldn't talk when it was over. My throat couldn't make a sound. The lump in it was too big. It's weird and hilarious and heartbreaking and more action packed than any other Star Wars movie. I lost track of how many times I wept while watching Rian Johnson's film. But I'm sure I also laughed hard just as many times, if not more. Nothing can prepare you for the emotional ride it takes you on. It's a truly epic journey that has enough plot twists for two movies. It's also a true example of auteur filmmaking, and it gives us some startlingly beautiful images that I still can't get out of my head."
1063,7,People are Overreacting Big Time,Star War: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is the 8th episode in the new Star Wars saga and has a lot of fans divided over weather Disney ruined it or admire it for going into bold new directions. But i am gonna talk more about that later and just get on to what i loved and didn't like about the movie. 
1064,10,"Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering...","Before I write down anything, let's be clear, this review contains MAJOR spoilers..."
1065,7,"It's Good, Hear Me Out","I thought The Last Jedi was a pretty good movie, I enjoyed it. It had a decent story, fantastic acting, plot twists, better lightsaber battles, some tense moments, and good humor. "
1066,3,"You may have heard critical reviews that this movie ""killed"" Star Wars...","It's a make-able argument. There are some clever camera shots, and I liked Leia's scenes especially, but the writing and editing is terrible, and the plot is nonsensical and downright stupid. Phantom menace might actually be a better-made movie, Jar-Jar notwithstanding. Seriously. Characters utter lines deeply anti-thetical to their whole personality in the service of ""new-ness"". Scenes are cut so roughly characters board and exit enemy ships with no explanation how. There are long sub-plot elements that go absolutely nowhere except into cgi hell. People have been way too easy on this trainwreck. Rogue One was what everyone was hoping Last Jedi would be. Not hopeful about Rian Johnson's Star Wars...worse than Lucas so far. Seriously."
1067,9,Its a STAR WARS MOVIE!!!,"OK, I am NOT a Star Wars junkie and MOST of the time, I cannot follow the PLOT to this movie. Honestly, I cannot keep track of WHICH movie is REALLY first, number 3, or 7 or 5 or 2."
1068,6,"Certainly not the worst movie of all time, but it is greatly hurt by the legacy of the franchise.","Star Wars The Last Jedi has amazing visuals, a forboding score, great preformances and attempts to take the franchise to new places, unfortunetly the writing is abysmal and the story drags far too long to allow the narrative to hold interest."
1069,3,Don't believe critics who got invited to premiere,"Ugh , was not impressed with this movie. I wasn't bored, but this seemed like a live action version of the rebels Cartoon. Thought Daisy Ridley had some bad line delivery in this , esp in the first 3rd. Some of the first order military thought they were in a Christmas Pantomime. Too much juvenile humor. Too much schmaltz. Too many Fake out deaths . The scene when Phasma is just about to execute Finn then there is that explosion and what luck all the first Order troops around them are dead but somehow Phasma has teleported about 50 feet away with her posse right behind her and not shooting. Also whats with the Praetorian guards striking action poses when they are so far away from any threat? I did like Kylo and Luke though"
1070,,Whiny fans are hating on this lovely film,Short review to simply raise awareness of the crazy die-hard fans hating on this incredible movie... 
1071,8,Something is off,"I'm completely new to the starwars movies. I've avoided them my whole life, but with Disney + I was able to watch all of them and then this one on Netflix. The bad reviews I see on here must be one of two things. Either targeted bad reviewing by bots and trolls or dedicated older fans who dont like anything new.<br /><br />Being a new fan I had no loyalty to any of the movies and have not been influenced by others opinions on them.<br /><br />That being said this is a very good movie. I was only able to get through the prequel trilogy because I'd seen these first and I wanted to understand the history and plot points better. If I'd have started with episode 1 I wouldn't be a newly converted fan. Those films, especially the first two are horrifically bad. Reviews starting that this is the worst out of the current 8 must not have watched those 3."
1072,7,A worthy addition to the Star Wars universe,"Action-packed, funny, and moves the characters forward. Better than any of the prequels for sure, and as good or better than any of the others."
1073,8,Rating: B+,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)"
1074,7,It's Star Wars...,"I didn't go in expecting anything spectacular but found the movie to be pretty good. Were there issues with the plot and some useless characters and such, yes, but the same could be said about all Star Wars movies. All in all it was entertaining and Star Warsy so I can't complain all that much. Don't read too far into this flick and enjoy the ride. It's fun."
1075,8,Blown away by this journey...,"I got to admit that this film surprised me in so many ways. Granted I'm more favourable to the whole cannon than many, but my expectations weren't as high after the Force Awakens which I didn't warm too. However I really got into this and loved it. "
1076,6,"Not the worst film in the saga, but an unfortunate misstep.","If I was going to describe the film using broad strokes for readers wary of spoilers, I would say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is thematically unsure of itself, ambitiously comedic, and in terms of a plot? You might find yourself checking your watch through some of the drag subplots that the movie will try to convince you carry some sort of importance. "
1077,1,This is not Star Wars,"Star Wars ended with Episode VI. We need no sequels. But since Disney decided to make more, everything went downhill. This movie is all about the destruction of everything we knew and love about Star Wars."
1078,10,Different but not worse..,Ok so many fans among them friends of mine hated..but I think that people should keep an open mind..
1079,7,I Feel Conflicted,I just saw the film so I may not be remembering some things correctly
1080,1,A movie for stupid people to pretend they're smart,"The original Star Wars trilogy was awesome. I grew up on it, fell in love with the characters, and dreamed of more for years to come until that fateful day in 1999 when The Phantom Menace came out..."
1081,,THE LAST STAR WARS,"Just seen ""The last Jedi"" it should have been called the THE LAST STAR WARS EVER... I'm a fan of all the previous franchise movies and this made me question if the writer or the director the ever watched the prequels? Sadly this was a epic disappointment."
1082,8,Putting my hat in the race.,"I think your enjoyment of Star Wars: The Last Jedi will largely come down to your willingness to put your trust in writer-director Rian Johnson. This is a film that definitely uses the Star Wars brand to tell a new story, and as such, it tests the characters we love unforgivably. Some story decisions, like where certain characters end up, will spark endless discussion on whether they actually work or not, while others like Rey's parentage are handled perfectly. In both style and storytelling and even editing, Rian Johnson clearly has not been afraid of putting his own creative fingerprints on the saga loud and proud, even if it will rub certain fans the wrong way."
1083,7,It was good :),"Okay, honestly, I think some of the reviews before hand that are around 1 - 2 stars are a little over dramatic, but I found The Last Jedi quite good, this is where there's a tide between all of us reviewers, you're going to get some good ones and some bad ones. <br /><br />It was a good watch, and the acting isn't weak, if you wanna see weak acting, watch A Wrinkle In Time. <br /><br />I feel in love with Star Wars when The Force Awakens came out, before I was not interested, so it's doing pretty well if it's able to capture my attention after so many years."
1084,9,"Say whatever you say, this is a good Star Wars","Many will like it, many will hate it, but in my book, Disney did not ruin Star Wars."
1085,7,Thesis or most Epic Review either way You are in deep if you're reading this,"I have to say I'm surprised. I rather liked the Last Jedi. Maybe even 7.5 stars. After reading the reviews, and my view that the Force Awakens was a total mess, I was convinced this would be awful."
1086,8,"Not the best Star Wars movie, but it´s a good one.","Star Wars: Episode VIII- The last jedi, is a good movie. Is not the best of all, but is good, and there are some things that are interesting. Even that the movie is 152 minutes long, it doesn't´t feel that long. I like Episode VII more than this, but this movie feels a little more epic. Rain Johnson is a good director, not only let us see the characters developed in the way they do, but also visually, is stunning. The performances are amazing, specially from Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill, not saying that the other actors are not good, because everyone is great, but Daisy and Mark gave the best performances of their careers in this movie. <br /><br />The issues of this movie, at least to me, is that the movie takes some decisions that they were not good for the movie (like the direction of a character, and the fact that the movie could be 20 minutes short) I would love to explore Laura Dern character a little bit more. Also, the movie could use some more dark moments. <br /><br />Leaving that behind, the movie was entertaining and has some epic moments, that in the future, Star Wars fans will look up to."
1087,6,From saga to franchise,"Star Wars used to be an epic saga built up from an almost Jungian archetypical level. After all, Lucas was heavily influenced by ancient mythology, by Joseph Campbell's classic on mythological archetypes and other spiritual influences. A lot can be said about the second trilogy, but even those still retained some of that magic, albeit hidden behind all the CGI and the end-of-the-republic politics.<br /><br />Not anymore with the new films, or almost not anymore. Since Lucas sold SW to -I thought- Disney, it's become a franchise. Other people -no doubt not as heavily immersed in ancient mythology as was Lucas- now write and direct the saga.<br /><br />This becomes very apparent with the latest films, Rogue One, The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi. <br /><br />It's not that it's bad, it's just not how Star Wars used to be. There is almost no spiritual and archetypical element anymore, or what is left has been reduced to -admittedly often great- grandstanding about the 'power' of the Force and of lightsabers. But beneath that, it's now become a series endlessly rehearsing staple SW ingredients but then without the deeper spirituality as its genuine base. <br /><br />Without this, SW is little more than action packed (American) Science Fiction: it's a profane money-maker using all the old elements without truly feeling through the, so of course the old sacred vibe is gone.<br /><br />A great pity.<br /><br />No complaints about Adam Driver's performance though. What a great pleasure to see him embodying Darth Vader's grandson."
1088,1,The Last Jedi tramples all over Star Wars and offers nothing to moviegoers,"I'm genuinely so angry, frustrated, furious, disappointed, upset, confused and gutted. "
1089,8,A good movie surrounded by too much hate,"When the last breath of the rebellion faces annihilation, young Ray goes out, seeking help and guidance from the one and only Luke Skywalker, who seems to have isolated himself for an unknown reason. Through patience and persistence, she must find a way to convince him to help, one way or another, as the little that remains of the rebellion are in a desperate need of a saviour. We follow closely the evolution of her character as well as the fabulous battles between the dark side's enormous battleships and the rebellion's tiny cruisers."
1090,7,Do not get fooled by these hate-reviews,The Last Jedi is special. It is an entertaining movie which gives more well-needed deepness to all major characters ahead of IX.
1091,4,What a load of feminist crap. Horrible casting. Horrible writing. Horrible plot.,"Dumbest version of the series to date. Hollywood is a one-trick pony. Hollywood feels the need to make 18 year old yuppies heroes beyond their years. You see the same one-trick-pony in Maze Runner, Divergent, Hunger Games, etc. Basically, 18 year olds with next to zero life experience saving worlds and defeating entire well trained well supplied armies."
1092,,Wow so Disney bought Star Wars to be Mickey's litter box!,"Wow out of 15 of us that came back from seeing the last Jedi only 1 thought it was just ok. The rest of us were disappointed beyond belief. And what's more is that my expectations weren't high because I didn't really care for the force Awakens, but I thought maybe with the director of looper at the helm, the film might be ok. How wrong I was. I no long have it in me to sit through another Star Wars film. Some of my friends were in tears and not in a good way, their emotions expressed disappointment, disgust, anger, outrage. No matter what any critic says there was no originality in this. The force Awakens ripped off the original Star Wars, the last Jedi ripped of scenes from both the empire strikes back and return of the Jedi. I simply cannot in good conscience recommend this atrocity to Star Wars."
1093,8,"Forget the haters - The Last Jedi is big, bold & exciting with brilliant characters, shocking story developments and beautiful action scenes. Star Wars at its finest",TL;DR<br /><br />
1094,6,"Partially a disappointing plot, but this is quelled by the many, many different things that happen in this movie.","After the large disappointment The Force Awakens was, I was expecting more of the same rubbish from Disney, but I'm glad this isn't the case in this movie. "
1095,10,Nothing beats Star Wars,Another amazing episode in the greatest and most magical saga on the big screen!
1096,6,Spoiler - lightspeed physics flaw,"A major plot twist is turning around and throwing the ship at light speed to the enemy, and it destroys pretty much everything. This should have not be used."
1097,8,You will fight inner battle yourself while watching the movie,"Picking up from the last one we are immediately thrown into battle and fight between Resistance and First Order. It is spectacular, massive and powerful to watch each scene and how fighting between 'good and evil' goes but in the end if you appreciate previous movies you will feel betrayed and probably get stunned by details but not in a good way. Return of our beloved Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) gives us a new way of confrontation which passes and gets you hyped enough to bite bait and focus on movie. On the other side there are characters that will make you wonder like Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) can get you real excited until further development or underdevelopment of characters goes through picture. Skywalker's contribution to story is pretty strong and mostly it feels constantly dragged toward his character. Discoveries throughout movie will keep it going and pull your focus to it with some stunningly scenes and landscapes because without any doubt it's one good looking movie. Now to get real with everybody there is so much need to tell you that movie gives some of the pretty laughable, ridiculous and stupid moments that if you really like movies you won't forgive. Rian Johnson, the director, man who also directed and wrote Looper which was fantastic, now gives every fanboy out there a material inside movie that will get them to the skies and beyond. Screenplay and directing done by Rian is fabulous without any doubt, it has some of the greatest fight scenes which look beautiful on big screen and you will definitely remember them. There is only one major criticism about characters is that Snoke got too little time and was so left behind and considering powerful man standing in his seat it could've been powerful performance. Overall experience of Star Wars: The Last Jedi without giving any spoilers that is very tough in such a movie is that it was well written and directed by Rian, followed by great performances but sometimes it felt that Johnson focused too much on fans of saga rather then to give us a more powerful story that he is capable of providing. 3/4 By the way Porgs are absolutely amazing."
1098,6,"It's actually not bad, so don't listen to the IMDb reviews...","I felt terribly disappointed when I looked on IMDb and saw such bad reviews on this movie. Nonetheless I gave it a go and it became apparently clear that the reviews are just many disappointed fans who were overhyped for the movie. Ok it's not my favourite Star Wars movie, it may even be my least favourite, but that's not to say that it's bad, I mean it's not 1/10 stars bad, I'd merely rank it as my least favourite because I love the rest of the saga so much. You see the thing is I understand that there may never be a Star Wars sequel that'll be better than the classics, but there are people on the other hand who will rank it 1/10 just because it didn't blow them away... Honestly it's quite ridiculous. Sure I much more enjoyed The Force Awakens, and it is a shame that this installment wasn't as good, but there's still a lot going on in this movie to enjoy and it's definitely worth watching if you really love Star Wars."
1099,1,What Is This,"Like ep 7 the Force Awakens seemed to ignore the 6 films before it and re-write Star Wars ep4, The Last Jedi ignores the events that happened in The Force Awakens (for the most part). Rian Johnson/Kathleen Kennedy continued to treat Luke like a joke and Rey like a messiah who can do anything but decided to ignore story elements started in ep7 the Force Awakens. Story such as who the Knights of Ren were, Snoke, and what happened to Rey. Instead, Snoke is dispatched and made a fool, Rey is a nobody, and half of the film is about finding fuel."
1100,8,I understand people's hate,TBH I loved this movie and Force Awakens!! The only Problems I've from this movie is that Stupid characters of Finn and that Asian girl. I don't know why but I find them very forced.
1101,7,Star Wars: The Last Contradiction?,"Laser cannons flash as ""X"" wing and Tie fighters do their best to dodge in between the deadly streaks of light in a desperate attempt to survive and win the day for their respective armies. Heroes loom larger than life, at times unrealistically so, as sarcastic quips rip through the explosions overshadowing the deadly struggles they're involved in. Impossible situations are serendipitously overcome time and time again as heroes manage to narrowly escape the clutches of their relentless enemies. Laughter, and clenched tears, are skillfully wrung from the audience as careful dialogue and likeable characters (despite their shortcomings) are centered on the silver screen. Such is the mixed bag of nuts that is Star Wars: The last Jedi, a movie that doesn't live up to the lofty expectations nor is it the abysmal failure that some have mistakenly accused it of."
1102,2,The Last Straw,"Rian Johnson trolls Star Wars fans. And delivers a shockingly bad movie to boot. To be fair it does have one or two interesting moments, but most of it is just terrible."
1103,,Hollywood is corrupt. Wake up guys.,It's pretty obvious that the critic reviews are paid off. And the majority of the people that actually genuinely like this film are in denial about how bad it really is. This film is an insult to my generation and to the people that came before me who enjoyed the lure and fantasy of this universe. It betrays every Foundation established by previous films even the prequels! All in favor of being a politically correct corporate cash grab that mindless people eat up. Plain and simple this film is a mockery of all the ones that came before it and should not be praised. I'm a millennial and I am personally ashamed that my generation is so brainwashed by the media they think this is actually good for any reason.
1104,8,Good movie nice new critters,"I actually liked the movie and disagree with most of the critics. The franchise has to move on. We cannot stay indefinitely with the same characters almost 40 years older. It'd be ridiculous. I like the new characters and I like how they are stiring towards a new generation, a very diverse one as a matter of fact. If Star Wars was about hope this movie gives a lot of it. I'm only sorry Carrie Fisher died because they her character development as General Organa was really good and I wish we could have seen more of her. I like all the new creatures even the sea cows Luke milks on the island. About the plot yes, ok it isn't the most linear and there are few things that could have been handled better like Snoke (who the hell is he and how did he come to power after Palpatine was killed? But then again we didn't know anything about Palpatine either in the first trilogy and I think disnay is in for the long run so they will make movies also about Snoke's origins."
1105,7,"If not for the plot holes, this would have been pretty good",The Bad:
1106,8,"Solid Star Wars entry, even if a bit spread out","This longish Star Wars chapter featuring the Resistance's desperate fight for survival against the pursuing First Order holds up well enough on a second viewing. It has much to recommend it, especially since it makes better use of Oscar Isaac than ""The Force Awakens"" did and offers a final moving turn by Carrie Fischer. Her presence in this film is greatly appreciated and she offers some of the best moments."
1107,7,Star Wars with some disappointment,"I grew up with Star Wars. I love the originals, I enjoyed the prequels. And I enjoy anything that has something to do with SW. But somehow The Last Jedi felt not SW, at least in some aspects. And I did not like the idea of changing the concept of The Force. I hope that the last episode will do everything right..."
1108,9,A great movie. Better the rogue one.,This is a great movie. Star wars is better. The Empire strikes back is better. The return of the Jedi is also better. The Phantom menace is also better. Attack the clones is also better. Revenge of the sith is also better. Star wars clone wars the movie is also better. The force awakens is also better. Still this movie has great acting. It also has great story line. I also has great special effects. 7.5 is a good ratting. But this is such a great film that 7.5 is underrating it. This is a 9 out of 10. This is better the Rouge One. See all the Star wars movies. They are all good movie movies. Any one who like science fiction stories will like this move. There is some scary space monsters in this movie. See this movie. It is a great movie..
1109,7,The problem with sites like IMDB,"Honestly, why anyone would come to a site like IMDB for reviews anymore is utterly beyond my understanding. A significant percentage of people literally have no clue how to properly critique something like a film. Those people just throw out 1's and 10's like they were no big deal. Anyone who thinks any of the Star Wars film made to date a truly a 1 have never seen a film by Asylum or similar movie companies. Those are film that are truly deserving of a score as low as a 1. Haters and fanboys, and many in between, have utterly ruined online ratings for movies, games, music, etc. "
1110,1,Social Justice Wars Episode II: The Phallic Menace,"It is a period of diversity casting. Social engineers, striking from Disney headquarters, have scored their first major victory against movie-going consumers by suckering millions of dollars out of unsuspecting loyalists. White male characters have been killed off, marginalized, or isolated to villain roles ""just because"". Darth Kennedy's sinister agents have fanned out across the globe in an attempt to destroy any screenplay that could possibly save the franchise from certain destruction. Secretly, she waits to unleash her ultimate weapon--a soundtrack by Enya and Celine Dion--for Episode X as audiences flee."
1111,10,One of the best Star Wars films,"The Force Awakens got criticised for too closely resembling the original Star Wars, but that's because those critics were looking out for things they recognised. TFA used the broad iconic pieces of Star Wars as scaffolding, within which it told a new and different story: an insecure adolescent bad wannabe dude, a stormtrooper who switches sides, an orphan from nowhere who discovers she has huge power. None of these things have been seen in a SW movie. All the character stuff was different."
1112,7,A Non-Dramatic Review of Star Wars 8,"The other reviews on this page really do seem dramatic, with such low ratings and claims like ""Disney ruined my childhood"" and whatnot. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but it seems many reviewers are focusing only on the bad of the movie. So in this brief review, I will discuss in detail a few elements I liked and some that I didn't.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />The direction in this film is wonderful. Ryan Johnson does absolutely everything that he can to make the script come to life, and I feel that he really utilizes his resources well. Every shot feels important and vibrant. While the rest of the Star Wars movies are primarily story based with generic direction, this was the first in the series that had a beautiful cinematic aspect to it. Colorful images and beautiful landscapes kept my eyes entertained and took me back to the wonder that I first experienced when watching Star Wars in my childhood.<br /><br />Rey is wonderful in this film. Daisy Ridley is the most beautiful woman on the planet, I'm convinced, and MAN can she act! In this installment, we see a lot more of her struggle with the dark side of the force and her character flaw is put into full light; she is naive. Ridley pulls off this character, who is barely learning that everything she thought she knew needs to be questioned, and it's absolutely enthralling to watch. For those who felt she was a ""Mary-Sue"" after TFA, Disney heard your criticisms. There were points where it genuinely felt like she would give in to the temptation to join the dark side, and you could really feel the confusion along with her. The narrative of Rey is by far the best thing about this film.<br /><br />Aside from that, as always, the saga continues to handle death perfectly. Each death of major characters throughout the series has been hard hitting, and the deaths of Luke Skywalker and Supreme Leader Snoke absolutely lived up to the standard. Very intense and emotional deaths, respectively.<br /><br />There are some weird things in this installment, and some of those things really work. For instance, the use of flashbacks is not cheesy or gimmicky at all, which is what I expected when I heard this device would be used. Rather, they are packed with intensity, and it's actually a great storytelling device that's used properly here.<br /><br />Ultimately, we see characters rise into who they really are. Luke finishes his life a good guy, like he's always been (though he lost himself). Rey ultimately chooses the light side, showing her true colors. Kylo Ren shapes into the full evil that he is, proving that he cannot be turned anymore. Finn overcomes his cowardice. And so on. There is very little wrong with the character development or their portrayals."
1113,2,The Last Jedi---We can only hope!!!,I think most of the other reviewers have already covered how bad this movie was. What is amazing is that it has something like a 7.3 rating while most of the reviews seem to be closer to 1 or 2 stars. 
1114,,"Good but not great, loses the Star Wars magic along the way","The Resistance prepares to do battle with the First Order. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker is unsettled by the strength of Rey's powers and connection to Kylo Ren."
1115,9,BOYEGA TO THE RESCUE!,"Directed by Rian Johnson, ""The Last Jedi"" is the eighth installment in the Star Wars franchise and follows the events of ""The Force Awakens."" The film stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Mark Hamill, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac, among others."
1116,7,"This is not going to go, the way you think","First of all, not adhering to where you wanted Star Wars to go does not make this a bad movie. I actually think it's one of the most well thought out Star Wars movies, but with a few flaws."
1117,10,A masterpiece from a galaxy far far away!,"First, I wonder why all the haters' user reviews are on the top of the others?...Disturbing this is...and unfortunate! :-P ...Probably, they don't have anything else to do, than stay online and spread their unreasonable hate...Ugh...No matter what, the Metacritic is the highest of all Star Wars!! Woohoo!!! Anyways, I found the movie all in all AMAZING beyond any imagination. It surprised me positively from the first moment and I loved the fact that it was a much different Star Wars movie. More modern, more subversive with a wider aspect of all things. A Star Wars movie for the next generations. I myself am a Star Wars fan since I was 12-13 years old and now in my 40s I didn't mind the change. I welcomed it with great applause and interest. I was impressed particularly of the Force capabilities that were shown and weren't mentioned or appeared before in the Star Wars Saga. I understand that some people found that annoying, but I found it somewhat cathartic...Like all this time we were able to experience only a tiny sample of the Force, forcing us to a certain point of view of the Force....But now, yes! That's it! That's how ""maxi big the Force"" is!!! Thank you, Rian!! As Qui-Gonn and Yoda once said about the Force, ""life creates it, makes it grow...its energy surrounds us and bind us..."" Just because we didn't see so far any other Force capabilities, doesn't mean these are false or crazy. This film showed us something new, something fresh and also something funny -as all the Star Wars movies have a great deal of humorous scenes, this one also had it in a ""healthy"" amount -only funnier! Something that comes to mind regarding the negative reactions, are the words of Palpatine to Anakin in Episode III, that we should embrace the whole aspect of the Force, not only the dogmatic, narrow view of one part of it....Well, ok, that sounded a little bit dark-sided, but you got my point hopefully!... We have to keep our minds open and welcome the positive change and continuity of the Star Wars universe.<br /><br />After I went out of the cinema, I wanted to go home and play with my little star wars figurines...Yes, Rian, goal accomplished!!....And Rylo FTW! :-D"
1118,6,Not the Star Wars movie I expected :'(,"Rian Johnson is an incredible director BUT I just didn't felt like he understood certain characters just like ""Luke Skywalker"" who began as the most hopeful characters in the saga and evolved to become the most coward. The film is entertaining but some scenes just felt out of place, and some characters with a lot of potential are just wasted, such as Snoke, Captain Phasma DJ, Maz Kanata, Admiral Ackbar, Luke Skywalker and even Kylo Ren, who acts like a bipolar nine year old kid. I did enjoyed some fight scenes and the filmography. And I admit the battle of Crait is quite memorable. At the end, the movie just seems weird."
1119,8,"Like it more now, didn't like it the first time I saw it","When I left theater the first time, I was disappointed; didn't like what I had seen. Went again, enjoyed it more, and now have watched it several times. I guess I was not used some of the campy comedy, and directors style. It grew on me."
1120,7,"Wrong title, horrible ending, over all: meh","First of all I felt the movie dragged in places, but that's not uncommon. The movie should have been named ""RISE IF THE JEDI""."
1121,3,Disney Has Given Us Twilight Star Wars - Expect Shiny Jedi Vampires Soon,Disney Has Given Us Twilight Star Wars - Expect Shiny Jedi Vampires Soon. 
1122,9,"Padawan,this movie creates passion which leads to the dark side!","This movie is everything I want it to be. It has courage and takes a lot of new ways never explored in the Universe. I really needed a fresh new look into the Universe and the characters.<br /><br />Within the logic rules of the fonctionment of the Universe, Rian Johnson makes a show off of his writing and direction skills.<br /><br />I absolutely love the direction taken with Luke and the different characters who support him. Again Johnson doesn't only take the force to a new level but makes the arc of Luke even more interesting as it already was. Great interpretation and writing of Luke's character showing a deep knowledge of the material.<br /><br />Really well paced but at times the pace slows down in bad way on a little adventure of the new character Rose but afterwards comes the best part of the movie.<br /><br />Good and evil has reached a new dimension in Star wars. Watch the movie and celebrate the risk taken and let your mind go to a galaxy far far away..."
1123,7,"Erm, what was that?","Ok, I'll start by saying that as a life long Star Wars fan - that could have been worse."
1124,1,Just bad.,The Force Awakens was bad. I didn't think that they could make a worse movie than that. But The Last Jedi was worse. It is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. And that includes the horrible prequels.
1125,,A Lot of Trolls,"What is IMBD going to do about the Russian Troll Bots that try to ruin the honest reviews of movies and other stuff on IMBD? It makes it hard to take these reviews seriously and it ruins the shows for those who do take the ratings seriously and use them to decide if they are actually going to watch something. This is not right and IMBD needs to act on it, please.<br /><br /> I loved all of the new Star Wars Movies, no they are not perfect but very entertaining including this one, with some really great characters."
1126,10,One Review to rule them all,"I am old SW fan. I am 48. Had two sons, 11 and 12. I was woried sick, after so much bad reviews here. And then, few of my old friends have watched the movie (all of them huge SW fans). Thay say it is excelent, one of the best in saga. Then, I go to see it with my sons. And, god, I was stuned. This is acctualy one of the best SW movies of all time. Its has all, the end of old storyline, the begfining of new one. Excelent visuals. Excelent story. And now comment for those with bad reviews: Plot holes? A few, but this is not a thriller. It is a parody? No, had only few laughs, as all SW movies had. Luke choices? All good for grumpu old Jedi, who lost almost everything during his bitter life. It is time to Luke end. Hopfully, this is not the end, the war just started and he is not a last Jedi. First time since the 80s I was thrilled after waching SW movie. And most important, my sons also. This is a first movie, that my sons are very pleased with. And that is important thing. This is SW for next generation. I, old fan also like it. For those who dont, I must say...dont watch enymore SW movies...it is not for you, you are too old, to serious, you are grumpy old SW fans, bitter as Luke in the movie. I am glad that Johnsom get 3 more movies to make. Cant wait."
1127,6,"A decent film, but a bad Star Wars film",When it comes to rating films I find most people are disingenuous with their rating. 9/10 or 10/10 should be reserved for the very best films of the year or the very best films of a generation with almost no flaws. 1/10 or 2/10 should be reserved for films that are essentially irredeemable.
1128,10,"The More I Watch it, the More I like it","The Last Jedi was like any Star Wars Story a wonderful experience. Star Wars is and always has been a Fairy Tale in a Far Far Away Galaxy. Not everybody enjoys Star Wars and maybe it shouldn't be this way. If one sees it and enjoys it, welcome to the World of Star Wars. <br /><br />The Last Jedi in my Opinion was the Movie I didn't expect but kinda wanted. <br /><br />You are entitled to your Opinion but please don't Hate. <br /><br />Hate leads to Suffering as Yoda would say."
1129,7,Don't Let The Naysayers Fool You - The Last Jedi Isn't Horrible.,"The ONLY Star Wars movie that is pretty much above or beyond criticism is The Empire Strikes Back. Other than that, they are ALL flawed in one way or another. The original Star Wars being the least flawed (as in almost not at all, but still a little flawed with some stiff, stilted dialogue and a really whiny, annoying lead character)."
1130,10,Let the Past Die...,"I actually really loved Last Jedi and was prepared not to based on what everyone was saying. People complain about Luke living in exile -- So did Yoda. So did Obi-Wan. The circle from idealistic kid to disillusioned adult made perfect sense. There are a few digressions that maybe don't need to exist in the plot, but that's true of most Star Wars movies. I do find the newer films are a little quippier than the old ones, but it doesn't bother me."
1131,6,The disappointment of the year,"Two stars for visual effects only. The story is garbage. Plot holes, character actions that make no sense, little or no backstory revealed, some of the most outrageously stupid things I've ever seen even for sci-fi, no explanations given for where or how some of the characters came to be in the story. Horrible writing, terrible movie. Disney should remove the film from theaters immediately, reshoot it entirely with a better written story, apologize for this giant piece of crap and give free tickets to new version for anyone that paid to see this one. DO NOT GO TO THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE A TRUE STAR WARS FAN. You will be disappointed. You have been warned!"
1132,4,Males need not apply,"Disney and Rian Johnson went too far in destroying every single male lead in Star Wars. The male villain is an emo who nearly cries in every scene. The hotshot idiot causes tens of thousands, possibly millions of of deaths and gets a pat on the back. The former Stormtrooper is a coward with almost no redeeming qualities. Luke becomes a green milk squeezing curmudgeon who hates the world. The only true rogue, Han, was killed two movies back. The evil villain, Snoke, gets zero character development."
1133,8,"Most heart, character development, & thought provoking SW film since Empire","The more I watch Last Jedi, the more I'm convinced Rian Johnson is a genius"
1134,7,What was all the fuss about?,"When I was in the cinema getting ready to see this movie, I was worried because I've never seen a movie get so much negative backlash of a movie in a while so I was worried but I was genuinely satisfied with it. While it doesn't have problems, it's mostly a good Star Wars movie that is mostly good rather than the polar opposite. To start off with the goods, shall we? The score is incredible which is the standard for these movies but it's still brilliant which is definitely applied to 'The Battle Of Crait' which as IHE said juggles around many themes which I highly appreciate. The cgi is also fantastic which again, may be the standard for these types of movies but it's great so who cares, man? The acting is superb with Mark Hamill's triumphant return to the role of Luke Skywalker which is one of the best things about this movie, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have totally outdone themselves this time by doing even better than there superb performances in The Force Awakens and Kylo Ren being played masterfully by Adam Driver one of my personal favourite actors at the moment who plays probably the most interesting thing in the franchise at the moment. Another thing I love is the way the film separates our heroes and villains by putting them in separate situations which lets you understand where each character is getting at and what they want. The action, while being massively helped by the use of cgi, is very exciting and gripping which is yet again, the norm for these but they are still very good. The cinematography is also fantastic as always and the way the two big plot points merge together at the end in the big battle of Crait is very admirable. Lastly and probably most importantly, I appreciate how Rian Johnson slightly changes the norm of these movies by changing usual plans of past heroes and putting them in that situation and it is usually executed vey well. However, all of this doesn't mean that I think this movie is a ten out of ten masterpiece as there are problems which I am going to now point out. The humour is decent at best and while it does have its moments, it mostly didn't really work for me. The character of Rose is a very polarising character which I can definitely get behind as she wasn't necessarily bad but certainly not good either as I never once thought 'Oh yeah, she's the new gold standard for a Star Wars character!' because she kind of just appears quite early on and we never get a chance to sympathise with her. While those two problems stick out to me a lot, I can't help but admit that I really am a fan of this movie and while it's not anything that special as while Johnson could of gone further with the innovation, he is definitely on the right track. It's a shame that it's not looking like he isn't going to direct the next one, hopefully he's given more chances at massive budget movies because he really is a talented director who deserves even more time to create movies."
1135,4,Star Wars: The Last Movie,I am amazed at how many reviews bashes this movie and the comments I read with nothing but disdain. I had the same reaction and I even defended the prequels somewhat. I didn't care too much for Episode 2 mainly because of how boring Anakin and Padme was.
1136,,1/10 because The Farce Awakens by Jar Jar Arams is 0/10,"Some random fat chicks running around for no apparent reason and doing magical things for no apparent reason in a far away galaxy that really looks like earth with desert and forest and mary sue humans. Darn Hollywood, at least put a pretty chick in your films. Snoring here with this film!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1137,10,"Ranks Up There With 4, 5, and 6.","No, it wasn't perfect, but I have to give it ten stars. At this point, I think it's impossible to make a Star Wars movie that doesn't have a few flaws. When I saw the initial corny exchange between Poe and the red-haired general, my expectations tanked. But then so much of the movie was good, the corny parts were few enough, that I really, really enjoyed it and want to see it again. In fact, I think it stacks up with the original trilogy, and that's the most important part. Plus, hey, no spending one third of the movie with the Ewoks, am I right?"
1138,7,"Extremely unhealthy for the overall Star Wars narrative, but not deserving of the hate it gets.","This review will get nothing but hate because I'm giving even a little bit of intermittent praise to a movie people love to bash. Yeah, well, get over it. Ever consider that you might not be taking an objective look at it?"
1139,9,One of the Best Star Wars Films - EVER.,The hate this movie gets for not being like Star Wars or doing disappointing things with its leads is misguided desire for depthless action. The criticism that this isn't a Star Wars movie is a willing denial of what Star Wars has embodied for the past 40 years.
1140,6,Hopes for a remake,"The entire franchise is due for a remake. The 70s and 80s appraoch is no longer appealing. The sci fi level is becoming boring, between homless like rebel costumes, the WWII fighters , the scouts like boys and girls fighting, the fashionable red carpet rebel generals, the insect like war machines (AT AT etc), the so cool clumsy stormtroopers with basically good for nothing war outfits , the mama's boy and boys...All in all a remake to satisfy mature sci fi thinking and expectation is way overdue. Think of the Man of Steel for example and the complete reshape it did to the superman character. As a huge fan i can only hope of a remake that would modernise and take to the next level the once great 4 decades old creation."
1141,9,An Outstanding Passing of the Torch,"It's that time of year again! Since Disney Studios has made it its corporate mission to release Star Wars films every winter from now until the end of time, it's becoming apparent that the ubiquity of the Star Wars franchise is making it impossible not to get caught up in the hype. The very moment John Williams's bombastic Star Wars theme sounded its trumpets to the expected opening crawl, I - like most everyone else I'd imagine - had a Pavlovian reaction ginned by anticipation and pure joy. I'm not sure how long this euphoria will last. The force of Force Awakens (2015) just barely lasted through the 2016 New Years...but for now I'm just going to have to say, ""Squeeeeeeee!!!"""
1142,7,Star Wars: The Hard Reset,"Where to start with The Last Jedi? Probably by stating the obvious for anybody who has seen or will see the movie: it will be the most divisive movie in the series. Even more so than the prequels or The Force Awakens. It might be the, sometimes almost slapstick level of, humor for some and for others how the Force itself is cranked up to insane levels. Maybe even the fact that, looking at the story objectively, The Last Jedi is quite straight forward and empty. <br /><br />And yet somehow it ended up being a great movie to me."
1143,4,How come????,"IMDB has 7.2 rating on the movie, but most of the people's rates are I have seen are under 5???<br /><br />The color palette is impresive but the narrative is confusing, the actors are not convincing and there are sooo many things that makes you think this is a cheap remake. Most Star Wars folklore is gone, Director/writer was not a real fan. They killed Han Solo and now Luke... Who is left?<br /><br />I am not eager to see next movie with those directors"
1144,8,An end to the Jedi? Why can't we get rid of the fanboys...??,"I like the whole Star Wars thing, i like it a lot. Seen all of the movies, bought them all on various formats from VHS, LD and onwards. Yes, I really do like Star Wars. Am I a fanboy? Hell no. And that's a good thing. I'm not locked in to all of this crazy mythology that appears to have been translated verbatim from some deity and then brought down on stone tablets by Moses for us all to devour. There are no 'rules' here, nothing we can't change and have a bit of fun with. We can do whatever we want with this universe, it doesn't exist, we're making it up as we go along. Do you supposed fans out there in Geekland understand that very simple fact? Somehow, I doubt it..."
1145,6,This movie just wasn't good,The whole movie was just boring. Found my self on my phone most the time. I didn't even buy it when it came to dvd. I own every other one. Just the whole Rey with Luke scenes were so pointless to me and at the end when like never left the planet and disappeared was stupid to me. But it's necessary to watch.
1146,1,It's not really a Star Wars movie,"The last Jedi is a very offending movie. If you love the Star Wars franchise, then for gods sake don't watch this movie in the cinema, you will be deeply disappointing. I hates this movie it is just so bad that I wish that they had called it something else then Star Wars like Earth Warfare or something I may had given it a higher score. But this is Star Wars guys is not a little movie is maybe the biggest franchise ever made in film history and The Last Jedi just pisses all over its legacy. Need I to say more. Just skip it."
1147,,Painfully boring,"This movie tries so hard to be original that the result is totally un-Star Wars. Also, the acting is pretty bad as well, sometimes it looks quite like something someone uploaded on Vimeo. It's a failed attempt at making a cool Star Wars movie, the plot is just too silly and illogical. There are no redeeming values to this: no good characters, no good action scenes, no pretty thin girls showing skin, nothing!"
1148,8,"Calm down, stop looking too deeply into everything and enjoy it for what it is","As a massive Star Wars fan, I, like many other waited with such great anticipation for this film, I loved the trailers and saw the film at midnight on the opening day, my initial reaction was OMG IMDB 1/10. I think the problem is all fans had an idea of where the story should go and it let many down simply because it didn't follow their own expectations. Lets get the negatives out the way, the ""casino scene"" dare I say, is the worst scene from any SW film in history (and that saying something with Jar Jar) ..the bit where BB8 fires the coins ..omg what were they thinking, like many dreadful BB8 scenes, trying to make it far to comical. The second worst scene in SW history is also in this film with Leia flying though space back to her ship! But enough of the criticism, what was good? Ive seen it 7 times now at the cinema, its grown on me to a point where I love it...why? This is a sci-fi film, there is no basis for faulting on whats possible or not as a Jedi, or on real science, in one of the last scenes when the Falcon is battling TIE fighters above a planet surface, the G forces on Rey would knock her out!, nor should you criticise characters actions, like Luke's reaction to Ben turning to the dark side and what followed...if you sit back and enjoy it for what it is and stop looking to deeply into everything you will like it....virtually ever film can be taken to pieces (apart from Alien). For me this film was made by Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren, which is just brilliant, climaxing with his battle with ""Luke"", aided by a great music score. Mark Hamill's performance comes good in that scene, you get the feeling his heart wasn't in the island scenes. Driver's stunning performance is what makes this film though, his Jedi counterpart Rey is likeable and Daisy Ridley's shone in a few scenes, but she doesn't have Driver's intensity, Finn and Poe both play good parts (sometimes with poor scripts and to many silly jokes) There has been a lot of nonsense spoke of the female characters , Carrie Fisher xx we love you and you will always be ""the princess"", Laura Dern as Vice Admiral was tremendous, I can understand the criticism with the Rose character though but given the script/scenes she had, even Liz Taylor would had struggled ! I don't get Phasma this is political correctness gone mad, why out of all the ""male"" storm troopers, Phasma is a ""female"" captain, where did she come from lol (she wasn't helped by her lines)...Anyway watch it again, sit back, enjoy and STOP looking so deeply into everything"
1149,6,I will finish what you started.. or will I?!,"The Force Awakens relaunched the franchise to a generally positive reception. The Last Jedi has divided opinion greatly, does it finish what JJ started, is it really a bad movie, or just a bad Star Wars movie?"
1150,9,What's wrong in this fanbase? So much hate....,"Wow, so much hate. What the hell."
1151,6,The Last Jedi,"As enjoyable as The Force Awakens was, most people's biggest gripes came with the lack of originality and how much it copied A New Hope. The issue with Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is that it derives far too much from Star Wars. Rian Johnson wanted to subvert expectations in this film while continuing the story of Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron in their fight against the Galactic Empire-like adversary. This movie picks up where The Force Awakens left off and seems to hate everything set up in that film, and lacks the fun too."
1152,8,So much fan butthurt,"It's understandable why fans didn't like this - it went in a new direction, leaving behind the predictable cliches and dumbing down of the story to suit a young audience.<br /><br />There was nothing predictable about this, it was the first Star Wars movie directed at adults.<br /><br />Luke's arc in the film was really engaging, and it was great to see elements of the universe we hadn't seen before (class divides, war profiteering, insurrection).<br /><br />It's a shame that this movie is perceived so poorly by fans, it's a really strong story, that prioritises character development over tired cliches.<br /><br />I'm a long time fan (grew up with the original trilogy) and really excited about the future of Star Wars!"
1153,7,Looks over story,"The cinematography in this movie is amazing, the cgi, locations, cast, everything."
1154,1,Not only the worst Star Wars but the worst movie,It really is a shame nowadays what people rate as a good movie....<br /><br />I am aware of the fact that a review (especially a bad one) should be a comprehensive explanation of the reasons for the rating etc. <br /><br />But i don't want to invest that effort for it because it would mean it is worth it... which it isn't. The movie is just bad... believe it or not.
1155,10,My Favorite Star Wars Film for Myriad Reasons,"I believe this to be the best Star Wars film in existence. I think it is as close to a perfect film as a Star Wars film will get. The nuance of the storytelling, the challenge it serves to the fans and the characters shows the kind of maturity you don't normally expect from blockbuster films."
1156,7,"Good, however...","Take out the stupid bombing scene, and the sabotage mission, and it's much much better. The parts on the Jewish island with Luke were top notch. The acting by the leads was pretty good too. Supporting characters, not so much."
1157,1,Another knife through the heart.,"An insane let down of a storyline with really bad performances from all the new characters, and the new film makers at Disney continue their mission to destroy everything that Star Wars means to the fans."
1158,,It's time to end this boring childish crap,"This ""Last Jedi"" is not only with terrible storyline, it's just look extremely outdated. It might have been looked good and interesting 30 years ago, but absolutely looks stupid and childish. Heavily relied upon computer graphics but also sadly still in stereotyped CGI designs and special effect. In order to create some new figures and characters for the franchise toy market, this new sequel has predictably thrown in more weird and funny creatures. There's nothing worth watching and continuing the interest to support blindly for this franchise, let it fade away or phase out after this one, please."
1159,10,Great film- do not pay attention to bad reviews- see it yourself!!!!,I am not sure why all the bad reviews??? In my opinion it was a great part of Star Wars SAGA!!! Really good acting too!!! Nothing to complain to be honest! I will not write too much here to not spoil the plot. Go and see it yourself and try to ignore all the critics. Film is great!!! I was in cinema yesterday and I did not get disappointed- as a proof- I am going to see it for the second time today with my son. We both can not wait.... :) Enjoy the movie! And....may the force will be with you....
1160,6,Star Wars: The Death of the Magic,"That's honestly what I thought the movie should have been called and after over 3 decades this movie doesn't give us the Luke Skywalker we were waiting for. Instead the trend of the new movies is to unceremoniously kill off beloved characters (Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Admiral Ackbar, and Leia in the next installment) with little fanfare and for no reason other than to push the new characters which we really don't have any connection to. Like everyone else, I have about the same complaints about Snoke being discarded 1.5 movies into the trilogy with no explanation to who he is or where he came from and the ridiculous trend of current Hollywood films trying to be inclusive just for the sake of it without actually paying attention to creating characters that you care about and find interesting. "
1161,9,Might well become the next 'Empire',"Yes, I am aware that not everyone shares this view. In fact I'm well aware that there is in fact quite a bit of backlash to the new Star Wars movie."
1162,6,"Can't say this is a bad movie, but..","After successfully committing patricide in the last movie, Kylo Ren a.k.a. Ben Solo in this episode manages to commit tantamount to avunculicide, and fails in committing matricide, but not for lack of trying. Boy, the Skywalker-Solo clan is one messed up family. "
1163,10,Loved this so much,Saw this on Tuesday and absolutely loved it. Some random thoughts:
1164,6,"Unexpected, but Great","Going into this movie I had one wish, I thought ""Please don't be a repeat of Episode V."" The Force Awakens mirrored A New Hope, and while it made sense to reassure returning fans, and give any new fans a fantastic story to start with, it disappointed me a little how safe they played it. The Last Jedi took all the expectations I had going in and threw them out the window.<br /><br /> Now most people are upset by this. They wanted all their questions answered more or less the way they were expecting. I feel the exact opposite, and yes I am a long time fan of ALL the previous movies, not that I should have to qualify my opinion with that. This movie was exhilarating. I can't remember the last time I turned to my friend in the theater with my mouth open in amazement because I'm so shocked about what just happened. It made the movie exciting, and the stakes higher, since I no longer felt completely sure about anything that was going to happen. Movies are ultimately just entertainment, and it certainly succeeded in that regard.<br /><br /> The visuals, acting, spectacle, sound, etc was phenomenal. The entire scene in Snoke's throne room made me want to cheer. I enjoyed this movie the whole way through, and I am excited about what direction the new Star Wars will take in the future. For all the people who want to nitpick every detail and piece of lore, Star Wars doesn't belong to you. It doesn't even belong to George Lucas anymore. If you don't like the ideas of the people who work very hard and do their best to make the best movie they can then don't watch them, and leave the rest of us alone."
1165,2,Episode IX: No Hope,"The Force Awakens was a somewhat divisive film, but apart from the common complaint that it was essentially just a remake of The New Hope, most people seemed to have liked it. It did not kill my interest in going forward to see this film; unfortunately, I cannot speak as favourably of The Last Jedi."
1166,9,Bad reviews make no sense. This movie is awesome.,"Not sure why every single review is one star with ""prevent others from seeing this turd"" as the only justification. This movie was fantastic. I actually almost didn't watch it because of all of the negative reviews, but fortunately all of those reviewers work for CNN, because it is all fake news."
1167,6,"wait, was that... SpaceBalls?","First i must say that i don not know anything about storystructure or moviemaking at all. I onlu acount for my experience 3 weeks ago at the opening night.<br /><br />It is really har to write a spoilerfree review but anyway, here it goes:"
1168,1,It Couldn't Be Worse,"I feel like 1 star is usually used by outrage mobs but that's precisely what I am....outraged. What an absolute disgrace. If you don't know that this film is a product of radical feminism, now you know. It is bad because politics were put first and film-craft was put last. Luke isn't Luke, there is no continuity or respect for prior installments, and the film actually destroys the future for the franchise in multiple ways. Even if I didn't talk politics and subtle subversion, there are so many problems on their face. Plot holes abound. Why would you make two directors clash in their vision for the trilogy? Are these people stupid? Yes...yes they are. All we are left with is a shiny bauble that looks nice. The only way we could make this worse is by moving into the category of parody."
1169,,7.5?... something smells funny here...,Aside the fact that this is a piece of crap surely there are people that liked.
1170,10,Not for people who think their star wars universe is the one and only universe,"The usual storylines were totally destroyed....and I loved it. The story stays loyal to the canon, however it is not what you usual expects. A lot of people feel uncomfortable with this, since the Star Wars universe is so old, people start to making it their own universe. If you cannot let this go, than please don't hurt yourself and watch Hello Kitty or something like that. This movie contains everything a true heroic movie must have: cheers, grieve, heroes, bad guys, folks somewhere in between, nobodies who turn out to be the real heroes and a 50 shades of gray area which lies between good and bad. <br /><br />So let it al go, watch the movie and do not commit on the star wars universe you created, otherwise you cannot handle this. It is a masterpiece which gives you a new mindset of a galaxy far far away."
1171,7,Not Great Not Awful,"Was this a great movie no, but it isn't as awful as everyone says. The acting isn't bad but the characters in general can get annoying. Plot is flawed but not terrible."
1172,9,The resistance is back!,Awesome! I loved it! Great story<br /><br />Oh and porgs are awesome.
1173,7,Can everyone calm down...plz?,"All right, I know it wasn't perfect but is it really worth sending death threats over? I don't think so. Going into The Last Jedi, exicted wasn't even close to describing the emotions I had. The Force Awakens was a great HOMAGE to the original and made me look forward this one. Pre-ordered the tickets as soon as they were on sale. And after seeing it, I couldn't help but feel...joy. At the beginning of the film, I didn't know how to feel because it wasn't what I was expecting. And I don't mean the scene itself. More like the tone I suppose. It felt off but at the same time, I kind of loved it. That was me during half of the movie. I was torn to say the least. It finally clicked for me when they landed on Canto Bight. Funny huh? I think that's where I just decided to embrace the movie for what it was. Not saying that I thought it was bad and I just lowered my expectations. Just...different. A lot of the things people had problems with, I didn't mind so much. Luke's reaction to the lightsaber was more shocking than comedic. Was a great way to say this isn't the film you're looking for. The identity of Rey's parents wasn't that important to begin with but people made it out to be. It would've been so easy to just label her a Skywalker or a Kenobi. But Rian Johnson didn't take that route and I couldn't be happier. A lot would disagree but I don't care. And the whole thing with Snoke...would it have made a difference if he was Darth Plagueis? Look, people have real criticisms with the film AND THAT'S FINE. But the way people are talking about it, they make it sound like an Ed Wood piece. It deserves more than that. Most of the stuff in the The Last Jedi I didn't like were the smallest things. The shot of Luke and Rey on the cliff looked a little fake, one random transition swipe stuck out, not enough milking. The Force Awakens is a more consistent movie but the highs of this are so HIGH. That controversial scene with Holdo and the ship left me in awe. And to close it out, Kylo Ren is the best part of these sequels and my personal favorite character...ever. His struggle between the light and the dark is just so GREAT. Welp, thanks for reading...bye."
1174,10,"Fun, great, deep, intriguing & cool!","What are all these negative reviews? Come on! The Last Jedi is great! Fun, deep & cool! The story behind Rey and Kylo Ren is super intriguing (the best of the movie), Luke Skywalker is back, the casting is great, the whole artistic production is absolutely amazing and the music is brilliant and wonderful, as always. Go see it today, relax, don't be such a grouch and enjoy! 10/10"
1175,7,"It is enjoyable alright, but not enough as a 'Star Wars' episode.","As a new comer in watching 'Star Wars', I have seen all the previous episodes not long before going to the cinema for 'The Last Jedi'. To me, the classic films by George Lucas may lack certain elements to make themselves more decent, but classics they are, due to creativity and good story telling. Making 'Star War' movies nowadays is different, for the audience are becoming more demanding, and scorn to see conventionality."
1176,1,"Review what...Treekies "" 1 star for Biggest fish caught in space ""","This film was edited by Bob Ducsay and force awaken by Maryann Brandon yet pehaps we just blame director. We only just look at the huge gap in what they have edited and you will see the difference one edited turtles movies and godzillia and one mission impossible and startrek.<br /><br />This film has damaged Disney's and I can,t believe they have not apologized for this film. Too many doughnuts sugar rush over hyped what if we did this!<br /><br />This luke skywalker is now like Frank Walker in Tomorrowland played by george clooney and they both have similar lines it's scary how similar both have to explain their pasts and both are grumpy old men. ones a girl and ones a young woman but both femail cast speak in strong uperclass english.<br /><br />The script writters did not watch Force awaken, trailers with false representation of The movie. I though about asking for my money back after seeing it. It died half way through this movie all original cast were removed from original plot and placed in what seem to be a BMovie . The alien world seemed so flat with cartoon poggs furby things and crystle dog so original. Their was no droid progression just a round spinning thing that has a lighter woh.... The new cast were given bad lines and fin was peeing fluid what was that about needed a wet floor sign. The special effects were dodgy like b movie of 1950s.<br /><br />Was-are- j.j brams and riam star- trek fans i know they loathed starwars but thats no reason to destory it.<br /><br />The one star is for biggest fish caught in space.The last jedi A.K.A killing the biggest fish. Theres always a bigger fish qui gon jin,well not anymore."
1177,9,Best of the Star Wars franchise,"The Last Jedi is, in my humble opinion, the best of the Star Wars franchise. I saw trailers of the first Star Wars film even before it hit the big screen back in the 70's, and that one I felt held the title, until now. This story is overall well-developed, and I really liked that they built up the character of Luke Skywalker and made him very relevant again after so many years with him missing from the films. There is good emotion, heartfelt, and the fight scenes with Ben Solo are gritty and angry and filled with a lot of passion. Overall, I feel that the creators and the actors put a real nice spin on this ball, giving the viewer and life-long fans, such as myself, closure on aspects of the this story which have been hanging there for decades. And, no spoilers, it's set up for more sequels."
1178,7,What The Last Jedi did right and wrong.,"***WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM NOT ONLY THIS MOVIE BUT ALSO PREVIOUS STAR WARS MOVIES***<br /><br />Firstly, I would like to go on record saying that I am a die-hard Star Wars fan. I, like all fans, love the original trilogy and I even found the prequels, for the most part, enjoyable. The Force Awakens was in my opinion a great comeback after the prequels, that appealed to audiences of all ages."
1179,2,strange 'twist' style humor... usually during drama?,"Slow and corny, with strange 'twist' style humor inserted regularly at the most unlikely and unwanted opportunities will make fans want to vomit but may leave the average movie goer chuckling about as much as an 80's 'buddy comedy'. Easily the most disappointing and poorly written of all Star Wars including including flawed Phantom Menace, (Remember Young Aniken, Midiclorians and Jar Jar Binks). <br /><br />Acting is good all round, casting- very below par... for visuals, music and effects it is a 5/10... for story and dialogue, character/set/vehicle design... it's a 2/10. So split the difference for total score- 3/10.<br /><br />It made me walk out of the cinema feeling hopeless and depressed.<br /><br /> I can really understand the people that cried, it was so disappointing, and I have had other reboots and sequels of my favorite franchises (Terminator, Predator, Robocop, Ghostbusters, to name a few) be really terrible, but this... it would have been so EASY to write a cool and satisfying installment... but Rian Johnson had to have his own 'weird humor' every 5 minutes or so (usually during drama?) seemingly just to entertain himself?<br /><br />There was SO many inconsistencies, mistakes and missed opportunities, I honestly think Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy will end up costing Disney over 3 BILLION when you count the short fall of this movie, the massive amounts the #SoloBoycott lost due to fan hatred of this movie and the #Episode9Boycott #EpisodeIXBoycott in 2019 still to come..."
1180,,The Worst To Date,"Just when you thought the Prequels and TFA were bad, this movie comes out to top them all. Written for 6 year olds, this movie is nothing but a way for Disney to kill off the remaining old characters and set up Mary Sue and her Diversity Squad. It seems all the white males have been killed off and the only thing the Rebellion has are women, minorities and aliens. Showing some of the worst writing to date it is only surpassed by the stupidity of the plot and the waste of Mark Hamill. Watching this movie it struck me that the people making this film have NO CLUE how the Star Wars universe works nor anything about the machines or even the Force. People got up and left half way thru the film was that bad."
1181,8,Re-Review,I kinda thought this movie was better than all of the Star Wars Movies and after thinking through the whole movie there were some flaws in it that i didint mention there is a repetitive flaw with Rey and Kylo Ren and also Luke is not the same as he is in all the other movies i dont want to say more wise just more of an a-hole i guess and also another flaw is the ending with Luke if you know what i mean i mean its a great ending but not something i really wanted but it was still good anyway but not as what i was expecting. But those are the flaws of the movie there are so many good things though with the actors portraying Chewy and Rey and many more. I cant believe how good it got in this movie even with the flaws i absolutely loved the special appearance in it. It blew me away and made it so worth it and also the shock with the emperor and how the story unfolds with Kylo Ren its just amazing. Not as many light-saber fights though but still a great movie. So my Re-review is now an 8/10 with giving consideration now. Still a great movie.
1182,6,Average. Just Average.,"First of all, since I had such a low expectation going into the movie, I was not as disappointed as I'd expected. I thought the previous installment (Episode VII, not the Rogue One) was bad, and that this would be even worse. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but it just didn't feel so. Not that it was awesome or anything, it was just OK to watch. At least I did not roll my eyes so very much like I did two years ago.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Having said that, as The Force Awakens was a collage of all the previous movies, this was mainly a collage of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Nothing original was in there. Just some old gimmicks, familiar cliches, and all-around action. Despite all these, there were some spectacular scenes in there, mostly thanks to the CGI team and in some instances to the cinematographer(s). Otherwise, it was Episode V + Episode VI + CGI = Episode VIII - Originality + Plot Holes. And if you can get past all those magnificent CGI scenes, you could also see the shallow points in the plot. By that, I do not mean the use of excessive humor and many jokes in such an epic sci-fi drama. Contrary to many reviewers here, I was not that much offended by the humor since it was not delivered by the main characters (as was the case, for instance, in Thor: Ragnarok) but rather, by some of the side characters and accessories*."
1183,8,The Last Jedi Review,"The last Jedi is a film written and directed by Rian Johnson. Finally!!! After all my busy time was over I was able able to watch this film. It was great for cinema holders to actually have this film after 2 weeks!! The trailers didn't show much which is quite a positive thing, as you have not much things to hope for. BUut after seeing this film, I can say that this film is an entertaining film."
1184,7,Disjointed,"I planned on waiting to see this as I try to avoid crowds, but when reviews came out a couple days before release I was convinced I NEEDED TO GO. <br /><br />I headed out in a Lake Effect Snow storm (because we know Regal at the mall NEVER closes). Managed to get a ticket 2 hours before it blasted on to the screen.<br /><br />I was all in, until the first Joke hit the screen.....I was then disjointed through the rest of the movie. Rian Johnson said don't watch the trailers.....I should have listened. Those were the movie I wanted, it was not the movie I got. Visually stunning and as always great seeing familiar faces. This ranks lowest in my Star Wars catalog. I would even put the Ewok Made for TV just above this. I understand moving the story forward, but this just seemed to really shake things up to much. I know look forward to what else is coming and truly hope this jagged puzzle piece will fit in the end."
1185,8,A Story that Needed Told,"After being left on a cliffhanger (quite literally) during the late stages of Episode 7 'The Force Awakens', we saw the last hope of the Galaxy, Rey, meet with Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, on a green island surrounded by the ocean, named Ahch-To. This was filmed at Skellig Michael in Ireland. His appearance aged from the last time we saw Hammill in action and his character, who had been away from the Rebellion's business for some time, found himself with his old lightsaber handed to him from a scavenger he had never met before. Knowing that 'The Last Jedi' would entail a journey including the two, viewers enjoyed the comeback of an extreme legend of the franchise. Shortly after the destruction of Starkiller Base, General Leia Organa leads the evacuation of the Resistance forces when a First Order fleet arrives. In his rather bold and confident nature, Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack, against Leia's orders, that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. This opening is very fast-paced, giving the sense of determination fro, the Rebellion and the constant, ongoing rivalry that they continue to impose on the First Order. Kylo Ren hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia's presence on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. It is clear that Kylo Ren has insecure visions in his head, tilting his brutal nature and tampering with his service to the First Order. These visualisations hint at the possibility of Ren turning good, but he appears determined to serve for the First Order. Leia is dragged into space, following the bridge destruction, and a feature in silence, slowly sees Leia struggling, until she uses the Force and survives, regaining her place aboard the ship. While Leia recovers, Vice Admiral Holdo assumes command of the resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order. On Ahch-To, we transition from the battle and conflict, turning to Rey attempting to recruit Luke Skywalker to the Resistance. Under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help and says that the Jedi should end. Luke seems uncomfortable on the subject of the Jedi and prefers his independent lifestyle, Rey's arrival is nothing more than an inconvenience, however, he is confronted by his old friend, R2-D2 who travelled with Rey, and agrees to teach her three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles the, both, reinforcing the idea that they are somehow connected. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power; Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that Snoke was corrupting him, which prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order, answering for Luke's independence and ignorance toward the Jedi, Ren destroyed all he had left, all the future hope, he thought... Convinced that Kylo is easily turned and can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library, but hesitates, while considering his actions, the spirit of Luke's master Yoda appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of lightning. He, in all his wisdom, encourages Luke to learn from his failure. Meanwhile, Poe entrusts Finn, mechanic Rose, and BB-8 with a secret mission to deactivate the First Order's tracking device. Rose, to begin with, was extremely reluctant by Finn's suspicious actions and opens up to him about the loss of her sister, who played a pivotal role in destroying the First Order dreadnought, sacrificing her own life in the process. Maz Kanata directs them to the casino town of Canto Bight, where they meet with the hacker DJ. Pursued by the local security, they escape the city with the help of stablehand children and racing animals they set free, fitting as Rose admitted to being one of the children herself when she was younger. Finn, Rose and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship, but are captured by Captain Phasma. Phasma plays a subtle role in the Force Awakens, being the only person to spot Finn with his stormtrooper helmet off following Jakku, she is blanketed in shining, silver armour with a dark cloak on her back, her structure is the same as a stormtrooper, but her status means an alternative armour design. Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts. Holdo plans to evacuate the remaining members of the Resistance using small transport vessels. Believing her plan to be cowardly and futile, Poe leads a mutiny. Leia recovers and stuns Poe with a blaster, allowing the evacuation to proceed. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on Crait. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to General Hux, and the First Order fleet begins firing on the evacuation transports, destroying many. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke after shaping towards Rey, the two defeat his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the Dark side, but instead asks her to rule the Galaxy with him. Staying loyal with the Resistance, Rey refuses, she battles him for control of Luke's lightsaber, bisecting the weapon. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. We are confronted with numerous occasions of Ren being pretentious, for example, killing Han Solo was just a cover up to show is ruthlessness and dedication to the First Order, he wants to join Rey, but not in the Rebellion, yet, takes the Supreme Leader, suggesting that he doesn't know what he truly wants. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw TIE fighters away from the Millennium Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself, knowing that there are other options. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon. Luke appears from the distance and walks over quietly to confront himself to the First Order, allowing the Resistance to escape. Furious, Kylo Ren orders every single fire on ""that man"", but despite their try, no fire harms him. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel, another exciting, edge of seat, master v apprentice battle; upon striking Luke, Kylo realises that Luke is not physically present, but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the Falcon. An exhausted Luke dies peacefully on Ahch-To, to become one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again. At Canto Bight, the stablehands recount the story of Luke Skywalker; afterward, one of them moves a broom with the Force and gazes into space. The death of Luke was ultimately caused by the power of the Force, the most powerful Jedi trait, signalling that he died a Jedi, one of the greatest. The very well directed Episode 8 sees the insecurity of Kylo Ren and his ambitions to rule the Galaxy alone. Rey is still unsure why the Force drags her and Ren together. The episode captures passion, sacrifice and desire from the Resistance, standing up bravely against the First Order."

1187,1,Star wars is dead,I'm actually upset people thought this new trilogy was up to standard.
1188,10,Luke Skywalker returns,"I liked The Force Awakens although I felt it was made for the Star Wars fan only, but after I was eagerly awaiting for came next, this is the first time where a Star Wars takes place shortly after the last story, like The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi where filmed back to back.. Also eagerly waiting to see Mark Hamill return has the Iconic character Luke Skywalker, and does not disappoint."
1189,6,Star Wars the Reboot?,"Huge fan of Star Wars episodes 1-6. In comparison, this new series feels like it is trying to emulate the Star Wars magic, but lacks the vision. In the end this new trilogy feels more like a reboot of episodes 4-6 than a proper continuation of the series."
1190,1,Poo,"Complete PC trash, i hope that mark hamil is having nightmares because of this hopeless piece of poo movie"
1191,,The only thing this film has going for it...,"... is that it wasn't directed by Mr rip Off JJ Abrams.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a piece of boring and undeveloped trash where the grrrl power ugly chick is in constant Line video call with her beau (she likes emo kids who throw temper tantrum and play mr dress up with halloween masks).<br /><br />Poor Kathleen Kennedy and the Disney crew. So oppressed, so lazy, so useless."
1192,8,The Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home of Star Wars. Humor returns!,"The worst sin of Lucas's prequels was that they couldn't make a grown-up laugh. The Last Jedi finally rectifies that. At last, we have characters who dare not to take everything so seriously all the time and who have some wits. We also have unpredictability, the hardest thing to produce in the ninth iteration of a series. Yes, it's still a recycled plot line from Empire Strikes Back, but it's much more creative than that. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks here, and I'm glad he did. I almost thought I was getting too old to be a Star Wars fan. Now I can relax and enjoy myself again."
1193,7,My saggy balls have more watch appeal than this movie.,"Take the original Empire Strikes Back, then strip away pacing, character growth, sense of good vs evil, proper, flowing story development and, most important of all, originality, and we're left with what is effectively a sequence of Star-Wars cliches without a reason to give a damn about any of it. There just wasn't any sense of menace at all in this, Kylo Ren being reduced to more of a side character with moments of telepathy. All this leaves an emotionless hole for 2 and a half hours full of countdowns to being obliterated by yet another powerful weapon while the good guys hastily cobble a plan together to escape again (usually involving one small ship evading all the bad guys. You've seen it before)."
1194,10,Beautiful In Countless Ways,"This deep and thematic movie is everything Star Wars needs to be. Expanding on the universe as well as focusing in on the characters. All five of our main characters have an arc that relates back to the themes of the movie. I could write a ten page dissertation on how wonderful it all is. But you should really see it for yourself, and don't let the people who want to be miserable ruin it for you. I understand that many people don't like it, and that's fine. But, since 2017 people have been endlessly toxic about how much they hate it, it even tainted my opinion for the longest time. But I was able to see past it, and now it's a breath of fresh air for Star Wars, and encapsulates everything I love about it. I've been seeing more praise for it online recently, but the hate is all still there. This isn't new for Star Wars, but I hope this movie (like we've seen with the prequels) becomes more respected in the future. This will be one for the ages!"
1195,6,Adventure based on chaos imagination,"After The Force Awakens, I pretty much take it as just another movie that uses the title and story background of Star Wars. As the descend of Han Solo in the previous one and the glimp of Skywalker at the end of the movie, I was expecting Luke would play a role more or less like Yoda in the orginal series. I should claim that the difference between the movie and what I expected is not the reason for this score. <br /><br />As we all know it is not easy to stick with science as movie serves another purpose. However, there are some amazing scenes in this movie that simply blowed my mind into the galexy. At least on IMDB, it is not in the category of Scifi. Despite the acts that main characters survived all those explotion, huamn can survive exposing to the spacing without helmet and suit (especially Leia)?<br /><br />As well, the story was full with chaos and confusions that lead the audience to nowhere. The conflict of Luke, the conflict of Rey, too overwhelming in 2h30min.<br /><br />One thing appreciated is at least the movie did not bore me during the whole time. Only left a mess mind of no impression of the story."
1196,9,"High rating for this being what it is, a farewell of sorts to the Traditional Structure Of Star Wars Movies.","At age 64 and a fan since 1977, I am content with Luke's arc. He, like Leia, lived his life, made good choices and bad, and went out in Yoda style dissolution, but with more action involved than in Yoda's death, who basically died of old age in his smelly little hut.. The sacrifice-for-the-sake-of-delay came through well. "
1197,7,A great film hidden inside a lot of shit,"This movie is quite amazing, but at the same time it is terrible, it has an amazing plot line evolving luke and Rey, but it falls flat in all of the other plot lines, the resistance vs first order chase plot line, Finn and rose's plot line is terrible, all of it, since the casino until Crait, overall it is this was a great movie inside a lot of mess, if it was more straight forward, cut like 1 hour and the jokes, it would have been the greatest movie in the saga, but it still has good thing in it. 6,8/10"
1198,1,Empire has won,"This story is about a greedy corporation which reduced to dust a beautiful fairy tale. I still can't believe that having so much resources Disney wasn't able to hire a good screenwriter in order to make some new, but at the same time a wholesome and well-balanced story as part of the original trilogy. JJ Abrams simply made a dumb remake with a bunch of waxworks. But what Johnson did is unacceptable piece of crap. Two and a half hours of meaningless actions that caused only new problems, instead of interesting twists we got nothing. The First Order is a shame for the Dark Side, because how can you be afraid of an old nutjob and two childish hysteriacs? Palpatine and Vader were a real evil, dangerous and horrifying, but these three? No way. In details the story is awful as well. The only good thing in this 'movie' is, certainly, CGI. This is the last thing which modern Hollywood is good at - the rest of the mass product they do in general is completely hopless, and Episode VIII made no exceptions about that."
1199,9,The Last Jedi is an awesome space opera as epic as the original trilogy!,The Force Awakens brought audiences back to Star Wars and what they love. Rogue One put the 'War' back into Star Wars. The Last Jedi brings back the mythic elements and the epic cosmic scale of the long running space opera franchise.
1200,7,Not as Good Upon Second or Third Viewing,"My impression on first viewing this movie was very positive. It lost some of it's luster, though, upon viewing it multiple times a couple of years after its debut. The story is entertaining and the cinematography and special effects are excellent, but a number of things bothered me."
1201,2,It is a bad movie...just like that,"It is a bad movie...just like that, its so bad its almost offensive to watch, because it feels like the director & writer really believed the viewer would buy it. Writing is so bad that what characters say almost makes it a comedy. Battle scenes resolve around self sacrifice and heroism put in context so absurd that leaves you wonder why did he do that. Massive plot holes and plot jumps are filled with one sentence like some characters says ""she escaped..."". I give it 2 starts for good visuals, first order aesthetic design and antagonist."
1202,,Worse than Episode I: The Phantom Menace.,"Even fewer good moments than Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and at its worst, harder to watch."
1203,8,This franchise just got interesting.,"Wow, just wow. <br /><br />I am not talking about the movie, it was okay. Just another holiday popcorn sci-fi, no biggie.<br /><br />No, what I am wowing about is this very awesome, and very original marketing ploy to sell tickets. Someone is a marketing genius over there<br /><br />at Disney Industries. <br /><br />""Hey, let's start an online campaign that appears like fans are panning the <br /><br />movie. The 'actual fans' will follow blindly because that is what they <br /><br />do...and the next thing you know, we will have a juggernaut at the box <br /><br />office because EVERYONE will be talking about The Last Jedi.""<br /><br />Well, it's working. People are flocking to the theaters to see who's right -<br /><br />the gushing critics or the die-hard cry-babies.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if this one breaks the record for profit haul. I am <br /><br />sure this idea has been thought of before, but not to this degree of <br /><br />success. There is a saying in show business: ""There is no such thing as <br /><br />bad press"". <br /><br />I am not sure this ploy was needed though. The Star Wars brand is going <br /><br />to do well at the box office anyway. But maybe the studio was worried <br /><br />about recouping their investment for whatever reason and concocted this <br /><br />online blitz idea to hedge their bets?<br /><br />When the film is viewed in this light, it takes a back seat to an even larger, <br /><br />and arguably more interesting, story ~ the story of us, the movie goers. <br /><br />Somehow we have become unwitting tools of the industry to sway the <br /><br />money in a certain direction. We are just pawns with disposable income."
1204,7,Disappointing and underwhelming,"So Star Wars: The Last Jedi came out. I've seen it twice, and I have some strong opinions about it. This review will contain absolutely no spoilers and will be as vague as I can possibly make it. You will not read this review and know anything that would hurt your moviegoing experience. Everything that I mention has been in the two trailers or has been released by Lucasfilm."
1205,9,The Force does not belong to you,"Return of the Jedi was the very first movie I saw in a theater and while starting at the (at that time) end may have not been the best start, what is really? Every Star Wars movie can be somebody's first Star Wars movie. Since very little was accomplished in The Force Awakens other than introducing a few new characters, The Last Jedi proves itself in numerous ways to be the actual sequel to Return of the Jedi. "
1206,6,"Nice set design, but bland characters","In Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Han Solo and Leia are overconfident and brash, but they often have to come to terms with the consequences of their bad decisions, and so are made aware of their own limitations. They use humour as a defence mechanism, to give them strength when things are not going well. Luke lacks self-confidence, but he is young, and sets out to learn, and improve guided by Obiwan and Yoda. All of this makes it easy for us to identify with Han, Luke and Leia in the original trilogy."
1207,8,Good movie,I have been a fan of the movie since o watched the first three with my dad. I found the movie entertaining and enjoyed watching it. I would say don't worry about reviews watch it for yourself and make your own judgement.
1208,6,"Fresh, exciting, innovative and yet, unfufilling and ultimately disappointing.","Like the reviews from fans, I'm split on TLJ."
1209,1,The Last Star-Wars I'll Ever Watch,"This movie was insultingly bad. This movie spits in the face of all Star-Wars fans that have ever existed. If you'd like to partake in the desecration of a great saga, watch this movie. I will never watch another Star Wars movie after this release, not even for free. I am so utterly disgusted by this movie that I will truly never watch another one. Repeatedly throughout the film the audience is mislead into thinking something bad might happen or has happened, only to have it revealed that miraculously everything is okay. Every time it seemed a character might die, they somehow survived with heroic trumpets playing. The main villain died in the most predictable and anticlimactic way I've ever seen. The terrible ""Rose"" character was so out of place and horrific that I was cringing the entire movie. The movie is not real Star Wars and is CLEARLY FOR CHILDREN. I am beyond insulted by this movie and hate that it was made. I could rant for days about how many specific things were wrong with this movie, but the point is that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I mean that, for over a decade I told everyone the worst movie I'd ever seen was ""Where the Wild Things Are"", but FINALLY a worse movie has topped it. PLEASE don't ruin your own representation of Star Wars by watching this filth. I wish I had my money back. On my life, I'll never watch another Star Wars after this."
1210,10,the best SW-movie since the original trilogy,"Everything thats brilliant bout TLJ was already written by people with real movie-expertise. sorry, but toxic online-haters are really not interested in movies. they are mainly just a bunch of anachronistic male star wars fans and they dont know anything about the medium SW belongs to in first place. so, yeah ... i rather have real brilliant, vibrant movie-making with risky storytelling (TLJ) than horrible directing thats based on stiff story-planning (episodes 1-3). the toxic haters may not believe it, but movies are a complex medium, and storytelling is not everything, it may not even be important considering the quality of a movie. i have one hint for these toxic haters: please watch some real movies from around the world and through the decades. get some knowledge about the thing you are arguing about ... and than think again."
1211,7,Never thought I'd say this...,"But this movie made me miss the genius that was Jar-Jar Binks. There were a few good moments here and there, but overall I don't know what this was supposed to be. It did absolutely nothing to advance the stories of the previous saga films, and instead turned the mythology everyone loves about Star Wars into bantha dookie. It's time for Disney to end."
1212,2,Boo this man!!!,"Rion Johnson is to the Star Wars franchise, is what Michael Bay is to the Transformers franchise."
1213,,Will Luke Skywalker be the last Jedi?,I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It has no extras at all but picture and sound are first rate as you would expect from George Lucas.
1214,9,Star Wars is REBORN,"While there are many opinions on the film, I personally LOVE it. Great acting (especially Hamill and Driver) beautiful visuals, engrossing cinematography, and a well crafted script (despite Canto Bight) from Rian Johnson help the film stand out among the other Star Wars films and shows a new way foreword in the franchise, giving us fitting ends to Luke and Leia so we can usher in a new era for the final film. In the end the film accomplishes what it sets out to do, and I will gladly say I respect it as much as the originals."
1215,7,Non va oltre,"Star Wars, dopo 40 anni, fa parte della nostra storia. Ma non va oltre un 7/10."
1216,8,God forbid a movie does something different and goes beyond expectations...,"*****Contains spoilers about plot twists and stuff so go away*****<br /><br />This review is mostly about the stupid fans that go on about how bad this movie is and are really bad at criticizing the movie<br /><br />This movie currently has a %53 on Rotten Tomatoes...<br /><br />The My Little Pony Movie has a %80 and this just isn't acceptable...<br /><br />Can people get their heads out of their heads and be reasonable for a second. This movie is currently being criticized for doing stuff different and ""destroying Star Wars"". God forbid the movie had creative minds behind it and was written excellently (at least for a blockbuster I wasn't asking for The Godfather and I didn't get it but the script is amazingly good still) <br /><br />These are probably the same people that criticized Force Awakens and Rogue One for being really predictable.Are you kidding people? Are you really butthurt over really good plot twists and change in Star Wars dynamics ? Do you need to know everything about a movie before it comes out ? Is this where the movie industry has come to. I'm seriously baffled because of these mindless reviewers and I'm siding with the critics for once. I'm more baffled at the people that give this movie 1 star. 1 star? are you joking. Even if you didn't like the plot or the changes, you gotta admit the acting is the best in the series, the visual effects are stunning, the movie has great direction (thank you Rian Johnson you beautiful beast), the soundtrack is also awesome, the action is probably the best in the series. <br /><br />So I'll like to go against some stuff that people got annoyed with<br /><br />Leia using the Force? - Even tho we haven't seen Leia use the Force for lifting stuff but she was clearly Force sensitive because she is the daughter of Anakin and does have the Force to help her out.<br /><br />Luke's character ark. -People are talking about this while Yoda literally did the same thing after ep III where he went to hiding in Degobah<br /><br />Snoke wasn't explored well. -As much as I kind of agree with this but Snoke's character was already weak and as mysterious as he was he was pretty much a placeholder for Kylo to get in power and It gave us one of the most intense scenes in the series<br /><br />Porgs? -I don't think much people are talking about them but they are awesome and adorable need one immediately<br /><br />So please criticize movies reasonably and give actual good criticism."
1217,7,Not as bad as people say,"I don't fully understand the bad reviews. I think the performances were good and while the story wasn't very original, it tried to borrow the ingredients from the other films, for example getting the other to join their cause aka switch to dark side. The jokes were a little lame."
1218,8,The force reawakens with a new hope in this solidly entertaining sequel that dares to go bold with the formula,"What was so surprising about The Force Awakens was how entertaining it really was. Sure, it offered overblown fan service and the story was nothing new, but it blended together old and new formula nicely with supreme energy."
1219,7,a brief evaluation,"Star Wars: episode viii, while bringing to an end the legacy of the old jedi, successfully launched a new generation of jedi stories. Although the movie is not perfect, the next development is still worth your and mine."
1220,1,Like a made for television low budget spin off,What's with the lame attempt at slapstick comedy and the social justice warrior approach to rebel hierarchy? 
1221,10,What Agenda Do The People Have With Low Reviews,"I watched the movie and I'm a Fan. I see many 1 and 2 rating this Episode. A one or a two is reserved for pictures like The Creeping Terror or Plan 9 From Outer Space. I feel there is some sort of agenda against this. It was nominated for 4 Oscars so Cmon just be honest and stop with the hate. By the way, I loved it."
1222,7,"It's actually good, provided you are not a Star Wars original hypocrite",I was actually surprised by those negative reviews. So this review is more a response than a review from my view. <br /><br />1. For those who 'worry' that Disney will turn Star Wars into a princess movie just because now the last jedi is a woman should stay in their 80s misogyny space and time. Don't you think it's already too late to have the first and only female jedi until 2017?
1223,2,Embrace the stupid.,"The villains are stupid. The ""heroes"" are stupid. Luke Skywalker is stupid. Leia is stupid. The admiral is especially stupid. Snoke is stupid. His guards are stupid. Kylo Ren is stupid. Finn is stupid. Rose is stupid. Poe is stupid. The sassy robot is stupid. The plot is stupid. The pet bird is stupid. Yoda is stupid. The crystal dogs are stupid. The horses are stupid. The slave children are stupid. The battles are stupid. The force is stupid. "
1224,,A Risky And Fantastic Star Wars Story That Will Get Better Years To Come,PROS:
1225,8,I really enjoyed it and found it fresh,"I'm personally writing this review to show that there are fans of TLJ. I found it a fresh of breathe air and in my opinion the risks pulled of better than I thought.<br /><br />First my main complaints. Yes the writing for Rose and Holdo wasn't good, I understood why they were there but they didn't add that much, Rose was just unnecessary but no where in a galaxy far far away as bad as jar jar, and Holdo is a character I feel would have had development in a previous movie but just wasn't pulled off right, bit swapping he rout for akbar wouldnt fix anything, in my opinion it would have detracted from the film. And the casino sub plot was unnecessary and it could have been put to better use by building the character of phasma, but its only like 20 minutes in this 2hr long movie so on 2nd viewing it didn't drag like I first thought. "
1226,7,"No, it's not that bad.","The utter hysterics among some of the reviews claiming this is ""The worst Star Wars ever!"" are a bit of an over-reaction. This is a completely acceptable Star Wars movie. I will say right off the bat that I didn't enjoy it as much as The Force Awakens, but some of the story elements are intriguing. It really requires multiple viewings to digest properly."
1227,8,good job,First off for other reviewers. we don't need a summary of the movie in your reviews. you're basically being mapquest giving driving directions out of your own neighbourhood- we know the summary we don't need it for the hundreth time<br /><br />for the purists out there yes i remember seeing these as they came out on video 30 years ago. those were great. these are great too don't get too bent out of shape on consistency what's the fun in that? when they first came out everyone loved them for that great enjoyable feeling. there were inaccuracies then too but no one dwelled on them be happy we still have them coming out you can stop at any time. i don't want to be bitter or too negative let's hust enjoy them!
1228,6,Use The Force Luke,"I gave my rating strictly on the soundtrack by John Williams, he can still compose great Star Wars music from the prequels all the way to this. I won't label Last Jedi a bad film, as a stand-alone episode it was very good and I was entertained. A wise 6 bucks spent on Xfinity"
1229,8,"Lots of philosophy, plot twists and surprises.","The Last Jedi was such a beautiful film on so many levels, despite its flaws, it's a movie that will make you cry, smile, laugh and inspire you. The most notable surprise was the script, in that it wasn't as dumbed down as I expected it to be. Unlike the Force Awakens, which was just one giant nostalgic introduction to the characters, The Last Jedi had lots of philosophy, and for that it will stand the test of time as a movie I'll go back to over and over for inspiration and not just for the action-adventure. "
1230,7,"Please ignore the abysmal fanbase, this is an original story that works well","I really enjoyed this rendition of Star Wars. Keep in mind, I try to go into every movie very very optimistically. I like to be as subjective to the film as possible, because I think it really gets the reader thinking about their thoughts. This is a very good Star Wars movie, and it definitely deserves praise. This is not to say it's without its faults; there are things wrong with this movie that simply cannot be ignored. However overall, I thought the movie was an eye candy success. "
1231,2,Good underlying story executed so horrible that I can't express it in words,I was literally googling whether I was watching an extended version while watching it. It is unimaginable how anyone could've thought all these pointless scenes would make up a good movie. At times I felt like I was watching a funny clip compilation instead of a part of probably the most well known space opera.
1232,9,Rain Johnson takes the new trilogy beyond a simple fanboy exercise,"I went into the film with goodwill, wanting to like it, but I also had modest expectations given some of the varied opinions out there. The film's first 20 minutes or so seemed really by-the-numbers and was not grabbing me at all, starting off with a routine space battle with no story build-up to get the audience invested, Luke saying he doesn't want to train Rey, and Rylo Ken/Ben Solo getting talked down to by his master, the Supreme Leader. Ho hum. But when the film started to get more into character driven stories than plot driven ones, the film really takes off. That opening exposition did set up some great character driven storylines, the most welcome of which involves a new character, Rose Tico, a mechanic working for the resistance who's sister was killed during that opening space battle. Rose's story as a low level true believer in the resistance getting caught up with main players Finn and Poe Dameron is terrific and a great hook for audiences to enter into the Star Wars universe with a fangirl of these rebel heroes. The main storylines in the film involve the rebel fleet fleeing the New Order while low on fuel and unable to jump to light speed, Rey trying to get Luke to come back and help lead the resistance while also telepathically linking to Rylo Ken and trying to draw him to the light side of the force, and lastly a secret plan by Finn, Poe Dameron, and Rose to sneak aboard a Star Destroyer to save the retreating rebel fleet. While those all seem very plot driven, writer/director Rian Johnson makes these stories dependent upon character and that's why this entry into the new trilogy really works so well. The last of the three plot lines, about sneaking onto a Star Destroyer to exploit a design flaw, is a very played out plot device for a Star Wars film, but Johnson plays against audience expectations and makes it work. Johnson also plays against expectations with the commanding officer of the rebel fleet being played by Laura Dern. It's unexpected casting, and don't get me wrong, Dern is a terrific actress, but is not someone who I'd have pictured in a Captain Kirk/Captain Adama type of role, but she commands the screen with power and grace. This being unexpected for me may be my male centric/chauvinistic perspective, but I want to commend the filmmakers for prominently featuring women in heroic/action roles throughout the film. ""The Force Awakens"" did this some by making Rey the main character, but ""The Last Jedi"" noticeably had more women as fighter pilots, on the command bridge, and in other leadership roles. This made me realize how male dominated the original and prequel trilogy were. The other character point that Johnson gets credit for is his development of Rylo Ken/Ben Solo. Johnson and Adam Driver make the character's inner turmoil between whether to embrace the light or dark side of the force seem very real and honestly left me wondering which way he will go. In the prequel trilogy, we already knew Anakin was going to embrace the dark side, so there was no suspense there, and the original trilogy had Vader as an out-and-out black hat villain for the first two films with no hints of an inner struggle, so having the Vader figure of the new trilogy palpably struggling with what direction to go is compelling to watch. Daisy Ridley also gets a lot of credit for helping make Rylo Ken's struggle feel more human, but Ridley deserves recognition for the strength of her own character as well, with Rey holding her own with such an iconic of character as Luke Skywalker for much of the film. It's also worth noting Carrie Fisher's final film appearance as Leia was given additional weight by her recent passing in real life. There's also a surprising supporting role by Benicio Del Toro, who is terrific as always. I'm really hoping his character returns in the next film. SPOILER ALERT! Getting to see Luke and Leia reunite, even if it was ever so briefly, is a great little moment. The other spoiler worth noting is Yoda's appearance and how excited I was to have Yoda portrayed by a puppet once again and NOT computer generate imagery (along with again being voiced by the great Frank Oz). Overall, ""The Last Jedi"" elevated the new trilogy and allowed it to stand on it's own. ""The Force Awakens"" was the fanboy movie I was hoping to see with the prequel trilogy and made me excited about the Star Wars universe again. ""The Last Jedi"" allowed the new trilogy to come into it's own and gave real substance to these new characters."
1233,7,Positive words from a Star Wars oldschooler,First of all I have to admit that this review is written by a 30 year old person who was very disappointed of EP7 and declared EP4-EP6 to his religion as a kid. Movie watched in 2D!
1234,1,WOW,"So firstly, I do not think this is a one, but sort of trying to off set the fact that this movie is a 7."
1235,,The failed try to go a new way...,"While the cinematography and special effects are great, obviously due to the big Disney budget, the plot and narrative choices derail the movie.<br /><br />The most things the characters do are simply irrational and the twists seem to ultimately lead nowhere."
1236,9,I really wonder about the negative reviews...,"I watched the movie on Dec 14 and had no expectations at all. I am a Star Wars fan since 1982 when I watched The empire strikes back (my first movie to watch at cinema at age 10). I loved Star Wars since but never ever did another Star Wars movie reach the quality of this one. Till Dec 14, 2017. I walked out the cinema and thought: This one was as good as The empire strikes back. Wow. And I really wanted to see all the reviews here on IMDB. And then ... what a disaster ... hey guys really - have we seen the same movie??? ... I don't get it. <br /><br />So I just say to you all who have not seen it yet: Go and watch it!!! This is a really good one..."
1237,6,"Space adventure eye candy, but forget the story","I work at the cinema and every movie I get to screen, I check if it will play right. That includes skipping few scenes, check picture and sound and I turn it off if everything is ok. Through skipping scenes, I saw a few that looked really engaging and I've decided to make a little cinema screening for myself before the people come in to see the movie. That was the first time I have done it and won't do that again for SW movie. Not worth it.<br /><br />I like the original SW movies (episodes I-III were ok, nice to look at), but I am not die hard fan of the series. TFA was ok, Rouge One not so much and this one... I really don't know anymore what this hype is all about."
1238,10,"""The Last Jedi""","I really felt that Rian Johnson's latest ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" only slightly better than ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015). This film is a little bit more original, in the sense that it isn't steeped in nostalgia for the original ""Star Wars"" series that was released between 1977-1983, which I know grated some people who saw ""The Force Awakens."" It still pays a lot of homage and reference to the original trilogy, and tries to do its best to distance itself from George Lucas's prequel trilogy that was released between 1999-2005."
1239,7,Better than Awakens but still sleepy.,"I feel like ths Should be the last Jedi,I keep holding out hope but it never gets better. Like the first three Xmen films The Star Wars reboots seemed destined to dissappoint."
1240,9,The Force is our religion and Jedi is our god,"Star Wars franchise has gone through different phases over the last 30 odd years. There were ups and then there were downs. But since the release of 'The Force Awakens', it has resurrected itself in a quite a grand manner. The recent addition: The Last Jedi perfectly blends the madness of Star Wars with a gritty storytelling. We all kind of had a hunch that 'The Force Awakens' was like a foundation for much bigger things to come. The Last Jedi takes the franchise forward in the right direction."
1241,6,Not worthy to be Star Wars episodes 7-9,"I sort of like it and don't like it! The main problem with these films now is, they don't have the George Lucas touch and here's why I say this! The original three are without doubt the best by a long shot! Even the three later that had the George Lucas moments where the audience went ""yeah"" e.g Yoda fighting Christopher Lee, Darth Maul killing Qui and then Obi Wan waiting for the force field to go down, great moments. But these new films do not have these moments! Other things that annoy me about this film, the General, he's like a little college boy, how is he second in command? This should be a character like Grand Moth Tarkin, a leader, a man who has a menace about him, not even Darth Vader talked down to him, he had respect. The Emperors guards, looked like a bunch of samurai's, why not just the usual Emperors guards rather than these new ones. The AT-AT's, why do they have to be different, what was the point in them having fists or hands as feet, they never did anything, and the originals from empire look more realistic. Even in the other film before this they could not get the size of these correct, you had Rai leaning up against the foot of one in the dessert, lol, I think JJ got confused between the size of a Scout Walker and an AT-AT here! SO this is episode 8, a huge joke if you ask me! What was the story, rebels on the run, stuck in space with the imperials on a slow pursuit after them, hmmm, very weak. Benicio Del Toro, great actor, but what was with the stuttering, did that add some sort of value to the character other than annoyance? The main boss, he sat in the chair and died, what a let down he was! Darth Vader wannabe, he is okay, but Darth Vader also always had other villains in the films, it was never just him, Jabba The Hutt, Boba Fett, Monsters, Emperor, Sand People, etc etc there were always multiple dangers in the original films. The base at the end, all this time, and they never knew about the way out at the back? Hmm, if you say so. The snow fox things, was strange, my friend explained they were from the cartoons, which is good if you watch these, but I don't, so I guess the writer assumes everyone watches the cartoons, which I don't. Luke at the end, what was that about? At first I thought, yes, Luke is very powerful when he was getting shot down, but then it turned out to be a Doctor Strange astral projection and to top it off at the end he just vanished into thin air, at least Obi Wan Kenobi was holding off Vader in the first instance when he did this, knowing he could not win the fight, also George Lucas always said he regretted doing that, then this writer comes along and just does that to Luke? Really? So now we're gonna have ghost Luke appearing everywhere all the time even thogh ghost Annakin, Obi Wan have totally vanished, LMFAO! Get a proper writer for the last film, the George write it for crying out loud, JJ Abrahams is not that good and very overated, and this guy who wrote this must have had his blessing! The more I write about it and think about it, the less I like it so I'm gonna stop now! An old school Star Wars die hard fan whose extremely dissapointed!"
1242,2,"Disappointing,",A sad day for Star Wars. And a good waste of money.<br /><br />The Last Jedi deserves every ounce of critique it has garnered over the last months.
1243,9,Met Uber High Expectations: Didn't Exceed,(Flash Review)
1244,6,10/10 Audio/Visuals with 2/10 Story,"Last Jedi movie was a beautiful Audio/Visual experience especially in 3D. That is pretty much all I can say about the PROs of the movie. I should make it clear that the 6 it received from me is a very generous rating, only given to acknowledge the amazing work people who were responsible from cinematography/effects/visuals and effects did."
1245,1,What did I watch !,Competent ruined my favourite saga of all time ! Not to mention my child hood! Kathleen and Rian you should be ashamed!! Bad movie
1246,,"Surprisingly unpredictable, and filled with shocking twists!",'STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI': Five Stars (Out of Five)
1247,10,People... just just... STOP,"People stop hating on it so much, just because it wasn't your cup of tea, doesn't mean you have to get all hoidy toidy about it. Most of you are from the older generations, from the time of the originals, I get why you might not like it. Maybe it just means grow up and that its not for you anymore. I personally thought it was great, then again I'm not from the original era of Star Wars, so yea. Just please keep this bull crap to yourselves, its your own opinion and it upsets many other people."
1248,6,An underwhelming Star Wars adventure,"Here we go. Another year, another release of a highly anticipated Star Wars film. After last years solid, yet unspectacular ""Rogue One"", which was more of a spinoff prequel than anything else, many fans were anxiously awaiting the next main installment of the new trilogy. This second installment of the new trilogy, titled ""The Last Jedi"", directed by series newcomer Rian Johnson, comes with a ton of hype. As usual with highly anticipated releases, all the hype comes with the potential of disappointment, and unfortunately, The Last Jedi is a bit of a disappointment. "
1249,8,Okay here goes...,Midnight showing is all done for Star Wars The Last Jedi. 
1250,7,The film was as conflicted as Kylo Ren,"I want to really like this film. Cinematography was great, acting was great, fight scenes were great, it was comical in the right way. Without spoilers, there were two extremely underwhelming characters that were both killed off. There was a character that I felt needed to be killed off. This film could have best been served as an ending rather than a midpoint. It does not live up to the hype however."
1251,9,I loved it,"I just need to write something, as I don't understand the many 1 star ratings. I saw the film yesterday with my family and we all loved it. It made me laugh quite a few times and it was full of meaningful action. I just enjoyed myself."
1252,7,Just my Opinion,"I will offer NO SPOILERS at all, go see for yourself, but I will give my take on the movie I saw today. I saw the original at age 6 and went on to see it 9 times that summer. I think the problem people are having with the saga now is that we can not see the same story with are child eyes again. Did the dialogue suck, YES, did it also seem like an Empire retread, some what. Just like a good book Star Wars needs to come to an end. Characters will have to be killed off, this is basically a WAR movie and people die in war. Was I disappointed, somewhat was it worth my $6.00 sure. Do I want to see it again, sure on Blu-ray. Do not be afraid of these bad reviews, make your own mind up. 7/10"
1253,1,Awful,"That was simply awful. <br /><br />A terrible plot, bad script, and poor acting. "
1254,8,A Good Blockbuster but far from a Great Star Wars film,"Simply put, The Last Jedi is an above average blockbuster but not a ""great"" Star Wars film."
1255,6,This is Not Going to Go the Way You Think,"Luke's line mentioned in the trailer is exactly what this movies about. It does not go how you think. It is almost like they read all the fan theories on the net and said ok lets not fulfill those notions. And you know what I'm ok with that. This new trilogy started with Rey, Finn and Kylo Ren, theses movies are about them not the original cast. The movie is good I was entertained but the problem lies (for me) in the elongated 1st act. Just like with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 I didn't realize that I was within the main plot until about halfway through the movie. The first half of the movie is a lot of filler that did not need to be there. I get what the over arching idea is supposed to be. The resistance in their most desperate hour, losses are great, choices are made, authority is questioned. I like all that but it could have progressed in a better paced way. During this first act though all the stuff going on with Kylo Ren, Rey and Luke are very interesting (and will create more fan speculation before Episode 9 comes out). Now to get into the good and the bad."
1256,1,70% of scores is fake is impossible 7.2 for this film,"When i see 7.2 score for this film I ve understand that they the scores is all fake,"
1257,,Ignore all bad reviews !,This film as absolutely insanely amazing. The best Star Wars by far and my favorite movie ever. Just think about something for a second. There is 286 user reviews at the time that I am writing this. Do you think that that's all the people that went to watch the film? NO! 99% of the people that are coming out of watching this film have come out feeling like I am. Absolutely stunned by how amazing that film is. But 99% of those people coming out of the film will not feel the urge to write a review to the film. However 99% of those that come out of the film and somehow hate the film (still don't understand why) will feel the need to write a review. 
1258,10,A thrill ride for everybody,Going into this movie and after seeing the trailers i expected a story of rey and skywalker spending most of the movie training and her like a super sayin exploding with the force but i was decived instead i got a who other movie like die hard but with more action thrills and comdey then i have seen in all starwars movie combined and the jokes were very funny i cracked up ever time and seeing finn just jump up and wake like that had my heart pumping.... being a huge fan of force awakens i had high hopes for and totally got what i was hyped for.it was nice seeing carrie fisher one last time portray laya and when she was floating in darkness for that split second i was about to cry lol.. also it was nice to see lara dern playing of the fighters of the resistence and ths cute little birdies chewie adopted is funny even when theybug him while he tries to fly the ship. For a movke that was 2hrs 34 mins it had action all the way through with mmaybe like 5 or 10 mins to take a breath. As a hater of the new hope prequzl his movie was very refeshing and i hope to see the next chapter dont listen to the negitive reviews.
1259,6,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,So the story continues with another quest for the heroes. We pick up straight after the Force Awakens (2015) and follow the Resistance as they try to escape the First Order.
1260,9,"Going against the fans here, I feel so Sith","I am not a hardcore Star Wars fan, so it's as a non-fan that I say this is probably my favorite Star Wars movie to date!"
1261,6,This was not the Star Wars I was looking for but it's not a 1 star movie either,"After having 24 hours to process I've decided the movie is overall a good film, with second-to-none effects, great acting, nice action and funny humor. First of all, the plot does make sense. After reading hundreds of one star reviews it became apparent that many folks just don't pay attention to movies. Some reviewers didn't understand that Leia can use the force, for example. There are many more similar examples. Yes, there is some boring filler. Finn has no point other than to be a convenient source of knowledge about base and ship layouts. I am mostly disappointed in the choices made for most of the characters. It's like they followed all fan fiction and if someone suggested something, they wrote the opposite so that no one would be right. I kept waiting for a payoff that never came, at least not in a way that was satisfying. It was like doing work for a grandparent who promises you a nice treat as payment and they just give you a dime. You still got payed but it's disappointing and not what you were hoping for."
1262,9,The first half put me to sleep but the second half was just amazing!!!,I was worried Disney would ruin this franchise but I was wrong... it's slow to get started but once it does it is positively riveting. There are a few plot-holes and if you can see your way around those you will ultimately the movie.
1263,6,Unfortunately disappointing,"When I was five years old, my friends and me came by a garden with a big rabbit stall. What's that to do with Star Wars? Bear with me... I saw the rabbits in their little cages and was sure that they were about to be killed and eaten. So we decided to free them. We climbed the fence and opened the cage doors, then quickly flew the scene of our crime. We were caught later and informed that these animals were pets and not food and that our action had put their lifes in jeopardy. If only we had a grown up with us... but what is Poe's excuse (Spoiler warning!)?"
1264,1,Do you realize it now?!!,"I cannot believe it took this movie to make some people realize how much Disney doesn't care about the Star Wars franchise. This movie is terrible by every means possible, and does no justice to the fans or the original trilogy."
1265,8,A rip roaring space opera of a movie !,"This is an entertaining, rip-roaring, space opera of a movie. Not since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark or the first Star Wars series have I seen such an enjoyable Matinee style adventure movie. Some old favourites hand over to a new generation of Star Wars characters and we even see the Ewoks done right with the brief Porg scenes. The director is a fan and it shows through his care and attention to detail. I think that cinema history will judge this film much more kindly than some of the IMDB reviewers - the professional critics are right this time."
1266,6,Social Justice Wars: The Last Gentrification.,Ohh look we have a latino and an asian now !!
1267,1,They threw consistency and character development out of the window with this one,"With little to no training, Rey is on her way to becoming more powerful than any other character in the entire Star Wars universe."
1268,,Non Fanboy Non Paid Review,"I've seen many Negative Reviews on IMDB from Star Wars Fanboys, i don't think they broke Star wars with this movie as some claims, in fact they tried to avoid classic Star Wars clichés as much as possible.<br /><br />The Force is and always will be a fictional concept and so amplifying or introducing it to new features is not unreasonable within the context of star wars universe.<br /><br />Obviously there are parts that needed better work and seems rushed also i did expect to get background stories of certain characters but sadly it wasn't included However The cast and crew did a good job overall and i'm looking forward to the next movie.<br /><br />To the fanboys that gave this movie a 1 just stick to watching the classics don't take it out on this movie"
1269,9,"Heavy in theme this confident addition inspires a new perspective on the Star Wars saga, although it won't come without controversy.","I have many feelings about this film and I do not quite know how to arrange them or how they will evolve with time. It's a film that is dense with theme, legacy and character without drowning in them or looking backwards in order to find inspiration. If The Force Awakens was a celebration of what Star Wars was this one uses the legacy as a jumping off point to criticize, inspire and recontextualize parts of the Star Wars saga."
1270,7,"Not the movie we longed for, but ultimately fun to watch",People who are reviewing this movie with 6 stars and below are obvious spoilers or at least narrow-minded. This movie is quite entertaining and a visual masterpiece. Furthermore John Williams delivers another great movie score.
1271,10,Best of the best,This movie was a complete joy throughout. Don't listen to the nimrods who say it's terrible. Watch it and arrive at your own conclusion. Don't blindly accept opinions. Including this one.
1272,6,"Star Wars, TLJ - Missing Power","I think Luke Skywalker was undermined. Due to the sensitive nature and like qualities of Mark Hamill, I truly believe some of the decisions made about his character in this film undercut his strengths as an individual, an actor. The way the whole thing plays out almost makes a fool out of him and Skywalker. I think its a damn shame, too. The guy more than held his own in this film and i was impressed. In the first films he had this aloofness, a sense of being far away. And this suited him well. It also added depth, perhaps meaning to the films. His sensitivity would have been a powerful vehicle if his character was handled less sloppily here. The writing decisions here make him come off as weak, unsure, even a bit unstable. Its too big and bombastic for his natural way and what he can bring with that to the role of Luke. "
1273,10,Great Film,"Great Film. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I was thoroughly satisfied with this movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Great visuals and storyline. This is a must-see!"
1274,7,What did the writers do and who did the Editorial?,SPOILER ALERT!
1275,4,A thoroughly mediocre movie - might disappoint existing fans by targeting a broader and younger audience,Warning: This review contains significant spoilers.
1276,10,It has everything! Incredible and immersive!,"I laughed, I cried; I gasped, and cheered; I often sat on the edge of my seat. There were predictable moments which reverently honor the heart of the Star Wars saga, and altogether unpredictable moments where I was pleasantly surprised. I frequently had to pick my jaw up off of the floor after scenes in which I stared, mouth agape and eyes wide, taking in what unfolded before me (And one of the greatest lightsaber fight scenes of all time). There was old and new, and both served to make this an immersive and exciting experience. This movie made me feel like a child again, stepping into a world full of unknown creatures, characters, and circumstances, wishing I could be part of it."
1277,7,Nothing elsen then 10 Stars for a Star Wars movie means: It was disappointing,"...and it was disappointing. I wish i could say something else about this movie, but i can't. Don't get me wrong, for a star wars movie, it was just disappointing and sad, but as a stand alone movie it was watchable."
1278,1,The modern Red Guards continue to destroy culture,"A post modernist take on Star Wars, which makes Rey the equivalent of a toilet bowl in an art museum. Now we know what a feminist take on Star Wars is like, apparently its like Transformers, but that wouldn't be fair, the robots have more character than the souless husks of ""identity"" politics we see on screen here. They even brought in a pink hair for good measure, because woman strong! "
1279,,Solid for what it is,"I mean, pretty much a Star Wars film through and through. I'm shocked that it;s this film that fans are going crazy for. Ridiculous. Anyways, it's good. As others have said, I do think that it's more flawed than The Force Awakens, and sometimes a little more boring, but other times it's also more intense and exciting. Overall, it's pretty standard and pretty much on the same level as TFA. I don't see how people could get so passionate about their annoyance with it though. And it doesn't hold a candle to Blade Runner 2049 (not that it ever was going to)."
1280,10,A family tradition,"40 years ago when I was 11 going on 12, my Dad and I went to see a fascinating new movie called ""Star Wars"" at our local small-town cinema. I was dazzled. My father liked the use of holography in the special effects. It is a great memory. Everyone was talking about it."
1281,6,Not bad but still cringey !!!,"I mean the movie was okay i liked the graphics and the music too but the whole movie as a script was a disaster, i mean they're trying to start a new heros of the story and new main characters but unfortunately they failed so bad , the story as whole deserves 6/10 ... luke and han may never be replaced.. my advice watch the movie to complete the cinematic universe..."
1282,10,A Franchise Forever Changed,"There's truly nothing quite like the release of a new Star Wars film. And with The Last Jedi, the franchise is forever changed."
1283,7,It may not be great but it is the best ever Star Wars movie,"The thing about Star Wars movies is they have never been really great for people who are not childish in the way they appreciate movies. The three prequels are, in every way except the special effects, awful. They plot and dialog are so awful they make accomplished and talented actors look wooden and flat. The original three movies are better, but only the Empire Strikes Back has much that is either surprising or original in it. The Force Awakens is a better movie than the original series, but lacks originality. It is more like a competent remake than a great original work."
1284,8,Great movie if you are a new fan of Star Wars,Spoilers ahead..
1285,6,"Its starwars, always worth another star",Slowly being re-introduced to a starwars and taking us on a five year ....opps wrong universe
1286,1,A Disgrace,Too many things are wrog with this movie. It is such a ahame how the characters are treated. Rose sucks period. Nothing can save this movie nor save the franchise. Thanks George for selling us down the river.
1287,9,A piece of the puzzle,"See.. going into this I was very open minded. I knew Disney would change things, I knew they would twist around some things you wouldn't necessarily think would happen or wouldn't happen. So I'm open to this new world, new characters and plot. People are also mad because of questions not being answered? My idea is that we see things here.. certain circumstances and characters that are going to be much greater in the future. They showed that in The Force Awakens that Kylo was much weaker than Rey. In this film they showed that they are now equal when the lightsaber was broken in half. So what do you think? I loved Kylo and Luke's tension, it made the story ten times more intriguing. You also can't forget the lovable Fin doing what he does best. It's an epic movie over all. Very different but very close. I think there is so much more to this that we haven't got to see yet and we will soon."
1288,6,"Got to the finish line, but stumbled its way though.","Rian Johnson has made one of the most visually compelling Star Wars films in the series, though I really dislike the retro look in this trilogy. Sadly, the The Last Jedi spends the first two-thirds of its running time recycling material and clichés from Star Wats or other films-the rebels are still devising the same plan from earlier episodes, but with a new twist; the reluctant or disillusioned master (Luke) that refuses to train a younger apprentice, and so on. Having said that, Rey's interactions with Luke felt rather flat, and uninspired, and her connection with Kylo Ren was more of a plot device. The last 40+ minutes were thrilling and well executed. The thing is, Rey is not convincing as a Jedi, it's not Daisy Ridley's fault-she's up to the part-but the filmmakers fault."
1289,1,"""Oh Luke, Luke...still whining, Luke. Have you heard enough? I've had to listen to that for centuries.""","What in the heck happened to Star Wars?<br /><br />Having just now (yesterday) watched this mess, I can honestly say: ""I'm done with New Star Wars episodes."" Done, not interested any more.<br /><br />Let's see if I have this straight. Our new generation of Jedi can speak with each other waaay across space? Um, Jedi masters of the past had to use holographic projections, and even then the reception was limited.<br /><br />Jedi Training? Nope, not no more, I guess there's an app for that. No need to become one with the force with years of training and guidance from a Jedi Master. These days you do your own thing.<br /><br />Dark side? Nope. Not no more, the Dark side of the force is about as sinister as an unopened box of cookies. Where is the unbridled relentlessness for power?<br /><br />Every Jedi is omniscient. Problem is not one force wielding being good, or bad know what's really going on. Neither did I. Half time through this wreck I was asking, ""WHAT?""<br /><br />And the whining from every character, Jeeze! Whining Luke, Whining Kylo Ren, Stop it already.<br /><br />Nothing but disappointment have I for the failure and future of this franchise.<br /><br />The fight scenes were weak at best, and where was the awesome lightsaber duel from anyone? Don't even get me started on the forced humor. I was bland, not even grin worthy.<br /><br />I miss one Episode of Star Wars and every Jedi get delusions of grandeur. <br /><br />I put up with Jar Jar Binks annoying voice. I looked past the ""Enhanced versions"" of the Original three films, but The Last Jedi, is my LAST Star Wars film."
1290,,Best of the Sequel Trilogy,"The Last Jedi is THE most divisive Star Wars film to date. You either love it or you hate it. When I first watched this film in the cinema back in 2017, I wasn't sure how I felt about it. I really liked a lot of aspects of the film, and not so much with others. After watching it a second time, I decided that this movie was worth the second watch. I think this shifted the narrative in the right direction and took risks with its storytelling. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is magnificent! John Williams's score is great. The cinematography is beautiful! It has a lot of weak elements, but not enough to justify all the 1s. Definitely deserves an 8/10."
1291,8,Page Turners They Were Not,"When Yoda bonked an angry and destructive Luke on the head, laughed and told him that he missed him (while watching the last ancient Jedi texts burn) - I almost peed. I mean, the humor in this one worked so well for me."
1292,6,The beginning was promising,"The story started nice with good introducing action but everything disappeared with too long dialogues and slow sporadical action. It is is still better than episodes 1, 2 and 3, but I expected more."
1293,8,I Liked It and I Don't Like Star Wars Movies,"I am not a ""Star Wars"" fan. In fact, I didn't even know the name of this episode when I bought the ticket. Apparently it's ""The Last Jedi,"" but I'm guessing that that is a misleading title - no doubt there will be a ""Last Jedi Part Two."" Though I'm not a fan, I enjoyed this movie. I don't really know what fans get out of ""Star Wars"" that causes them to become fanatical, but I can tell you why I enjoyed this one. "
1294,7,Gets a bad rap,I personally felt this movie was in between the originals and prequels due to its flaws but i still enjoyed it. The movie pretty much cramped on things set us in the Force Unwakens but it still was a Star Wars story. It did some other things that are in books but made you question why now would be the first time we saw it. I feel Kylo and Rae have a relationship that is starting to build up and I'm the end will lead to good things so everyone just strap in for the ride.
1295,8,way different than expected,"Before starting to review Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I'd like to tell you about my expectations of the movie. Many People said from the beginning that Star Wars VIII will be pretty similar to Star Wars: The Imperium Strikes Back. I used to share the same expectation aslong I just saw both teaser and trailer. After watching the movie last night, I can say that some of my expectations are fullfilled. Even when I dislike Rian Johnson's script due to some unintelligibilities during the movie, I need to say that I got quite surprised by some incidents."
1296,7,"Another enjoyable, but underwhelming Star Wars","The movie is like the previous two Star Wars films released by Disney: Enjoyable, but underwhelming. No character is particularly interesting or worked out. The acting is overall mediocre. The plot feels like rehashes of previous Star Wars movie plots (pre-Disney). The story was continued, but when you think about what actually happened at the end of the movie, really not much has changed, and what did is not that interesting. There is good action, but it isn't a strong point in any way. There was some really great scenes and visuals, which also do great justice to the Star Wars vibe--I think this is the strong point of this movie. The movie felt crammed and artificially fast (which is funny considering how empty the movie feels). The movie was cheesy often, but there was some ""counter-stereotypical"" scenes which were fun. There was quite a bit of appreciated humor, but maybe a bit too much."
1297,5,Not for me,I loved Solo. Saying that so you know I don't just hate everything like so many people on here these days. Gone are the times when this was a forum for genuine criticism and thought. Now it's all just hate.
1298,8,Star wars episode 8 the last jedi,"Rey seeks to learn the ways of the Jedi under Luke Skywalker, its remaining member, to reinvigorate the Resistance's war against the First Order."
1299,6,Okay At Best,Although it has an overused Disney feel and an overwhelmingly familiar plot Rian Johnson still managed to put together an okay movie that can wow even the most analytical audience.
1300,3,Utter trash,Is leia indestructable????<br /><br />Are all the captains female????<br /><br />Why are all the men killed off????<br /><br />And luke skywalker!?!? I thought it was all about luke??? Not just to kill him off also!!!! And rey absolutely annoys me to death!!!! Is she unstoppable?!?!? Iv never seen such trash!!! What a way to ruin one of the best franchaises ever!!! I am totally done with starwars!!!!the vader days are long long gone in a galaxy far far away!!!!
1301,,Needs to be cut down by at least 2 hours,Just walked out of the midnight screening of this awful mess of a movie 20 minutes before the end. This movie is like when you order a sd card and you receive a huge box full of packaging with the item you ordered hiding in a corner.<br /><br />80% of the scenes have no relevance to the main plot.
1302,8,It´s a solid Star Wars flick. WHO exactly are you agressive haters?,"No really,I´m curious. I was born in in 1978,kinda grew up with these films and by now I am a handsome but still somewhat old (42) man. As a kid I was mesmerized and a bit obsessed with these films,I loved the first trilogy,concidered it the greatest movies ever....then I hit puberty,got laid and saw things a bit differently. Still,who are ya?"
1303,6,Could have been great,So many needless excursions into pointless sub stories. Leah flying through space with the force?! Luke descending into a depressed failure and a recluse?! This could have been an epic movie. Instead we were left disappointed.
1304,8,A fun and impressive movie for a Friday evening,Greetings from Lithuania.
1305,7,a new hope for star wars to change and adapt,"No it is not as good as a New Hope or Empire Strikes back, but it doesn't take away from the original stories or previous lore. Rian Johnsons direction is impeccable and although his dialogue needed slight help the movie still pushes boundaries of what Star Wars could be.<br /><br />It throws away any expectations and fan theories to create an emotional and deep character and action driven film like the originals did. It changes things with tone and lore like empire did, and keeps mysterious characters mysterious just like in the original trilogy. yes it lacks closure, but that has never been a bad thing in cinema. It leaves so much for us, the fans, to speculate and question.<br /><br />This is more than a star wars movie. Its a great movie (not as good as Empire) that takes star wars into a new direction for the new generation.<br /><br />I did need to watch it twice (i saw it 3 times on the first day!) to adapt and accept some things but once i did i fell in love."
1306,9,The last jedi-a beutiful epic,"A stuning epic that is full of twists and the best light saber fight ever (the one when they fight snoke's red guards) not perfect but new and original and alot better then the force awakens(6/10) and even better then return of the jedi(8/10) and the entire prequel trilogy (1/10), this movie is hated because of a conspiracy made by the russians not because it isn't good."
1307,7,It was fun day at cinema,"Although I have been awake from the early morning an it was late in the night by the time i got to the dark of movie theater I had no problem being awake once movie started. There is plenty of action and it looks good. A lot of red color (the Pretorians, the planet's surface, for example) visually sharpen the scenes. Luke Skywalker came back with style, so did Yoda. Spacecrafts in the space continue to behave like planes on Earth, but I'm used to it by now. Adam Driver still looks more like pissed tennage nerd than the embodiment of evil and power, but Kylo / Ben has become a full-fledged character and his relationship with Rey is one of more interesting part of the movie. To summarize it's a movie that I will love to watch again."
1308,3,Hi all Tow Mater fans,"Bizarre concoction of Star Wars + Marvel Movies + SyFy Channel + Disney Movies. Everything but Star Wars. THE LAST JEDI (Such a grand title) should have been grand. This movie is made for the fans of Dory, Nemo, Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater. No serious Star Wars fan should tolerate this insult to intellect. I'm rating it 3 stars just because the director made luke skywalker happy by having him drink that green milk squirting out of the mammary glands of the lounging dinosaur."
1309,9,New Beginning of fight against dark forces for GenNext,Go back to 1977 when Mark Hamill was our teen hero as Luke Skywalker whose journey as teen to a Jedi is scripted in subsequent sequels as we grew up.Today as I watch the latest -'Star Wars the Last Jedi' film with my son in 2017 at age of 56 I almost feel what Luke must be feeling interacting with young Rye who is not at all blue blooded but a child almost sold off by less gifted parents.Still she shows the will power to face the brute dark forces and takes over the mantle of the Last Jedi.The film is a new revelation which will hopefully lead to new sequels as the old from my generations are wiped off or disappear giving the fight against the dark forces to gennext. Visually this was superb with 3D viewing and great sound reverberating in better theaters we have today.Those who find some faults are reading too much or too little in the magnum opus.All those who have never seen SW just go and watch the stretch of Imagination that made our youth and George Lucas!My son enjoyed it all- right from first movie till this last which seems to us both as new beginning.
1310,7,One of the best films of the year.,"Going through the reviews, I see an unfair bias against the film. I understand that there is a lot of reverence for the lore that was estabilished by it's predecessors. The previous film, The Force Awakens, came out of a place of nostalgia, and appeased fanboys, but majority of filmgoers found it to be too familiar, and too similiar to previous outings. This outing does the exact opposite, it strays far from the familiar, but yet, still fails to do some fan service by including Yoda (in a cameo), clearly it also fails to do this as many fans are calling for the head of Rian Johnson. What the film does well is self-conscious humor, instead of the over-serious tones of previous films, instead, actions are done which would seem out of place in any of the other films. Another point that has fans rabid is the fact that Luke Skywalker, and Yoda, seem to have a complete disdain for the Jedi faith. To me, this was refreshing, if the prior threat had been elimanated, then there clearly would have been no need for them any longer, or so I would reason. The last thing that will not appeal to fans is the fact that the helmuts have now come off, quite literally, they are no longer worn."
1311,2,Just flat out awful,I cannot comprehend what went through the director or the writer's minds when they pushed out this pathetic attempt of a Star Wars movie. To think they erased all those Star Wars novels to insert this garbage into the franchise as the new canon is baffling.
1312,,"Fabulous, love this latest instalment",28 December 2017
1313,10,Just amazing!!,"This movie, whoa!!! My second favourite movie of this decade sitting just below Andy Muschietti's adaptation of IT released earlier this year. Everything about it was amazing. The director really nailed this movie really well, the acting of the characters especially Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). They both deserve Oscars for this movie, great job! "
1314,6,For younger people,"Opening scene set the tone for the whole film. Too much awkward comedy and downright dumb dialog dropped points to almost zero. After that it got little better. <br /><br />Visuals were top notch and it seems they keep getting better. I only wish the stories would too. <br /><br />This movie like its predecessor has cool characters that don't really do anything or by doing make themselves much less cool. <br /><br />Plot was almost carbon-copy of Empire strikes back with minor alterations. Again, just like the previous film was copy of New hope.<br /><br />They also seem to come up with new Jedi powers for each movie that are never seen again. This really bothers me. And this is the 8th movie and we still don't know what the jedi or the force is and what you can do with it or what it means to be strong in the force or have a lot of midichlorians.Like if you have 100 force you cab lift 1 rock and with 1000 force it's 10 rocks."
1315,8,Good but not satisfying,"A good sequel but I must admit I preferred Episode VII, simply because it had the better and more exciting story. DOnt get me wrong this new installment of the legendary franchise is still a very good film but I thought the approach of Riann Johnson in regards of making it too comedic at time that it felt like a parody of its own was not always the right way to handle it. I know its good that it doesnt take itself too seriously but the problem is that in some parts it felt like a skit and in other parts it actually DID take itself very seriously so I did not really think the mix worked too well. But yeah that is basically the only beef I have with it. I missed more twists, a la ""Empire Strikes Back"" but I guess they may save those for the last part. I also wasnt sure about the fate of some characters they built up so well in the first part. But anyway, I don't want to get into too much detail as I don't want to spoil it (but to be honest there is not much too spoil). <br /><br />Acting wise it was fine. Mark Hamill did well and had some really good moments throughout the film. The way he played Luke Skywalker is very different to the way he did before and that was interesting. A great development and the film left him some room to even further develope it throughout. Daisy Ridley was all right, however some scenes were a bit exaggerated. Carrie Fisher was great, and not only because of the bittersweetness of her appearance but they really gave her something to do here, unlike in Episode VII. Adam Driver was possibly the best of the cast, still at times monotone but mysterious and very twisted. I liked it. He also expressed the dilemma of his character excellently. Oscar Isaac more and more developes into Han Solo. John Boyega was tolerable. I really don't like Domhnall Gleeson in that series. Horrible performance. <br /><br />Good new addition of Laura Dern who also had a great character. Benicio Del Toro was great, I just wished has role had more significant. <br /><br />There is another thing that bugged me, it relates too much to the old films like the scenarios repeat themselves, there is nothing original nothing shocking. The structure is the same like an never-ending story. J.J. Abrams film could come over that, I hope he can do it again."
1316,7,Satisfying like fast food,"Good, but not great. If you have any scientific background, you'll very often be forced out of your suspension of disbelief by the story's frequent ignorance of the laws of gravity, the reality regarding transmission of sound in a vacuum, its disregard for how a battle environment would be under constant surveillance, etc. Still, the movie is satisfying in the same way that fast food will kill hunger. <br /><br />It's well acted, fast paced, and visually arresting. but lacks the depth of a good meal. Still, I recommend seeing it on a big screen rather than waiting for the streaming or DVD versions to become available."
1317,8,Have No Clue Why Bad Reviews-Great Flick,"Have no idea why in the heck there are any bad reviews here. This movie imo was great, epic in scope, and lays the groundwork for much more 'epicness' in the final film in this trilogy...What Luke does at the end was imo one of the greatest displays of Jedi power ever in ANY star wars movie...The way they explained how the force works and what it is goes along so well with todays current theories on energy etc so it made it so much more believable to me than anyother explanation (like episodes 1,2,3 lol that was dumb) I honestly cant think of anything that makes this movie deserve a bad rating or flack from fans. The CGI was great, acting great, plot was good (maybe not great but good enough to deserve higher ratings than wut many are giving it) and that ending...WOW imo! lol Cant get over that ending part with Luke lol..Amazing! 8/10..Not perfect, not 10 worthy, but def atleast 8 worthy"
1318,7,It is not a star wars anymore,What can I say what you really don't heard from anyone else?
1319,1,Complete TRASH.,"This simply does not exist in the star wars universe. It felt like a nightmare Luke had which he very quickly woke up from. Let's use that story to remove these from star wars history. Bad acting, bad storyline. WEAK WANNA BE DARTH VADER. HA! And rise of Who?! TRASH!"
1320,8,"It's Not the Same, But It's Fine.","I walked out of the cinema feeling amazed, because I felt like there were climax after climax after climaxes in the movie. The comedy parts were on point, the characters were on point (not all, but I like how they were presented), though there were some ""what the?"" moments, I could brush it off (I mean, come on... remember in the I to VI there were also moments when you're like, ""seriously, that's it?"" so why being harsh on this one)."
1321,7,A Movie about Women Schooling Men,Brilliant in terms of gender equality. Some great Comedy. All my long term Star Wars female friends cried. A pity it was Empire in reverse and there were a lot of wasted opportunities and cheese. Some editing choices that weren't the best but still empowering for Women. I recommend everyone see this.
1322,4,They should have just made a cartoon,"The storytelling and character development in The Last Jedi is worthy of a Saturday morning cartoon, not a big Disney movie. The best word to describe the people who were in charge of making this movie is ""incompetent"". "
1323,,Made in the spirit of the original trilogy,"This is the second star wars movie that I have seen in theaters, beginning with the force awakens. I am too young to know what it is like to watch the original trilogy in a real theater, but I enjoyed myself greatly seeing The Last Jedi with a large excited star wars crowd. "
1324,8,The Force is Mixed With This One,"Well it's finally here! The epic movie that television has bombarded us with for the last three months has finally appeared from light speed to grace us with another epic installment, or so we hope. Episode 8 has held the promise of the return of story telling, matching the epic lore of the originals told to hopefully breathe life in a series that has struggled. Rumors even say it surpasses Empire Strikes Back, the movie that holds the throne of Star Wars quality. Can this be true? Has the Force grown strong once more? Robbie K here to shed light on the rumors and hopefully provide some wisdom. Get Started, Let's!"
1325,7,"When I saw Yoda, I felt like leaving",Everything in this movie was a complete piece of crap including the scene with Yoda. Did they forget to CGI him? It looked like a freaking joke and that the director doesn't give a damn. In a Star Wars everyone wants to see a cool light saber fight and not useless stuff like Leia using the force and flying around like an idiot. The whole casino scene was completely useless and did nothing to advance the story. This movie made me hate characters like Finn because he did nothing but waste time in the movie.
1326,8,"An all around good movie, but harmed by some irrelevant sillyness, and endless hype.","Star Wars, Episode VIII is, all in all, an entertaining adventure, with good action, good performances, but somewhat tainted by some silly scenes and concepts. But, in general, emotionally, it's a movie that works creating interesting relationships between characters (at last, credible sexual tension in Star Wars since 1983!), good landscapes and action scenes, and went to places Star Wars never had gone before, such as the theme of ""dealing with failure"". Yes, it was present in ESB, but in this movie is more developed, perhaps not in a subtle way, but it's not a common theme in adventures."
1327,6,"Better than TFA, but still not what it should be.",Both this and TFA feels like two avarage blockbuster movies that completely ignore the legacy. It's STAR WARS! It could be amazing. But it's not. It's just... okay. And that's exactly why it's not okay. 
1328,10,Fanboys are the worst,"When Disney and Abrams restarted the Star Wars saga in 2015 with Force Awakens, they gave us a delicious, candy-like confection that gave us everything we loved about the space opera: adventure, earnestness, humor, and lots of space action. Now, with venerated filmmaker Johnson at the helm, Last Jedi is something decidedly-less immediately pleasing, though undoubtedly heartier. The nature of good-and-evil, the import of passing-time, the difficulties of truth. Sure, it's not quite revelatory, but it reaches for it...and is plenty of fun along the way.<br /><br />There's a whole lot going on here. Rey is being trained by Luke, and that stuff is great. Leia and Poe are trying to evade the First Order while leading the rebellion towards a new base, and that stuff is (mostly) great. Finn and newcomer Rose team up with an awesomely enigmatic codebreaker on a first-world planet, and that stuff is hit-and-miss. Kylo Ren struggles with his finding his place in a universe stuck in the past, and that stuff is transcendently fantastic. The design is beautiful, the cinematography is sweeping, the humor is strong and the fight scenes are among the best yet. It's all bold and kinetic and flawed and jagged and fun. In other words, a Star Wars film.<br /><br />Luckily, unlike the overstated claims that Force Awakens was just a nostalgic reboot, Last Jedi is very much its own beast, working in a mold while consistently finding ways to break it. Director Johnson has managed to walk into a money-making machine and put his personal imprint on it. Even if Last Jedi isn't quite as instantaneously satisfying, it thankfully moves the galaxy into new and meatier territory."
1329,6,Wanna cry!,"Disney turned one of my all-time favorite sagas into a wanna-cry nothing! I'm also both very sad and angry. For two and a half hour I was sitting in the chair and with every single minute I just wanted to cry out. Most intense on the scenes of porges and Lea Poppins. I'm not going to describe all the mind-blowing genius ideas that are already enough commented but will tell you how I feel after the premier... I feel like a was raped, robbed and recycled - like e complete piece of junk just as they did with the movie and our hope and memories. I feel offhandedly utilized for a couple of bucks. This piece of great dismantlement is directed by people that have no clue what Star Wars is, what this religion is, what lies at the heart of it. They are just some group of people lost by mistake in another studio and probably was going to shot another child comedy Disney production. R.I.P. Star Wars! :("
1330,2,misleading title,"The movie title is totally misleading. when you say ""the last jedi"" it makes people think either you start with 1 jedi or end up with 1 jedi. uh... that was not the case. there were 3 jedis to begin with and by the end 2 for sure - but possibly 3. so i don't get the title at all. and since there are still jedis, they'd probably make a start wars 9: more jedis. apart from that, the acting was quite blah... there was a big attempt to inject funny moments, some were somewhat successful but over half were meh - not just for me, the 7 other people i went to watch it with didn't laugh either. <br /><br />we got free movie premier tickets, that's why we went. i wouldn't pay for that movie, i'd feel really ripped off if i had."
1331,9,Embracing change while staying the same.,"With the possible exception of Rogue One, Star Wars movies were always made with kids in mind. We loved it as kids. Now the new movie is not ground breaking like the first (er, fourth) one, but it's still an entertaining movie. Could it have been better? Sure, almost anything can always be better. But it could have been a LOT worse. For the adult in me, sure, I can pick holes in the plot and see the Star Wars formula play out over again, but the kid in me still gets goosebumps from the opening crawl onwards, and there is enough tension to keep it exciting. Moreover, my kids loved it, and they are the target audience. Watching my son vibrate with excitement in the seat next to me was worth the price of admission alone."
1332,7,It's a Star Wars Movie!,"More of the same, and although a reasonable effort is made to develop the Star Wars story it is highly derivative. Despite that, it is watchable ."
1333,1,Garbage Movie,Way to ruin a great franchise.
1334,,Did George Lucas write this?,"Jar Jar deserves an Oscar compared to this. Soulless tripe of a bad comedy and poor action movie. I grew up watching the original trilogy which except for ESB haven't aged well. But TLJ is embarrassing. Disney, go stand in the corner and hang your head in shame."
1335,9,"Creative, energetic, and not what people expected","It upset a lot of people because it wasn't the movie Star Wars purists were expecting. Star Wars purists are quick to judge calling it cheesy or lame, but forget when Obi Wan literally ""force-talked"" to Luke after he died when Luke blew up the Death Star. Sorry it wasn't whatever ""cannon"" fan theory you were expecting but this movie had a lot of strengths. The origin of the blue milk was hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud when Luke was suckling that sea lion creatures teats. People want to blame the ""failure"" on Rian Johnson, but here's a wake-up call; you don't ""test"" someone with a billion dollar franchise. It was a collaborative effort between Disney, JJ abrams, Rian Johnson, and the thousands of people associated to make it the way it was. At very least it was interesting. To me it was genius. I knew it wasn't going to be the movie people wanted it to be when Luke tossed the light saber. People think that just because it wasn't the move they expected that must mean it's bad. It wasn't. It was a great film, and if you can't see past your own expectations then maybe you should stick to the prequels lest you encounter any change in your life. And for those who still blame Johnson, do a little research on his previous work and his fixation on a term called the ""fall-guy."""
1336,6,Merchandising megopolous!,"For a movie more than 2 hours in length, you would think they would move along the story more. Without adding spoilers... not a lot really happens in this movie. Oh, there are lots of fights and stuff blowing up, but to what end, I'm not sure. Plus, didn't it feel like it took Luke a lot of mentoring and training to hone even the basic Jedi skills? So how it that Rey has leap frogged so far into her skills and knowledge, with virtually no training? <br /><br />Also, Star Wars movies have always been ripe and fertile ground for merchandising. That's why the forced insertion of various characters (usually of the muppet like variety) seems like more of a money grab than adding to the story telling arch of the movie. <br /><br />Finally, what the Star Wars universe really seems to miss (besides actors over 5ft 5"" in height), is a bad guy with the gravitas of Darth Vader. The crew they have now wouldn't scare my bulldog, and he hides in the closet when the doorbell rings."
1337,9,See this movie for yourself. It's very entertaining and worth it,BIG SPOILERS. Don't read this review if you haven't seen the movie yet and don't want to know what happens.
1338,7,Time to let go of the old and embrace the new.,"I'm an old massive Star Wars fan. I grew up with the original movies, owned the toys, played the video games, growing up I wanted to be Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and the gang. I lived Star Wars."
1339,9,Probably the most divisive movie of all time!,I LOVE STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII-THE LAST JEDI!!!!! I do NOT understand the brutal hate this movie gets!!!! Is it perfect? No. What film is? Here are my pros and cons: 
1340,6,The Last Jedi - extreme subversion of expectation,The biggest problem with The Force Awakens was that it was too much like A New Hope. It was too predictable.
1341,2,But Which Is Which?,Which is the master and which is the apprentice sith that destroyed Star Wars and the saga of the Jedi and the force?
1342,10,Original,"Great, fresh, original story. Unexpected and moving."
1343,6,"Yes, YES, no, no, NOOOOO.","Let me qualify this review and say that I am an 'average' adult fan of Star Wars. I grew up with the movies (I was 7 when A New Hope was released) and had some of the toys back then. I haven't read any few books and haven't watched the animated series. I loved all of the first series of movies (except maybe the Ewoks) and I consider them classics. The 2nd set of movies were pretty bad, but I liked some aspects and consider Phantom Menace the best of that series. It's Star Wars, so it's still kinda cool still, right?"
1344,5,I wish someone could explain to me.,"They spend so much money for CGI and budget.<br /><br />Can someone honestly answer, why they don't hire some of the best writers in hollywood? They have the cash..<br /><br />Star Wars is a joke to them. RIP star wars"
1345,,Of Course it Is Cheap And Terrible,"It is produced by JJ Abrams. Enough said.<br /><br />having said that, the fat Asiatic girl is so terrible. She goes around and pretends she is important. Yeah, self-important.<br /><br />What does all of this have to do with Star Wars? Nothing.<br /><br />Disney and Bad Robot are dens of no-talent."
1346,9,The film made better by the test of time and The Rise of Skywalker.,"The Last Jedi is a movie that is considered the most divisive of the Star Wars films- a title that once belonged to the now-revered Empire Strikes Back. Without spoiling the next film in the trilogy, I can definitely attest to the fact that the first and last films of Episodes VII, VIII and IX definitely do a lot to elevate VIII in terms of quality."
1347,6,A Fun Movie To Watch But A Very Disappointing Star Wars Film!,"Star Wars The Last Jedi Is A Fine Movie With Great Visual Effects Great Acting,Things That Made This Movie Fun To Watch But Beyond That To A Star Wars Fan Eyes...Was A Disappointment.2 Years Have Passed Since The Force Awakens Was Released, 2 Years Of Anticipation And Theories About The Backstory Of Some Great Characters That The 7th Film In the franchise brought to us.<br /><br />The 7th Film Introduced Us To A Very Mysterious Villain Named Snoke Who Had corrupted Ben Solos Mind And Turned Him Into Kylo Ren...But Who Is He?Why Is He So Disfigured?Where Was He When Emperor Palpatine A.K.A Darth Sidious Was in Command?Could He Be His Master Darth Plagueis?Or His Brother Maybe?Or Son?Who Is He???The Answer Is....WHO CARES? He Dies at the Half of The Movie By Kylo Ren, This Mysterious Figure (Who Many Of Us Went To The Cinema Just To Satisfy Our Curiosity About Who He Is) Dies After Almost 20 Minutes Of Screen Time!But Dont Worry Because Dissapointment Doesnt Stop There. Another Character The Force Awakens Brought To Us Was Rey. Rey Had A Very Powerful And Mysterious Connection To The Force That Left Us Wondering About This Connection And Who Were Her Parents, Like Snoke Many Theories Were Out There Like Luke Is Her Father Or She Is Related To Obi-Wan Kenobi.The Answer About Reys Parents Was That Her Parents Were Junk Traders Who Sold Her. I Have Been Waiting 2 Years To Hear This...Really?Where Is The Plot Twist We All Hoped For? Unfortunately Disappointment Doesnt Stop Here.<br /><br />The Third And My Biggest Disappointment Of This Movie That Made Me So Frustrated Was...Luke Skywalkers Death...Yes He Dies.They Actually Kill The Star Of The Original Star Wars Movies On the Second Movie Of The Trilogy. Yes I Know That We all Believed That He is Going To Die But Not So Soon, I Thought Like Yoda He is Going To Die In The Third Movie Of The Trilogy Not So Soon And The Most Frustrating Thing Its The Way They Kill Him. When Luke Closes His Lightsaber In Front Of Kylo Ren You Are Sure That He is Going To Die (So Yoy Feel Sad about It), Then When Kylo Strikes Him You See That Luke Is Not Physically There And He Is Safe On His Island(So You Feel Happy About It), Then He Dies Because...I Dont Know He Was Spiritually Wounded Or Exhausted? That Made Me Angry Because What Was the Point Of Luke Not Being Physically There If He Is About To Die 2 Minutes Later...He Could Lift His X Wing From The Bottom Of The Sea (A Great Reference To Episode V When Luke Tries To Lift His X Wing) Fight Physically Kylo Ren And Die(He Could Use The Force To Dodge The Bullets...Chirrut Did It).<br /><br />Another Disappointment Was That There Was Not A Propper Lightsaber Duel. In EVERY Star Wars Movie We See A Jedi And A Sith Striking Each Other With Their Lightsabers. This Movie Doesnt Even Have That. Sure We See Them Killing Some Soldiers With The Lightsaber but Thats It. Even When We See Kylo Ren Vs Luke Skywalker There Is Not An Actuall Lightsaber Battle Because (As Mentioned Before) Luke Is Not Physically There, Is Just Kylo Ren Trying To Hit Luke And Luke Just Dodges His Attacks. This Movie Has Many More Disappointments Like Captain Phasmas Death (Another Character Who Died Too Soon And Without Any Character Development) And More. Of Course It Has Some Cool Stuff Like Great Visuals, Rey And Kylo Ren Working Together, Yodas Force Spirit Advising Luke Of What Is The Purpose Of A Teacher And Encourage Him, Leia Using The Force But These Are Not Enough Unfortunately To Save This Movie. <br /><br />In The End Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi Is A Fun Movie To Watch With Great Visuals And Plenty Of Cool Stuff But When You Exit The Cinema The Disappointments Are So Many That Make All These Nice Things....Forgetable!"
1348,9,"Too many bad reviews from people who didn't get ""their"" SW movie","A lot of people seem to be over reacting to TLJ , focusing much on what wasn't in the movie, rather than what was in it. Furthermore, many are complaining about the plot, and how ""poor"" it is - they are confusing plot with story. There is a story here, and characters arcs, and surprises. But as Luke says , it's (probably) not going to go the way you think. "
1349,6,Supreme Leader Who?,"Leaving the cinema after watching the Last Jedi, I was genuinely conflicted as to whether or not I enjoyed the film. In all fairness to Rian Johnson, he has carried the torch from J.J. Abrams with flying colours - with the feel and look of this new movie being constant with that of the Force Awakens. Despite this, along with the stunning visuals, epic fight scenes and (at times) brilliant character development, parts of the movie felt cheap and unfulfilling."
1350,10,So much unnecessary hate.. are you all siths?,"I loved this movie. Yes, the comedy felt off and the pacing was messed up. But the most hate this movie receives are illogical opinions because they lack the knowledge.<br /><br />Here's a few of them:"
1351,7,Negative Reviews everywhere,Its different... That's really all I need to say. People are hating on it because it doesn't copy the empire strikes back. Probably one of the best star wars movies.
1352,1,Social Justice Wars: The Last Snowflake,"I just finished watching this movie for the second time, and guess what? I hate it even more. "
1353,8,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi's force is strong, as a great story, great character arcs, and great action make this movie a true jedi","Ever since Disney bought the Star Wars franchise, a lot of consideration has been put together from the fans about whether the output of more content will make the popular series less special. It's safe to say that Star Wars is more then a fun space opera; it's a story that changed how Hollywood defines blockbusters. I've gone over this more in my Force Awakens review, but I mentioned that before Star Wars was made, most science fiction films were scene as fun little B movies that, while having an audience, didn't have a lot of respect when compared to classics like Citizen Kane and Ben Hur. Of course, things are different."
1354,7,All over the place.,"The only reason I give it a 7 is because is Star Wars and it will always have a soft spot in my heart. If it was something else I would have rated it much lower. The story was all over the place. Literally. It felt like I was watching a TV show where all the episodes were compiled into one part. The action was fine. Some good scenes and it seemed they tried to bank in on nostalgia too much. I understand it worked in the first movie and they did it properly in 'The Force Awakens' but it doesn't work so well here. The story for the characters felt out of place. The only thing I'm excited for after this movie is the next part which hopefully, they would do it right and have better characters and more action and a fresh story. The rating I gave for this movie would have gone WAAAAAY up if Rey actually joins the dark side. That would have been a really good twist."
1355,1,POINTLESS,"Was expecting an excellent and fully fleshed character development and history of the Snoke, Kylo Ren, Rey and the Knights of Ren, but alas none of these burning questions were answered - imagine the plot that could have been. instead, i got 2.5 hours of a cat and mouse chase of the rebellion and the first order. one word describes this movie - POINTLESS."
1356,,My Last Star War Movie,I cannot believe it. It is all the things bad in movies. Longer is not better. Slower is not more poignant. More explosions is not more excitement. This franchise is like watching an elderly relative deteriorate.
1357,9,OMG Amazing !!!,I loved this movie i have been a fan since 1977 when i saw Star Wars aged 7 years old.I really cant believe how much everybody is crying about The Last Jedi i loved it and the story was good and well put together great action all the way through Rey & Kylo worked well as the story moved on.<br /><br />Princess Leia:s performance was spot on as always.<br /><br />Snoke is dead long live supreme leader kylo super ace scene all round.
1358,7,The most original Star Wars film to date,Okay. People need to calm down and just breathe for a minute.
1359,8,How did it get only 7?,"It's a great, underrated Star Wars film. Sure, it's not as good as The Force Awakens, but it has a nice story and good action scenes which makes it worth a watch."
1360,7,A competently made film that is deeply misunderstood.,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is definitely a competently made film, attracted by a mountain high of controversy for its questionable characterization of certain iconic and favorable characters, plot structure, editorial pacing, and so on. But in my opinion, Rian Johnson did something that will very likely to please no one, and the review shows. On IMDB reviews in terms of helpfulness, nearly all of them are 1 star reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes audience rating, it is a staggering 50%, which effectively made it the lowest ranking Star Wars film based on such metric."
1361,9,My eyes and mind got a filmorgasm!,"Wow just wow! I remember seeing the original 1977 Star Wars in the cinema back in the good old days, It was just pure art at the highest level. Many days havs passed since then and i never thought the spark of star wars would return but i can finally say it finally returned 2017!"
1362,6,Mediocre and quite polarizing Star Wars experience,"This movie is by far my least favorite of the ""Disney"" Star Wars movies. It is in too many parts borderline idiotic in a way that it feels like ""Spaceballs 2"" - a SW parody...<br /><br />It is almost as bad as Episode III. I promised no spoilers, so I won't delve into details, but Ep 8 is worse than Ep 7."
1363,4,I understood what the director was trying to do...,I imagine it went something like this:
1364,10,Don't Believe The Negativity,"You know that old expression, ""don't make mountains out of molehills""? Suffice it to say, a vast majority of the harshly negative reviews of The Last Jedi present a whole mountain range of issues where only molehills exist. "
1365,6,"What were fans expecting, Empire?","WOW, it seems I'm giving one of the few better reviews. Ok so the script is certainly questionable; I'm not so sure Rian Johnson knows what the hell to do with Star Wars. That said, sometimes I wonder if other fans saw the same movie as I did, because I rather enjoyed this one after thinking it would be terrible. Not to mention I generally despise Hollywood overall. I think too many people went in expecting it to be as spectacular as Empire. It's just a movie and that's how it should be taken in."
1366,1,Complete car crash. .. Awful. SPOILERS... read them if you wish to save yourself.,"If you're a fan of the Star Wars saga who at least expects these new movies to stick to Star Wars lore that has gone before, then this will make you sick."
1367,,The Story of Hopelessness,"When an emo boy gives up on getting pretty chicks he decides to target ugly chicks. Wen ugly chicks don't respond to him he drops his toy/non-functional mask and whines. In a twist, an ugly (modern) Disney princess who refuses to be attractive, feminine or learn how to cook becomes interested in him and starts to stalk him. The said emo decides he will play hard to get, but not enough hard to get to turn on his privacy mode on his video chat app."
1368,9,The difficulty in making a Star Wars Movie,"The difficulty in making a Star Wars Movie is trying balance doing something new with giving fans what they expect. As I read other user reviews, it seems that they're mostly angry that the movie didn't do what they wanted it to do. They went in with such pre-defined expectations that they missed how well this movie was written."
1369,6,Very good!!,"The force awakens was just a modern injection of contemporary reflection. It served as a mechanism to reinvigorate the franchise. It was safe. It was a blockbuster and not a blockbuster Star Wars movie. It doesn't share what the original has or Indiana Jones, aliens, etc. What makes Star Wars is the movie magic, the escape. The last Jedi is back on that track. <br /><br /> It has the locales, the characters and it brings the environment alive. Watch and you see that rain makes the environment in which the characters live, move. He just adds so much detail, it deepens the viewers investment. That was the magic of the original. It was an escape and not just a movie. Sure the movie has some flaws, but everything does when you look hard enough. <br /><br /> This felt like the old days and not just for Disney's pockets. I'm glad Johnson is the new face of Star Wars."
1370,8,Surprisingly funny addition to this trilogy,"Never has a sequel to The Force Awakens been more eagerly anticipated as this one, if only for the answers to some questions. "
1371,6,Two movies in one!,"Almost 1,500 reviews at this point so I'm obviously most likely writing this for myself only, but that is ok as I feel a need to sort through the impressions. Just like with TFA there is a lot to like here, but there are also just like in TFA a painful amount of lost opportunities. First off, this movie was a wonderful experience, there is absolutely no doubt about that and the positives far outweighed the negatives. Having said that the negatives that were, were all related to the general story arc and unfortunately pretty significant. There also seem to be a general trend in Hollywood that we need more humor and self-depreciation in movies nowadays, which proved valuable in films like Ant-man, Deadpool and especially Guardians of the Galaxy, but which went for example completely overboard in Ragnarok, making it a painful slap-stick mess. In TLJ some jokes and gags add comic relief depending on timing, whereas others are just plain disrespectful to the franchise, such as the response Rey receives after giving Luke his light sable."
1372,9,Die hard Star Wars fans are the resistance. Disney is the New Order. I guess I'm a Storm Trooper I like this film.,"I am a writer and tell stories for a living and have since a little after the first Star Wars movie. I have learned to simply let a story be what it is instead of wishing it into something different. I love the humour in this film, the action. I love the development of good and evil, the subplots and the special affects. This notion that the business of Star Wars has to feed the hardline Star Wars fans begs a quote from Star Trek: the needs of the many far outweigh the needs of the few. Disney will keep developing Star Wars into the next generations not a Star Trek reference a fact. It's ironic that the die hard Star Wars fans are like the resistance and Disney has become the New Order. I guess I love this film because I appreciate it for what it is and not fight what it isn't."
1373,6,An Improvement From The Last.,"Undoubtedly lacking the right feel to what we would consider as a Star Wars film. The franchise definitely is not what it used to be, but it is heading the right direction (I use the term ""right direction"" very gingerly here). There were better character development throughout; although not from the characters you would hope to see them in. There was a sense of a huge disappointment in some character where I personally expected so much more. It definitely is quite far from being ""the best"" nor for it to be ""good"" but I would not say it is ""not worth watching"". I can not really say much without spoiling the movie; but rather I shall leave you fans out there with a simple remark or warning, take it in which way you see fit but May The Force Be With You."
1374,1,Didn't feel like a Star Wars film,This was without the usual class and gravity of a Star Wars film. Everything from Lukes 'comedy' to Snoke being pointless just felt wrong and hugely disappointing
1375,10,The Next to the Last,"When I heard that Disney was taking over LucasFilm - the thought that crossed my mind was: How are they going to continue the canon (storyline) of the biggest franchise in American Cinematic History? I answered that question myself: In one word: INCREDIBLE! Not the word that comes to mind when you have been a Star Wars fan for almost nearly a century and a half. <br /><br /> You know there is a little big of the light and the dark side in every one, but when you really think about it - it is so surreal to really fathom at the thought that this could be the last great franchise in cinematic history. I would have to say that, without a shadow of a doubt, that no matter where we are or what we are doing, Star Wars will live in all of us until we meet our destiny. <br /><br /> The Last Jedi raises too many emotions to really even write about due to the fact that we lost someone extremely special to us. Carrie Fisher, was by far the greatest actress of the last few centuries and even decades. Her legacy and her name will never be forgotten even if and when Star Wars is no more. So I guess, this is more of a tribute than a movie review, because in so many words you can't even describe how this movie has moved and touched all of us. <br /><br /> I mean, come on, there is no way, that I could even begin to describe how The Last Jedi was, in so few words, incredible and amazing. But I know for a fact, that J.J. Abrams is going to do a hell of a job incorporating the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy and tie everything together for Episode IX (9). <br /><br /> I have loved every minute of this franchise. To be quite honest, I was not a fan in the very beginning, but a good friend of mine got me hooked, and now I am hooked for life."
1376,7,An excellent 2 1/2 hours of entertainment,"Please, do not pay attention to all the whiny reviews. This is a GREAT movie if you are not into sticking plot lines. The action is top notch, the characters are all believable. Well worth taking time out to go see, especially at this time of year when you get sick of all the Holiday movies on TV."
1377,2,What even is this?,After watching The Force Awakens and Rogue One I was reasonably excited. Whilst they both had alot of fan service and didnt really rely on any original plot I was excited for what was to come and hoped Rian Johnson would stick to key elements of the star wars universe and guess what he ruined it.
1378,,This movie is hot garbage,Please Disney powers that be make the next movie a lifeboat for the franchise. Luke wakes up and the entire last movie was just a nightmare. Anything from there plotwise will be an improvement.
1379,8,Ignore The Disinformation,Never in my experience have I come across a more concerted disinformation campaign by a small core of obsessive fans.
1380,7,Too much of magic to handle,"The movie starts up slowly and with every next scene it's more tiring to watch in. In the movie even with a few lesson from Skywalker, the girl could do all the force manipulation with ease. I mean this impracticality follows throughout the movie.<br /><br />Yet I gave it a 7 for all the technical aspects and the future of the star wars is all set and I will be waiting for it."
1381,10,The last jedi review,"The Best Star Wars movie so far. I don't know why everyone thinks Disney is ruining the Franchise. The movie answered a lot of questions and the special affects, the action, and story is amazing."
1382,6,It's alright tbh.,"It's fun. Star Wars is fun. The characters are pretty fun. Sure, the Finn and Rose sideplot was pretty weird, but other than that? The movie engaged me enough to not bore me like the prequels did (first two specifically)."
1383,10,Star Wars has evolved - some fans haven't,I didn't really like Star Wars when I was an 11 year old kid when it came out. I thought Close Encounters was better. But over time I have become an enthusiast for the whole saga - including the prequels.
1384,6,An Idealistic Crusade,"The Last Jedi is well directed and thematically strong. There are some great moments I like that many might disagree with such as: Luke tossing the saber over his shoulder & Rey's revelation of being a nobody. From afar, I appreciate Rian Johnson's ambitious undertaking. Up close it can feel disconnected."
1385,2,Why,"Is Boyega in this movie, or in Star Wars at all? Crappy actor with a crappy attitude. Makes all his private statements more or less dealing about race. It's not about race in, it's how good you perform at work, and he's bad at it! Hamill is also not a good for the record."
1386,10,Better than the original trilogy. Compelling new trilogy.,It's great that they killed off Han and Luke to make room for the more interesting new characters of Rey and Finn.
1387,7,Godspeed? Seriously?,"I love the Star Wars universe. I can easily overlook most of the criticisms from high-maintenance fans but when Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo utters the words 'godspeed' I cringed like never before! The singlemost inappropriate, out of context line in any Star Wars film ever. It made Jar Jar Binks look like creative genius. They may as well have said 'Like, you do the math' while Miley Cyrus played on the radio. It's so embarrassingly out of place for non-Americans and everyone else in the universe that the writer should be fired and then tortured by made to watch Michael Bay movies on repeat. Other than that the movie was friggin awesome!"
1388,1,I still lose sleep over this,"I still lose sleep over how mad this movie made me. I actually stayed up, 10 minutes after I meant to go to bed, venting to my husband about what's wrong with this movie, and proceeded to stay up another 20 minutes after that fuming. So much potential, options, and freedom to take this movie in exciting directions of the Star Wars universe that was wasted to teach modern day lessons. Sadly resulting in a shell of a movie with no lore, emotion, or investment in characters or plot. I didn't think this movie would actually affect how I felt about other Star Wars movies, until I finished watching the original trilogy and found myself genuinely sad because I knew where the story would eventually be going, and how my favorite characters would end up. I won't be boycotting the new series yet, as I want to see where JJ Abrams will take the final chapter, but you can put money on me NEVER watching a Rain Johnson film, of any kind, ever again."
1389,,Just When you thought No One Can Be As Bad As Jar Jar Abrams,Disney finds another fool to compete for the title of worst director around.<br /><br />This proves that these (alleged) scripts are pre-approved by the treasury department at Disney and handed to no-talent yes-man (alleged) directors to film.
1390,8,Salt is not sand or snow...,I was focusing my attention for most of this viewing.
1391,6,I can go scene by scene saying what I don't like,I can go scene by scene saying what I don't like. 
1392,8,"The First Order Strikes Back, but not in the way you may expect","Over the years I have written several reviews, and adapted almost each of them one or two times over the years, because I find that how I experience a movie can change from year to year, and even from day to day. I am quite envious of people who can grasp a movie in one sitting, because that is something that rarely happens with me. Having seen The Last Jedi on its opening day, I am pretty certain that I am going to revisit it a few times, and that my opinion (and that of many other fans) will probably change over the years."
1393,7,Wow!,"So I went out to the movies to see this on Tuesday, 12/19/17.<br /><br />I watched the movie before this one and found it helpful knowing the back story. I have seen the older generation Star Wars and liked how this one followed the story. I am not going to write too many details because there are MANY spoilers. But It ended how I wanted it to. It still didn't connect a few deaths for me though, which was a bummer. All in all, the graphics to the movie, the flawless character acting, helped out the movie tremendously!"
1394,8,A Soon-To-Be Controversial Product From the Disney Machine,"Love or hate Disney and the direction they have taken with all of your beloved childhood favorites (or Lord, what are they going to do to The Simpsons?!?!!?), they are the company everyone else is looking up to. They have 5 of the 10 highest-grossing movies in cinema history, the highest-grossing American film of all-time, and in the year 2017 own 4 of the 10 most successful films globally-and this is with Star Wars and perhaps even Coco making its way towards the top. They have their crap figured out in an era where Hollywood is struggling to go up against indie cinema, Netflix, digital streaming, and the YouTube generation of sheer creativity, incredible access to the past, and overanalyzation."
1395,7,The Worst thing about this movie is the fans,"This film is fine, I can understand why some people don't like it I really do but 1 star, really. <br /><br />JJ Abrams set up a Star Wars trilogy with no idea what the answers to some of the big questions were (who Rey's parents are, Who is Snoke, etc) can you blame Rian Johnson for taking the movie in a different direction.<br /><br />Out of everything we've seen in Star Wars over the years this movie was probably the most unique, different messages, new sets new ideas the fact that The Firce Awakens was rejected because it was too similar and The Last Jedi was rejected because it was too different is ridiculous. Not every film has to fit YOUR ideals, and just because it was a bit different doesn't make it bad.<br /><br />Out of all the complaints I've heard not one really comments on the overall plot structure or character arcs, new ways to use the force, new themes and character development that actually impacts the plot were all achieved in this movie."
1396,3,Unbelievable,"I've gone page through page and barely managed to find a review that rated it above 3, which is I believe what this movie deserved considering good effects and average acting. But the writing boi is it bad. Considering do many negative comments I can't believe that this movie menages to sit on 7.1 making usage of bots obvious."
1397,9,Viewers Will Appreciate it in Time,"I watched this movie late (as a true star wars fan, three weeks is pretty late) and it wasn't the kind of movie I was hoping for, in a good way."
1398,7,Great movie for people who like movies- maybe not so much for true Star Wars fans,"Honestly, everyone is being really pissy about this movie. As someone who has seen all of the previous Star Wars movies but isn't necessarily a die hard fan, I enjoyed the movie. There were plot twists and turns that you don't normally see in typical Star Wars films, which are usually pretty predictable. The film is visually stunning, so if you're in the mood to just look at something pretty, this is the movie for you. Star Wars fans are upset about this movie because it breaks away from the norms you see in traditional movies (with some beloved characters becoming.... less beloved), but for people who appreciate interesting plots and in general just decently made films, this is a pretty good movie. "
1399,1,Poor in so many ways.,I disliked TLJ when I watched it at the cinema on opening day but like many I gave it another shot but things only got worse. Here's what bugs me the most but I'll miss out the stuff that's been mentioned lots of times.<br /><br />1. Admiral Ackbar given a poor death. Why didn't he fly the suicide run at The Supremacy instead of a purple haired Laura Dern. 
1400,,A (Jedi) Master Piece,"I've watched The Last Jedi 3 times and going through fourth, and I definitely won't stop there. It just gets me every time. I either laugh, or cry or watch in awe to the sight and sound that's laid before my eyes."
1401,9,Fixes most of episode 7's mess,"The Last Jedi did not have to do much to be an improvement over ""the force awakens"" - it pretty much accomplished that goal when someone other than JJ Abrams wrote the script.<br /><br />But still, the improvement is great, and in no small part this is due to the film's not-so-subtle criticism over its predecessor: For example, early on, Kylo Ren is chastised for being just a silly guy in a mask who got beaten by a girl who had never used a lightsaber, addressing (at least in part) one of the many ridiculous points of tFA. Then the film pokes fun at tFA's last scene (and some other plot points). But more importantly, it has 2-3 major twists that seem to be direct refutations of what Abrams wanted to do with the story - I mean, perhaps these were planned all along, but I somehow doubt that master-copycat JarJar Abrams intended to have Snoke die so quickly, easily and ingloriously. I doubt he intended for Ray to really be a nobody from nowhere. The latter is a really good choice, the former can be criticised to a degree (we learn next to nothing about who this extremely powerful Sith is, where he came from, etc), but it is a bold decision: it says enough with the master-apprentice Sith duos, we have seen more than our fair share of those. It is suprising, it is interesting, it is a bold step, and I can't help but applaud it."
1402,6,"My God, People","Before I lay into the fanbase of this franchise, or at least the ones who post reviews on this site, let me give my fresh-from-the-theater impression of this movie."
1403,10,I loved this film!,"I have finally got around to watching The Last Jedi. I'm a 44 year old man who has always loved Star Wars.<br /><br />I thought this film was exciting, funny, touching and an excellent tribute to Carrie.<br /><br />I watched it on Sky Cinema but, having seen it, I'll now be buying the Blue Ray to watch it over and over,<br /><br />I just loved every minute."
1404,7,2nd viewing - It was good!!!,SPOILERS 
1405,10,One of the best addition to the Star Wars lore.,"Regardless of the crying and moaning of the fanboys/girls who are just too connected with the VERY old films, and the trolls/haters hate comments, this movie is really good. Personally, I prefer this movie to the others. Most probably all the kids crying didn't get the god damn obvious message the movie was hinting throughout its entirety. Like come on.. You don't like the development of powers on numerous characters etc. but you love Luke kicking air, Bobba falling in the pit like a cartoon and the cringy alien songs? Really? LOLZ"
1406,7,"Still well made and fun to watch, but the feminism is annoying","All current pushing of women into military just doesn't cut it for me.<br /><br />It was the first Star Wars where I cheered against the resistance.<br /><br />Lots of inconsistencies. A lieutenant just talks to an admiral as if she is a manager in a company after a meeting.<br /><br />The general of resistance ""Leila"" blames the lieutenant for the destruction of ships that are not under his command at all.<br /><br />Leila looks like Madam President :)<br /><br />They all look stupid and really lack a punch.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Luke Skywalker acting, there would be pretty much no real man in the movie to watch."
1407,1,The Last Jedi's real villain is Rian Johnson,"THE GOOD:<br /><br />The special effects were amazing, as usual."
1408,9,Expecting the worst.,"Just rewatched TFA and TLJ before I watched this film for the first time. I still enjoyed the nostalgia of the A New Hope remake that was The Force Awakens. I reassessed the The Last Jedi, as quite an enjoyable film that felt the most unique of the final trilogy."
1409,7,I Will Destroy Her. And You. And All Of It.,"Giving this movie a fair evaluation is quite difficult. It's Star Wars; I want to love it, but to ignore the flaws based on that nostalgia would be absurd. I wanted shock value and the unexpected; I got just that, but not in the feel-good way in which I had anticipated. "
1410,4,Too political and a lot of rushed characters,"Well, this movie was a little too controversial. Many of the characters were poorly developed or underused. Phasma for example, who only appeared for 4 minutes total. Seriously, it took me a couple minutes to figure out that i was watching a star wars movie, not a comedy advertisement."
1411,,If The Force Awakens Did Not turn you off Star Wars...,... this will.
1412,8,The Star Wars movie that is going to divide the fanbase,"I am a big Star Wars fan, who watched all the movies multiple times. The expectation for this movie was set high after ""The Force Awakens"". That movie took the safe route and looked a lot like ""A New Hope"" building up the beginning for the next Star Wars trilogy on tested ground."
1413,7,"The ""Fans"" are Wrong. Incredible Experience!","The ""Fans"":<br /><br />I would first like to state that you should skip any reviews that begin with ""as a HUGE Star Wars Fan..."" These people are the ones who limit Star Wars to the original trilogy and blast anything that is different (or even when its the same: TFA) They take pride in being fans, and feel cheated whenever others enjoy something in the same universe under a different name. For some reason they believe that withing a whole galaxy in a different universe, only 3 movies can shed light on its true form, when in reality Star Wars is a living thing now. It grows, evolves, changes. It is like our own world, but a hell of a lot cooler. "
1414,8,The Star Wars movie that is going to divide the fanbase,"I'm a big Star Wars fan, who watched all the movies multiple times. The expectation for this movie was set high after ""The Force Awakens"". That movie took the safe route and looked a lot like ""A New Hope"" building up the beginning for the next Star Wars trilogy on tested ground."
1415,6,A Decent but Lacking Film,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an okay film, but it is not a great film. It has scenes that are amazing, boring, and terrible. The entire story with Rose and Finn is worthless. It adds NOTHING! This was such a terrible waste of time that made many of the fans angry with the entire franchise. The death of snoke was a disgrace. He was brought up to be powerful and mighty and dies in such a boring way. Luke's death was dignified. I liked his death, but his character ark throughout the entire movie was not what he was remembered as in the original series. The opening scenes that starts with a prank call ruined the mood. The lightspeed death scene was awesome and beautifully shot. Leia's mary poppins act was awful. The acting was decent. Rose was a terrible character. Kylo Ren was given more backstory and Adam Driver did well as him. The shirtless scene was worthless, though. Rey was alright in the movie, but it seems as if they want to leave her best performance for the last movie."
1416,8,Truly enjoyed this movie. Where are all these bad reviews coming from?,"Ok the movie wasnt perfect. It was a little slow in the middle. And there is one part with Leia I though was cheesy. But other than that, I loved this movie. "
1417,6,somewhat disappointed,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) is a futuristic fantasy adventure movie, about the Resistance rebels defending against the First Order rebels. Usually I wait to watch movies after reading about the opinion of people, but this time I've felt I'd watch it anyway, no matter what they say, and I didn't want to make the experience worse by hearing spoilers. It's a visually nice movie, with great action scenes, without any substantial story or logic behind it. I was somewhat disappointed by the film, but even I have to admit that Disney keeps the stories very even in quality."
1418,1,"""You're Breaking My Heart. You're Going Down A Path I Can't Follow.""","The character of Luke Skywalker is so clearly developed in the original trilogy. He shows up to help his friends and family when in need, no matter what and at any cost. He repeatedly makes selfless, morally sound decisions. He sees goodness in people when nobody else does, even in Darth Vader. To now portray him as a cynical, sarcastic, grumpy old hermit who had it cross his mind to murder his nephew in his sleep (he sensed darkness!) and then isolate himself on an island ""to die"" and avoid cleaning up the mess he made of his nephew makes no sense, even with the flashback explanation given. "
1419,8,Loved this MOVIE! LUKE SKYWALKER!!!!!,"Great acting, great action. Slow in the middle but that happens. Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisey Ridley were great as was the whole cast. The movie ws not perfect but I thought it was better than TFA. Not sure where list this in the series but I will have to watch it again."
1420,7,Not bad for a person that has never seen an Star Wars movie.,The movie was not bad as everyone says. maybe is because people hate this since they watch all the Star Wars movies. I have never seen an Star Wars movie ever. So i find this okay. There were some good scenes like when Luke Skywalker fights Kylo Ren and when Rey fights with Kylo Ren. and yes. i can agree that it was confusing me everything whne i first watch this movie. My score for this movie is 7/10.
1421,1,Fans will hate my review,"""Star Wars"" fans will never admit when a film is terrible. They will still defend ""The Phantom Menace"" and they will also defend this film. Now ""The Last Jedi"" is not as bad as ""The Phantom Menace"" but its not ""Much Better""."
1422,,"Dumbest plot in a long, long time? No, There is no plot!",This erratic and meaningless 'sequel' is an obvious and blatant attempt by remake/reboot experts Disney to bring a film to the screens and bolster revenue. Nothing more and nothing else.
1423,8,"Another (entertaining) ""remake"" with some confusing elements","Do you remember the Hoth initial scene? It's here... and the battle between Luke and Vader, ending with the death of the the Emperor? Also here... and Luke training in Dagobah with Yoda (who didn't want to train him in the first place and had contact with a force ghost)? That's right there. Chasing a damaged ship? Check..."
1424,7,IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS - THERE IS STILL ONE MORE MOVIE (Minor spoilers),"For goodness sake, I think it's silly to expect the Last Jedi to answer every one of the Force Awakens questions. Ignore people who say that this movie did not cover these topics - they certainly did. "
1425,8,Not born in San Diego,"More than some people I enjoyed this movie. Lived the action and story telling. However, those of you fans here read he was born in San Diego? I'm sorry to say it's false. He was born in Fontana."
1426,7,Absolutely STUNNING (No spoilers),"My goodness, what's with the hatred of this movie? It was great! Yes, there were traumatizing parts - Luke's and Kylo's behavior, and some parts of the story-line lacked spark (Finn and Rose) but the plot twists are great. Expect the unexpected!"
1427,8,The Best,Probably the best Star Wars film by going to the dark places with the proper seriousness. But it's the parts where it tries to cater to the fanboys where it loses its strength and still they are not satisfied.
1428,6,"Is it good? yes, no and maybe","This movie is MUST to be seen in 3d Imax, otherwise it will be a total disaster. Why? Well, because it fails in places where it tries to be original, like whole ""Rey-Kylo"" long distance romance, or Benicio Del Toro character line. But when it sticks to the original movies plot-it is really good. Luke playing Kenobi's part is a brilliant twist, or ""nearly identical"" to the Darth Vader/Sidius/Luke scene with Snoke, Rey and Kylo. And ""Last supper"" scene on the last frame with Leya and Rey-is a nice little touch. Also ""easter eggs"" are all around the movie, like Poe's ""I know"" respond to Rey.<br /><br />Visually it is very eye pleasing, dynamic and well produced movie, but some plot holes, rushed ending and other little things are keeping it from being brilliant overall. So 6 stars would be enough. And it is a pity, that it will be not remembered for 40 more years...."
1429,1,WHAT WAS THAT!!!,STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI is what you call milking the cow when there is no more milk to give.
1430,10,Bad reviews are false! Fake news!,"This movie is not bad at all. Yes, the movie has minor issues such as pacing and ignores key plot point from The Force Awakens, but it's still an enjoyable and fun entry in the Star Wars series. I guarantee those unanswered questions from TFA will be answered in episode 9. TLJ is its own thing and doesn't rely on TFA to be good. "
1431,6,A marginal star wars movie,"This movie was at best okay. At least they did not blow up another death star, but this title does not do anything to further the story or scope of this trilogy. It is a disappointment. Rogue One has been the only original content with good writing so far. The current group of people definitely knows how to cast and do special effects, but writing a genuinely good script is not in their bag of tricks. You would think when Disney paid billions for the franchise they would hire better writers to protect their investment. At least Darth Emo is a bit better this time around."
1432,1,Fake Stars....!,Above 8 stars? Really?
1433,,This is what happens in a right-wing conservative capitalist society,"They need to keep making and remaking and rebooting and sequelizing and making money by dishing out rubbish even though there is no call for the movies, there is no story and no reason for any of this crap."
1434,9,A fresh new direction for the Star Wars pictures,"Star Wars Episode VIII is a very different film for the star wars franchise. It ditches some of the classic themes of good vs evil to tell a different story. The film once again focuses on Rey who wants to convince the older Luke Skywalker to join Leia and the Resistance, to fight the evil First Order and it's devilishly evil leader Snoke. At the same time, Leia and the rest of the Resistance, including Poe Dameron go through their own troubles while trying to flee from the First Order. The entire cast from Star Wars: The Force Awakens returns, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac and Carrie Fisher in her final film role. Mark Hamill has to singled out, his performance as the legendary Luke Skywalker is well, legendary. Luke is broken and fragile in this film. He has a very little sense for hope, something that angered many fans of the character. I think that this was a very brave move that turned many ideas about the franchise on its head. Daisy Ridley is also very good at showing the youth within her character. She is filled with hope and believes that with Luke's help they can win the fight against the First Order. Rey is very naive, something that a Mary Sue really isn't. What really surprised me about The Force Awakens was the treatment of Kylo Ren. This is continued in The Last Jedi. Kylo is treated like a main character, who has his flaws but who doesn't really come across as this evil. Kylo simply is a human being who made a decision, the line between good and evil seems to fade away. Carrie Fisher who thankfully received a much larger role in this film than she did in The Force Awakens, enlightens the screen with hope, beauty and joy. She simply gives the best performance of her entire career. Same thing can be said about Hamill. This film isn't entirely flawless. Without spoiling anything, the side plot involving Finn and the new character of Rose felt stretched out and almost pointless. The arc for Finn seems rehashed from The Force Awakens, which is unfortunate as this arc could've easily be given to his partner. Kelly Marie Tran's performance is good, however her character feels rushed. Same thing can be said about Vice Admiral Holdo, played by Laura Dern. Dern is a terrific actress, who is good in the film and the lesson she teaches is important however the way her character was written seemed a bit weak. So overall I really loved The Last Jedi. It did feel 30 minutes too long with the Finn and Rose story. However everything else involving Rey, Luke, Kylo and Poe was really interesting and it expanded the Star Wars lore. I think Star Wars fans need to let this film sink in more. After all, episode V was divisive for its originality however that is now seen as the best film in the series."
1435,6,J.J PLEASE COME BACK,"This movie was....fine. That's pretty much all I can say. It had all of the cool characters everybody loves acting their hearts out to a meaningless plot. Don't get me wrong. I was entertained, but the fact that Rian destroyed all the interesting plot points that J.J set up, made me feel heart broken."
1436,10,A stellar film that will stand the test of time.,"When it opened in 1980, the Empire Strikes Back was not the universal success that we now think of it as. Audiences were mixed, accusing it of being both too different from Star Wars and too similar to it. It was said that the film was too serious, and ""machine-made"". Many bemoaned that Empire and its creative team had missed the entire point of the original film. The final reveal of Luke's parentage by Darth Vader was not unanimously well received either, as many rightly pointed out that it contradicted the facts laid out in the previous film. While George Lucas wrote and directed the original Star Wars, he neither directed nor wrote the Empire Strikes Back. Much like some of the negative responses to TLJ, many who weren't expecting what ESB brought made a big stink about how they ""missed George"". But Irvin Kirshner, Leigh Brackett, and Lawrence Kasdan made a far better film than Lucas could have done. In case there was any doubt about that, he drove that truth home with the comparatively juvenile and disappointing Return of the Jedi (which saw Lucas regain creative control). <br /><br />Some warmed up to Empire soon after its controversial premiere, while others needed to see ROTJ to fully appreciate Empire for what it was. In any case, it's now generally considered the indisputable classic of the Star Wars franchise, while its sequel is largely seen as a disappointment. What a difference time makes. <br /><br />Now here we are in 2017, and similar things are being said of The Last Jedi. Like Empire, TLJ is a more complex and challenging film than its predecessor. As such, it will take time for some fans to come around. And, like Empire before it, The Last Jedi bucks many of the expectations that the audience had for it. You can witness the seething rage of those dashed fantheories in many of the negative reviews for the film currently on the web. Few discuss the film itself. They tend to complain about things external to the film (politics, racism, Disney's business practices, the fact that the film didn't incorporate the reviewer's fanfiction, how much the reviewer hates Rian Johnson's previous films, etc.). But those initial reactions are primarily an artifact of the time we're in. The movie has only been out for a few weeks now. When the dust settles - when the trolls get bored and go to complain about how Black Panther has too many non-white actors, and the fans come to grips with the curveballs that the film throws - The Last Jedi will be remembered as one of the great Star Wars films. <br /><br />The Last Jedi, like Empire, pushes the franchise into new territory. Some were angry about Rogue One for this or that reason, but it was mostly uncontroversial popcorn fare. We already knew that story. Similarly, we already knew where things would end up in the prequels. This is the first new territory for a Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. For once, we don't already know what happens to these characters. As such, many of the answers in the film will not be the ones people were imagining. But this is a film that will be remembered fondly for what it has done, rather than what is hasn't done (which has dominated much of the negative response so far). The things that it didn't do will fade, as always happens with sequels like this one. People no longer complain about the stuff that Empire didn't do (except Joss Whedon, who can't stop whining about the ending). When Empire was all potential, it could have been anything. Now that potential is gone, replaced with something real. Similarly, The Last Jedi must overcome not just the expectations of following up TFA, but of following the entire Star Wars saga. That's a whole lot of potential. It has 40 years of Star Wars nostalgia to reckon with, while also trying to chart new ground (something TFA didn't do much of, as it was mostly a nostalgia trip). That Rian Johnson manages to do that so well is not just impressive, but inspiring. <br /><br />As a lifelong Star Wars fan who remembers when the prequels hit the theaters, The Last Jedi is a treasure. It tells a new story that is familiar without being rote or tedious, and weaves characters both new and old throughout. The ingredients are recognizable, and the film is true to its universe, but they are rearranged in ways that keep things exciting. Every time TLJ looks like it's about to give us a carbon-copy of a scene from the original trilogy, it does something far more interesting instead. Luke Skywalker may be older and scruffier than you remember, but that's what 40 years will do to you - especially if you spend many of those years as a hermit on an uncharted planet. And he does right by his legend, even if it doesn't happen in the way some expected. Rian Johnson even does the impossible, making Kylo Ren (a.k.a. Ben Solo) into a sympathetic character while simultaneously forcing the audience to take him more seriously than ever before. And for the first time since the original trilogy, the struggle between Light and Dark actually seems like a real struggle, and not just a prolonged lesson in good and evil based on lines arbitrarily drawn in the sand. The failure to make Anakin's fall believable was the cardinal sin George Lucas committed in the prequel trilogy. There is more believable tension and inner conflict in Rey and Kylo in this film than Anakin had in all three prequels combined. And it makes this story far more compelling for it. <br /><br />This film will not give you everything that you expect. But if you're open to it, it will give you what you need. And in time, this film will stand alongside Empire as a science fiction classic."
1437,7,It's Fine.......But In Hope For A Rip Roaring Third Instalment,"I've just got back from watching the film at the tail end of it's theatrical run in the UK.<br /><br />My score of 7/10, is a reflection of how I feel about it."
1438,8,fantastic and gripping,Now i fully enjoyed this movie i watched with my younger brother and as a guy in his mid to late 20s i loved it and my brother being early pre teen he loved it too. Story was very gripping and shared a new light on the dark side of the force. We really got into it from start to finish the whole old lore re lived could'nt recommend this movie any more and its a good watch with family to. Loses some stars for the lack of charater deloplment on a few of the newer charaters thats a shame sadly but id still recommend.
1439,6,"Didnt fulfill its destiny, also better than tfa imo but yep","I was disappointed with The Force Awakens and I didn't have too much hype around The Last Jedi, but obviously I was still going to watch it and with all the great reviews I was excited. "
1440,3,Disappointment didn't end with the DVD purchase,Was impatiently waiting for the dvd release since I didn't go to the theater to see it but now I'm glad I saved my money. I was mad because the DVD and Blu Ray had to be purchased separately. They should have given them away. What a yawn fest. Where'd the excitement go? I'm 60 so Star Wars has been in my life a long time. And it's heartbreaking to see the franchise crash. I never expected the 70s versions but I wanted at least the entertainment. Kylo was the only Star Wars-like character sans the originals.
1441,9,What a film for this space opera saga!,"Currently being hailed by critics as the best 'Star Wars' film since 1980's ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Rian Johnson's latest film really brings the goods for the midpoint of the 'Star Wars' saga."
1442,6,I wonder how much the critics got to give this one good reviews?!,"I smell corruption. I watched the movie with about 7 friends, about 6 more watched it the day before and none of us thought it was good. Just to be clear, this is not a drunk, stupid, gang, we are all college graduates, PhD students and masters students, so its safe to say that we can be objective about this. We pretty much all agreed that the Kylo-Rey scenes were great, but the rest was pretty much garbage. The Finn-whatevershescalled story was pure filler and completely unnecessary, the jokes were brought in straight from the Marvel movies. The huge reveals were all worthless. Its a messed up movie. A new cut was never needed this much. Cut out an hour of filler, cut out a further 15 minutes of stupid jokes and you get a good movie. <br /><br />I almost sure the reviewers got paid off. I hope they are ashamed on top of their pile of money."
1443,3,Never been more disappointed!!!,"Wow, just wow!! So disappointed. All the characters they established were completely forgotten. Everyone was different then how they were set up in the Force Awakens. They wasted about 45 mins. with the most useless crap. Here's the problems with the movie. Rose is a useless character, Leia cam fly through space, Poe is rude and arrogant, Captain Phasma was around for 10 mins. at most, nobody knows who Snoke is, Rey cam use the force without training, Yoda is a psychotic ghost, Luke is now a jerk, and to top it all off half the characters you love don't even get to be in the spotlight for a full minute, much less a movie. This was depressing!"
1444,,Star Wars: Episode VII - 7.0,Act 1 - 7.0
1445,10,Pretty awesome.,I feel like a lot of the negative reviews here are written by the same person. They nearly all say the same thing in the same language. I've loved Star Wars since the very beginning (I even read the novelization!) and I found this one terrific. My whole family enjoyed it. I have no idea what people are talking about when they say this film destroys the legacy. Seems like people's expectations got in their way of enjoying a fine movie.
1446,7,Not among the best episodes,"It was like watching a 2.5 hour long Spanish Soap Opera with constant emotional turmoils during every single character arc. Most of them had a unsatisfied conclusion. Was expecting to see a shocking movie. And it was, for the most part - shockingly disappointing. Action scenes were great. Humor was brutal. Great performances By Hamill and del Toro."
1447,10,"Don't worry, Star Wars isn't ruined",I can't believe how much some people hate this movie. I am a long-time hardcore fan (and I really mean hardcore) and I just don't recognize either the Star Wars mythos or facts in most of the negative I read. 
1448,6,This could be viewed as the turning point of the franchise,"While I am not going to go so far as to say that The Last Jedi was a terrible movie, I do think it failed in basically every way to capitalize on what I thought was an extremely well done ""reboot"" of the series in the Force Awakens. Yes, JJ Abrams relied heavily on nostalgia and a near retelling of the original movie to bring us back to the universe far, far away, but he did it in a way that you KNEW he was honoring something that needed to be planted correctly after the near abominations that were the prequel movies. <br /><br />The idea that this was being marketed as the best movie since Empire is laughable. The tension of the Force Awakens is eradicated in mere minutes. The humor is cheap, jarring and unbefitting a saga which gave us the wit of Han Solo. The fantastic characters and their storylines from TFA are cheapened in a way that there were entire subplots that could have been dropped. There were miscasts, reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu. The handling of Luke's Grand re-entrance, while there were some savory moments, was at least a partial dud. The biggest flaw of all was the way that they kept playing with a plot twist that never materialized. <br /><br />This is obviously my own opinion. There are some redeeming qualities to the film such as the cinematography and some epic space battles (and Rey is always phenomenal). I still really appreciate the actors from TFA, even though I felt like they were done a disservice by the director. All-in-all, I am happy that JJ Abrams will be back to helm Episode 9. Star Wars needs him or it risks turning into what the Pirates of the Caribbean turned into; an epic parody of itself."
1449,8,Enjoyed and would recommend to a friend,"I thought this movie was excellent. I for one, am NOT really a sci fi fan."
1450,6,"Good, Lacking in areas","The story when approached from a movie-goer/non-""nerd"" POV is fine, good for a fun movie experience however when approached from certain nerd/geek POV's the storytelling maybe be lacking/leave the viewer wanting."
1451,3,Not the worst movie ever but I don't think I've ever hated or have been more angry at a movie,"Before we start, let's give some background on my view of Star Wars. I'm not one of thosr rude nostalgic-blinded disney hater SW fans. I adore the original trilogy and consider the 3 movies timeless classics, I'm a defender of the prequel trilogy (despite TPM and AOTC not being great) with ROTS being my favorite Star Wars movie, I enjoyed TFA despite its major flaws with the story and Rogue One was surprisingly great and just gets better the more I think about it. So, naturally, I was really excited to see where Disney would go from here. I could not wait to see these characters again and see them get developed but I was also hoping it'd solve the problems of TFA, trying something different instead of rehashing the same story."
1452,9,Star Wars is Back in Full Force,"Disney did the right thing to replace J.J. Abrams and bringing back the master George Lucas to show them how it's done right. Episode VIII is really good and Mark Hamill really pulls off his best acting. Luke Skywalker is awesome!! The crowd in the movie theater cheered when he dueled and beat Kylo Ren. I was satisfied with ""The Last Jedi"" as part of the big saga. I will not bore you with a detailed summary. There are a few noticeable problems. There is some prominent feminism in the scene involving women commanders. You can really feel the estrogen in the room and how these women were poorly chosen just to make Carrie Fisher look good. Back in the good old days Princess Leia was a tough character who was much more than just a doll face. Laura Dern is badly miscast as Vice Admiral Holdo. Her character is weak but she does what she can with the material that she was given. Other than that, this film is a super blast! Go and see it!!!"
1453,7,Better than the prequels at least.,"Mark Hamill did a fine job. Daisy Ridley was glowing in this movie. I'm glad they ditched Kylo Ren's ridiculous mask, and modified voice. Now to some minor gripes. Chewbacca should look older, maybe with some grey, not younger. I'm tired of necklaces coming off with a slight tug, just remove it from your head please. BB8 can use AI to hijack an AT but you must have a person in the chair to push a button to do lightspeed kamikaze? No droid can do that? And that's the first time anyone thought of that? ""Wait they're turning around, oh no they decided to destroy us by jumping into lightspeed straight through us, oh we never thought of that because no droid can do that and no one would sacrifice themselves to save the galaxy."""
1454,2,Rian Johnson seems to suffer from Amnesia,"At the beginning of the movie Rose says they must follow their responsibilities, duties and fight the evil First Order. However at the end of the movie, she stops Finn from doing the exact same thing and basically kills the whole movie with the whole ""Love conquers all cliche"" ."
1455,,"Say what you want, it's still a STAR WARS movie to me","For a movie that is considered the most anticipated movie of the year, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is leaving a lot of its viewers split down the middle. The same thing was said about THE FORCE AWAKENS when it came out. Say what you want about either of the movies, but just know that they are and always will be part of the Star Wars series. <br /><br /> In this case, we got entry number two in the new trilogy, episode eight, The Last Jedi. Picking up where we left off, the film ventures into Rey following her destiny alongside Luke Skywalker ( the LAST of the JEDI?) We also follow Leia Organa as she leads the Resistance against supreme leader Snoke and Kylo Ren's First Order. <br /><br /> Now, I'll admit that upon seeing The Force Awakens and seeing the trailer for The Last Jedi, that they would copy a lot from the original trilogy.Particularly, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. For example the AT-AT walkers make an appearance on a planet that's white, the main protagonist trains with an isolated jedi master, and other parts that are spoilers. So there may be similarities there, but does it work well? Yes, it does.<br /><br /> What I love about this new trilogy is that it allows a new generation of movie goers to experience the same fun that people in the 70s-80s got to feel when they saw the original trilogy in theaters. Luckily, the writers managed to put in some new ideas. The last jedi does have its moments that make it a Star Wars film. Yes, there are space battles, there are lightsabers being used in battles, and a ""i have a bad feeling about this"" saying. Let's be thankful that there are no scenes where people sit around and talk about politics. <br /><br /> I believe that every moment in the movie mattered, even the entire canto bight sequence. They kept the ball rolling through out the film and really developed the new characters of the series. Talk about letting old things die. <br /><br /> The Last Jedi continues to give Star Wars a good name and I can't waitfor episode nine."
1456,10,It's a shame so many old farts are terrified of change...,"This film is a layered tale truth, in it's many versions, and the ambiguity of morality. It shed's light on the fact that good people still inevitably end up being involved with bad people, and that clinging desperately to old traditions and beliefs can lead to failure and defeat. Just like how the Jedi need to end, the cling to the nostalgia of the Original Trilogy has to end in order for Star Wars to live on and succeed in telling good stories. "
1457,7,"I can't say that I don't like it, nor that I do","I have mixed feelings about this movie... during the first 1,5 hours I felt that this is the best SW film yet, but then something went very wrong. By the last half an hour the whole movie turned out to be an awful American romantic comedy style movie considering the script and the dialogues. I had the feeling that writers let the whole thing gone and stopped writing normal dialogues and they tried to be ironic, however the whole thing turned out to be something awful... like it was a Twilight or other awful young adult romantic fantastic drama.<br /><br />We left the cinema after a massive 2,5 hours without knowing more about the enemy and their aims... that was absolutely not working....<br /><br />However I really like the character of Kylo Ren and Adam Driver did an amazing job.<br /><br />Mixed feelings at all."
1458,10,Newer Hope,"To me, the theme of Star Wars cinema is hope. The first movie had it in the title, the 2016 film character Jyn offered, ""Rebellions are built on hope"", and to his credit Rian Johnson masterfully took hope to another level in The Last Jedi. His unpredictable plot and storyline elevated this story to the level of one of the greats, almost comparable to the caliber of Empire and Rogue. <br /><br />Seeing Luke once again in lightsaber battle was mesmerizing. The humour of Chewie and what I've been calling the gophers on the Falcon was actually humorous, like the dialogue of the droid K2 in Rogue One, removing the cheese from the humour of the earliest droids and the silliness of the non-humour of Jar-Jar. <br /><br />I would have scored this a 10, but I didn't find there was a scene that caused my adrenaline to race, such as in The Force Awakens, when Rei, engaged in battle with Kylo, becomes calm, embraces the Force, and becomes the stronger of the two combatants. <br /><br />One other element of script writing and realization by Rian Johnson that is worthy of mentioning is in relation to his ability to create flashbacks to earlier films in the mind of the viewer. There were those moments in The Last Jedi, and that Jedi-like ability is admirable."
1459,7,Rosy Retrospection - this is why no new star wars will ever live up to fans expectations,"I've been reading some of the ""criticism"" of the star wars episode 8... have you people watched 4-6? You may want to rewatch them with the same cynicism and I think you will find they have all the same plot holes, awkward acting moments, and bad ""science"". The movies have been and always will be space fantasy - they are just fun movies not philosophical masterpieces. They broke new ground at the time, hard for ANY new movie to do this now days as almost every conceivable movie plot has already been exploited. That being understood, I think they did a pretty darn good job"
1460,10,GET OVER IT PEOPLE,"Ever since when I was a kid, I loved watching all the Star Wars movies. This is one of them that I liked. Star Wars the force awakens was long over due for over thirty years. JJ Abrams brought a team of visual effects artists to create the spectacular vision of the Star Wars universe. Two years later, we get the exact same thing fro The Last Jedi. Even though that this is the longest of the Star Wars movies, I still think that this one comes out on top. The cast is terrific. I love those little porgs on Luke's hidden island. And this one has a great backstory for Rey as if she wants to find out a secret about her parents. The visuals are top notch with non-stop action. And yes of course, more of BB-8. I however have made my decision after watching this to defend all of the Star Wars movies (including this one)."
1461,6,Another good Star Wars film.,"The excitement built to a breaking point. Movie didn't disappoint on most level. It was fun, exciting, and funny at times. It's not the best Star Wars movie. While it has epic scenes and events, it not a grand story that Star Wars is known for. The whole movie covers just days, which puts stress on the pacing and story. Some jokes works and some were just disrespectful to the characters. Story line included scenes that reflected Return of the Jedi, Empire, and the Prequals. Some chances taken while giving us what we love about Star Wars. Overall a nice little movie."
1462,4,The last hope.... I've lost hope in anything quality coming from Star Wars,Episode VIII was unsurprisingly worse than Episode VII. I had little hope going into this and I left it having even less belief in this franchise.
1463,9,Simply don't understand the backlash,"It is important to preface this review by saying while I am a Star Wars fan, I'm a film fan first. The sheer negativity and hatred I have seen arise from this film was enough for me to type out a review on this site, and I rarely ever do that. The Last Jedi was a very good film and an even better Star Wars film. Yes, I can feel your anger, strike me down with your lightsaber. But after two viewings, I can definitively say that this movie was all that I wanted and more, even with notable flaws. <br /><br />Luke Skywalker's character arc:<br /><br />Many people when flocking to hate this film, bring up how Rian Johnson destroys what made Luke Skywalker so compelling in the Original trilogy. He, even for a brief moment, plans to kill Ben Solo when looking into his mind, chucks Anakin's lightsaber, after Rey hands him it, and wants to the Jedi to end, seemingly going against his character. <br /><br />Well on the first example let's look into Luke contemplating killing his nephew. In the Original trilogy, Luke throws aside his lightsaber when being forced (no pun intended) to kill his father. This is a moment people continuously bring up to discredit this film's depiction. But let's go back to that original scene. Luke, hiding in the shadows, hears Vader say, ""If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she (Leia) will"". At this moment Luke lashes at Vader, cutting off his arm, and putting his saber towards his father's neck. Had the Emperor not have come down his throne to taunt Luke, it would seem likely Luke would have killed his father. In Luke's character, he doesn't want the dark side to manifest in his friends and family anymore than it already has. Now let's look at the Last Jedi scene. Luke, as he mentions in narration had looked into Ben's mind for months to see his alignment, he saw darkness but tried to brush it off. With his dark dreams continuing, Luke knew the dark side had already taken effect on him, much like his father. In that moment, Luke, making the same hasty decision as he did in Return of the Jedi, ignited his lightsaber to put an end to the darkness, but he corrected himself in the same way as well. So in other words, it fits the character.<br /><br />Secondly, Luke throwing aside his father's lightsaber, was an effective way to communicate to the audience that Luke is done being a Jedi, it's a visual and even comic way to explain where he is in his life. Which leads me to the third problem people have with Luke, and that is his belief that the Jedi must end. In the originals, until the very end of Return of the Jedi, Luke was never a true Jedi. Most of them train from young ages, to even full on adulthood. Luke only had a year or so training from Yoda. He was just a boy, who never knew the full ways of the Jedi. After Yoda's death, the only means of his knowledge was learning from the sacred texts, not from a master (unless the force ghosts made regular appearances). This is a pivotal device in Luke's arc, as he is basing his entire belief system on old, non-page turning, books. This as well as the recent tragedy of Kylo Ren, was enough to push him into this way of thinking. He single-handedly destroyed his sister's family, and brought destruction, to the galaxy, it's no surprise he'd want to shut himself out. It isn't until Yoda returns (It's implied he hasn't returned to Luke in a while), who burns down the tree containing the texts, telling Luke that the Jedi are meant to evolve beyond the old Knights. He also tells him that his failure, is part of life, and to teach people how to go beyond that. Not being an all powerful Jedi, but telling others to move past their failures, by being a symbol of hope for the rebellion. Which is what Luke does in his last scene."
1464,6,A rather perplexing film.,"MAY HAVE SPOILERS, IF NOT ALREADY MENTIONED."
1465,2,Written by an accountant,"Bored actors playing boring characters on boring planets amble their way through a boring script, written by bored Disney accountants, sprinkled with boring CGI. A truly appalling piece of film-making."
1466,,"Cute, fun way to spend 2 hours","I'm going to go against the downward trend right now and give an overall positive review for this film. I actually enjoyed The Last Jedi, and that means a lot, because I can't stand most movies these days. "
1467,8,"Good entertainment, in parts bad Star Wars","Well, it is almost Impossible to match the sky-high expectations of a new Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi is good entertainment and it has epic moments. The Kylo\Rey relationship is developed well and provides some surprises.The space battles are enjoyable, especially in 3D, for example the attack of the Resistance bombers.<br /><br />However the plot is full of flaws and some characters are wasted.<br /><br />I don't want zu see a depressed Luke. This is Star Wars and shouldn't mirror daily life. I fully understand Mark Hamill's frustration. Skywalker deserved a better fate. Equally bizarre ist how Johnson handled Snoke.Abrams' TFA wasn't perfect but it gave us a new fascinating villain.For two years people speculated about his origin and how he fits into the Star Wars Universe.And then Johnson kills him off?! He should have talked to Gareth Edwards to learn how to treat this universe well .Instead he just gives fans a punch in the face.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed most of the movie. To give a film two stars I have to be bored and with all due respect to some of the previous writers this is totally exaggerated!"
1468,6,For diehard fans only,"The visuals were great but I just couldn't get over how ridiculous is the whole attitude towards time and space in this movie. <br /><br />1. People just jump on an off stars and galaxies like they go for the store for a carton of milk. Everything is instantaneous. Distance is meaningless.<br /><br />2. In the future we have robots doing everything but we still need a human to hold the wheel of every starship, from the smallest fighter to the largest cruiser. In one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie the rebels are leaving their cruiser but an Admiral ""has to stay and navigate the ship"" because...what? It will hit a tree or a mailbox if they left the wheel? <br /><br />3. Of course every battle has to be in eye range contact. Bombs are being dropped like it's WW2.<br /><br />4. Also: Kylo Ren or whtever his name is is as intimidating as your annoying Emo neighbor. Good villains are either murderous death machines like Hulk (if Hulk was a villain) or cold an calculated like most good villains out there. Kylo Ren is just so angry and emotional you just want to slap him."
1469,10,Johnson hyperspace jumps the space opera to bold new terrain,"The most passionate fans among us are treating this like how Empire was treated following the smooth, tightly structured self-contained A New Hope. It's divisive. The Empire Strikes Back was, too, originally for some of the same reasons. "
1470,7,Star Wars: The Last Jedi...I really wanted to like it,"SPOILER FREE VERSION: I really wanted to like this movie. There are some very good bits in it. I thought they did a nice job adding to the Star Wars lore, but the movie was really gimmicky and heavy handed. A lot of people liked it and I am happy for them. I personally felt it was a bit much. The movie is growing on me a bit, but it did not live up to my expectations."
1471,9,Deserves to be Seen Twice,I think when we look back in ten years- this movie will get the respect it deserves. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a film that paves its own path. It makes choices that you won't be expecting. It's fresh- original- and is taking our characters to places they have never been before (thankfully). 
1472,6,Don't listen to the haters; it's really good,"Just a heads up: The Last Jedi is quite long. In fact, it's approximately 2 and a half hours long. That's neither good nor bad; I'm just stating a fact."
1473,1,The worst Star Wars! Ever!,I waited until I watched at home again about six months after being disappointed in the theater hoping maybe I missed something. Maybe I was tired that night or something. Maybe my expectations were to high. Nope. The movie was just the worst Star Wars ever made. TFA was good not great but got ride of the bad aftertaste of the prequels. The movies were back on the right trace. Rogue One was incredible. Maybe the best Star Wars movies ever except Empire. Then this movie. There are thousands of reviews that will go into more depth than me but here's my main reasons why I think it's the worst. 
1474,9,Let me grab my popcorn real quick...,"...I did enjoy the show so far. I mean, not really, since it was filled with rather annoying screaming and flailing from the collective hivemind of manbabies out there, but hey. At least I'm very late to the party, so it has quieted down a bit."
1475,7,The Hate Behind this Film is stupid,"I believe that this is the best Star Wars movie.This is coming from someone who is not a fan of Star Wars I loved the Fan service and the ending was good and wrapped up Luke's story Nicely.Though the writing is sometimes boring and honestly I never liked the fact that they killed Harrison Ford but Carrie Fisher still remained(I say this because she's dead in real life).The things I hate about the film the most is that the pacing is slow and the 2 plots switch way to often.The Pacing starts off fast with a high chase Space scene though then almost Nothing happens for most of the film until actual Charcter development happened which doesn't happen until around the second act.Speaking off which the two plots in the film are destroying a Bad spaceship belonging to the villains and Rey learning from Luke.I feel that the plot switch way to often and we can't really appreciate each individual scene.But the thing I truly hate about this movie is the hate behind it.Some people say this film is better than the Prequels.THE PREQUELS,which even though I don't like Star Wars were absolutely TERRIBBLE movies.My final thoughts on the film are Check it out if you want but if your not a big Star Wars fan then I recommend staying away from it."
1476,1,Impressive achievement.,"This is the movie that killed Star Wars. Absolutely decimated established characters by taking a left turn into the nearest star, simply for shock value."
1477,,Skywalker Supremacy,"Director Rian Johnson, known for ""Looper"" (2012), fully committing himself for ""The Last Jedi"" in writing the script and directing on and off set; additionally bringing on board cinematographer and editor in order to create an extraordinary ""Star Wars"" movie, rooting deep into Japanese mythology, especially with the sequences on Luke Skywalker's exiling island."
1478,8,A decent instalment,So I wasn't a big fan of force awakens despite its great cast and stunning visuals it just felt very femiliar to me the last Jedi however does not and is in my opinion one of the rare sequels that is better than its original it's picks up right where force awakens left off it follows the rebellions ongoing war again the first order ray on an island asking for Luke's help and being trained and fin is of on a side mission with new character rose while kyloRen/Ben is stil off trying to deustroy what remain of them rebellion the film has some unexspexted comedic value and in my opinion a great performance from Hamil as well as some great twist in plot and the same brilliant visuals as it's predocseor over all it's fun well written and more original and in a way breaks away from Star Wars formiler providing us with something fun funny visual dazzling eye candy with a great story and cast In my opinion not everyone will enjoy it as a movie however it is also my opinion that some fans just hate it because it didn't forfil their fan theory's plus your fan theory's are just that theory's
1479,6,A failure on multiple levels,"The parallels with TLJ and ESB are mercifully less than the AFW's copy & paste substitution of ANH. Luke Skywalker is at a low point, as much a disappointment to the new trilogy heroine Rey as fans of the original trilogy. This is no honorable handing over of the baton to the next generation of Jedi."
1480,8,"Don't expect great, it's good, but Rogue One was great, not this.","So I had to to see this twice to fully appreciate anything about it. <br /><br />When I first saw it on opening night in 3D (NOTE: don't bother with the 3D). I thought it was weak. Just like with The Force Awakens the hype is not lived up to. It's not great it's just good and I'm expecting it to be great. It starts off OK, but then the second act is too long and scattered. Your expecting Empire Strikes Back, because we know it's the second in the new trilogy. It tries to be episode five without trying to be episode five, and in the process, too many stories are developing at once (and it's too much). We need to concentrate on ex-storm trooper finn's buffoonery, as his attempts to run away like a coward from the first order leads him on a mission with a new character, Rose to a part of the Star Wars universe we don't see that much, the land of the rich and the powerful. While Poe and Leia Organa are having conflict on how to handle the first order when the rebels are out matched by a first order destroyer. Meanwhile we also have to focus on Rey trying to become a Jedi, by a Luke Skywalker who seems uninterested in the idea all together (Now I see what Mark Hamill is talking about how he did not like what they did to Luke, it was not the guy I was expecting at all). To top it off, how Kylo Ren is integrated into the Last Jedi part of the movie so much it makes it a story on it's own to have to concentrate on. Then the last part of the movie reminds me of Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King so much, that even though it's a great part of the movie , I could not wait till it was over.<br /><br />The second time I saw it, I did like it...Slightly better. The Disney version of Star Wars is a little too humorous, and that humor was annoying the first time I saw it, but more amusing the second time. Yet still, the humor fells like it was inserted into the film (possibly to insure a two billion dollar net like VII by appealing to international fans). You could have easily taken a lot of it out and still made a good movie that was not as long. This was a problem for the movie. We know it's not the end, we know we have another movie that will technically end the Disney Trilogy. Yet whenever you felt that it was time for the credits to roll the film kept going. It was like it was trying to over compensate for the lackluster ending in the greatest film of the Star Wars franchise, by having dozens of them.<br /><br />That's my long (unending) opinion. It's good, but it's not great. I don't want to see it a billion times , I'm happy to see it twice. I'm sure this will not stop anyone from going to see it, It's just a warning to keep your expectations down, and hope it will seem better than I'm making it out to be. So I'll just end this by saying, so far, Rogue One was the best of the Disney era star wars films."
1481,6,Was that really Luke Skywalker I was watching?,Its now been over a week since I viewed The Last Jedi and its still playing in my mind - as much for its misfires as its good points. Kind of shows how much Star Wars has ingrained itself in our psyche I guess.
1482,10,"Awesome Movie, restored my faith in Star Wars","Beautiful and amazing, has genuine heart and surprised me in several places. The Force Awakens, Rogue One and the The Last Jedi have restored my faith in Star Wars after the terrible prequels."
1483,6,"Not Terrible, Not Great","This movie feels like it had a lot of potential. There are so many instances where I can see where Rian Johnson was going and what he was intending to do, but so much of it just fell flat for me. There are plenty of interesting concepts and themes, but it's like Rian didn't know how to translate them to the screen in a way that flowed naturally or melded with the rest of the saga."
1484,2,Trash.,I gave 1/10 because 0 is not an option.
1485,9,IMDB SW fans... are you kidding me?,"Bottom line SW:TLJ is the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi - and it isn't even close. The writing/directing is light years ahead of the last 5 SW films - probably closest to being on par with the quality of Return of the Jedi, just without the ewoks."
1486,6,Better than The Force Awakens,"I'm a lifelong fan of the Star Wars franchise, and an even bigger fan of Luke Skywalker so this was a fun watch for me.<br /><br />(I was always a Luke girl, and was quite upset when it was revealed Leia was his sister...I wanted Leia to wind up with Luke, not the scoundrel Han Solo!)<br /><br />Luke's badass move at the end of this movie reminded me a bit of Return of the Jedi, when he shows up at Jabba's all calm and collected, knowing he's going to take the place down.<br /><br />Although I have to say, I was disappointed in Rey. She missed a big opportunity to take over the galaxy by turning down Kylo Ren. He would've been putty in her hands. But that's the difference between a girl and a woman I suppose. A woman would've been like ""Sure, I'll rule the galaxy with you"" knowing all the while he'd be her little lovesick puppy while she ruled the galaxy."
1487,1,Pretend it's not canon,"Where to begin... Kylo Ren is supposed to be our Darth Vader but when he took off his mask in the first movie there were very audible laughs in my cinema... because he looks like a loser, nobody can take him seriously. He's been training under Luke freaking Skywalker and Snoke yet he is nearly beaten by a traitorous stormtrooper and he IS beaten by a chick who has never even held a lightsaber before."
1488,,Worst Barf To Hit The Planet Since....,.... Jar Jar Abrams' The Farce Awakens.
1489,10,The Best of Starwars !,The Best of Starwar saga and I love it !
1490,6,Meh.,"It has good aspects, it has bad aspects. If you took Phantom Menace and took out Jar Jar Binks, Phantom Menace and Last Jedi would be about equal. It has a few appropriately Star Wars scenes, but also really idiotic plot holes you could drive a Star Destroyer through. The problem with bringing someone in to ""reimagine"" things is that they may largely miss the point and do some bone-headed things - you know, like Johnson did. Worth seeing once, but maybe not much more than that. Too bad, because Force Awakens set things up for a terrific sequel. This just isn't it."
1491,8,Decently Neutral Review for Average People,"Definitely better than every prequel combined, unless we're laughing AT them."
1492,7,Good film but it could have been better,"The film was good and established a good balance between action and reflection, but I think it could have had more action.<br /><br />Good music and special effects.<br /><br />The deficiencies of the plot were compensated to a certain extent by the talent of the actors .<br /><br />I agree with most of the criticism against Disney.<br /><br />The film would have been better with the direction of George Lucas."
1493,8,Excellent Star Wars movie!,"I am stunned to see all of the bad reviews here. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Excellent writing and the best performances we've seen from Hamill and Fisher since ANH. Director Rian Johnson took risks that paid off big time. I was pleasantly surprised several times. It's unpredictable, it's ballsy, and it's in the top 3 SW movies for me."
1494,6,"Star Wars is dead, long live Star Wars","I loved Star Wars, I liked The Last Jedi. "
1495,1,This movie was such a waste,Every 10 minutes someone is having an emotional crisis whinging about how difficult things are for them. Please bring back the old Star Wars where nobody had time to feel sorry for themselves.
1496,10,Perfect sci fi by JJ Abrams,"Dear readers, Star Wars in my country Indonesia is always be a legend. Since 1980s, Indonesian children love Star Wars. In this Last Jedi movie, I can feel the sense of perfection of sci fi movie by the sci fi director legend, JJ Abrams. I follow Star Wars since my childhood and also watched his other movies and series such as Star Trek and Fringe, so for me the Last Jedi is just perfect. The effect, sound, story plot, characters, ending, etc, there is no small mistake that I can found, nor I can criticize. Thank you JJ Abrams for making this Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie in my mature age that I can still feel of being Star Wars movie again and again. I can not imagine when Star Wars is not longer directed by JJ Abrams, it is like American history without Abraham Lincoln or World War II history without Adolf Hitler. Love this movie!! For the story plot, sometimes for those who do not follow the beginnning, might be asking, ""who is this girl?"", ""what is her role?"", but after focusing on the core of the story, each character comeback to their own role and audience will applause of what they did really unpredictedly in each scene. This implies also for the history of the ship, galaxy, superpower force, Might the Force be with you, then to watch this Last Jedi movie for about 2,5 hours with unending emotion after. Bravoooo"
1497,6,Fundamentally flawed but not all bad,Looks beautiful and the action is good but the plot is fundamentally flawed
1498,4,Perhaps the most disappointing chapter of the saga,"It's not that this movie is bad from a production standpoint. The cinematography is actually very good. But, when producers wish to make a sequel, and more so add a chapter to a legendary series, they have to accept that certain character points are non-negotiable."
1499,,political wrong,Don't guess I'll see this one. They are trying to make a political statement
1500,8,A satisfying film but some scenes are a tad drawn out.,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Cranky nuns look after the ancient Jedi buildings on the island Luke retired to (reminded me of primary school). Rey drives them to distraction with her attempts to reinvigorate Luke, to get him to take up his Light Sabre in defence of The Republic. Luke is rusticated, his daily routine consists of kamikaze style fishing and drinking milk fresh from a dino/seacow. Just like a typical hermit. Oh, and he also haunted is by the ghost of Yoda."
1501,6,Star Wars for Millenials,"As a Star Wars fan, I really wanted to like this film but there are just too many problems. In the E.U., Luke is the strongest Jedi the universe has ever seen but in TLJ he is depicted as a coward and a quitter. Once he finally does something halfway cool, he dies from exhaustion. The entire plot of the movie makes no sense as all the First Order has to do is send a few ships ahead of the rebellion convoy, via light speed. to cut them off. The entire plot line with Fin and the Asian girl added nothing to the movie and basically could have been left on the editing room floor. We waited two years to find out who Snoke was and they kill him quickly, without any explanation of his backstory. This is the powerful nemesis we've been postulating about? Oh, and Rey is a nobody from nowhere. I get what the director was trying to do, the Force resides in everyone and can be expressed anywhere, not just in the Star War legacy family lines...I just felt there was so much more opportunity here that has now gone wasted. BTW, not one mention of the Knights of Ren? It's as if this director forgot there were a previous move (Force Awakens) that he was supposed to tie into.<br /><br />There are some cool scenes but the movie jumps from one scene to the other so quickly that the viewer doesn't have time to absorb it fully. It's like this movie was created for an ADD kid, the Millennial generation. Also, there is a lot of misplaced humor, inserted into serious scenes inappropriately, and then just ignored for the remained of the scene. IMHO, this is sign of an inexperienced director that was not ready for such an undertaking. I grew up on the original trilogy and this is no longer the Star Wars that I recognize."
1502,9,Excellent!,I know I'm not supposed to like this movie but I really do! It has really grown on me and is now in my top 5 of best Star Wars movies.
1503,6,This is a good film!,"This movie has gotten a lot of hate and negativity. I understand to an extent but at the same time, i found that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There's ups & downs, some charecter development and some good excitement. Some cons of the movie were that there should have been more lightsaber action, it felt lacking and also Snoke was a joke but overall this was an enjoyable film, my guess is the final chapter to this trilogy will be the best one!!"
1504,10,BEST STAR WARS MOVIE YET!!! WHY THE BACKLASH??!!,"I can't believe all of the backlash for this movie on this site. I thought this was the one of the best Star Wars movies, if not, ""the best"". The acting was superb and the movie aesthetics were incredible. The plot, along with all of the sub-plots, made the climax and the ending of this movie epic! And sot since Empire Strikes and Return of the Jedi have we seen a Star Wars movie with some great and intense emotions in it. Finally, we have Star Wars actors that can produce real tears in ""convincing"" emotional scenes. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are great actors that portray their characters beautifully with deep and convincing emotions. This saga really centers on them two and I think it is fantastic. Their scenes together are some of the best in all of Star Wars, and that climatic sequence towards the end in Snoke's chambers was amazing - never before has that happened in Star Wars before, making it just unbelievable. And how the movie ended with Luke was fantastic as well. **SPOILERS AHEAD** Luke projected himself on a remote planet (Crait, which by the way is the best planet ever created in Star Wars) to confront the Kylo Ren because he was doing what Yoda taught him in Empire Strikes Back, and that is ""a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."" I'd say Luke did that against Kylo Ren better than any Jedi in all of Star Wars! The only other Jedi that ever came close to fighting the enemy in that fashion was when old Ben Kenobi fought Vader in a New Hope...and he became one with the force after too! You also have Rose saying to Finn a few sequences before the Luke and Kylo scene that ""we will win by not fighting with hate but saving with love"". Luke didn't fight Ben Solo with hate (at all actually), so maybe that is Luke's first step in trying to save Ben's soul...maybe Luke's Force Ghost connects with Ben Solo on a spiritual level in Episode 9 to help turn him back to the Light Side? Episode 8 was a great second act in what has been a great new Star Wars trilogy so far. Episode 9 is shaping up to be the most epic Star Wars yet with everything dependent on what happens between Rey and Ben Solo! How someone can watch The Last Jedi, and not ""like it"", is mind boggling. Even if die hard Star Wars fans don't like Luke's character and/or how the Force was used, the film still deserves at least a 3 out of 5 stars for great acting, movie aesthetics, character development, creativity, intriguing story, and fantastic emotional and action sequences!"
1505,7,Not sure if genius or crap,I have never been more confused about how I felt about a movie than after watching this one. I know I feel strongly enough about it that it's either complete garbage or else a really great film.
1506,1,Star Wars is ruined,Absolutely the worst experience ever. I remember how magical the very 1st Star Wars was. Disney's Star Wars are disgusting. It's a shame what's happened to Star Wars. Not worth watching. Written by amateurs and directed by idiots.
1507,10,Ignore the haters!,Bananas! I loved it! had a great time! Probably will see it again! If I had 1 critique it would be the fight scene against the guards after Kylo killed Snoke. Choreography could've been better. But that's so minor lol I thought they hit all the marks and it felt like a Star Wars movie!
1508,6,Nice Disney movie,This movie is kind of starwars movie. It is wannabe starwars movie. It is good movie without guts.
1509,1,I could not watch this a second time,"So Uncle Luke went to his nephew's bedroom during the night to hurt him... If this doesn't sound creepy I don't know what does. But the question that keeps on coming to me is why have they turned Luke into such a creep and jerk? The bedroom scene has different versions that we never understand what really happened. <br /><br />Who is Snoke? Do we ever find out who he was other than being the antagonist? No? Anybody out there would care to answer why I would be happy to see a guy chopped in half? The guy is ugly but that hardly merits death. How did Snoke not sense that Kylo was going to use the Force to kill him? He practically brags about how easy it was to ""Jedi"" Kylo's mind, pulling his strings like he was a puppet. The character is so obviously created by CGI that he might as well have been a cartoon. Snoke is only evil for the sake of being evil and when he dies I really don't feel like that the ""Force"" is relieved.<br /><br />And then there is the scene where Luke milks the teats of that bizarre looking alien. I mean seriously??? Why were we subjected to that scene? We move from Luke cutting off limbs from aliens to milking them? Was that creature even sentient? Because the smile of satisfaction that it gets is disturbing to say the least. However, that scene with Mark Hamill aptly symbolizes what the producers are doing to this franchise. <br /><br />What I can't understand is if the Jedi are over or not? When Luke meets Kylo Ren in ""astro projection"" mode (this is a new Jedi power, but who cares) and tells him that the Jedi will not end with him and that there's another... The scene cuts over to Rey. But earlier Luke tells Yoda that the Jedi are over... So which is it? Was he just messing with Kylo? Is Luke just trying to hurt his nephew?<br /><br />Kylo Ren is a monster, then he isn't, then he is, then he isn't... Oh how confusing! He looks like a comic book villain. Then he has a moment which seems to imply that he and Rey are going to make out. I won't be surprised to discover that Rey is his long lost twin sister. Leia is sucked out into the vacuum of space but she brings herself back onto the ship with the Force of magic (or the magic of the Force)... Man, the Force is really picky about who it wants to save. <br /><br />I really hope that this was the last Star Wars movie ever, because I don't think I could tolerate another bad storytelling."
1510,,Episode 8? More Like The Hateful 8.,"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie in the 40-year-old franchise, and it's a rolling dumpster fire of a film to boot. Many seasoned fans like me absolutely detest this movie, but not because it ""takes bold risks"" and ""wants to be different,"" as if we're too immature and selfish to accept ""change."" Just stop using those weak straw men arguments."
1511,10,The Last Jedi- A Cinematic Masterpiece!,"First of all, do NOT believe the bad user reviews on this site. The vast majority of the downvoting that you see here has been organized and executed by an army of online trolls on some alt right sub-reddit forum, and to what specific end? Shame on them all. "
1512,6,Nothing more to tell,The movie has many good features but unfortunately has nothing more to add to the saga of the far away galaxy we grew old with.
1513,9,Falters a little but still an enjoyable experience,"Having breathed new life into the Star Wars franchise with The Force Awakens back in 2015, a film that was an adrenaline rush of nostalgia combined with fresh new characters, Star Wars was well and truly back, and bigger than ever before. Opting to close the film with such a teasing cliffhanger of a final shot left the world waiting with baited breath for the continuation of the saga and with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the wait is finally over."
1514,6,What A Shame,"Fellow ""Star Wars"" fans, we all know the history of this series. 1977's (First) Episode IV--exciting, fast-paced, groundbreaking Western light space-opera version of the 1958 Japanese Classic, ""The Hidden Fortress"" (""Kakushi-toride no san-akunin""). Episode V (1980)--a truly great and (for its day) special-effects-packed sequel. Episode VI (1983)--a flawed but arguably satisfying conclusion to the original film trilogy. The next three live-action pictures, Parts I through III (1999-2005)), were an arguably disappointing balance of state-of-the-art special effects, action-packed stories, and, sadly, poor poor casting choices. Then in 2015 came Episode VII--a seeming partial remake (of Episode IV) cum series sequel that was beautifully paced and action-packed. For an aging fan who saw ""A New Hope"" (Episode IV) TWICE in a row on day 1 in 1977, ""The Force Awakens"" (Episode VII) was a popular cinematic triumph (by primary helmsman J.J. Abrams)."
1515,8,"""This is not going to go the way you think!""","Ok I've seen the screeds upon screeds of negative reviews for TLJ all over the net, not just on IMDb! I can understand why a lot of people will be negative about this movie. In fact I feel theres been more negativity aimed at this installment of the Star Wars Saga than even any of the prequels!"
1516,7,left me saying What?,In some ways I loved the film. But in other ways it did not answer the questions. I was hoping to have answered for the Force awakens be answered. But the other thing is I was left saying is what? You can't go into this film thinking about the old school. The torch gets past. But not in the way I was expecting. It left me mixed for it was not using the info from what made Luke a powerful Jedi in the history we know. But it also did it in a rushed way. With a level I can see why some have the feeling it disrrespects that past. I think they could of done something else that Could have shown more respect for the old school. But it doesn't and in that way it failed. But it does provide some exciting action. Does have some good moments. But for those of us who loved the old. I think you will be disappointed for it like a total.departure from this and gives hints from some of the old but. It's a huge drop off and it will leave enough wondering where it goes from here?
1517,1,"George Lucas - ""There is no episode 7"" Same goes for episode 8","I know the movie genre is a lot about personal preference, but Star Wars is a little more than that. It is not only a great sequence with a lot of story and emotions behind it, but a very uniquely build world. "
1518,8,Its all about Luke... really,Well its 3 am and I have just got back from the midnight showing of The Last Jedi. 
1519,7,Struggles a bit,The film has its struggles during the middles section but the opening and closing section are really great and features a great send off to a very beloved character.
1520,1,RIP Star Wars,This movie will be my last Star Wars movie I ever watch. The script and direction a corporate Disney empire took with this trilogy just ruined it. They took a great movie series and decided to dump on it. Like a big dump. They made Luke look like a joke.
1521,,Remember when Star Wars was FUN?,"The original Star Wars films (""4-6"" as we're now supposed to call them) were FUN. It's that simple. They had action, surprise, and a bit of humor. They were a treat for viewers young and old."
1522,10,Don't Believe the Haters!,"This was a great Star Wars movie. It was a bit different than previous installments, but the magic is still there. The humor and plot are good, and certainly provides an interesting problem for the Resistance and the First Order. Just see it for yourself with no expectations, that's how movies get ruined."
1523,7,I know... but wait. This is the Godfather pt.ii of Star Wars.,"But ""I have a bad feeling about this?"""
1524,10,"Strong female leads, awesome story arc!",What a sensational picture. All the favourites back together. Sparkling cinematography and a stirring new take on the sound track.
1525,6,It's treason then,Why didn't they execute order 66 after reading the script? It was not continuous with episode 7 at all (which was a good and fun movie). I have no idea how any character is any different now than they were after episode 7. 
1526,9,I'm getting really sick of all the hate on this movie.,Have you ever watched an amazing movie and seen so many negative reviews for it that it actually made you angry? That has been my experience for this movie every day. People need to stop whining and accept that just because this movie is different doesn't mean it's bad
1527,7,"""Let the past die, kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be""",Star Wars: The Last Jedi will certainly (and has proven to be before the opening weekend has even concluded) a polarizing entry in the franchise.
1528,4,Five Reasons TLJ is the worst of an otherwise fantastic Saga.,"When I first saw it, deep down I knew I was disappointed but I kept telling myself ""its so good!"" I was in denial."
1529,8,Ignore the salty nerds,"Easily the best star wars film since the 1980s, a lot more interesting than the fairly run-of-the-mill force awakens, following in the footsteps of the empire strikes back by taking things in a different direction, fixed a lot of the problems with the series that were introduced in the prequels and is what any addition to the original series should've always been, all the made-up science jargon and tired old chosen-one tropes can finally be put to bed, let's just hope they don't bring them all back in the last one..."
1530,6,Tomorrow gonna go for ep 9 so I gave it a rewatch...,"Although the movie is bad written, but really really bad, the direction of Rian Johnson wasn't that bad.<br /><br />He is not a bad director (some of the coolest Breaking Bad eps are his btw) but I think that he tried to imitate the same style that JJ used, but mixing it up with his (Rian's) own personal thoughts about what the Force is and, in some ways, also trying to create his own personal new characters (Rose and Admiral Hondo, or what she's called) trying to destroy JJ's (Phasma and Hux), which he and many didnt liked... For example tryng to make Hux an idiot (the Hugs pun with Poe); Phasma looking weak and being more useless, and also end in an cliché way ), snoke prematurely killed in another idiot way (""I can feel he knows the right think to do, no more conflict!"" thing that, come on! He knew how to make them two visually connect and touch!!)<br /><br />He should've gone trying to make us love them much than changing"
1531,3,SJW Trash,"Professional critics again telling the public what we must like and watch, to be as moral and wonderful as them."
1532,,Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Movie review,"As a huge Star Wars fan i went to saw this film, but also with an open mind to certain things. The first i saw this movie was on December 14th of 2017, and i found it a pretty good Star Wars movie. Better than ""The Force Awakens"", but i didn't review it because i want it to see it a second time before i start to note my review. I watched it a second time tonight on January 10th of 2018, and it confirms to me that this is my third favorite Star Wars movie. "
1533,9,A Fresh Addition on the Franchise,"I went into ""The Last Jedi"" expecting one of two things: a ""repeat"" of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" or something completely new for ""Star Wars."" I would have been satisfied with either, but what I got was a surprising mix of the two, and honestly I couldn't be happier."
1534,7,Entertaining Star Wars movie like no other.,"I'm old enough to have watched the very first Star Wars in a movie theater, back when the opening crawl lacked the ""Episode IV, A New Hope"" crap. Indeed, when I saw it in 1977, the first text that appeared in the crawl was, ""It was a period of civil war."" So, yeah, I'm old. "
1535,9,One Of The Best Star Wars Movies,I dont know why people hate this movie so much. It's one of the best Star Wars Movies and is one of the only ones to actually try to have different themes. Not perfect but the good outweighs the bad.
1536,6,Very good... and very bad at the same time.,"Disconnected from ep. 7. Too much unnecessary political agenda, half a dozen terrible scenes and plot points (compared to 1-2 plot holes per movie in previous trilogies), plus many more I genuinely disliked. "
1537,10,Star Wars for a new generation,"As a lifelong fan of the saga, halfway through TLD after flirting with disappointment in the movie I decided to stop comparing it to the originals or waiting for a classic moment on par with say, the Death Star attack in A New hope. There is so much to enjoy about this new trilogy; the whole franchise hinged on the casting of Rey and in this movie (as with the last hour if FA) she comes to life. In fact the whole suite of new characters all hit home for me aside from possibly general Hux who feels a tad one note. Kylo Wren must surely be one of the best characters in the entire saga. The way the move keeps you guessing throughout which side he will choose is a masterstroke. Whilst there is undoubtedly flaws (certain scenes/characters feel completely out if place in the SW universe, a questionable comedy balance) the final hour is pure Star Wars heaven. As for our heroines, I'm struggling to understand the fan criticism of Luke's character developments, it feels like were seeing the result of 40 years of growth and I for one thought this was the most rounded version of Luke we've seen. Leia is treated with the respect you'd expect and Chewbacca chews plenty of scenes up. I understand certain criticisms from SW fanatics but I for one am happy to go with this new version of our galaxy far far away and cant wait to wee where the journey ends. If Rogue One was a SW film made for the purists then this is SW for a new generation!"
1538,7,Writing and Editorial has potential,"Snoke was a Sith Master, right? Then be in for a big disappointment and a completely inconceivable turn of events. When I saw the movie first time, even I could sense what might happen and I'm just a man, no Force sensitive let alone a Sith Master. (1/10)"
1539,1,plot twist after plot twists,"The primary writer obviously loves their plot twists, thinking that this is infact what makes a good movie, but no it makes it hard to follow and frankly makes a terrible plot worse. Not only have they destroyed the lore of star wars, with Rey the mary sue suddenly being a more capable jedi with no training than Anakin in episode 3 or Luke in episode 6, but they've also destroyed lore surrounding the rebels, with little to no rebels left in the galaxy, everything that happened in episode 6 is diminished. Then there is the idea that a ship that enters split stream can destroy several star destroyers and the main flag ship. Not to mention the horrible ship captain that flew that ship, who instead of just telling her plan to poe she proceeded to hide it, with obvious attempts of forced feminism with the idea that ""men aren't always right"" vibe, when really she should of just told him the plan (Which it self was flawed). Then theres the fact that they completely ruined luke as a character, and even the actor himself has expressed how he doesn't like the direction they took and is extremely disappointed."
1540,9,Maybe I'm just sentimental,"I really must be missing something because I came out of the theatre on premiere night of STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (2017) thinking I had just seen the best Star Wars film since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. But, hey, that's just me! LOL Believe me, I've been to movies where I've seen them in the theatre and known right away whether or not they are trash, and TLJ is not even close to that. The only part that underwhelmed me was that casino planet nonsense, but otherwise, I thought this film hit every right note start to finish. For one thing, I really liked how tight and focused the plot of this movie was. None of this jumping around from planet to planet. Just 3 or 4 major settings to centralize all the action. I also love how fluid this film was with 'The Force Awakens', picking up where it left off. You can actually watch TFA and TLJ as a 5-hour film and I'm not complaining about that!"
1541,6,Big disappointment due to inexplicably positive critic reviews,"I am your average moviegoer that grew up watching and enjoying the original trilogy. I think the Force Awakens did a remarkable job of reigniting the excitement about the new saga in spite of its ""convenient"" script structure which was probably necessary to connect old and new characters. It was arguably far from an easy task after three mediocre prequels and its ending was a very promising set up for this episode. I admit that I had high expectations for this movie, I was genuinely excited. This was further fueled by stellar critic reviews:"
1542,2,The worse of the sequel trilogy.,"The Last Jedi is the wrong title for the movie, it should be The Empire Strikes Back Again! The film was a poorly done rehash of the superior ESB. I am amazed the writers and the director could not come up something more original. There are a lot of Star Wars novels out there, why didn't they adapt one of those books instead of copying a classic."
1543,,Disappointed,"Not the explanation we needed for key characters , no point watching most of the first 60 mins of the film very boring , however on a positive after the first 60 mins some good plot twists."
1544,8,The formulaic franchise continues,I went into this film with an attitude that perhaps the owners of the franchise were bleeding the public dry what with the regular films and these new spin off films.
1545,6,Episode 10-12 on the way?,"Its been a while since a movie has driven me to a review, but this I think deserves it, warning on spoilers<br /><br />Director JJ Abrams creates an amazing trilogy plot line only to have Director Rian Johnson ignore it and create a movie that is a waste of a good 122 minutes of run time. I'll give it half an hour of a decent showing of some good cinematography."
1546,10,An unexpected excellent Star Wars movie,"Not Star Wars fan, because I found all the Star Wars films were nothing but some ridiculous aliens and Japanese ninjas holding laser swords. Most Star Wars movie fans' minds have always stayed at the age of 10, but this movie I totally enjoyed from beginning to end, was a bit long but the tension created by the movie was very good. It's the best Star Wars movie I've ever seen. if you watch Star Wars is to watch ridiculous aliens fight, you may not be satisfied, but for something else, such as movie art, you may like it"
1547,7,"I like this movie, don't harrass me for liking it!","OK, i like this film. Now lets start with the good stuff. It has some great effects and cinematography, good acting (the acting from Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill was amazing) and the film has a great moral of learning from failure and that anyone can be a hero no-matter what their background. Rian Johnson hadn't made a film on this scale, and for what he made, it was pretty good."
1548,9,"Bad ending, but one of the most entertaining SW films",No spoilers from me but I read some of the negative reviews here and I think these people had written their own movie in their head before going to see this. I did not and therefore enjoyed it greatly for what it is. 
1549,7,A Beautiful Mess,"Movie was all over the place, felt rushed, had filler, a lot of things didn't make much sense and was really poorly written and jarring; however the battle scenes, visuals and some of the characterization was done excellently."
1550,3,Massive potential all wasted,"This is, by far, the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It doesn't even feel like Star Wars. Its like they took familiar characters & images and did a random, unlrelated movie where none of the characters even act like themselves."
1551,10,Great fun from start to finish!,Before we go into the review I just want to say that I'm sorry that I didn't do any reviews for the last few months. I'm now back with another review and this time I will be doing Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi! Let's get into the review!
1552,7,Star Wars Fans Are The Worst,"As a lifelong fan of the franchise, it hurts to see how divided it's fans have become. I would like to start off by saying this is not a perfect movie, not even close. Upon my first viewing I loved it, but after repeated viewings the hype began to fade and I saw this movie for what it really is, a Star Trek episode. Not a bad Star Trek episode but not a great episode either. The inclusion of ""real-world"" problems like fuel is what hurt the prequel triology (politics and midiclorians) and this film. The movie boils down to a slow car chase that doesn't do much to move the story arc along but give us a buffer between Force Awakens and Episode 9. <br /><br />In an attempt to not solely hark on the negatives, this film did have decent acting from Domhnall Gleeson (Hux), Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), and John Boyega (Finn). Oscar Isaacs many others in the film do a fine job of portraying their characters. The development of Luke Skywalker in this film was a bit dissapointing. Skywalkers story felt like it kind of betrayed its source material but I don't know how else someone would react to the fall of the new generation of Jedi. Though seeing the return of Luke as a Jedi Master fighting against Kylo was a good payout. <br /><br />One thing above all was something that made this movie enjoyable, the visuals. This film is one of the prettiest Star Wars films I have ever seen. The cinematography and use of practical effects makes the hurt of poor writing lessen. <br /><br />My biggest complaint about this film is the writing, character development (lack there of), or the future of the franchise. My main complaint is that this film causes more questions and division than any film prior. I'm not wishing all of the questions made in Force Awakens be answered, but maybe at least one. For every one question answered in this film, ten more arose. <br /><br />This all being said, nothing the Disney/Lucas Films produces will ever live up the expections that most fans have for the franchise. Star Wars fans have these warped ideas of what they think the franchise should look like based on their fan fictions and the extended universe books, comics, etc. With the expection of the horrific holiday special and all of the Ewok TV movies, Star Wars fans must understand that some Star Wars is better than no Star Wars. With the boycott and remake plans being thrown around, movies that fans want like Boba Fett and Obi-Wan are being put on hold. We need to appreciate what we have rather than over analyze and complain about everything that is put out. The movies don't NEED to be made and if we continue this state of whining, they will cease to exist and we will no longer have anything to complain about because the fans killed the franchise."
1553,3,Scarcity creates value; Plenty creates cheap crap,"I'll just join the chorus in saying IMDB's weighted average is obviously a joke, as anyone who spends time going through the reviews can see. Go to Metacritic, where the user review average is 4.6/10 for a more accurate picture of what audiences actually thought of this movie. There, there are 3,307 negative reviews compared to 2,600 positive reviews. And as anyone can see even here, the vast majority of negative reviews are thoughtful and well written out while most positive reviews are basically ""Awesum!"" Does anyone think the audience of user reviewers at Metacritic is composed of a wholly different group of inherent haters while *only* IMDB is an accurate representation of audiences? Please."
1554,,Fun but flawed,"The trouble with reviewing the latest episode of a galatic franchise like ""Star Wars"" is that expectations are so hign. Ever since I saw the first movie almost four decades ago as a 30 year old who had fairly recently become a father, I have approached each new chapter - usually with my son - with immense exitement and not a little trepidation. If there was no ""Star wars"" canon, this film would be judged a great success with lots of enjoyment and entertainment. Assessed as the eighth segment of a saga, however, the sum of the parts (too many parts) - often exhilerating - is less than the rather incoherent whole."
1555,8,Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.,"It's in the title and emblazoned all over the trailers; Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi master, declaring the need to end the Jedi order and bring balance to the Force. And for much of the film it looks as if it will keep this promise to explore the darker, twisted complexities of both light and dark side, and finally deliver a conflict that isn't merely the next generation of different coloured lightsabers clashing. That was one of the main criticisms of Abrams' revival, that we had seen it all before (and better). The Last Jedi barely allows any time to muse on the poignancies in the long gaze between the weathered face of Luke and his daughter (or so fans pleaded and speculated). Unceremoniously, he tosses the ancient weapon over his shoulder as if he was throwing out the trash. Immediately Rian Johnson signals a changing of the guard - there is to be no Obi Wan mentoring here, no Karate Kid style montages. Luke sees a deep pit of darkness within Rey, and for once it seems more than just vague menace and funny helmets. "
1556,7,Not The Best 'Star Wars' Film By Far.,"I have to say I wasn't too impressed and I feel a bit deflated from all the expectation. I think I am being over-generous giving this a 7 out of 10 to be honest. The finale was was like something out of an American Wrestling scenario where the heroes and villains do their stuff on cue and in turn and all the inevitable twists and turns take forever to conclude. The drawn out silent stares into camera,there were far too many too,suggests to me that this film won't be winning many OSCARS for direction, acting. or dialogue; although the camera work, CGI and special effects were very good and they may get some recognition. Bottom line, worth watching once, twice might be a chore."
1557,9,A New Direction Worth Exploring,"When it comes to the Star Wars franchise, I may have been late to the game in terms of when I became a huge fan, but I see myself as being pretty well-versed in the core saga as of today. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the latest installment in this universe, and while it's easily the riskiest and most daring of the series, it also ranks among the best, at least in my opinion. I rarely do this, but I felt the need to see this movie twice before writing this review. Having a very solid memory of this eighth installment, here's why I believe it's one of the best in the franchise, but also why it may not be for everyone."
1558,6,Last Jedi isn't bad or Great,"Coming off the Force Awakens the Previous film in the Skywalker Saga which released in 2015 was left off with big questions like Why was Luke Hiding, Who is Snoke, Who are Rey's Parents, some are answered while some are thrown away wasted. Mark Hamill Performance as Luke Skywalker is the best it has ever been with a Luke who is shamed off himself and want's nothing to do with the Jedi while the other highlight performance's are Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Oscar Isaac as Poe, (Etc.) after the unfortunate death of Carrie Fisher of the End of 2016 left us with her last Performance as General Leia which also her best performance. Rian Johnson had an interesting story with loads of twist and turns that not all fans will be happy with (Spoiler Alert) Death of Snoke and Luke Skywalker who would of been big players in the final film of the Skywalker Saga he also delivered very powerful emotional moments. My Problems with this film are that Force Awakens and Last Jedi feel so different to each other because this film continue's where Force Awakens Left off but there some bits that do not connect, Another Problem I had was the waste of character's like Snoke in Episode 7 looking so Scary and interesting powerful character and hoped to have learnt more about him and we didn't and was defeated so easily and also the Finn and Rose (Canto Bight) storyline did nothing to the overall story and finally the final problems I had was that Han Solo died in Starkiller Base by his Son Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and which they do not address or mention anything about apart from Luke who asked where's Han (in a Deleted scene Luke mourns Han's Death) but not in the Movie (WHY) it would of adding more emotional to the film and deleted scenes that couldn't of been in the movie (Luke mourns Han's Death, Lesson 3, Finn Up to Date, BB 8 Reveals Rey's Goodbye, Rose Bites Hex) why delect those scenes<br /><br />Overall the Film was very entertaining with great action scenes and unexpected twist and turns with some emotional powerful moment."
1559,9,Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017),"I love Star Wars. The original trilogy is up there with the best trilogies in film ever. I even see the good in the prequel trilogy, despite their many flaws. I'll find something to love about them. When The Force Awakens came out I was very pleased with the revival of the Star Wars Universe and how fun and exciting the film and new characters were. The perfect blend of nostalgia and a new hope. I welcomed Rian Johnson and his vision for this sequel. This may be me looking at the series with my Star Wars fanboy glasses but this film was very good and a worthy successor and entry into the series."
1560,6,Wish George was back.,"Say what you want about the prequels... keep hating on them but to me they were better than these new releases by Disney with the exception of rogue 1... Both VII and now VIII just lost touch with the whole feel of what star was was about... The prequels even despite the criticisms maintained that feel of what a star wars movie should be.. I can't put it into words, but the last six done by George Lucas still had that magic touch.. Its a flow, its the way the movie unfolds.. its the type of battles and when.. It was the selection of key character that made the movie. No matter how much action they put in, or what they try to do, it just feels like star wars is falling apart and dying.. The best part of this movie was when r2d2 played the old clip of princess leia asking Obi Won for help.. "
1561,3,Rian Johnson sets his targets far too high,"Firstly, let's address something. Why so many critics and certain fans consider this movie to be good is due to 2 reasons."
1562,8,"Mark Hamil, Ridley, Dern it is good to see you again.","I have to say in the words of Yoda! (Yes I was surprised to see the wise little jedi master) ""It is good to see you Luke Skywalker"" and I hope we will see him again in part three, please because we lost Mrs. Fisher whom we will always miss, so please let him be in a significant part of the film. There was a part where Kylo Ren is so convinced that we must let go of the past (yet I am still waiting the Return of Han Solo in part 3 do not disappoint us, did I mention that Mrs. Fisher passed away and that we will always miss her and that there is an ache that can't be filled in her absence.) But I have to give you a snippet from this review : A Lesson in Ageless Thinking From James Bond ""Age is no guarantee of efficiency,"" the quartermaster says. ""And youth is no guarantee of innovation,"" Bond replies. Quite true. Please be careful that you don't disrespect the elders in your midst while seeking to carve a name for yourselves. Whatever you do to the seniors amongst us you do to yourself and later when your own handiwork returns to the hands of the masters seeking the same fate for you that you handed out in your youth. It was also George Lukas in an interview (I cant remember which one) one time whom mentioned the old saying ""old sins cast long shadows"", I think the best way is to respect all life, all things as Jedi Master Skywalker tells Rey on the first of three lessons he gives her and I add to forgive and forget, seek to heal old wounds with the balm of kindness, gentleness, good will and honest diplomacy. This does not mean that evil will not raise its ugly head, as Skywalker said there will be evil it may be here to stay for now but it doesn't have to be here forever, cruelty, hate, war, violence, can go away and we can find the way together, hand in hand as Rey tries later with Kylo Ren who refuses in his quest to destroy everything and start anew which we can't do, you destroy the good with the bad if you do that and we cannot do this as Rose Tico (a rebel fighter) tells Finn's character ""we fight for what we love"", which hit me like thunder when she acts out of love for him in a special scene which should bring a tear to your eye or atleast leave you with a lump in your throat. Moving away from the philosophical, I have to say that I wanted more at the end, that I was at first dissappointed with Skywalkers behavior at first but then realized that yes after so many years of fighting it takes it's toll on anyone but I need to see him again in part 3 triumphant in every way as he was when the first films came out because it does a heart and soul good to see him one in the force, one with the force! Lastly I would have like to see a more exciting sword fight, like the kind in Phantom Menace with Obi-wan and Qui-Gon vs. Darth Maul which is one of the greatest fight choreography I have ever seen (along with the fight scenes in Ipman part 1 which are incredible). Also if this movie is some 20 years later shouldn't the technology be more advanced, the space ship that Laura Dern's character (was great although too rigid, but good to see you back laura) is in towards the end seems advanced but other technology seems the same, for the next and future films and yes there should be a follow up to Rey's character she is just exciting as a jedi, her youth and please her purity must remain intact as the years pass to light and gui de the rest through the darkness that surrounds the jedi universe and I am excited to see new Jedi and hopefully alien ones like Asokah Tano from the animated clone wars. Hopefully Star Trek (the competitor) will not go Rated R but remain PG-13 but follow many of the same advice I gave above especially with the elders, while enhancing the story and action. I would like to see William Shatner make a significant Cameo alongside with John Luke Piccard (yes Kirk LIVES! As in the self written answer to his untimely death in the time traveling storyline, hey he could appear before that story line, just have him and the rest of the surviving cast appear to pay them tribute and satisfy age old fans and show respect), p.s. Chris Pine is great as the young Kirk, he has grown into the role and is very charismatic. I would love to see some new droids and more aliens and alien creatures a jungle planet would be awesome to see and a great back drop for a great battle scene as intense as you can make it with hundreds of resistance/ emperial fighters making their stand. By the way the 3D Effect continue to disappoint because although there is depth perception in some scenes, the whole idea is that the scenes need to POP-OUT at you and they don't. Come on guys get this done to really give us a real experience like no other, during some of the regal cinema promos we get the regal cinemas logo POP right out to us in TRUE 3D but that's it, can you guys get this happening, I mean we're paying a bunch of money to go see it in Imax 3D just for this (once again yes the depth perception is well done)."
1563,6,The plot of Jedi Knight Academy (2003) for PC and Xbox was a better sequel.,"For a franchise that has garnered so much beloved attention for decades, there should have at least been a decade's work culminated into it;<br /><br />Not a week's worth of a sole person's fan-fiction side project."
1564,3,"""Hey look, it says StarWars on the tin!! (You dumb sucker)""",If I should review this movie in a single word: CLICHÉ.
1565,,Totally kill Starwars franchise,This is my first review on IMDB and words can't even describe how frustrated I am right now. Starwars has became a way for people to promote politics ideas and social justice. They built the most ridiculous plot and characters just because they think that's how the society should be. Total garbage.
1566,10,GREAT STAR WARS FILM!,"I saw this film 5 or 6 times in IMAX 3D, when it was in the theaters; I LOVED everything about it: the great cast, dramatic plot, the diverse and talented cast, light saber duels, the space battle scenes and the dialogue! Held onto my seat during the entire movie, every time I watched it-THAT's how exciting this film is! Definitely much better than the prequels (well, Revenge of the Sith was actually better than the other 2 prequels, so I'll make that exception)!! Definitely a major favorite Star Wars film of mine (except for Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and all the Ewok parts in Empire Strikes Back)!! A must-see!"
1567,6,I have a mixed feelings about this,I have a mixed feelings about this. All I have to say right now.
1568,10,Star Wars At Its Finest,"What an incredible ride from start to finish! Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed TFA. However, I was hoping the next two movies in the trilogy would be more unique with their storytelling, and take us to some new places and ideas as opposed to TFA's safe approach. Thankfully, The Last Jedi doesn't disappoint in this regard. Not only does The Last Jedi do some unexpected things with its characters, but it also manages to expand our understanding of the Galaxy, and the role that every person can play in its narrative."
1569,6,Still conflicted,"After not digging the Force Awakens I was surprised that I actually liked the Last Jedi, I think. There are some parts of the film that are amazing and then there are others that make me feel let down. "
1570,8,The Last Jedi Isn't The Empire Strikes Back and That Is Why It's So Great,"The Last Jedi has its various story problems (the introduction of Rose, the Canto Bight scenes, Poe's brashness) but along its failings comes a fascinating tale that delves deeper into the realms of the force and sets up some remarkable ideas for the final installment of the trilogy. "
1571,6,Barely a Star Wars film,As a whole The Last Jedi is a mildly entertaining space movie but as a Star Wars movie...it's just terrible.
1572,1,Makes no sense,This storyline really had no follow up to The Force Awakens..? It's a completely different style detailed storyline from a weird fanatic.
1573,8,Not As Bad As Everyone Says,"My main problems with the film are that C-3po, R2-D2 and Chewbacca are being left out constantly throughout the film. They're the characters we want the most! BB8 might be a great addition but if he was actually working with R2-D2 on the missions then he'd be even better. C-3Po got a satisfactory role in the film and yes he did get one odd scene where Poe, who stole his role, told him shut up. R2-D2 didn't even get out the millennium falcon. He and Chewbacca were literally the only two characters who you knew were gonna survive because they stayed in the plain and did nothing. When we see our three heroes return, they need to be the main characters, not Poe Dameron. At least the ending hints that they may do something but it looks doubtful. Maybe they will get the role they deserve."
1574,7,Better 2nd Time Watching It.,"Before attending the midnight release for the film in the UK, I had so many questions and thoughts on my mind like; will Luke turn to the dark side? will Leia be killed off? will this be like an empire strikes back? and many more, and the biggest of all, will this movie live up to expectation. Unfortunately after the screening I was left with a sense of emptiness and mixed emotions. At first I gave this film a 5/10 as I had too many questions to ask like: Was the film too comical? Should they have killed off the supreme leader Snoke? Was it too convenient for Leia to use the force after certain death? Was Finn's part in all this really necessary? and did the cat and mouse chase of the first order and rebel fleet drag out far too long? "
1575,3,Cringe,"Ok so I'll start off and say it wasn't horrible. If you don't drink or have ANYTHING better to do, you might as well give this movie a shot. The graphics were great, but the dialogue and overall plot have so many big holes you might as well call it Mia Khalifa. I mean for real, this entire plot seemed like an eighth grader wrote it, and some script writers touched it up."
1576,,Now I can confirm my losing hope on humanity.Thank You The last jedi for this exposition.,"One of the most intelligent and audacious act by a director, the movie reeks with intelligence and craft, and has finally transcended the genres , questions and conflict between good and bad. Has its flaws, but the highs have towered in the visage of magnificent turrets upon the lows. Best star wars episode after new hope and empire strikes back.The composition of scenes and themes were dazzling.No one did stuff in star wars that has been attempted in this film.May The Force Be With Us."
1577,10,LOVED IT!,"I think those of you against this movie were so set on certain ideals, and when those certain ideals weren't met, it ruined it for you. Surprise, you're not writing the movie. My husband and I absolutely loved the movie and are shocked at the bad ratings. There were a couple inconsistencies in character development, but I'm hoping with JJ Abrams coming back for number #3, that he will tie everything back together. Regardless, the action was great, awesome graphics, and there were genuine funny moments. I usually don't care for funny moments in these types of movies (Guardians of the Galaxy 2 killed me with that), but the jokes in The Last Jedi were actually funny."
1578,7,Best Star Wars movie I have seen!,"The Last Jedi... Ufff, if you love Star Wars as much as I do, then you have to watch this one, it's seriously the best one in my opinion, the 2 hours and 30 minutes feels like one hour, if you are really into it. I was sad when it ended because I wanted more, but to be honest... The movie is worth every minute!"
1579,9,A lot better than expected,"After reading a lot of bad reviews and media about the PC element to the film I actually didn't bother watching it until recently. I was really surprised how good it was. I literally felt like an 8 year old again durring some of the scenes. I did notice what felt like a mostly female cast, its hard not to, but even the stereotypical useless General was a women, and the Black Male was made to look like a coward and stupid, so all in all it wasn't politically correct in the typical sense it was actually really well done and didn't look to promote any particular group, in-fact it was open season on all of them, and although noticeable did not impede on the story, but it is enough to make it the topic of what a lot of people talk about after watching it. I think the story line is very clever and really makes you wonder which way the story is going to go. Some people have written that the story is direction less, but I think they are just accustomed to watching movies where the storyline is obvious and easily anticipated, this movie is very difficult to predict. There is nothing shocking about any of it and in the end it makes perfect sense. There are a few bits that are disappointing where you want the awesomeness of the force and Luke to save the day - when actually its just a mind trick, seriously if they had given the audience what it really would have like to see on this then people would have been out their seats cheering in the audience, how they resisted to do it that way is an absolute mystery and shows some restraint, but I guess they wanted something unpredictable and nothing that could be cheesy . The special effects were also spot on. I really enjoyed the movie a lot, for me its definitely as good as The Force Awakens and will be one that I watch again."
1580,7,**May include spoilers** Enjoyed......but not blown away....,"If i am honest, i hated The Force Awakens (granted i only seen it once, which tells you why i hated it), this film seemed a bit more interesting in terms of story however I can't help but think they are just simply recycling the luke/leia sibling story from the prequels with rey/kylo, even though nothing is concrete about her past/origin, i can't help but think that these films now just purposely lead people on with mystery for specific characters just keep the audience interested and hooked on this franchise, giving it the only relevance to remain a franchise. The whole ""who are rey's parents?"", i don't think anyone cares anymore if i am honest, all people want to see nowadays is some decent lightsaber duels (which this film was ridiculously short on by the way, might as-well have left them out). <br /><br />Even though the dialogue was laughable back in ROTS, at least the choreography spoke up for itself. "
1581,10,"A fantastic, masterful film, the Star Wars movie fans have deserved, not the one we've waited for","This is a different movies, by far passes everyone other Star Wars movie before except of course for Empire. Yes this is a different Star Wars movie. ""Things are not going to go the way you think"" Many of the reviewers on the site are salty that their theories didn't come true, and that Luke was a hermit to begin with and not a Grand Master Jedi that the Expanded Universe originally wrote him as. Although, yes he is that, but that comes before this movie. Before the sequels (Although the flashbacks do help show that) Luke is now ashamed for what happened to Kylo, he feels responsible, and hurt. He feels like he let down Leia and everyone else. He has taken full responsibility for it all, he has gone to the island of the first jedi temple to simply get out of the way and die. But that is until Rey find him, at first yes he is unwilling to teach he, but then he agrees, now I cannot wait to see him return in Episode 9 as a force ghost and see Rey take over, who is the true last jedi, and teach a new generation of Jedi. She has the books, Lukes saber, and she is ready to take the screen and fulfill her destiny. Yes at first glance Snoke is a bit of a waste. Most people salty that he wasn't Bane or the Emperor, but it doesn't really matter who he is, or if he comes back or who he was. Kylo Red has overpowered his master, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, but Snoke was arrogant, and didn't count on Kylo betraying him. Adam Driver did a fantastic job at portraying this. You think he will turn and help Rey, but he tricks her, and try to turn her. All I can say is this film was fantastic. The funniest thing about this movie is how salty people are that their fanfics didn't come true!"
1582,6,A step forward,You cannot expect this to be like the original trilogy because times have changed. They need to adhere to millennial audiences. I did enjoy it and it was better than the force awakens and turned away from copying the originals.
1583,1,"Utter garbage with a sticker ""Star Wars""","If one doesn't treat it as a StarWars-branded movie then it's just plain bad -- terrible script, weak characters, heaps of SJW and feministic political garbage."
1584,10,"Yey, I'm not a geek","I left the cinema with the same amount adrenaline as when the opening credits started. A brilliant story going back to the original Empire Strikes Back type drama. Reading these reviews which paint such a bad image of this film just makes me glad I'm not a complete geeky nob head, after the disappointment of 1,2&3 Disney have saved the star wars saga, not killed it by any means. Go see it and enjoy it, I certainly did and I can't wait for 9 to arrive"
1585,7,Entertaining and a solid entry in the franchise,"A good movie for both old and new Star Wars fans. A little rough around the edges, but manages to provide good entertainment and a solid narrative. It definitely left me excited to watch the conclusion of this trilogy."
1586,1,Garbage.,Absolute crap from the start. Turned it off halfway through the movie and I was watching it on a plane and was bored.
1587,10,1The Last Jedi Review,The best star wars movie so far I don't know why people think it sucks or why Disney is ruining the franchise. This movie shows a lot of surprises and incredible action.
1588,,"There is brilliance here, but it's buried beneath over-stretched and bloated plot.","I'm not really a great Star Wars fan, so nothing they would do with the characters would upset me."
1589,7,Hold your Horses - It's Not That bad !!!,"I have to admit this film is no Empire Strikes Back but it's no Phantom Menace either!!!<br /><br />Having come across such negative stuff on the Internet regarding the direction taken with The Last Jedi, I would like people to take a more balanced look at this film for what it is (an attempt to move things forward rather then give us the same old same old).<br /><br />There is a lot of blame headed in the direction of Kathleen Kennedy and Disney but bearing in mind George Lucas gave us Jar Jar Binks and played around with the original trilogy with his Special Editions adding supposedly comedic scenes (yes the terrible Bit with Han stepping on Jabba's tail) only took away the magic of what made these films so good in the first place."
1590,8,Out with the old?,"Out with the old and in with the Disney new. Seems to be the theme with this movie. Kill off the Jedi v Sith as if it was always a sub plot to the real saga of plain old good values v bad regardless of gender, race, sexual or any other alien persuasion that exists in the underverse. Don't have a problem with that as long as it's entertaining and the saga is heading somewhere. This movie isn't entertaining for sure, though where it is heading? That is anyone's guess. Frankly I stayed out of the guessing game years back and encouraged my kids to do the same. Don't like it....well become a creative and invent your own franchise based on Millennium old storytelling! Speaking of which; at least they didn't blow up the Falcon!"
1591,7,The Star Wars Vision I've Always Wanted to See,"The latest installment and 8th episode to one of the most celebrated and glorified movie sagas of all time, delivers a cinematic experience and momentous climactic orchestra of sci-fi exuberance it had me in applause.<br /><br />Starting literally heartbeats after The Force Awakens, it's the only Star Wars movie with pretty much no gap of time between it's predecessor, leaving the almost useless opening crawl to reiterate the obvious in 3 mandatory paragraphs."
1592,10,I know it's bad but they should have killed Leia off in this movie.,"Don't get me wrong I love the movie. I was raised on the prequels, fell in love with the originals in my teens and I am open to this trilogy. I won't lie I loved this installment. I was a bit heartbroken to see Luke become little more than Obi-Wan had been in A New Hope but at least Obi-Wan was still open to teaching Luke before he died."
1593,7,what they did wrong,"This movie was interesting in its own way. i was relieved of how they created a newer plot, unlike how the force awakens resembled a new hope too closely. but they are putting in an unnecessary love interest story between rey and kylo ren. i also was not impressed how they explained who was rey's parents were. all the important character ans theories they set up in the force awakens, such as who snoke is, who rey's parent really are, who phasma is, but than completely erased all of it. But it definatly impressed me how they showed how leia was also one with the force like luke."
1594,1,The Holiday Special had a better story than this confusing car crash,"Having been a SW fan since watching the original in 1977, watched all the originals and prequels dozens of times I can honestly say this one is the absolute worst of all the films. No story, no plot, no sense. I watched it once at the cinema and will never watch it again as it just makes me angry."
1595,9,"Perhaps not for die-hard Star Wars fans, but a very good movie otherwise!","I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie, but mostly from die-hard Star Wars fans. Perhaps this is true, but I approach this review as a fan of movies in general."
1596,6,An overview of 'The Last Jedi' and any future manifestations of Star Wars,"Well back in 1977 Star Wars emerged like a breath of fresh air after the early 70's period of bleak and violent films which signalled the final end of the 60's dream. I was unaware of this at the time I just knew I enjoyed the fun, creativity and enthusiastic energy of the movie. So now cut to modern day with it's much changed social and political landscape and movie industry and I sit down to watch 'The Last Jedi'. It all looks so much like the original films, but immediately a worrying thing occurred, I didn't know who all these new characters were or what at happened in the previous film, I couldn't even remember if this was a prequel or a sequel ! "
1597,1,Should sell a lot of Toys and Merchandise,"Well as a Star Wars Fan from the 70's I thought number 1 was bad with JAR JAR binks but this new one topped that in badness. It seems to me that characters were designed for Toys R Us instead of contributing to a good Movie. The recurring theme of Star Wars has always been the Bar with creatures from all over the universe this new one feature a casino that acted as a social statement (Child Slavery, Animal Cruelty, and Arms Sales) did not add anything to overall movie basically, who cared? Another thing Princess Leigha flying through space with no suit? Really? All I know is that I left saying to theater management is it needs to be the last movie ever. Its time bury it. But with Disney and now Fox all things are possible."
1598,10,it's amazing,It's one of the best and you should be proud rian;)
1599,,delete,Why do you make it so hard to find own reviews and remove them?
1600,7,To all those whom read and watched crapy videos talking about the Last Jedi before it even came out,"Well I have been reading comments and wtf?<br /><br />I could write here a bunch of crap criticize and justifying why this movie is not crap as most of you are saying, instead I'm going to paste here a comment from someone that pretty much sums it all"
1601,8,Fun movie.. I loved it,"I watched this even though there were lot of negative reviews here and you know what... It was worth it.<br /><br />The story arc was decent, acting good all round and the action great!<br /><br />Haters gonna hate.. ignore them. Go watch this movie."
1602,6,Could have been better,I'm a big Star Wars fan along with the majority of the world but I have to say I was a little disappointed with this instalment. There were some good parts of this which held the original Star Wars trilogy in mind. Howerever there were also elements of the second trilogy which was disappointing. I think the Force awakens was good as it was closer to the originals but last Jedi failed to build on that.
1603,9,Wow! The Redemption of Luke Skywalker! *MILD spoilers ahead.*,"This movie is going to divide. Once the hype and emotions settle I think it will go down as one of the best in the series. A definitive improvement over TFA. Like ESB (which opened to mixed reviews at the time and has become one of the most loved of the original trilogy) the good guys don't always win. Luke is broken and his Redemption fits the epic mold that it deserved. Despite Mark Hamill's personal feelings about the way the character was written for this chapter he brought his A game and really gave the audience a true connection to the character. If your expecting a by the number s Star Wars you will not like this movie. If you are okay with what Luke said in the trailer ""this is not going to go the way you think"" then you will leave thoroughly satisfied."
1604,7,how will it end?,"I liked the effects and most of the characters, however, snoke was a BIG let down, taken out so easily. Surely ren and hux can not beat the rebels. feel like star wars is heading in a new direction, for better or worse? how will it end? time will tell."
1605,1,This has ruined Star Wars for me,"I have been a huge fan of Star Wars for years. There have been some bad episodes yes, especially phantom menace, but none that have actively ruined the whole series for me. This achieved that. It is so badly done, overtly PC to the point it puts it above proper plot and character development, spattered with bad jokes and littered with bad acting,"
1606,9,Don't believe all the negative reviews,Had I not pre-ordered my tickets I might not have gone to see this movie in the theater.
1607,6,"As a movie it's OK, as a Star Wars movie it's dissapointing","I don't write many reviews but this one bothered me so deeply I felt I needed to. First the rating, yes I gave it a 6, why? Because the movie looks good and the acting is great. I don't want my disappointment to take away from the great acting which the movie had. The story was just terrible, it not only made this movie fall flat but the decisions that were made cut deep against generations of build up. The impacts and poor decisions of this movie didn't just impact this movie but so many of the story arcs that have made Star Wars great."
1608,1,Writer/Director insults intelligent Star Wars fans,"Let's leave out all the propaganda - feminism, vegetarians, the stupidity of saying the only way to get that rich is war...coming from Hollywood/Disney. Let's leave out all the sexist nonsense. There are many valid reasons fans felt insulted by this entry into the franchise."
1609,8,"Love SFX, love this movie - but!","Typical Star Wars story which is ""OK"". As expected, brilliant SFX and lots of action. I don't know quite why but it's not quite as good as some of the others. Some of the acting was not really up to scratch and the attempt at comedy just did not work. Re the story line, I know it's a long time between movies but the story did not quite seem to be a logical follow on, however we did enjoy it and will watch it again in the future."
1610,,It is a battle royale,Which is worse?
1611,7,The Last Jedi: Expectations vs. Reality (An unfair way to approach cinema),"The Last Jedi is a controversial movie with nerds and Star Wars fans alike. While people on both sides of the political conversation use this movie as a totem poll for their world views, I will not join in on such egregious banter. Movies are escapism, Star Wars is escapism, politics in movies, art, and Star Wars are not new. Despite what people people online drone about this movie doesn't make any statements about gender politics, Donald Trump, or a conversation specific to North American politics. Finding anti-conservative ideology in this movie requires mental gymnastics."
1612,10,Incredible film. Star Wars fans won't be let down.,"I can't heap enough praise on this movie. Every turn of this movie was amazing. The casting, script, dialogue, special effects, and everything thing else was executed so flawlessly. I'm so thankful that the franchise was not let down. Director Rian Johnson is legendary for creating this masterpiece. Having JJ Abrams as producer doesn't hurt either!"
1613,7,New trilogy,The people who complain about this movie are adults who grew up with the original trilogy and are annoyed that 'their movie' didn't go the way the exact way they thought. I think the way this movie subverts expectations is brilliant! Killing off Snoke people complain we nothing about him what did we know about The Emperor before the prequels. Rey not having parents makes people believe anyone can be a force user it never says it is genetic
1614,10,MASTER YODA !!!,Why give 10 Star?<br /><br />Because there is Master Yoda
1615,6,Just okay,"I liked watching it. I did. The overarching story was kind of cool. No one is ever going to be completely satisfied with it. My problem with it was the writing seemed lazy. Like there's only one person in the universe who can crack the shield codes of Snoke's battleship, but there just happened to be another genius prefect guy right there in the jail cell that Finn and Rose get tossed into for illegal parking. Then he pulls a Lando on them. What a shocker! And Leia in the vacuum of space just using the force to fly back to the ship. As if her son wouldn't have frozen dead and her blood wouldn't have bubbled from the complete lack of pressure. Anyway...you get the idea."
1616,3,Possibly the worst Star Wars movie,Unfortunately you can realize that there was a huge conflict of ideas between this movie and the force awakens. The director/ writers have destroyed everything that the force awakens built on and filled the gaps with unnecessary plots and comedy.
1617,10,It's just a movie guys...,"Hey real quick ...I'd normally give this movie an 8 but with all the rage ratings out there I think it's unfair to tantrum rate this film as anything below a 6...especially giving it a 1 is just silly. So i rated a 10 to just try to offset the unfair 1's out there. Movies that deserve 1's are the films that are fundamentally broken god awful films like: birdemic, incredible bulk, replica etc. "
1618,7,Some of these negative reviews ae as whiny as prequels Anakin,"Listen, Star Wars The last Jedi is not a perfect film. It is not the best Star Wars film, but it is not the ""trash"" that so many on here have called it. "
1619,1,Infuriating & boring,"Visually impressive (""nice"" shots, views etc.), but infuriating and confusing."
1620,8,A More Mature Outing Mixes Things Up,"Having just come from the theatre, the one thing I think tarnishes this film most is the product placement. The Disney overlords deemed it necessary to feature prominently cute groundhogs (also featured prominently in Toy departments). The other thing one would have hoped that we moved on from is having the Death Star as the big objective like the last umpteen Star Wars films. Lo, something shows up in the fourth act that uses Death Star as part of it's description. "
1621,,"Not as bad as the prequels, not as good as the original trilogy, somewhere in between...","""Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi"", from ""Looper"" director Rian Johnson, is the latest entry in the ""Star Wars"" franchise and does it live up to the hype? For me, sadly, this 8th episode was a bit of a disappointment. Sure, it offers some good performances from Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver, it has some pretty cool action scenes,the score from John Williams is expectedly good and in my opinion slightly better than the score for ""The Force Awakens"", the CGI is decent, there's some good camera work and for the 2 hour and 32 minute run time the pacing is not terrible. For me what made ""The Last Jedi"" a bit of a disappointment was for one thing that it felt all too safe and family friendly. There were moments throughout the film where I thought the filmmakers would take some risks, but just ended up going the predictable and at times cheesy route. There were even a few times where I remember thinking to mysely ""Wow, is that actually going to happen?"", but then it didn't or something else happened and possible major events were avoided. There wasn't all that much tension throughout the run time either and I left the cinema rather underwhelmed and the film failed to leave an impact. Despite really wanting to love the film considering I'm a ""Star Wars"" fan myself, I just couldn't really wrap my head around the overly long 152 minute run time and the needless sub-plots, especially the side quest with Finn that constantly slowed down the pace, took up way too much time and overall just didn't need to be there. The comedy doesn't always work and is mostly child-oriented, especially the introduction to the creatures found on the Ahch-To island known as ""Porgs"" that are basically there to boost merchandise sales and don't really play into the story much at any point. Another thing that surprised me was how much Princess Leia Organa, played by Carrie Fisher (Rest In Peace) in her last portrayal of the character, didn't have to do with the story. Aside from 1-2 short scenes, Leia was, in my opinion, kind of wasted and could've been utilized a lot more. Talking about the supporting cast, there aren't any standouts, the best performances are definitely those from Ridley, Hamill and Driver, the rest just aren't as strong, new characters don't leave an impact and returning characters were more enjoyable to watch in ""The Force Awakens"". Negatives aside, I still think you can watch ""The Last Jedi"", it isn't a complete failure, it has its entertaining moments and is enjoyable to watch (especially with friends and/or the family) if you're not expecting too much and there are definitely some funny moments and homages to the older films that will probably make fans crack a smile. It's clear that Rian Johnson is a big fan of the franchise and wants to make the best kind of ""Star Wars"" film that he can, but in comparison to J.J. Abrams's previous effort, I think ""The Last Jedi"" just doesn't hold up. All in all, I'm kind of disappointed with ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", maybe it was due to the high expectations I had for the film, but it just didn't do it for me. It felt way too family friendly, the subplots are mostly unnecessary and could have been easily cut out, the film isn't that rewatchable and it just seemed a bit rushed to name a few things. The scenes between Rey, Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren were definitely the most interesting to watch in the entire film and those actors definitely gave the best performances. The action scenes were also entertaining with the decent camera work and CGI, but I feel the majority of the film was overall still just rather lackluster and played it too safe. The supporting cast isn't as strong as the main cast and some of the interesting plot points established in the previous film, for example where and who Rey's parents are, feel like they are just thrown away in this sequel. Although not quite as terrible as the prequels, this is definitely not one of the best ""Star Wars"" films to ever come out and I would say it's pretty much as good as ""Rogue One"", if not, a little better."
1622,7,"Everyone wants to see something different from this series, but it's one of the best I've seen so far","I was put off with Episode 7... The reuniting of Han and Leia was off putting and awkward. The older cast of star wars is unable to act any other way. In this edition, at least their roles called for it a bit more. I wasn't expecting a joyful meeting among old friends here in episode 8 as I was in episode 7. They played their parts a bit better. The action produced wasn't as intense at the beginning of the movie as compared with most of the OTHER Star Wars films, so it definitely felt slower moving than we're used to. However, some of thew most entertaining ideas that star wars has seen to date were employed. From floating in space without a suit to escape death, to literally teleportation across the galaxy using only the force.... The movie really inspired some age old ideas in new ways, and it turned out fairly well in my opinion. Anyways, I feel like it was a good watch, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm a Christian and am uncertain even FANTASIZING another religion is acceptable, but I'm only in this world, I don't have to be OF it, and star wars promotes that within me as well."
1623,8,The real Star Wars are back!,"TLJ is actually the best episode that has received negative reviewes mostly because of the JJ's initial installment of the sequels trilogy. And RJ really tried to fix all the mess around. This episode has the unique planet, unique species, unique spacecrafts -- basically everything we love SW for! Even a blue milk - is a reference to removed scenes from A New Hope. It's a REAL unique Star Wars episode and not just a parody of the original trilogy."
1624,7,Not as bad as they say.,"Not really bad at all. The ""Force"" has an easier time doing fantastic things like communicating with video & audio over loooooong distances now. Hi Yoda!<br /><br /> The script was condensed so it seems, with more efficiency scene to scene and so the story moved along at a quicker pace. It almost felt like it was too fast, but not quite. Less technical mumbo jumbo in the dialogue too. Got a plan? Been a pilot? An insider or a mechanic? Get cracking everything will work out just fine.<br /><br /> This has very good effects, fine tuned in fact. very professional. A bunch of cool natural worlds (and some animals) that looked great.<br /><br /> Some of the actors we're intense & natural, others contrived.<br /><br /> The twist in the last scene sets up another trilogy of more Jedi kids growing up to fight the good fight. This time they live I suppose."
1625,9,Spoiler free short review,I can make this very easy for people thinking of watching this film...
1626,7,no one will read this bc you have to scroll down 300 times to read more current reviews DUH,No one will read this bc you have to scroll down 300 times to read more current reviews DUH
1627,1,Worst Star Wars movie,Worst movie period. Nothing redeemable with this dumpster fire. Star Wars is Dead and Ruin killed it with Sea Monster Ttty milk. I hope he drowns in his own pee. Episode 9 will fail because of this trash.
1628,9,"Excellent, creative movie. Haters are missing out.","The Last Jedi is a great movie, which is being shouted down by some vocal angry fans. I counted the first displayed 137 reviews on IMDB before I found a positive one, despite it receiving a 7.5 rating. This is because angry fans are up voting the bad reviews so they are all that is seen. The user rating is more accurate and consistent with other sites. Only 1 of my many fan friends did not like it."
1629,7,The Last Jedi Expectations and Story line,"I watched this movie twice before creating a review on it and I think that I have a good overall view as to both a fans perspective and Disney's perspective. The movie overall was a good movie. The visual effects were hands down just amazing and the best in any Star Wars film that's so far been produced. However, the flow of the movie needed a lot of improvements. Comparing The Last Jedi to The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams, Abrams had such a great flow and it made sense of what he was doing and where he was taking the series. I remember being in the theater watching The Force Awakens and the last scene was when Rey was handing the Skywalker lightsaber to Luke. Then in the Last Jedi Ryan Johnson just had Luke toss it and walk away. That was ""the moment"" that we all were waiting for, really! Johnson didn't have a good balance of comedy either which definitely threw me off. How, would anybody think that Luke tossing the lightsaber would be funny and approachable. Disney should definitely step up there game big time in terms of having the movie be produced in a fan's perspective story line, rather than what the director thinks the flow and story line should be. The financials also prove that because the story line was being tampered with, the profit had been severely slashed on a Worldwide bases by $735,615,409. Now 735 Million is a ton of money to loose from one movie transition, so clearly something's changed or isn't working."
1630,1,spits in the face of every fan repeatedly and demands they pay for the privilege,"Words actually fail me at everything they've done to the old characters.<br /><br />i could say its appalling ,its disrespectful, its awful,that the film makers don't get star wars at all.<br /><br />but none of these words comes close to actually seeing this film and viewing this affront for your self.The new actors are bland and terrible just like the last one.Its an achievement that the film, manages to be worse in an entirely different way than the pastiche /rip off feel of the last movie .Beloved characters are changed beyond all recognition and reason,poorly used then disposed of."
1631,9,A terrific addition to the series,SPOILERS
1632,,Disney produces rubbish and is rewarded with £ 1 billion.,"Following on from a poor, uninspired rehash of A New Hope ( The Force Awakens), The Last Jedi puts the final nail in the coffin of a once cherished movie franchise. The plot is bizarre, erratic, but ultimately fairly dull. The acting in the movie is generally poor, with Daisy Ridley delivering lines about "" the force"" that genuinely made the me cringe and wince in my seat. A Star Wars film without a lightsaber fight is like a comedy film without jokes (What's the point ?). I found myself genuinely not caring if Finn killed himself by driving into a laser beam. A sentiment I shared with all the characters in this film. The trotting out of the old cast (Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher) once again demonstrated a true lack of creativity and imagination. Attributes that ought to be in abundance at a company founded on them (Disney). It saddens me to think that the children of today will not be able to experience the same sense of excitement that I felt when growing up with Star Wars movies. Disney have effectively capitalised on the propensity for young children to like lightsabers and on the nostalgia of Star Wars fans. This means that they can produce 1-dimensional , uninspired films and gross over £1 billion."
1633,7,"Better than TFA, but not quite up standard","Ok, so I went to watch this movie hoping that Disney would redeem themselves from the fiasco of The Force Awakens (TFA) and they have managed to SOMEWHAT do that. "
1634,10,Mind blown experience. Love it :),"This is the first Star Wars movie experience that I truly feel satisfied. If you love vivid stories of hope and faith (may the force be with you), then this is the right movie for you."
1635,6,Nothing but a shadow of the legacy...,I am so sorry to say this but please don't make any Star Wars movies anymore.
1636,8,Luke didn't know what to say after watching this movie!,"Impressive,most impressive.After 37 years(The Empire Strikes Back) Star Wars is back.Star Wars:The Last Jedi is a nearly perfect film full of jaw-dropping action scenes,stunning visuals and huge twists and turns.<br /><br /> The film is awesomely directed by Rian Johnson,who achieves to depict his own vision of this beloved universe.The action scenes never miss a bit due to his directing.The film's plot is really effective. lot of things happen that even the hugest Star Wars fan couldn't think of.This movie expands the Star Wars universe and adds new ideas to it in an original, fascinating way.The risky direction that the film takes make it a pure delight.<br /><br /> The performances were really good.Mark Hamill was better than ever,Adam Driver was excellent and generally the whole cast did a great job.The relasinonship between Ray and Kylo is well-developed and although some people<br /><br />found Fin's and Rose's adventure boring or insignificant,but I found it fine.<br /><br /> The third act of the film one of the best moments in Star Wars history.Character's collide,the screen bursts with breath-taking scenes and a lot of questions are answered.<br /><br /> The only flaw was the humor.Despite the fact that I laughed a lot,I have to admit that a lot of the jokes were presented in a way that looked like the film was making fun of itself.But this,in my opinion,is a flaw of minimum importance.<br /><br /> All in all, Star Wars :The Last Jedi is amazing.It's a film to remember.A film which proves that Star Wars is and will always be a part of our history.But,even if it was bad or a failure,It wouldn't worry me at all.Because,as an old master once said:""Failure the greatest lesson is""."
1637,7,Problemed 1st act gives way to a very satisfying finish,"I spent the last several months hoping that the Last Jedi would make more sense than The Force Awakens, Episode VII was, in my opinion, basically a subpar rehash of A New Hope, and I was hoping we might get something out of IIX that captured more of the classic feel that Rogue One had, and not the feeling of a Star Wars fan fiction that VII had.<br /><br />I think we got something somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with the movie was that they didn't take time to make sure every scene had meaning, which honestly shouldn't be surprising. Most movies don't do that, and Star Wars hasn't done that since Return of the Jedi really (although I suppose a case could be made for Rogue One). The 1st third of the movie really felt like a time filler. It gave Luke and Rey their needed scenes, but the other story arc about the Resistance seemed to be mostly a time filler. It was not well executed or thought out, and quite honestly bore very little impact on the rest of the movie. The same end could have been achieved by a much more effective mean. I think it was probably made the way it was to help hold the attention of less mature audiences. Also, the way they dealt with Princess Leia was ridiculous. "
1638,1,Just appalled....,"Not only is this story and script so bad that it makes it hands down the worst but it's also the most commercial and politically correct star wars movie to date period. While I shouldn't be surprised after the force awakens and how high school, pc, and filled with loopholes that movie was the Rogue one movie had some better and more serious acting that gave me a shimmer of hope but boy was it just wishful thinking. Aside from there being so much moments and scenes that just didn't make sense when it comes to star wars the movie also dosen't focus on the main cast and story enough and as it should've but goes out of its way to make it blatantly obvious how politically correct it is. Now its so much more politically correct then TFA that it's cringeworthy at times and scenes will feel more like watching a commercial then a movie. Face it disney's decision to try and commercialize star wars and to push and profit from the pc agenda has destroyed the star wars legacy and shown they could care less about what original fans may think and want or about the legacies of any popular culture they can get their hands on."
1639,10,Not a movie of Heroes.,"People tend to think that Star Wars is about Heroes Vs Villans. It´s not. People already forgot Star Wars IV. Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi was hidden where only a handful of people knew about him. That was the way to keep the galaxy at a ingrateful peace. Yoda too never returned from his deep obscure hideout. Luke made the same option. <br /><br />Ben Solo wanted to be the new Darth Vader... and that´s what he made all the way. <br /><br />On the other side, the movie shows us that ANYONE can be a hero, because each person thinks different. A fighter pilot wants to take out the enemy and survive, even that he loses his entire squadron, if the mission is completed, it was a great mission and the losses are normal. For an Admiral, there are other options and even that nobody cares, it need to hide from any enemy or spies, until the end... even that it costs people lifes but saves much more. That´s something that people tend to forget and want do see victories and defeats. <br /><br />Only the ones that survive can say they where there and lost less than the ones that died. <br /><br />All the movie is based on that. On the 4 acts, that´s the main point of the entire story. Anyone can be hero since everyone wants do survive but only the ones that are cautious can do it and will lose many on that escape. <br /><br />Can´t understand why people bash the movie... because it did the same think that started the IV movie."
1640,7,Here's one for the person who dropped in from outer space to see this movie,"A movie with this much pedigree and expectation gets judged by a high standard. Me, I didn't see any of the other recent Star Wars films (I mean, none of the ones in the last 20 years or so), and I'm going to judge it the way I judge other movies, namely, did I have a good time? Was it better than whatever else I could have watched?"
1641,3,Was this movie written by grade schoolers?,"From the starting scene to the end, it was ass pull after ass pull. The story was nonsensical. It went all over the place, and in the end, we went nowhere. I won't bother going over the story, as many others have already picked it apart. Who read this script and thought it was a good idea? How did we go from ""The Force Awakens"", which was actually enjoyable, to this disaster? Star Wars has just went grade school with this film. In direction, in story telling, in mentality, in every way. Goodbye Star Wars, you will be missed."
1642,10,"I loved it, truly loved it",As a hardcore Star Wars fan - I disagree completely with all these negative reviews. but to each their own right?
1643,,I hate this film.,"I have loved Star Wars since the 1970s and know most of the films by heart, but this film left me feeling sick. The philosophy of the other films was so distorted that I would not allow a child to see it. My favorite characters were destroyed and their replacements were just sad. Finn did not "" stand up"" to the First Order, he was a big chicken. There were no heroes left."
1644,7,Enjoy the adventure with your families as it is intended,"I have read a plethora of ""fans"" reviews for this film prior to writing this. I am sure that the majority were children when the original trilogy was shown in cinemas back in the late 70's and early 80's. These films were originally conceived by George Lucas to be a modern / up to date answer to the Saturday morning adventure serials screened for children at cinemas in the 1930's. The point being they were made for children, his films a loving tribute made by him and updated for the next generation of children to enjoy. I am sure that all fans agree that what he achieved was a phenomenal success and there mere fact that films are still being produced today over 40 year later stands testament to this. Unfortunately I find, unlike George Lucas, these fans are unwilling to pass this experience (a child friendly movie) on to the next generation of children (their families) and choose to overanalyse and criticise every plot turn and character arc. I believe a conscientious effort has been made by Rian Johnson to placate fans whilst essentially keeping true to the films original intention which was light hearted, escapist adventure for children. Sure there is peril in the original trilogy which gives weight to the hero's undertaking but above all else it is a family oriented adventure story, suitable for children to watch unsupervised."
1645,9,BEST film in the franchise next to The Empire Strikes Back,"As an old fan who saw the original in '77, The Last Jedi is a STAR WARS masterpiece. Forget all you know...or think you know! This movie is visually stunning and sucks you into it's story from the get go. With 8 movies in, TLJ contains some of the greatest moments in the franchise...hyperspace kamikaze, Yoda's lesson, Rey / Kylo team up, Luke's Force projection and demise. I can go on and on. <br /><br />I think the backlash is coming from fans who spend too much time in fictional universes whether it's reading hundreds of books and comics, endlessly playing video games, or playing dress up in a Darth Vader costume. It would seem the 'regression' is creating a sense of story ownership. To borrow the line from Mystery Science Theater, ""...it's just a show (movie), I should really just relax.""<br /><br />The Last Jedi is on par with The Empire Strikes Back. Don't miss it!"
1646,6,Enjoyable with a questionable plot.,SW - The Last Jedi.<br /><br />*Spoilers*
1647,9,Why you heff to be mad?,"The Last Jedi has gained notoriety for the ""fan"" backlash it generated. However, much of this criticism is, in my opinion, undeserved. Sure, it wasn't perfect, and there were definitely elements I din't like. For instance, the scenes on Canto Bight felt just a bit too prequel-y for my taste and Finn and Rose's entire subplot ends up being kinda meaningless, but these are really just nitpicks. The visual effects and score are phenomenal. The performances are executed perfectly. Each twist manages to feel unexpected without being completely random. The plot is both interesting and very memorable. And Luke's death, one of the scenes that has ""fans"" worked up the most, is satisfying and feels like something Luke would do."
1648,6,Worst Star Wars movie,I'm so sad about this movie. 
1649,1,Pesudo Star Wars,"BAD!!! It has a great team behind it (excluding Director and story writer R. Johnson and producer K. Kennedy) but even with the John Williams musical score, special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic, a good cast of actors (even getting Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher to make a return appearance, although Hamill himself says that he could only think and pretend he was playing a Pseudo-Skywalker with what R. Johnson has done to the character) who act their asses off, the film still manages to be the biggest TURD in movie history (thanks to the story by Johnson and his direction) WOW every franchise has its poor installments but never thought it would happen to Star Wars (thanks K. Kennedy and of course R. Johnson) ."
1650,9,A Proper Turn in the Industry,"May the force be with you. As it is in this film it's full of force and power as this movie is a beast. A non stop action packed movie with one of the strongest narrative pieces since ""Empire Strikes Back"". This multi part story keep anyone who's slightly paying attention intriguing and wanting more. And for the die hard fans it delivers with such 'force' it moves you emotionally. "
1651,7,little bit disappoint . . . . . . . . .,"Before i start to review this film, I wanna tell everyone that I' m a star wars fan since I was 15 years old, I just saw The last jedi about 5 hours ago. However, I have many point to review after I saw this film.I will separate are both of disappointment and impression. Let me talk about my disappointment to this film before impression.<br /><br /> For my disappointment, firstly,after saw this film, I still not clearly know that who is ray's parents , there are many questions about ray's parents after The force awaken was released , and I expect that this film will give a good answer to me. Unfortunately, look like this issue is not important for this film, I believes that many people disappoint about this .<br /><br /> Secondly, Supreme reader Snoke in The force awaken look seriously mysterious and so powerful character , It hard to believe that he quickly to die. In my opinion, writer should tell about the origin of Supreme reader Snoke more than this and audience should have opportunity to see his power of dark side and fighting more than this .<br /><br /> Thirdly, the scene that encounter between Luke and Kyro len, before I saw this film, I considerably expect that I have to see dual-lightsaber seriously scene between both of them like The phantom mance (obi wan vs. darth maul scene). Unfortunately, disappoint again for this scene.<br /><br /> Fourthly, the humour in this film is not funny enough to audience.I notice from interact of many people who watched the last jedi at the same time with me in theater , when some humour scene arrived, the audience have completely quiet.<br /><br /> Fifth,I think Sound directors,they reduce bass sound of lightsaber, especially lightsaber sound while Rey have swing her lightsaber in training scene, that made me not impressive <br /><br /> For my impression in this film, firstly,I really appreciate that they bring Yoda, jedi master come back to this movie. It very surprising for me, Furthermore,I will very surprise more if they bring Obi-wan kennobi come back to joint with them.<br /><br /> Secondly, I think the location where they chose for this film is amazing place also including amazing animals in this film such as crystal fox, porg and other, I like so much.<br /><br /> Thirdly, Fighting scene both of Kylo ren and ley to encounter with the group of red guard knights.It is a novelty of fighting scene in Star Wars movie that I like also.<br /><br /> All of my reviews above, maybe someone disagrees with me, sometimes I think i expect too much about this film. However, I really expect that Abrams will create Episode 9 as I expect. And Finally, I still love Star wars movie and I will continuously watch about Star wars universe."
1652,3,Did this movie try or not?,"It was very hard to know if they actually tried to make this a good movie or just a product. Ryan Johnson might have been trying to do something, and that's what ruined it. When a main story is started and you make a trilogy, you have to keep the original storyline it wanted to do, and the people that made it. The Force Awakens was alright, but this was just bad in many areas"
1653,10,"The Last Jedi is different from all the others Star Wars movies, and this is what makes it great","This movie goes where no other on the franchise has gone it. It takes serious risks to moving on with the story of the new characters. That's the point guys. Star Wars is moving on to a new cast, and once the fans understand this, I think we will all be able to enjoy the new Star Wars."
1654,,No mark under five should be taken seriously!,"People giving movies these low scores should be given a criteria to mark against. The special effects alone are worth a better score than three. If they are not happy with the storyline then they can mark it down. The acting, costumes and music deserve a few points so already we have at least five. Just the atmosphere at the Star Wars with the history and characters make non sci fi viewers like Star Wars. <br /><br />I saw the very first one when my children were young so each one evokes memories for me. I did enjoy the movie and it was a family celebration which made it special. Was it the best Star Wars film, well obviously not, but it was also not the worst one.<br /><br />Would I recommend it to others, of course, go without huge expectations but look for the Star Wars themes, costumes, much loved characters never to be seen again, music and the overall emotional aspect that brings back Star Wars fans again and again."
1655,7,little bit disappoint ....,"Before i start to review this film, I wanna tell everyone that I' m a star wars fan since I was 15 years old, I just saw The last jedi about 5 hours ago.

However, I really expect that Abrams will create Episode 9 as I expect. And Finally, I still love Star wars movie and I will continuously watch about Star wars universe."
1656,10,Unfortunately Not For Everyone...,"For me however it worked on all cylinders. It's fast, fun, flashy, beautifully directed (some great wide shots), great acting (Mark Hamill is amazing), John Williams is on point, it dives deeper into the force, taking many risks all while keeping quiet on Rey's lineage to keep us guessing until the third installment or maybe never. I still don't trust Kylo when he said what he said about Rey's parents, I think he'd say anything to get Rey to join him.<br /><br /> This film played with ideas that haven't yet been seen in other Star Wars films and I believe that's what the majority disliked about it. Myself and still many others enjoyed the change in plot formula instead of retreading old ground. No it's not perfect like anything else, but it works. <br /><br />A familiar face pops it to teach Luke about failure. The failure he speaks of apparently ""ruined"" a lot of fans childhoods. Some will accept this and some won't, there's no right or wrong answer but I do believe Luke is human like the rest of us and makes mistakes. Similar to the mistake he made when Vader spoke of his sister and how Vader wanted to turn her to the dark side. As we know Luke didn't like that and out came some anger filled aggression against his father cutting off his hand and besting him to the ground almost killing him. So in my mind Luke has those tendencies and what he almost did to Kylo to save the greater good didn't bother me but like I said everyone's different. <br /><br />TLJ has more to say than previous SW films. It dabbled in Hope again a couple times and that's okay, that's what these movies are about...ragtag teams joining forces and believing/hoping they'll be able to defeat what lies ahead of them. In the same vein the last scene of this film was unexpected but very welcomed. I Hope the next episode is as good as this one."
1657,6,Predictable.,"Star wars is now a cash cow. There isn't much too tell, not much to make up, specially nowadays where you cannot hurt anybody's feelings and risk a social media or media boycott, but it still sells, so lets make another movie. No, several. And some spin offs. As a result, the viewer gets more and more disappointment... Star Wars Episode VIII is an absolutely predictable film. Everything that happens, a non brainless viewer can anticipate it. The better thing to do is not use your brain at all, because you start to raise questions, the little pleasure in watching it is gone. For instance, how does a character survive adrift in outer space, with no suit, gets back to the half wrecked ship, a door opens and she gets in. Do not try this at home, or better, at an aeroplane, because if you do it everything will be sucked out and the structure will most likely implode. So the movie is a mimic to ""The empire strikes back"", more alien bar scenes, more gullible characters on the good side dwelling with issues, much more funny pets and robots Disney can sell as merchandise, CGI, CGI and more CGI and no creative spark at all. Very little plot. Very little novelty. Even Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher performances are (and I am very sorry to say this) feeble. Has a saga fan (and Sci-fi fan) I keep going to the movie theatre to watch these movies but this one may have been the last, has I keep getting disappointed. I enjoyed episode IV, V and VI, a long long time ago in a far age, I was a kid. As an adult its a little bit more difficult."
1658,10,Simply put...,A film about letting go of the past and embracing the future for an audience who can't let go of the past and is fearful of the future.
1659,6,I still perfer the Yoda in The Revenge of the Sith,The puppet version of Yoda is so disconnected with the rest of the film. And the casino.
1660,5,Very poor effort,This poor attempt to recapture the episode VII fun has fallen short as nothing but a borderline offensive attempt to subversify a beloved franchise. 
1661,10,"They're Wrong - It's a Thrilling, Mind-Blowing Delight","It took a while before it dawned upon me that there, shockingly, seems to be quite a number of folks out there not liking this and being loud about it. Which, apart from being incomprehensible, is just sad. So here's just a plea - never mind the haters and go make up your own mind about it, because you simply don't want to miss this. Here's why:"
1662,7,It was relatively enjoyable(some minor spoilers),"I enjoyed certain aspects of this film like the connection between Kylo Ren and Rey but damn, I hated that entire Finn storyline. It felt like absolute padding to make the movie longer and to add a social justice warrior vibe to the story."
1663,2,What could go wrong?,Mary Poppins
1664,8,To all those giving this less than 4/10,"If you hated the film, that's absolutely fine - but it can't get anything less than 4/10. Why? Because you have to look at the whole production with honesty and be fair. Break it down into its basic components and come up with something sensible. For example:<br /><br />For a scale of 1-10"
1665,,Entertaining and not as evil an entry as made to be,"I went into film being a huge Star Wars fan since A New Hope. The bashing the film gets is unwarranted. Rian Johnson took things into a new darker direction. If you go into a Star Wars film of all films to analyze it to death of course there are going to be a lot of disappointments and disagreements. Watch it and enjoy it for what it is, a form of escapement. Growing up I did not like The Empire Strikes Back for its dark overtones and what I thought was the killing of my favorite character in Han Solo. Since I've become an adult and have seen in hundreds of times I don't care about plot holes like is Lando's security cyborg still locked up in tower with stormtroopers while they escaped. "
1666,6,Really unsure about this...,"This really didn't seem like a Star Wars film to me. Yes, it was exciting. Yes, it was beautifully shot. Yes, it had recognisable characters. But there was something missing. That special thing that makes a Star Wars film a Star Wars film just wasn't there for me. Shame really."
1667,10,"A film, the world was not and is still not ready to see.","There is things I can't stand, nevertheless i actually LOVE every second of this movie and it's deleted scenes."
1668,7,Total Blasf,"Many fans didn't like The Force Awakens for not taking risks, this film takes risks and they are bold, sure they don't always turn out the way you had expected but this is still an enjoyable film and I can't wait to watch it again!"
1669,10,A little different than other SW movies but very great,Yesterday I went to the cinema to watch te movie twice.
1670,7,"Cringed while watching Episode VII, but I liked this",I'll be brief. This installment is good enough for me to be wanting to see again The Force Awakens in the future (already an achievement by itself).
1671,1,"Deeply, awfully bad","Even more of a legacy-killer than The Phantom Menace. It set JJ Abrams up with the impossible task of making The Rise of Skywalker a memorable, enduring film. So many engaging narratives that were presented in the Force Awakens were tossed aside like garbage. So many amazing possibilities for ushering in a new era for Stars Wars dissipated after day one of this film's release. The business interests in charge of the Stars Wars franchise took a risk in making a non-cannon film that veered from existing storylines and stomped on character legacies, and it did not pay off. This maligned film nearly killed Star Wars as a cultural phenomenon. If not for the Disney offshoots, like the Mandalorian and Andor, Star Wars would be nothing more than a 20th Century memory that people used to love."
1672,8,Just enough good stuff,The scenes between the characters of old make this movie worthy of Star Wars. But there is far too much of Laura Dern's and crew female empowerment political bull and Abram's need to limit white males in the name of racial equality.
1673,6,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Useless Character Build Up,"I usually mock the people that complain a lot in every movie that comes out, mainly cause you can't expect the same result again and again.<br /><br />When Force Awakens came out, I love it so much and I considered it a new Trilogy rather than an original Trilogy copy-cat."
1674,1,Terrible,"What in the hell was this garbage? It's like everything that was built in The Force Awakens was thrown away and the laziest answers for legitimate questions were given. Characters feel as though they reverted back to their old selves in the beginning of The Force Awakens and any character development from that film was tossed out. The movie feels like an hour and a half chase scene with a pointless 30 minute social commentary segment that felt like Hollywood propaganda, and another 30 minutes of constant unnecessary exposition. Force powers are distributed as though anyone can pick their powers put of a hat and use them, all lore established in previous Star Wars movies is contradicted, and beloved characters just die for no reason and are barely even mentioned after their deaths. This was one of the most disappointing movies of 2017 and one I couldn't even review until now because of how shocked I was. I thought that the bad reviews after the film released in theaters were just from a bunch of angry ""fans"" who didn't like anything but the original trilogy and were just nitpicking, but for the first time, I agree with the fans. This movie was just bad, and I don't know where this trilogy can go from here."
1675,10,"Amazing Movie, bad user reviews are ultra sensitive nerd rage","The Last Jedi is definitely tied with Empire as the best Star Wars film of all time, no question about it. I loved everything about this movie. The acting was great all around, especially from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. The special effects were superb and the filmography was the best in any Star Wars Movie. This is a beautiful movie. Rain Johnson has a unique style that worked so well on smaller budget projects (A few of the best Breaking Bad Episodes, Looper) and explodes with splendor here. The plot is unexpected and perfect, not only for the overarching Star Wars mythos but also for the era and circumstances surrounding this movie. This is the Ninth feature length Star Wars movie. If you want the same old tired rendition of this space opera you have eight other movies you can watch. The Last Jedi is fresh and exciting and pumps a ton of creative energy into the series, on par with Lucas at his prime. The bad user reviews are just ultra sensitive nerds who came into this movie wanting it to go a specific way. They try to point out plot holes in their reviews as reasons it's bad. Come on! Literally every movie ever has plot holes if you nit pick it apart and most of the plot holes I've heard people complain about in this movie can be rationalized through internal Star Wars logic or by the filmmakers choice on direction. The Last Jedi is where Star Wars needs to go, if not it will diminish into mediocrity by rehashing the same old stories again and again. Kudos to you Rian Johnson. You have made Star Wars important again on a story level."
1676,,Ridiculous Plot Points,Ridiculous Plot Points
1677,6,I hope I'm wrong,"I am a giant Star Wars fan so it is hard to be objective when rating these movies. I feel like Rian Johnson dropped the ball on this chance to show how bad ass Luke with the force. The vision the director had for the film did not come to fruition. Hopefully I watch it and see that I missed the point, but for now I'm bummed. Help us JJ Abrams you're our only hope!"
1678,8,Star Wars The Last Jedi,"The Last Jedi, the latest entry in the Star Wars saga, picks up where The Force Awakens (2015) left off with protagonist young jedi trainee Rey locating and meeting jedi master Luke Skywalker who had disappeared years since the rise of villain Kylo Ren and the creation of the First Order. Skywalker had intentionally disappeared to die in solitude, living in shame of failing his nephew Ben Solo and responsible for his fall to the dark side. As Rey seeks his guidance in the Force, the Resistance led by Princess Leia prepare for a grand assault by the First Order all while Kylo Ren struggles with his identity as he goes down the path that will seal his destiny. "
1679,6,mixed feelings (spoilers),"If u like star wars, u should watch this but honestly it felt like any other star wars movie...."
1680,9,Compelling watch!,"We met Luke Skywalker 40 years ago in Star Wars: A New Hope, and while many thought fan favorite Hans Solo would be the central character of the trilogy, it was actually Luke's journey that formed the crux of the original trilogy- from a peasant to a rebel and then to a Jedi. He defeated the Empire back in 1983 and disappeared, only to make an appearance in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as the last Jedi. Or not?"
1681,7,"Good, not great, but also not horrible (an even-handed review)","It's as though they where pitched a softball over the plate, while playing against a 5-person softball team, and yet only managed to hit a double (we've all been there though, haven't we?). But the movie doesn't strike out, and it is able to score better than a single. "
1682,4,Hopefully the last Star Wars movie.....,Having seen The Last Jedi I can fully appreciate why George Lucas did not want to make any more films in the Star Wars universe. 
1683,9,Superb,"Loved its not full of clisché scenes, loved new staff, unpredictable story, actors performances, bright and funny dialogs, looking forward to third masterpiece"
1684,7,mildly disapointed,"Like all great franchise movies, sometimes they lose the thread and have to be rebooted. I thought thats what was going on after the previous film, and was legitimately giddy of how well it was. This film however had me questioning why I even bothered going. Its not horrible mind you, its truly not. I rated it a 7 because the 2nd half of the film carries the 1st half. There were some funny one liners and well a few funny scenes that got a chuckle. Seeing Yoda on screen again was awesome, even though short lived. Here is the thing though. I know I am not the only one who went to see this film thinking there would be more Luke Skywalker, perhaps training a Rey, passing onto her secrets of the force and how to wield its power, going through that awkward phase as he did trying to come to terms with what he had. There was hardly anything, and for that I am so disappointed. This film could have been great, with just a little more effort and thought. I recommend waiting till it comes out on DVD."
1685,1,Garbage which ruined a classic legacy,Really surprised how crap like these get such high rating in IMDB ?
1686,10,"Amazing, surprising and the best Star Wars movie....","I was so thrilled and excited to see this one after Force Awakens and to my delight it fulfilled my expectations and got beyond.<br /><br />First of all the movie is brialliantly shot and the scenes have a depth and are almost every time eye-pleasing. Mark is just amazing as Luke once again and carrie's leia finally gets some justice to her role. <br /><br />I can see why this movie is getting some hate from the fans but they are not able to see how this movie changes the Star Wars universe, the movie finally takes some bold risks and shows what the force always should've been. It is surprising and unpredictable at every scene and that's the best. It's not the Star Wars we fans got used to but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's a new generation of Star Wars and it's going to last long."
1687,,Capitalist right-wing thinking destroys Star Wars too,"Star Wars which stood for hope, selflessness, social justice and peace has been sold down the drain to the sith lords of war, greed, materialism and hatred.<br /><br />A cannon of fraternity and freedom has become a tool for magical nonsense, false and fake ideals and making money handover fist for the dark side represented by Disney.<br /><br />All capitalists rejoice! Disney, Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson and their collaborators are now churning ourt so-called Star Wars faster than you can say 'rubbish claptrap vomit.'<br /><br />As for those who thought Luke is dead. Worry not. Yes, the real Luke and his ideals are dead, Star Wars is dead, etc. but we all know that Disney will do a computer analysis and bring out Luke again if there is a dollar to be made. Remember that Disney does not care for Star Wars. Where Yoda and Obi Wan said they could not interfere after death Disney has instead resurrected old characters who come back from death and do get involved and do interfere, fight, etc. <br /><br />The Last Jedi is not Star Wars. It is Cash Flow Wars: sealed and approved by Disney accounting and the right-wing cons paying them.<br /><br />People of dignity, integrity and fans of Star Wars will boycott this nonsense."
1688,7,Carrie Made Me Cry: Seriously and I'm a guy.,"OK so I'm crazy.<br /><br />Here is why.<br /><br />Story seemed well laden for character direction and evolve. Even Star Wars evolves.<br /><br />What was horrible was action. Where the hell was the vertical sway like on Ewok bikes? That's the feel that was missing and it sucks. It wasn't a damn lack of story feel and I'll get to that.<br /><br />Where the hell was the dizzying, swirling vertical sway effects. I felt like a watched a damn good Star Wars story but I didn't watch a damn good Star Wars overall movie. Screenwriting outshone direction in this one. Carrie's portrayal was one of a sense of capturing herself in a timeless moment almost as if premonition of real life was driving her. Daisy's was pretty damn good too.Character portrayal was pretty great all around for all characters.<br /><br />Forces better understood and more elaborate, maybe even more sci-fy tech might be coming: heck I don't know where evolutionary direction of this world is going. I could conjecture guess and have fun thinking about the next one usually right away but this one left me thinking the energy of the world of Star Wars was missing a bit. Future thinking seemed to be left uninspired and perhaps maybe that's another lost feel good or bad in the end. <br /><br />In the end of this one the story is very organic maybe too much so for those devoted hopes, assumptions, set standards but the organic action definitely wasn't .there. I think J.J. did better.<br /><br />Michael Lee Burris <br /><br />""I will never stop driving a creative revolutionary wheel of desire and determination always truly needing help along the way."""
1689,8,"Better than Ep7, not as good as Rogue One, still too much ESB in it","So, it was a fun ride. But come on, just like Ep7, they had to make it parallel Ep5 in too many ways: Hoth, Dagobah, space chase, ethnic scoundrel ... they all showed up in Ep8. On the other hand, there was enough originality here to make the film compelling, although at 2.5 hours, it's hard to not keep checking your watch after the first hour. Tips for Ep9: less Finn, less Poe, less Kylo, MORE REY. She and Rose steal this film, truly. Acting wise, maybe this is a minority opinion, but Adam Driver is just a waste of celluloid. He's cringeworthy every time he tries to act. It's a shame Carrie Fisher died, because it would have been nice to see her emerge in Ep9 with Rey and other strong female characters. Hope the Han Solo film is good next year."
1690,7,Good but not a great Starwars movie,"It pains me to say it but The Last Jedi just wasn't a really good movie. Yes it had the big action spectacle, the ships, droind and creatures. The acting was generally pretty good. I did find Carrie Fisher to be a bit bland. The whole story on Crait was totally not needed. an what about Snoke? That was just plain silly to me how his story was ended for no good reason. I was waiting for a good reveal but Rey's backstory was a total let down. Most importantly the story was to full, too many things going all at once. I gave it a 7 for effort."
1691,8,"Shockingly, Surprisingly Good","First, know that I am a gigantic Star Wars fan but I had no plans to see this movie at the theater. I just knew my heart could not handle another disappointment, and it has been decades of disappointment for me, from the prequels to Episode VII and Rogue One. However, my 11 year old son begged me to take him on opening night. I couldn't be happier that he did."
1692,6,Underwhelming and overlong.,"If I have to endure another cantina/nightclub scene in a Star Wars flick, I'm going to burn my eyes out with a light sabre. Sick of heaped-on new characters; not happy with lack of development in the existing characters; plot progression was clunky in several key spots. Checked my watch several times to see if the end was near. Felt like a pretty substantial step backwards towards the first three films."
1693,1,So Bad that now Episodes 1-3 look good,I can not believe that there was a time that Star Wars was so great that I had no problem with going to Ticket Master to get my tickets in advance for Return of the Jedi. 
1694,10,Good,I generally believe that this is a great movie with it's plot twists and great character arcs to lukes peaceful death. Yes I don't think it's a ten but I wanted to trigger these nerds who say it's a 1. And yes it has no plot holes
1695,7,Losing it's Lustre,"While I tend to give SciFi movies a lot of leeway as they tend not to be traditional, dramatic films, the Last Jedi had too many weak spots that kept pulling me out of the Star Wars universe."
1696,1,"Star Wars makes Billions on this movie, yet....","I'm no critic but, disjointed story telling with no regards of any star wars universe before hand, this was a scene to scene mess."
1697,10,This movie will separate the Dark Sided Fans from The one that are with the light.,This will be the movie that will separate Star Wars Fans. The ones of the Dark Side from the ones that are in The Light. 
1698,,A no hope,"After viewing a dramatic, highly anticipated trailer, The Last Jedi proved as a disappointing, lack-lustre film, not capturing the essence necessary to raise the this film to even a ""good""-level like many of the films have soared past. The Last Jedi has mainly a full returning cast, following the basic premise of most Star Wars films: The-Bad-Guys-are-shooting-us-,-what-are-we-going-to-do? sort of thing. Adam Driver performs well as the returning villain, Kylo Ren, accompanied by an emotional performance from Mark Hamill, easily the best actor in the film. New to the stage are the new species of space-penguins, the funny, adorable Porgs, who are like a sidekick for Chewie (who surprisingly wasn't in the film that much) and are a great comedic element for the otherwise boring film. "
1699,7,Nostalgia value for baby boomers--no story,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is full of space battles done with quality special effects, nostalgic moments with characters from the original trilogy, and some well-cast, fresh-blood, star warriors. This two-and-a-half movie is filled to the brim, but it all comes out to me as, not enough."
1700,9,You jedi,This would be a 10 but some parts I dont like so much would be more better some parts i was suprise but it took like one second it would be normal.
1701,6,Would've been a 10 but...,"Take out Rose Tico the idiot, and Holdo the 2nd most pointless Star Wars character, after Rose, then this would have received a 10/10"
1702,10,"Seriously, I loved it. A lot.","Been a sci-fi fan my entire life and while I always liked the Star Wars franchise, I can't say until Rogue One and this entry I have loved it. After watching TLJ, I went back and rewatched all the film's and yep, still think this one is amazing. Now down time, interesting characters, growth of said same characters, the action was amazing. I just flat out loved it. Found myself tearing up in places, laughing in others and cheering at all the right times. This film had a lot of heart. Sad that Rian won't be handling the next one."
1703,6,Too Many Plot Holes and Bizarreness,So many ridiculous things to mention here. Just a few:<br /><br />So now people can just float around space without spacesuits?<br /><br />Gravity no longer needs to be considered?<br /><br />Snokes is incredibly important... and then suddenly NOT!<br /><br />Rey's background is VERY important... and then NOT!??<br /><br />Anyone can now master the Force with NO TRAINING?<br /><br />Far too many stupid plot holes and questions like these... UGH!
1704,5,Hopefully the Last Jedi,Disappointed! This movie took everything thing I loved about Star Wars and told me it didn't matter. Everything is a joke in this movie. Kerry Fisher did not get a proper send off nor did Luke!
1705,8,Hype From Both Sides,"In a strange way, this movie reminds me of the original Ghostbusters. I went to see that with two friends: one who went expecting an action movie but got a comedy, and the other who went expecting a comedy and got an action movie.Both were disappointed. "
1706,6,"Not great, not terrible.","Visually the movie is great,but character development was not."
1707,4,Star Wars: The Last Straw,"So, I wasn't much pleased with the Force Awakens. It was too derivative and too much like a reboot to be considered ""good"". But, like many others, I told myself that the proof of the pudding would be in the next movie, and where that took the story."
1708,9,My opinion on the movie and some of the points most people have a problem with.,"First of all you're gonna watch the movie so don't bother reading reviews just watch it.<br /><br />I personally liked it, unlike most of the people I know that have watched it.<br /><br />Their main points are that things differ too much from the previous movies, i.e. how the characters react. Then again most cried about the last Episode which was, and I quote, 'too similar to A New Hope'. I completely understand why some feel this way as I too felt a bit disappointed back then, what I do not understand is why the same people are currently upset because too much is different. And they are not even correct in their points. I.e. why Luke went into exile following his ""failure"" as a master, when we saw the exact same thing with Yoda. One of the few points I can agree with is that Rey just seemed too strong without any training, that being in combat with a light saber and her control over the force, but that is intertwined with the concept of building a new ""hero and villain"". Anyways I could go on but I have no intentions of addressing each and every point someone has made.<br /><br />The other main thing that that people dislike is all the forced comedy, to that I can only agree. I'm pretty sure they just wanted to sell some merchandise after seeing all those unnecessary scenes.<br /><br />All in all it looks like they are starting a new story with similar characters, I don't know how I feel about another 6-7 Star Wars movies."
1709,,Highly Recommended,"This film I arguably as good or better than The Force Awakens. An enjoyable plot which although uses some basic components of Episode 5. Even if you've only seen The Force Awakens this is an enjoyable film. A humorous, action-packed, enjoyable spectacle for all."
1710,7,"Uneven, but great overall!","If I had to describe my reaction to this movie, I'd say I went though ups and downs while watching but ultimately left the theater satisfied. I'm going to simply give my opinion on three cons and three pros, based on what was actually in the movie. <br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-yes, the canto bight scene sucks. Decent enough concept but too long for too little plot and stupid cgi camels.<br /><br />-The Holdo subplot was frustrating and felt like it was there only to manufacture artificial tension. <br /><br />-The Leia ""space Mary poppins"" scene was an example of good concept, poor execution. I was wowed to see her using the force but was held back by how visually goofy it looked. <br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Rey and Kylo Ren's dynamic. I loved how it evolved from hatred to understanding to heartbreak. Definitely the most interesting new relationship in the series.<br /><br />-Snoke's death and the throne room fight. I was so glad to see Snoke die, I thought he was a boring emperor repeat anyway. I was satisfied to see Kylo actually kill his master and take power like Vader once talked about, and the fight scene was pure awesome.<br /><br />-LUKE SKYWALKER. I personally loved the direction they took the character. We see him beaten down and broken. But along the way we get glimpses of his old self as he encounters R2 and Yoda (two of the most emotional moments of the film). His actions on Crait in the end of the movie were incredibly heroic and inspiring. Overcoming his personal damage to sacrifice himself and buy time for hope to live on. That's what being a hero is all about. It felt like the culmination of all of his jedi training (""a jedi uses the force for defense, never attack""). Fading into the force like Obi Wan and Yoda before him. Amazing.<br /><br />Overall 8/10. I recommend it."
1711,9,A Misunderstood Beauty,"This film was highly enjoyable to watch, the sheer manpower and creativity that went into this is stunning. This movie isn't the one that fans wanted, but it's the one they needed. I think people will come back to this after the trilogy is over and appreciate the story it tells."
1712,6,If the idea was to put an end to the old and usher in the new....,...Rian Johnson and Disney succeeded. 
1713,10,Best since 1980,"The movie rather rates at a 8/10, but since so many people are giving it a 1/10, because it didn't fulfill their childish headcanon. I'll just counter this."
1714,6,Not a good star wars saga continue.,"Director and Writer ,thank you for raping my childhood.And spit on it."
1715,1,Form over function. Shallowness at its prime.,"I have waited two years to make this review... Because I didn't want to just came up with an emotional rant about it. I actually saw the movie three times. I was so thrilled and excited that the first time I leave the theater confounded. My brain was carefully avoiding the fact that I haven't liked it at all. Then the second view gave insights. And then I read all other reviews and opinions and realized it was a massive phenomenon. But the real dissappointment came when I read the reactions of Rian, Kathleen and even Bob Iger: they didn't even realize (or weren't even aware) how they have failed the story, the characters and the fan base."
1716,8,YES!!!,Great movie I loved it. More than I thought it would be
1717,6,A perfectly good Star Wars film,Let me clear: This film isn't as mind-blowingly fantastic like the film critics say.
1718,1,This movie very good if you dont have brain,I dont like why is this movie geetting oscar? Is very very bad. The people live on stupid island and drink from mutated cow. Peoples in this movie always look like maybe they have trouble going to toilet so they have appearance on face like someone who cannot use toilet even if have been sitting on it for long time. So they get really grumpy like small children.
1719,8,A Christmas Treat to the Fans,"At the onset I have to admit I am a Star Wars fan and this review might be slightly biased in this favor. However, I also want to state the fan in me felt satiated seeing the movie and hence the review is a reflection of the same!"
1720,,The line of Skywalker is dead.,So what was the point of the whole OT and PT??? We're all the events that took place useless??
1721,7,"Star Wars is always awesome, but downhill from Disney :(","Well, Star Wars will probably always be good, at least somewhat, it seems to be going downhill at the helm of Disney. Star Wars movies will always be interesting, but they are just not as good without George Lucas at the helm of the movie."
1722,9,Possibly the best one,"In terms of character development and storytelling, Empire may only be slightly better. The fan backlash is completely understandable, though. Especially if you spent three decades investing in toys and sticking them up on the wall, watching Ewok movies hundreds of times, and sucking dry the galaxy far, far away. I adore some of the parts of the expanded universe, like Shadows of the Empire and Knights of the Old Republic. I get it. I do. Those who played all the games and read all the books, did so because they couldn't get enough. Now, even with a freshly wiped slate for a creative playground, it seems many have finally had enough of the Star Wars. It began in '99 with the fan wrath invoked by the prequels, and will cycle on as generational shifts do. I currently still can't get enough, so keep 'em comin' mister Walt's-head-in-a-jar-jar!"
1723,6,cosmic whiplash,"From the first instant, it seems that writer/director Rian Johnson is out to contradict not only the expectations and curiosities generated from The Force Awakens, but indeed undermine much of what we know of the Star Wars cinematic reality. Not that there's anything wrong with that approach. On the contrary, part of what made episodes 1-3 nearly unwatchable was a slavish devotion to old plot devices and gimmickery, a devotion so total that not a single new idea surfaced, and what made The Force Awakens so refreshing was its proficiency with those devices that revitalized them through elaboration. In this sense, that expectations are contradicted right and left in The Last Jedi ought itself be to its credit. But sadly, the baby is too often thrown out with the bathwater. We find an unrecognizably foul-tempered, off-puttingly irreverent Luke Skywalker, whose former boyish charm turned calm mastery had been so central to what made the original story arc of episodes 4-6 compelling. We find the rebellion mocking a clownish imperial army, the former sinister and ruthless intellect of which had posed such ominous threat to our heroes, captured sobelievably in Darth Vader and convincingly cultivated in Kylo Ren, now diminished by ineffective comic relief in the form of General Hux. The rejectionism of The Last Jedi has only a few interesting ideas to offer in trade, namely a doubling down on the feminism so totally and embarrassingly lacking in the original films, and the shrugging off of a nagging, implied sense of elitism whereby the Force had seemed accessible only to a select few of some mysteriously royal lineage. The extent to which such revisions of the Star Wars cosmos are sustainable are perhaps yet to be seen."
1724,10,I enjoyed this!,"I had a really good time watching this. Opening night, my Star Wars friends. It was great!"
1725,7,A rich Disney movie,The movie made me consider the basic elements of a classical Disney movie into the Star Wars universe. 
1726,1,Revisionist Trash,It's as if RJ secretly hates the SW universe and wanted to undermine the entire saga from the ground up by dismantling the mythological underpinnings that give it the form that we've all come to know and love.
1727,9,My review (this is the script for my YouTube review),"First off, I'd like to say that I loved this movie. I saw it five times in theaters and each time I noticed something new. I loved that Poe called Hux, General Hugs, and that BB-8 stole the walker. This is the type of comedy that Star Wars needs. It needs to be funny, to keep the audience interested, but not too funny because then you have, well, Jar Jar Binks. This is my favorite Star Wars movie, and I agree with most of the bold choices they made. It did start to get old after four and five times but you can't only see this movie once. I think two or three is the golden amount for a Star Wars movie in theaters. A lot of people said that it didn't live up to expectations, but I had just as many expectations. At the time of this review, I have watched the official trailer (ya know, the one that starts with ""when I found you"") 703 times! This was an incredible movie, and it makes me excited for the future of Star Wars. I think Star Wars is in good hands and Disney will take it places.<br /><br /> Enough with the overview. Now I'm going to talk about what I loved and what I'd rather them change. I, like many other Star Wars fans, loved anything that happened in Snoke's Throne Room. It was unexpected and very cool. I also liked the reveal of Rey's parents. It shows that Star Wars doesn't have to revolve around the Skywalkers. It shows that almost anyone can use the force. Even though, I think Crait was underused and the chase through space was overused, what did happen on Crait was cool and true to Star Wars spirit and the chase in space added urgency to the situation that makes a Star Wars movie that much better. I think Luke dying added to the story. It showed that it is time to pass the torch and stop pestering over the original movies I, and many others, watched all those years ago. I liked how they had him die peacefully watching twin suns after sacrificing himself to help the rebels escape just like Old Ben did in the Death Star many years before. But every movie has problems, so now here are the things I didn't like about this movie. Number 1 is Leia Poppins. Even though the score in this scene is awesome, the scene isn't as good. It proves everyone's point that main characters have a protection shield. It would have been more powerful and a lot better if it showed her floating there while playing the soft Leia theme and just crossed out the part where she twitches and floats back. Number 2 is Canto Bight. I have no problem with Canto Bight, in fact, I think it's pretty cool. If you're skeptical over Canto Bight, read the Canto Bight novel by John Jackson Miller, Mira Grant, Rae Carson, and Saladin Ahmed. It's really interesting! Anyway, the reason why I didn't like Canto Bight was because it felt forced and out of place. I think they should have reserved Canto Bight for Solo: A Star Wars Story which will come out in May. I think it fits better in Solo than it does in The Last Jedi, considering Han is an avid gambler and smuggler. It would be a cool easter egg, though, if Canto Bight was where Han won the Falcon. Number 3 is Finn. I don't mean the character, I like the character, I mean his ""death"". I think it would be better if that whole part was cut or Finn sacrifices himself. It is a really powerful moment when he goes in for it, but Rose saving him, again, is rally dumb and feels like a main character shield. Either he sacrifices himself or doesn't even try. It feels like the story team was sitting around a table and they couldn't agree, so they compromised and that compromise is really bad. ""It's not fighting what we hate, it's saving what we love."" Yuck! This is Star Wars (emphasis on the Wars), what do you think this is, The Space Between Us?<br /><br /> Overall, though, I loved this movie and I personally cannot wait until it comes out on Blu-Ray and Digital.<br /><br /> That concludes my review on Star Wars: The Last Jedi."
1728,7,"People who dislike this movie, hear me out.","Not saying that people don't have a right to dislike it, just saying that people are overreacting about the movie. No, it is not the worst movie ever made. I can think of several worse movies I could've seen. Being naive enough to say that the reviews are rigged because they contradict your own beliefs is just utterly ridiculous. Yes, there are flaws with the movie, I'm not saying this movie is a masterpiece. I liked this movie because it took itself in a new direction. I like the performances, the cinematography, the characters. There are a few issues with the writing, misplaced jokes, tonal issues and really big pacing issues, however, these issues aren't going to ruin it for me. If they ruin it for other people, that's fine, but don't go around exclaiming that you're right, and everyone else is wrong. And don't call out names and send them hate for working on this movie. Everyone sending death threats probably don't know how painstakingly hard it is to write, direct or act in a feature film. Don't go around worshiping a work of fiction so much, that you believe that people who wrong it deserve to die. There's a way to make an argument without you sounding like a complete idiot. Nobody wants to listen to someone who's mindset is that their opinion is the right one."
1729,1,Your worst Fear. A childhood magic stolen,"""A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away"" Isn't that the greatest single tagline for an epic start to a fantastic story ever? Well, the story is now dead. George Lucas did a magical thing in 1977. He had us captivated and enthralled. It was a fantastic adventure filled with unexpected turns and imaginative storytelling."
1730,9,Enjoyed the movie and had a great time,"I remember going to see Empire Strikes Back in theaters when I was a kid and how big everything seemed. I was only about 7 so some of the details of the plot and the story were lost on me, but I still enjoyed the heck out of it. I also remember going to see Phantom Menace when I was an adult, but I think the big thing I managed to do was avoid almost all the marketing for the movie, so I actually knew very little about it going in and I enjoyed it. No, it wasn't a great movie, but it more than lived up to my expectations, which were pretty mediocre to begin with."
1731,,So much emotional baggage...,The whole movie got better after Luke got better clothes and a haircut.
1732,6,dont watch if you like star wars: quick review,If you watch this film you will be in debt of 2hrs and 30mins of your time. worst star wars film ive ever seen. every major scene was absolutely terrible. I would of been happy if the plot holes were filled but they were just widened. If you want argue your point add me on Facebook Oliver mather
1733,10,"""the true burden of all masters""",Fantastic new tale in an old and sometimes repetitive saga. 
1734,7,"Star Wars good, but not as good with Disney at the helm","Star Wars will always be interesting is some way, just because it's Star Wars, but it will never be as good as when George Lucas was at the helm of everything .... well, because he created it and he had a very creative mind for the story telling behind the Star Wars universe."
1735,10,This Trilogy is the Trilogy in SW!,"JJ, Rian I'm writing this for you both. I love you! I can't thank you enough for this trilogy. The cinematography, characters, laughs, bad ass lightsaber fights along with the beauty of the visuals. The most beautiful films of all time, with the Godfather etc."
1736,7,"Pretty good, but not fantastic.","The Last Jedi was in many ways an enjoyable experience. The story takes unexpected turns, most of which are fine and welcome additions to the story line, but some plot holes, a kind of a DRY subplot, and some remarkably bold decisions made by the writing team leave the audience wanting MORE than what they got out of this movie. This is not exactly what I expected when I walked in the theater to watch this film. Not saying that I was utterly disappointed, but rather a bit surprised by the answers to the questions raised in Episode 7, which is why I think so many are conflicted about this movie. Personally, I didn't feel that my childhood was ""destroyed"" or that Disney ""ruined"" the saga, but I can't disagree with everything the naysayers have to say."
1737,3,Rian Johnson wrote an AWFUL script. Mark Hamill was RIGHT!,"I'll tell ya quickly why The Last Jedi sucks...Aside from the Rey/Kylo ""Force Skype"" which was totally ridiculous. So Luke never got his happy ending, ya see, he struggled SO much - his aunt & uncle were burned alive, his mentor Ben Kenobi is murdered, his hand gets chopped off, his evil father dies. He's had SO much misery, it'd be nice to see him 30 yrs later happy, with a wife & a few kids maybe? But no, it was all for nothing. Luke's reward for all those acts of heroism is to die alone on an Island, never getting married, never finding happiness, & not having any cool lightsaber battles."
1738,10,I know why some people didn't like this movie.,"I know why some people didn't like this movie. When people die and when their decisions have real consequences - you know, there is war going on! "
1739,6,So bad it's good,"This is perhaps the most memorable film I have ever watched. From the moment this started, with the Normandy style bombing, I couldn't help but feel bewilderment. It only continued with the flying Leia and the baffling hypocracy of the casino. Plus everything with luke. I couldn't help but laugh at every baffling plot contrivance they put in. My review may sound negative but anyone that has seen the Room knows how fun bad movies can be. More than the bland and forgettable Force Awakens and the downright garbage Rise of Skywalker, this film comes to my mind all the time. Still a bit boring at times though."
1740,1,Stick a fork in Star Wars,"Imagine a stereotypically ironic & self-absorbed Millennial. Give him utter disdain for the cultural heritage of the original Star Wars trilogy, no humor, a craving for filthy lucre, and complete creative control of Episode VIII. Now take that insufferable little twit and plop him in a Gen X-er's body, and you get Rian Johnson and this movie. "
1741,8,I enjoyed it,"It was a good star wars movie. The action sequences looked good, the acting was convincing. And although there were some cringe moment, it didn't ruin the overall feeling for me."
1742,,I ABSOLUTELY loved it,I have a thing for big-boned Asian chicks and this film bows to diversity and affirmative action and puts one on the screen for us to enjoy.
1743,7,Can't understand the hate! This is good movie,I'm not a Star Wars fanboy but I have watched all the movies and this one is certainly the best one since the 80s. 
1744,9,"Funny, dark, and exciting middle trilogy story","I saw ANH in May of 1977 when I was 19. I think this is why I enjoyed TLJ much more than many of the other user reviews. I think younger viewers who saw the original trilogy or the prequels as children have different expectations that SW will stay true to an expanded universe canon. I don't care about any of that. The SW universe is a space opera with wild characters, villains and heroes, moments of distress followed by last second rescues, and a great score. TLJ has all these plus some better acting from Hamill and Fisher."
1745,6,It is a ferwell movie,"If you saw Lost, then this is a version of Lost but with jedis.<br /><br />It has a magical island, a cave at the bottom, dark and white everywhere, things that only some can see.<br /><br />Also the last Lost movie where they said farewell, this is the same atmosphere, same gestures, good byes everywhere...<br /><br />And coincidence - it has the guy who did Lost producing here.<br /><br />There are more things on the same line but this is a ferwell movie to all we knew about star wars. They were prisoneers to very spciffic things and they did this to say a big good bye to all - we are making our own star wars from now."
1746,9,"""It was awesome except for when it was kind of dumb.""",THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW
1747,7,Overall a good star wars sequel,I have watched all Star wars movies and over the year each group of artists have changed the tone of the movie in every decade. So people may see each movie differently. I loved the movie and I cannot give it anything below a 7. I enjoyed it. Thanks.
1748,1,A truly terrible film.,"A confused and inconsistent waste of potential. Everything wrong with Episode 7 dialed up to 11, and then turned on it's head for good measure."
1749,8,I really enjoyed it in spite of some flaws,"It seems obvious that a bunch of angry trolls are spamming the reviews here. I found the film moving. I like the characters in The Last Jedi and their motivations make total sense to me. The good far outweighed some odd choices and Disney-ish subplot details that didn't quite work for me. The ""off"" parts didn't ruin the experience for me and the best parts are as good as the best parts of any previous Star Wars film. I already have tickets to see it again."
1750,7,Disappointing..,"Maybe my expectations were too high.. Throughout the entire film I felt a sense of disapointment. I left feeling empty. The film felt thrown together, rushed and confusing. It did not flow. I hope JJ can pull all the strings together again."
1751,1,Awful film,This film is an insult to the people who have adored Star Wars since 1978 (like me) or those people who experienced it from childhood later on.
1752,10,The Star Wars movie we didn't know we needed,"*Minor spoilers*<br /><br />I am not going to give a detailed analysis of the movie here. It is obvious that people have loved and hated it in equal measure. I am just here as a casual viewer, who has not read these comics and was only mildly keen on watching this movie, until I went and saw it the day it released. I couldn't resist the Force (sorry). Even now, four days later, it is all I can think about. I did not read any review before booking the tickets and thank God I didn't cause I would've missed a great movie. The movie had me glued from the theme song and I did not want it to end. Every scene was beautifully shot and performed, especially the Force Bond ones between Ben/Kylo Ren and Rey and my favourites were the team-up and Luke's ""deception"". The light speed explosion was visually stunning. Kudos to the visual effects team. I must congratulate Rian Johnson and all the cast and crew for taking such a huge risk and pulling it off tremendously well. Haters are going to find faults anyway and although I have read some of their views, they fail to mention why exactly they hated it, and frankly, I don't give a damn. For me, The Last Jedi is the movie of the year (sorry, Diana) and an epic sequel to the Force Awakens in terms of character and story development. I am very excited for Episode IX."
1753,,Ignore the Cellar dweller nerds. Fantastic movie,What's bunch of nerd whiners!!! Fantastic movie with great action set pieces!!!<br /><br /> Leia did not fly children. She used the force to pull herself toward the ship and survive the rigors of space for a few minutes. Luke projects an illusion of himself to fool Kylo. The ultranerds would have you believe that this is impossible because we've never seen it before. This is a made up power so now we know they have this ability. See.....logic and immobile sense. Also Leia supposedly NEVER showed those powers. Stupid nerds; that was 30 years ago. Who knows what she's learned and how powerful she's become. <br /><br /> So the dreadnaught gets destroyed by oh powerfully constructed bombs. We've no idea what they're made of. You but the logic of adamantium don't you?<br /><br /> Luke who for all we know changed tremendously in those 20 years. So he had a weak moment because he felt the darkness in Kylo ( much improved performance BTW ). He still wasn't going to through with it. Rey's parents turned out to worthless nobodies. Great twist. Vader's Mother has no powers either. So don't go there.<br /><br /> No light saber battle. So what? A fantastic battle with (one can assume ) extraordinarily trained guards. Rey saved Rylo but he dispatched most of them. Snoke is his arrogance and self assurance didn't sense the lightsaber about to kill him. I could go on forever. Now there were some bad parts. The whole Casino subplot sucked. They should have let Finn die. Phasma was again a nonentity and Gleeson as Hux was way over the top. Leia in space was a stretch but these are minor quibbles. Stupendously entertaining movie but judge for yourself and ignore the cellar dweller nerds. My family and I are eagerly awaiting the next one!!!!
1754,6,An imperfect glimmer among the darkness of Disney's malice,"Let's face it. The Last Jedi was decent, a tiny oasis in a wasteland-- but it was a faint heartbeat in a cadaver with maggots feasting on its eyes. Star Wars is dead. Disney Killed Star Wars. George screwed up yes, but it was ineptitude, not purposeful ill intent. Bob Iger, Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams however, are pure malice. They don't want a cultural luminous myth, they want shape-shifting political allegories. They want a venue where they can manipulate youth into their own mold of 'useful'. They don't want a singular vision leading the stories anymore, they want focus groups and popularity bastardizing everything it stands for."
1755,9,One of the best star wars films,"This films honors the complexity of characters, especially those deemed ""villains"". Character is not sacrificed for skeptical, which I think is often the case for the JJ Abram star wars films. This film gave me hope. It gave me new perspectives on characters and found myself to see myself within characters of the dark and light side."
1756,7,mixed feelings,"I have to say, that overall the movie is in my opinion not as bad as some reviews suggest here, but it also isn't really good."
1757,10,It's cool to be a hater,"I thought ""The Force Awakens"" was ok. If it had been marketed as a reboot of the series I would have liked it much more. I went in expecting something new and was surprised and disappointed when it was simply ""A New Hope"" with a different cast. I felt nothing for ""Rouge One"" as it was to me simply an action movie set in the Star Wars universe. The Vader scenes were awesome, but those five minutes could not make up for an entire movie of stuff I did not care about."
1758,7,Not nearly as bad as people say.,"Far from a perfect film but not as bad as the reviews make it.<br /><br />Among other flaws, the Canto Bight sequence was indeed bad, Finn's character development was stalled and the ""long pursuit"" was a long dried up sequence that dragged too much and could have been solved if the characters just talked openly.<br /><br />This movies has some interesting concepts though. The Luke Skywalker dealing with failure and reluctancy to come back to the front was a good take at a previously ""perfect"" character. It added depth to him.<br /><br />The killing of Snoke was an interesting step that should have put Ren in a irredeemable path to the dark side.<br /><br />The fact that Rey's parents were nobodies was refreshing and a cool way to open up the Force to somebody outside the same families (anyone can be powerful independently from the origin).<br /><br />The take on war profiting was also interesting.<br /><br />Too bad some plot points were dropped by the next movie which weakened the entire sequels. If only Disney wouldn't bend to the fans online and had continued with the path this movie started, we might ended up with a much more solid and satisfying sequel sequence.<br /><br />Bottom line, flawed movie with some interesting concepts and some cool action. Not nearly as good as the original trilogy but better than the prequels (at least Ep.I and II)."
1759,2,"First we had the Episode IV plagiarised, now it's Episode V's turn","Well The Last Jedi was better the 'The Farse Awakens' (see my review of it to understand), but it wasn't great.<br /><br />Where Episode VII was a rehash of Episode IV with elements of the other films thrown in, this was very similar to Episode V with elements of the other films thrown in."
1760,9,The best Star Wars movie ever made.,"Filled with new concepts, revolutionary ideas that are leading the universe in the correct direction. We can all have the force. The Jedi Order was a cult, a cult of ego, and Luke realized that. This movie is incredible.. Incredible.. The haters are fan boys that wanted an OT copy."
1761,6,Not sure why I keep buying tickets to formulaic Star Wars movies,"Not a devoted follower, but I enjoyed the originals. Can see why the true fans would be disappointed. The plot didn't really make sense, it was overlong, and Luke Skywalker cuts a sad figure. Would give 6/10. Why do I keep buying tickets?!"
1762,1,The End of Star Wars,"Star Wars the Last Jedi is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. The plot is dumb, stupid, and boring. The acting is bad. The characters introduced in the last episode disappoint. Luke Skywalker is terrible; his characher that was developed in the original trilogy ruined. Overall, the movie is mediocre and a waste."
1763,9,Different but Fantastic!!!,"Wow! I remember walking out of the theater thinking ""That movie took everything I thought was going to happen, and gave me something even better""! Here's what I expected to go down.<br /><br />I did expect that Luke would be a grouchy old man at first but would soon come around to help the resistance. I loved this and thought it added even more to his character. His thoughts of attacking Kylo I found even better. Luke always had a connection to the Dark Side. Especially shown when he battled Vader on the Death Star. However, just when he was about to go too far, he realized that what he was doing was wrong. I found this moment reflective of that scene and showed a more human side of Luke.<br /><br />The throne room scene caught me completely off guard however. I expected that kylo would hold off Snoke so he and Rey could escape and regroup with the resistance, leaving Snoke tone the leading villain of Episode IX. When Kylo ignited the lightsaber and KILLED Snoke my jaw hit the floor. The film lets us believe there is hope for him yet, until he says, Rey, Join me and we can rule the galaxy. It's heartbreaking but it just seems right.<br /><br />Luke's death I found very appropriate. He went out saving the cause he believed in and the final scene before he fades away is beautiful. He looks out into the sunset as the wind blows through his face, calling back to where he was in Episode IV, showing how much he has grown since his youth on Tatooine. It's a beautiful scene that I think many overlook.<br /><br />The hate on this movie is absolutely ridiculous. Rian Johnson made a fantastic movie that easily rivals the Force Awakens and opens the door for so many possibilities. The Canto Bite sequence, while it slows down the movie, is nowhere near as boring as the Senate scenes in Phantom Menace. For this film to have only 7.2 stars on this site is ridiculous and shows how butthurt fanboys can get."
1764,,Fantastic movie and Leia did not fly,"I can't fathom these people who cant appreciate a movie just because it didn't cater to their wishes. Leia did not fly. She used the force to briefly keep herself alive in the vacuum and used the ship like a tether to pull herself toward it; not flying. She has 30 years to master or at least learn more on how to use her powers.<br /><br /> As for Luke, just because we never saw a Force user use that power doesn't mean it isn't possible to project an image of yourself over several light years. Who knows what he has dealt with until the scene with Ben. He might have seen nosalvation and had a moment of weakness. He's not a God and not infallible. He still wasn't going to kill him. <br /><br /> The bombs dropped in the dreadnaught could-have contained incredibly destructive powers. We saw in ANH how an X-Wing can avoid the numerous turrets and laser batteries to attack a larger ship. <br /><br /> Yes the casino segment was stupid and boring and why didn't one of the First Order shops just jump to light speed in front of the Rebel ship? We were also cheated with Snoke's background ( for now ). The movie wasn't perfect but incredibly entertaining and certainly a Star Wars movie all the way. <br /><br /> Grow up people. The movie wasn't made for you specifically. As a pure SW fan for 40 years; I loved it and do did my family. I have seen each movie dozens of times and all the animated shows. I have also read over a 60 SW books. Can't wait to see it again and eagerly awaiting the next movie."
1765,6,The most chaotic Star Wars movie to date,"I'm dissapointed with The Last Jedi. The film completely destroyed the moral character of Luke Skywalker in an effort to separate this new trilogy from everything that came before in the Star Wars Universe. Out with the old, in with the new... yes, it is necessary to pass the baton, but not destroying everything that came before. I speak about this in a very long review in spanish at my website, if you can read spanish i invite you to go ahead and read it... i obliterate the film, even though is very entertaining as a movie."
1766,9,Fab film,"Dont no where the hate for this film comes from, equal to Rogue One and The Force Awakens. Great stuff."
1767,6,This is not the review you are looking for,"Too much negativity from so called fans that never seem satisfied, yet always watch the movies. Having said that I too feel a bit disappointed with the film but not to the point that it ruins the whole franchise. The Rey back story will be answered in the next film. Kylo Ren was just trying to antagonize Rey and manipulate her/mess with her head about her parents, so people need to calm down thinking what Kylo said was fact. The film had some solid acting all around especially Hamil and Oscar Isaac. My biggest beef with the movie though is of course the sudden death and lack of history behind Snoke! So the film basically ensures we watch the third installment because of the questions we still have that are left unanswered."
1768,9,luke skywalker is the best,"Everyone's hating on him, but the way I see it what he is only natural. It's real. Not every super hero is perfect."
1769,6,Either you love this movie or hate it. I do both,This is my honest review of this movie and it will contain SPOILERS. I maybe change my opinion about things later but this is how I feel about it for now. In this review I'm discussing things that standed out the most to me. This review includes my first impressions and more in depth thoughts.
1770,1,It's like drinking dull dishwater,I was 5 years old when I first saw the original Star Wars in the theaters in 1977 and have been a fan ever since. I loved the originals and the prequels. I thought Rogue One was great. I thought The Force Awakens had enough promise when I first saw it.
1771,10,Best film of 2017,This film is one of the best film in Star Wars. I've seen it so many times it's that good.
1772,6,Star Wars The Last Jedi:We hope it's the last disappointment in the trilogy,"As Star Wars fan I really love the franchise and I believe that George Lucas created a whole universe with its own culture that no one has made before. In The Last Jedi the expectations were really high giving how great was The Force Awakens, but to me it's a real disappointment when comparing it to all the previous episodes. I list here some of the issues that really bothered me. "
1773,1,Worst Star Wars Film I've yet seen.,"This is the worst Star Wars film I have seen as of writing this.<br /><br />The Prequels are much better than this... and you know what that means if you are a Star Wars fan.<br /><br />Hopefully the next film in this trilogy will redeem this B.S., but I doubt it."
1774,10,My Favorite Star Wars Movie,"The Last Jedi is a perfect Star Wars movie. Everything about it is absolutely fantastic. The acting is phenomenal, the story expands the plot of not just the new trilogy, but of all of Star Wars in general. It challenges what we know and gives us a new take on Star Wars for a new era. Not to mention that visually this movie is absolutely gorgeous! The cinematography is one of my favorites! I adore this film and I hope one day fan will be able to appreciate how wonderful it truly is."
1775,,Most expensive SW parody,Nothing more to say. Hope Lucas gonna trick Disney gnagsters somehow to creata sth really connected to Univesre he created
1776,6,fun to watch but disappointing for a star wars fan,"To do justice to the movie, it is probably fun to watch - unless you are a star wars fan. if you are, then don't watch it; just wait until episodes 7 & 8 are removed from the star wars timeline and completely re-written."
1777,10,Best Star Wars movie since the Empire Strikes Back,"This is by far the best Star Wars movie since the original except for the Empire Strikes Back. I never thought I would actually sincerely say this ever again, but the The Last Jedi is the best movie I saw this year. Not just the best sci-fi or the best action but the best motion picture! Thank you, Rian Johnson, from the bottom of my childhood!"
1778,6,Too much Disney,"I found the movie to be too much 'Disney' in the form of it not embracing the darker side of the Star Wars universe. Much effort has gone into keeping the children-safe, clean and perky. The result is, that the funny one-liners are just too much, and very often with bad timing. The darker side of the movie is simply over-run by cute space-aliens. This movie does not feel like its made with love, respect and a deep understanding of the Star Wars legacy and universe, but rather as the best culturally- and political safe-mode movie a billion dollars could buy - and I frankly find that not just boring, but also sad. It's not bad - it's just not Star Wars. It's a barbie doll."
1779,8,Very good,"I thought this was really good, definitely one of the better Star Wars. It baffles me why so many didn't think so."
1780,7,Better appreciated a second time,"While this is not the best Star Wars movie, it isn't the worst either like a lot of people claiming. The are unnecessary plot developments but there are are lot of positives in the way the story and charactors are developed. In real life there are no perfect heros, people make mistakes, they fail and that is what is brought into charactor of Luke. To me the Luke here a more realistic charactor. Plans rarely work as we hope, even if at all. The whole diversion with Finn and Rose demonstrates, though the romance here does feel forced."
1781,1,What the..?,"Okay first I'm not a huge SW fan, I like them enough, but this one has me perplexed, to quote a famous (and fabulous) movie line ""how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?"" Which is what is sadly going on here, with each new movie the fans are being subjected to the same old same old and nothing new....indeed degenerating story arcs...at this point I'm glad to not be that great of a fan, because I would be totally devastated as are many of the people out there suffering this travesty."
1782,9,The Last Jedi is the latest masterpiece.,"True Star Wars fans will appreciate this film as it tells a truly great story, while creating just enough action to satisfy. It is almost impossible to duplicate the success and originality of the original trilogy, however, The Last Jedi does a great job of keeping the Star Wars tradition moving in a forward direction. While there are some characters that are forgettable, most of the characters are easy to root for."
1783,7,Don't expect too much,"I know that I'm late to the party, considering that I've only watched this movie on the Dutch Netflix. The story is fine, the actors are good, but there is nothing really special about the film."
1784,3,Disney has lost the plot,"Disney has lost the plot. They are no longer making Star Wars movies. I am not sure what Star Wars: The Last Jedi is supposed to be, but it is not Star Wars."
1785,8,not bad,"Highly predictable, but entertaining . too short a review says imdb but i have nothing to add ."
1786,,It is simply enough to say that Star Wars,"Perhaps it is simply enough to say that Star Wars movies are an event in themselves and although the Last Jedi doesn't reach the heights of The Force Awakens- it is a great piece and will sit well with the other movies in the cannon. Although the narrative is weak and there is some padding it can be excused as it usually is the case with middle films of a trilogy. What the Last Jedi has going for it are some fantastic standalone sequences, sequences which are classic trademark Star Wars, and all fans- old and new should enjoy them. (Reminiscent of classic Star Wars- an enjoyable ride)"
1787,6,"Not horrible , but not good either","I'll start with the cons , because there are a lot of them.<br /><br />"
1788,8,"Less pew pew, more story",Some people probaby like SW for the always the same story telling<br /><br />and the same black and white hero schemes.<br /><br />Well I don't.
1789,7,The last Jedi... ?,The last Jedi is not a perfect or a super great movie but it proved that sometimes we really should look at the world from another perspective 
1790,10,Great movie,Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Loved it! Can't wait for episode 9!
1791,7,Rian Johnson made the best star wars movie he could do with a gun pointing at him by Disney...,"If all of you guys who gave ones and twos for this movie are for real,you should have given TFA sub zero..TFA sucked...This movie was much MUCH better than the previous one.I cant start writing why and for what reasons cause it'll take me all night.And that is because i feel i have to answer to all of you guys.No disrespect to any of you.I am a die hard Star Wars fan all my life and i am 40.I have seen all six lucas movies at least 50 times each.The last jedi has its flaws as we were expecting(since disney was the driver) but it was fuller and better than TFA and episode I and II.My verdict is the title of my review..May the force be with all of you.."
1792,3,Probably the worst of the SW films (or tied with Eps 1-2),"Not a particularly entertaining film, Star Wars or not. "
1793,9,Just a great addition to the series (spoiler-ish),"Saw this movie last night in Belgium, part of a movie marathon with The Force Awakens. I found The Last Jedi to be just what a Star Wars movie should be. There's epic battles, great emotion, well done humour and some nice twists and turns. Acting was really top notch and it really did not go the way we were all thinking. "
1794,7,Totally Confused !!!,I saw SW: The last jedi on the cinema the first day and i had very high expectations about that film. It was because of the franchise return or the unanswered facts from the SW the force awakens? I dont know but i did expected much more in these 2.33 hours.
1795,2,Censoring the 'Goofs' section on IMDB is not enough to save this trash,"This is what you get when you are so determined to surprise everyone that you want to do against both the fan theory and its opposite. Rian Johnson, the mind behind the awesome Looper, went desperate and stabbed his movie in the balls with a lightsaber."
1796,10,"Original, yet consistent",This movie is far more loved and adored than people realize. It seems as if a very loud and obsessive minority of bitter fan are upset due to missing the point of the movie. So they take their anger out on Disney and Lucasfilm due to their lack of understanding. This is a truly phenomenal film.
1797,,HUGE Misfire with Luke but the rest of the story was smart,"So many conflicting thoughts when trying to fully review what hits the screen. Did expectations play too large a part or were certain events really as anti-climatic as they feel??? While heady and interesting, there was a lack of emotional connection overall. At key times, in what should have been big plot turns things felt a bit hallow. Not to say it was all unfulfilling but a lot simply didn't pay off with as much impact as the characters deserved. (Luke's fate being chief among them) Overall, Luke's arc finished with him appearing to be a whinny crybaby and his actions since Kylo's defection seemed overblown and snivel-like in nature. Taking little of what Obi-Wan and Yoda taught him and ignoring lessons learned from the original trilogy. I simply didn't like how Luke was written in this film. "
1798,6,Disappointing,"Spoiler Free Quick Summary: There are many Flaws in Star Wars Last Jedi. Some of it was really fun. Some of it flat out disappointed. Some of it felt like exploitation of the franchise, while other parts felt like they had a heart and paid good homage. <br /><br />The fact is, ""It just didn't feel like Star Wars"" felt more like a Marvel movie. Which I don't see as a good thing. They need to cut about 45 minutes from the film and stop ""Plot twisting"" to shock the audience. Sticking to the rules of the Star War lore would also help the situation. And The CG over practical effects kinda smashes the whole idealism as to why the Force Awakens was deemed acceptable and the last Jedi as another tool to make quick cash. Too long too much and too Disney not enough Star Wars.<br /><br />6 out of 10 stars."
1799,9,ESB was once controversial too... Now it's the best,"TLJ is not perfect. No movie is. But the movie is beautiful. It was a long time since I went out of the theater in tears. Thus now I have watched the movie six times. The tears are now replaced with chills. The same chills I get when Luke looks at the twin sunset in ANH, the same chills when Vader says his iconic line in ESB, the same chills when Vader throws the Emperor in ROJ. This movie is Star Wars in its finest. Fun, wise and moving. This is what Hollywood SHOULD be.<br /><br />Yes, Canto Bight was annoying. Yes, Rose could be more fleshed out.<br /><br />But I would take a movie like that any day if it has the same powerful filmmaking spark it has in its high points."
1800,6,A simple Disney story: all princesses must survive and black boys do not get the white girls,"I have to admit the movie was generally enjoyable for me, although it was strechtched too long.<br /><br />I really appreciate that Disney brings an Asian girl as a key figure, but i really really really cannot lose the feeling that Rose is only there to avoid Finn and Rey being together!!! This ""finding a codebreaker"" mission is just soooo totally pointless and unnecessary. Why did they need this? For me really simple: to make Finn unavailable for Rey and the white girl do not end with the black boy."
1801,8,This is a good SW movie,"First, I have no idea why so many people don't like this film. While I would say it's not as good as episode 7 or Rogue One, this is a fine addition to the SW series. I personally thought the story good, and (slight SPOILER COMING) adds a deeper level to the Jedi mythos, particularly in that they aren't the perfect people many believe. This movie promotes the underlying theme present in the greater SW universe: balance. Light and Dark live side-by-side, and always will."
1802,6,The movie disappointed me to some extent. The hate for it around here is absolutely shocking.,"I certainly agree that this movie does not deserve an 8+ rating on this platform as it fundamentally lacks in some areas. But I can't understand less how many people actually think is is a 1 out of 10 movie. If that's your opinion, why did you even bother to watch the movie completely. "
1803,1,Disgrace,It seems like the people who now control this franchise are not familiar with the source material. Having characters make decisions inconsistent with previous decisions shows they did not do their homework and is definitely not bold. I consider this more a departure than the holiday special. This is now the worst piece of Star Wars material ever created. I would watch the holiday special a second time before this movie. The best plan for Disney would be to figure out how to redo this movie or make it not cannon. People who have not seen this movie are better off than the ones who have seen it.
1804,10,WTF!!,"Soooooooo!! Underrated, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. Well done Rian Johnson hope to see you helm more titles in the future."
1805,6,The Last Jedi fails to live up to the hype.,"First off, giving this movie a 1, 2, or even 3 rating on this website is total bull. I'm tired of people trying to lower film ratings this way. Just give the movie what you really think it deserves. I have a hard time believing that anyone that saw this movie truly thinks it's a 1/10 or 2/10 film."
1806,1,Star Wars died in the last Jedi,"If she's nobody, then she has no story, so why are we following her? No Young Skywalker equals no Skywalker Saga. If you want to watch a space story without Skywalkers, go watch Star Trek. They boast they didn't bow to theorists, but they should've. You know who they bowed to? The antitheorists. They knelt on both knees and sloppy french kissed the butts of the antitheorists. Who are the antitheorists? They are plot haters who don't want complex stories distracting them from their shiny sparkly 'splosions. Dimwits have pulled Star Wars down to their level, but I don't like Pokemon."
1807,8,"Different, but same in the best way","This episode definitely resonates with the force. There were some comedic scenes that felt awkward at first until their purpose was revealed, but for the most part the story flowed well. I love the force conversations between Kylo and Rae. It brought a great dialog of perspectives into the mix that really increases tension while giving us a chance to feel these characters more deeply.<br /><br />I give this 8 out of 10 due to some apparent plot holes and my issues with Leia's character, but overall this has all of the Star Wars elements I love...and then some!"
1808,,TERRIBLE!!!,"This movie was a major let down, Snoke is just a guy with Sith powers who gets killed off quickly. Rey is not a Skywalker her parents are peasants who are buried on her home planet or so the story says for now. The CGI on Yoda was terrible, Luke Skywalker was misused again and new characters are highly unlikeable or you just do not have any interest in getting to know them. Garbage I can not believe I waited two years for this movie. It's worse than The Phantom Menace."
1809,6,It's not THAT bad,Con: nothing new<br /><br />Pro: nothing new
1810,8,A dip in the trilogy but still good,"The Last Jedi has some issues. Some scenes look poor with CGI. Scenes in Cantonica could be done to make it more interesting. They introduced characters that are not needed, and some scenes are dull. However the history and decvelopment of Kylo Ren is fantastic, and it makes his story tie into the prequel trilogy."
1811,6,Why does everyone hate this movie??,"I personally thought that this Star Wars was one of the best (if not the best) Star Wars movies, thanks to the unpredictability of Rian Johnson's writing."
1812,9,A Good Star Wars approach,"Don't trust all those hater-Reviews. This movie is a good approach to the Star Wars universe. It is better than ""The Force Awakens"" because it is not just Episode V repeated. It has different story arcs and some goot twists and turns.<br /><br />The great galactic battles shine as do the actors skills. I would rank it just behind the original movies (episodes IV-VI)."
1813,7,Not as bad as the vocal majority are claiming it to be,"Because the movie is 5 days old as of this review, I'm going to keep this very short. Quite simply, this movie is 30% awesome, 30% decent-to-good, and 40% questionable to atrocious. Due to this conflict within the script and narrative, it seems apparent that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson have very different visions when it comes to the characters of the universe, and the universe itself. In some cases this pays off, and in others... it doesn't."
1814,1,Boring Disney crap,I don't even think this can entertain 5 year olds.
1815,9,The Last Jedi was EPIC!,"Yes, I believe that personally, the last jedi is one if not the best of the Star Wars movies. Now at first walking out of the theater I had a ton of questions. I had a lot to process and I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not. But, after I watched it a second time, I found I was enjoying myself and I was sucked in by the beautiful imagery and epic conclusion. Now I will admit this movie does have flaws, no doubt, but I think when you look at this film through a bigger scope it will begin to make sense. Remember a lot of people didn't like empire strikes back at first. When it first came out people were confused and weren t sure what to make of it. Not until Return of the Jedi when everything connected and the story was complete that all the 'plot holes' or mistakes in Empire began to make sense and it became a classic. I think this movie can do the same. I also think many of the reasons this movie was so divisive was because of the twists and turns. I loved many of the twists upon second viewing, they were crazy and original and I never would have guessed them. I think because of all the speculation on the internet about this movie, with people coming up with their own theories was what caused some people to be disappointed. I think some people didn't expect what transpired in the movie and their theories didn't come true so they were frustrated by the fact that it wasn't the exact thing they wanted. If a movie had all the twists and plot that you expected it would be boring, right? So congrats to Rian Johnson on making a movie that was so beautiful and intricate and that contained so many big twists and turns that he can call his own. "
1816,7,Adam Driver was worth the admission fee alone...,"A lot of positives here. The acting was solid and Adam Driver was excellent, despite the hammy script and it had a number of fantastic set pieces and spectacular space battles. After the predictability of The Force Awakens, it was a pleasant surprise to have some actual plot twists. Its not perfect and dragged a little in the middle (which could have been fixed by replacing the whole codebreaker section with a 2 minute montage) and despite the long running length, there was a number of unanswered questions. Ignore the haters, whilst some editing and a script rewrite would have improved the movie, only a fool would score it less than four stars."
1817,1,Worst Star Wars movie so far,"That's it, this is how you ruin everything."
1818,8,"It's good, very good...not great.","I liked it, but I didn't love it. I feel like saying that is just asking for someone to point a sniper rifle at my head, but I won't lie that I have problems with this movie. Not sure why I'm discussing my opinion on the movie now since most of America has probably already seen this movie twice. However, I have things to say so why not?"
1819,,This Perspective on the Star Wars Universe Blew Me Away,Rian Johnson takes aim on all our preconceptions of what Episode VIII should be and blows them to smithereens. Good for him! It's time for the Skywalker hegemony -- on both sides of The Force -- to end.
1820,6,A well made movie with an abundance of wasted potential,"To start this review, I wan't to point out that I did like this movie, well the majority of it anyway, but I feel like my pointing out only what I enjoyed is not just when it is evident that this movie has glaring flaws. I'll list my Pros, then cons to give an analysis into what was well-done and not so much."
1821,10,Best Star Wars Movie ever.,I feel bad for those who gave it a low star review. It just shows you don't have taste.
1822,6,A Good yet Disappointing Movie,"""The Force Awakens"" was an average movie at best with some redeeming qualities such as the lightsaber battle, the character of Kylo Ren, and the reveal of the mysterious, in hiding Luke Skywalker, the man who took down the Empire and the Emperor that stood with it. The final scene of TFA was so dramatic and exciting that it left myself and many others hyped out of our minds for the start of this movie. Then when we first see Luke he throws the lightsaber behind him off a cliff, the lightsaber that has been was used by his father, and was given to him by his teacher, this spectical of Luke's past is thrown off the cliff without any questions. I think Luke throwing this lightsaber is an interesting metaphor for this movie as a whole, build up, some of it fantastic, only to lead to a bogstandard payoff. To keep this review interesting I'll start with Pros then move to cons."
1823,10,Fantastic!,"Took my 3 eldest kids to watch this last night and was totally blown away. I've been a mega Star Wars fan since I saw the originals as a kid and this one doesn't disappoint. Sure, you could nit pick anything to the nth degree but if you do then you're focusing on the wrong things and need to appreciate these new movies for what they are. They are never going to be as good as the originals or directed in the same way so all the haters need to get over that! There were loads of sub plots and new characters/locations to get into. The CGI was awesome and the so was the acting/sets/music. Enjoy!"
1824,6,Too much Disney and Marvel in it.,"There are some really iconic moments in the movie. But it is cluttered with unnecessary ""Disney"" plots that do not serve any purpose to the story. The unnecessary Marvel jokes are funny but do not belong in a Star Wars movie. It is a good Sci-fi movie but the soul of Star Wars is slowly disappearing in the saga."
1825,1,"Watch the Mando Season 2 finale BTS trailer, then read this.","When Mark Hamill pleaded with him to consider what the fans might want out of TLJ and it's depiction of Luke, Rian Johnson literally said, ""We're not going to give the audience what they want. We're going to give them something they don't expect that WE want."""
1826,9,The most divisive Star Wars film yet.,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is written & directed by Rian Johnson and stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Kelly Marie Tran, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Gwendoline Christie, Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro."
1827,6,The good old days...,"Writing it after ""Rise of Skywalker"", all I can say is: I miss you, Rian! I miss you."
1828,1,An insult,The Force Awakens was a bad Star Wars movie. This is far worse.
1829,9,A Film Adorned with Beautiful Animals and an equally Beautiful and Slightly Tedious Narrative,"I saw Star Wars : The Last Jedi at midnight on the 14th of December in NZ and I loved every moment of the film. I loved the way the layered characters of Luke Skywalker, Rey and Kylo Ren were examined, I loved how light was thrown on the internal politics that has been brewing up within the Resisitance and how that is impacting their capability to fight with the First Order, I loved the film's zest for adventure and I also loved the fact that this is one of the funniest Star Wars films I've seen. Also, I loved all the exotic creatures that this film has showcased. The Star Wars franchise could give the Fantastic Beasts franchise a run for their money any day when it comes to showing off a plethora of amazing otherwordly animals."
1830,,Rian Johnson works for Jar Jar Abrams,There is no other way to explain this dross.
1831,6,My last SW movie,"No, just no, they made Luke an a-hole, Snoke comic relief, Finn story doesn't matter at all in the long run, DEATH STAR size plot holes and so on."
1832,8,Don't you want nuance?,"Most reviews I have read condemn Rian Johnson for placing Luke Skywalker in a place of ""Grey Jedi"" ala ""Jolee Bindo"". But I believe that very much his natural evolution of an un-directed Luke toward his understanding of the force, makes sense. And hence his direction of Rey's training is understandable.<br /><br />The main characters of this series are Rey and Kylo and the Dynamic of that relationship will only be truly defined in the 9th film."
1833,6,I miss George Lucas,"Nothing to add really, it's not a bad movie. Characters and their interactions are great but plotwise it's a joke, a bad joke, the kind of joke where you feel like they are making fun of you."
1834,10,I don't get these people,Just got back from the Last Jedi show! Wow! Just wow!
1835,7,A Simple Honest Review (Minor spoilers so proceed with caution),"Never felt compelled to write a review before but so many trolls giving 1/10 and 10/10 on this I thought id just give the pros and cons as I see them.<br /><br />PRO<br /><br />>Its visually stunning some of the best SFX i've seen in a movie<br /><br />>The acting is good-great throughout<br /><br />>Quite a few surprises, nothing quite goes the way you expect it to.<br /><br />>Funny in places (although it goes a little too far at times)<br /><br />>More original than TFA (still a lot of call backs though)<br /><br />>Over all the story is good and well written, if a little loose.<br /><br />>The action/fight scenes are very entertaining and well done/shot.<br /><br />>Lots of Lump in your throat moments (some a little forced)<br /><br />>A Fitting emotional farewell to one (maybe two) beloved characters.<br /><br />CON<br /><br />>It's over long, this movie could have been easily trimmed down or tightened up to 2 hours.<br /><br />> Too many story lines the movie should have focused on the Rebel fleet, Rey/Luke and Kylo-ren.<br /><br />>Finn's story-line felt like ""got to give him something to do"" it would have been much better if he had stayed with the Rebels and helped Poe defend the ship or something (maybe a Phasma lead boarding party to defend against).<br /><br />>The whole Canto Bight (casino planet) part felt dangerously close to prequel/kid movie territory.<br /><br />>The pacing was ""off"" not bad but very ""off"" (Kinda hard to explain) "
1836,2,Id rather watch paint dry,"This movie was a steaming pile of ****. Enough said. No. Not enough said. Not yet. I would have tolerated this movie, the boring scenes, Leia ragdolling into the void of space, but then keep her Alive EVEN AFTER SHE DIED IN REAL LIFE, or the fact that they ruined this mysterious snoke character and put him in a fabulous but not really gold robe, or the humor in this movie that is so cringe I had to step away from the movie it was that bad, no. Here's the real reason I hated this movie. So after all that happened on star killer base, she finally finds Luke skywalker. Yay right? She hands him the very weapon, the one anakin crafted during the clone wars, the one he used to slay jedi younglings and masters and all kinds creatures on Mustafar and the very weapon obiwan saved for Luke all those years, and vader ends up cutting Luke's hand off with, so he receives this lightsaber with SO MUCH STORY TO IT. And he just tosses it out behind him like it's nothing and walks away it took a very serious and thoughtful moment away for star wars fans and just. Ruined it with their corny humor. I was done with this movie at this point. Fights sucked, dialog sucked, only thing I really enjoyed in this movie was yodas scene. It was nice to see him finally again as a force ghost. But if anakin and obiwan were there in episode 7 half of this mess wouldn't have began in the first place. This movie ruined Luke skywalker for me. It ruined star wars. And don't get me started on rose. Please don't ever make a steaming of cow manure like this ever again.. this ruined the whole trilogy. Force awakens felt so much darker I don't know why if it was the massacre in the first act of episode 7 or if it was the way Abrams directed it but it was at least watchable despite how bad it was, this one, was awful. It took the darkness away and felt like a comedy scifi film then the epic space opera that star wars is known for. Very disappointing."
1837,8,Ignore the haters,"I saw this very recently and thoroughly enjoyed it, yes the plot has floors and yes there are un answered questions from the previous film but when you take that out and just enjoy it as a star wars film its great. Ignore the haters, give this film a watch and enjoy a great Star Wars movie."
1838,7,Good but not great.,If you remove the Star Wars banner there is actualy a very decent movie to be found in The Last Jedi. That being said this movie has more in common with a Luc Besson movie than with Star Wars. Actually Valerian reminded me more of Star Wars than this. So how is The Last Jedi? Pretty ok actually. I just didn't like the jokes. They were to slapstick for my taste. The story itself was ok minus the storyline of Finn and Rose. Personally I was hoping for a new Skywalker but it was not to be. Luke is there but doesnt remind me much of the Luke I used to know but was ok. The acting was pretty ok all around. Special effects and visuals were also good but on par with the prequels. For me it was like Rian Johnson tried to hard to seperate himself from the saga. In trying to make something special he made something avarage. Less is more with Star Wars.
1839,1,cringeworthy moments and cop-outs,"I saw this movie many months after it was released and was unaware of how it was received because I wasn't paying attention. I didn't read anything about it on purpose and didn't watch the trailers because I didn't want those to ruin it for me. I am a life-long Star Wars fan, but not one of the hard-core types (SW was my favorite set of movies and I had the toys as a kid, but grew out of it and never got into the comics or games, etc). <br /><br />Then I saw it at a friend's place several months after its release. Almost immediately, the Poe vs Hux scene set the tone for what this movie was to be, and it was not good. This movie had great visuals, but the plot and characters just sucked. I was initially in a state of confusion after watching this. <br /><br />Afterwards, I started looking online and saw a few things: apparently the actress for Rose was being harassed online (?) and how Rian Johnson was lashing out at certain fans (partially to defend her?) and partially due to his arrogance at realizing he made too many mistakes with this movie. Honestly, what I saw of him behaving online was very immature. I saw a pic of him holding a sign saying something like ""your Snoke theory sucks"". The back and forth of it all reminded me of junior high school. <br /><br />RE the Rose character: I thought the character was very annoying, particularly at the end when she ruined Finn's only good potential act in the movie (I liked Finn in TFA, but he was kind of lame in this movie). But, that, in and of itself, would not have ruined this movie entirely (and certainly doesn't justify anyone harassing the actress, obviously). <br /><br />The whole movie, when taken into context with the written statements of RJ after the fact, smells of his hubris. He wanted to make this ""his"" movie and to hell with any continuity. If he wanted to do it this way, then why not just make a goofy, comedy/sci-fi movie on its own without standing on the shoulders (and pissing on) the legend that gave it that perch in the first place? I guess that might also happen now that there are rumors of him getting his own trilogy... wow, talk about rewarding bad behavior. <br /><br />Anyway, I won't go through and document all the cringe worthy moments as there are far too many and others have done a thorough job of that. <br /><br />The main cop-out to me was the way they handled Snoke (and yes, I have read Rian Johnsons rationalizations of this, and no, I didn't have a ""fan theory""). I am not passionate enough to join the ""get Kathleen Kennedy fired"" movement, but I now no longer care about Star Wars and won't bother seeing Solo or Episode 9- and certainly won't touch RJ's coming spin-off trilogy with a 10-foot pole.<br /><br />Another thing I want to add is to address the way KK, RJ, & JJ Abrams have dismissed any criticism of this film by painting all those who dislike it as racist, sexist white supremacists who fear women. First of all, my 2 sisters and wife also called this movie ""garbage"". Second thing specifically to address JJ Abrams comment about critics fearing strong women: total BS. Alien was probably my second favorite movie series growing up and even into adulthood and you won't find a stronger female (believably written, unlike Rey) character as Ripply out there. This lame deflection on the part of these executives shows their arrogance and disconnection with the common movie fans, whom they seems to have a strong level of disdain for anyway."
1840,9,Criminally Underrated,"I just finished watching this movie a second time and find it to be one of the best in the saga. After two years of fans taking to the internet, complaining about the tired formula that The Force Awakens had ripped from previous entries, Rian Johnson inflates the new trilogy with a breath of fresh air that is refreshing to say the least. Although it isn't conventional, The Last Jedi is undoubtedly a Star Wars movie, with a few minute flaws that have been blown out of proportion. Yes, Canto Bite was difficult to watch, but upon my second viewing, was begun and ended much quicker then I had remembered, and much to my surprise, was a much more bearable once I knew it was coming. Again, a bit jarring, but I feel as though there is so much I love about this film. The moments between Rey and Luke always kept me intrigued and on the edge of my seat. Luke ad changed so much since the original trilogy, but rightfully so. His personalty traits ran more akin to Yoda on Dagobah after facing the fall of the Old republic. Luke is clearly damaged, and perhaps a bit misguided. It has been thirty years. He's not going to be the same person we know and love. The death of Snoke was tense and satisfying. I'm appalled at the reaction towards it. In my opinion, Snoke was the least memorable part of The Force Awakens. He was always a plot point, and the shock factor of killing him off so soon is incredible, and the plot device is putting a new twist on Kylo Ren's character that I'm very excited about. Honestly, it's difficult for me to defend Snoke because I had a hard time caring about his character and back story. The internet theories were just getting to be too much that the truth would've been disappointing anyways, so Rian Johnson just killed him, and it took balls. The climax is also one of the most jaw dropping, spectacular twists since 'I'm you're father' and it gave me chills on both viewings. Overall, The Last Jedi is one of the best chapters in the Star Wars saga in my opinion, and certainly surpasses The Force Awakens and Rogue One."
1841,,My review of Star Wars The Last Jedi,Sad 30 year old men: OH MY GOD OH MY GOD MY CHILDHOOD IS RUINED RIAN JOHNSON AND DISNEY HAVE KILLED STAR WARS. STAR WARS IS DEAD ;-;
1842,6,Star Wars just got less interesting,"You waited long and hard for answers, revelations, resolutions - anything! And you got it all, with a twist."
1843,8,'The Last Jedi' notably serves its purpose as the middle child in this latest trilogy,"'The Last Jedi' finds itself as perhaps the most polarizing installment of the Star Wars franchise since 'Return of the Jedi,' with die-hard fans either dwelling too much on the bad parts of the script, or obsessing too much on the good. The fact is, the film gets more right than wrong, and even features some of the best sequences of any Star Wars film, period."
1844,6,A LOT of potential; bad execution,***SPOILERS AHEAD***
1845,9,Great moment at the movies,"Great follow up to Force Awakens. Good enough in regular format, will wait for a flashier movie for Imax, next time. <br /><br />The plot moved along plausibly, the characters we were rooting for grew a lot (this is what happend to children in war settings) love the new addition, the imagery were beautiful. Unlike some people I did not waste my time the last 2 years coming up with fan theories and was greatly surprise by some turn of events. Would rewatch when the trilogy is over to see how well it flows. I like doing that."
1846,7,"Average and Odd, but Entertaining; Needs a Second Chance","This is not going to go the way you think and that's the best part. Entertaining and many memorable moments. Had some flaws, too much forced humor and a slow and disjointed first half. "
1847,2,I remember when critics used to give bad reviews for mediocre scripts,"I just felt like the story was thrown together as they went, because it is some of the laziest and Deus Ex Machina reliant work I have ever watched. I personally didn't watch any fan Theories and just went opening night to be entertained by another Star Wars movie. Instead Rian Johnson serves up a good lesson that quantity is not always quality."
1848,8,Do watch it again with an Open Mind,Star Wars: The Last Jedi (My Thoughts)
1849,6,Doesn't deserve the HATE; doesn't deserve the PRAISE. Deserves to be seen.,"After swearing that I would never watch Star Wars again after watching Lucas sell out, I was tricked by IMDB into seeing Last Jedi. I rarely ever get steered wrong on here but the ""Star Wars"" name has become too innate- the Force is too strong and common movie goers have become blind fanboys. "
1850,1,Stop Disney stupidity. Avoid it and FORCE them to the right path,"Perhaps you are not interested in spoilers; but believe it is better to read this before spending two and half boring hours trying to understand where the movie is going and find out it is not going nowhere.<br /><br />The movie can be described as many sub-plots that some barely join at the very dissatisfying end but the others go absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />Rey trying to get attention from Luke <br /><br />Rey trying to connect with Ken and turned it to the light. <br /><br />Poe try to become a leader despite his rebellious attitude <br /><br />Fin trying to avoid war and find Rey and his friendship with a new female character that (as sympathetic as she is), does not add anything to the movie.<br /><br />Fin trying to get a Master Hacker to save the rebels; a plot so absurd that looks was added later to give some emotion to the movie (and failed).<br /><br />While in the original saga, Darth Vader was the conducting force; here is Ren becoming the new Vader; but what is the point of the rest ? Aside from Rey and Ken story everything else seems to be just fillings. In fact Gleeson with less screen time is able to get far more personality (and laughs than Ken)"
1851,9,What is all the fuss about?,"When this film first came out I made the mistake of looking at the reviews listed on here. One after the other 1s and 2s star rating, so I thought this can't be too good I'll not bother going to see this, I'll wait till it comes out cheap on DVD or on the telly. But at the last minute just before it went out of the cinemas, I decided to go. I'm glad I did."
1852,,It is not the best nor worst Star Wars movie,"I will keep this non spoiler but this movie feels and is a product used to sell the merchandise of a brand called ""Star Wars"". The production team did pretty good to attract the kids to go to the shop and buy Star Wars products. The writing and the action seemed quite like a generic Star Wars movie so if you like the old one then you could enjoy the action. Overall this is not the best Star Wars movie nor the worst an stands as the awkward middle child of the Star Wars franchise when it comes to expectation and the content."
1853,7,"Not perfect, but I enjoyed the film",The film started off really well tying in the previous film to this one. The middle lost me. Was it really necessary? Nope.
1854,8,One of my top three Star Wars films,"Last Jedi marked Star Wars' 40th anniversary as a franchise. 40 YEARS IS A LENGTHY TIME. Last Jedi added new surprises, made new choices and took the series to a different place then where it had been before. In time people will look back on it and see the risks it took with its storytelling and how it payed off. Luke's arch showed a real look at what transformation looks like and how life's struggles don't always end because you've conquered some of them beforehand. The prequel trilogy suffered from lackluster acting and character development and these new Star Wars films have made an effort to have character progression be front and center. The filmmakers should be commended not trashed."
1855,7,I came out of the theatre with mixed feelings,"I came out of the theatre with mixed feelings. For the most part I thought it was a ""good"" movie although a missed opportunity for the new trilogy in many ways.<br /><br /> There were some excellent battle sequences that used CGI well along with some beautiful scenes and a diverse colour palate. The different and darker tone that was used was interesting and refeshing, Kylo Ren changed from being a weak antagonist in the last to a more interesting character in this and I also liked the general movement and decisions the film took. Unlike many others, I was fine with the way Luke was portrayed and felt that it blended nicely with the rest of the story. <br /><br /> With all of this being said though, this movie is not without its faults and there are a considerable amount of them. <br /><br /> There is a noticeable pacing issue that lends to boring scenes and awkward transitions. I also felt that there was a level of over saturation in that they tried to fit too many characters both old and new to the film with too many subplots into a single movie. The result is time devoted to sequences with questionable relevancy to the main story and close to no character development in many characters that makes me wonder if they were included for marketing, toys, red herrings or set ups for a next instalment. <br /><br /> There is also a lack of logic or explanation for many things including how the force is used in instances, how time has past and why decisions are made by characters that seem to simply be there to pander to a lazy and convenient way to make a story arch among other small less significant parts. Needless to say, although most are not blatantly obvious, the keen viewer or one that will view it more than once will notice these are plot holes. <br /><br /> Even though the film has taken a much different direction that the others, one still cannot deny the mirroring that is throughout the film. It is nowhere near as noticeable as The Force Awakens but it is still there. you could argue that it is just a product of it being in the same universe and story line but it has aggravated me.<br /><br /> There is also some comedy relief and cute creatures sprinkled throughout the film that wasn't too distracting but still felt too ""Disney"" to me and not reminiscent of the original trilogy minus the Ewoks of course. <br /><br /> I would have liked to see Rey interact with Luke more and even though I liked Kylo Ren's character in this, there still seems to be a lot missing from his story.<br /><br /> Looking past my nit picking, I still feel like despite the actual significant plot points within the film, we still haven't learned a whole lot more of the story and I dread a single sequel to complete the trilogy like planned will not be significant enough to make the story seem finished. It is a good time and a casual movie that you can enjoy. Nothing outstanding but just another placeholder for the next film."
1856,10,"One of the most thrilling movies in the world. 2 thumbs up, way way up!",I am a huge Star Wars fan and appreciate the fun filled movies I get to see from Disney and Lucasfilm. I got my moneys worth.
1857,6,Made by Disney,"This film had a good story to it but there are too many parts through the story which don't make sense and are ""Disney Moments"" hard to follow the act of Rogue One I suppose but expected better from the franchise."
1858,1,A disgrace,This film was horrible and I can't unsee it. NEVER let Rian Johnson direct again. This was a bloated nonsensical mess. I have no idea how ANYONE let this become a movie.
1859,9,Daisy Ridley pulls of a brilliant piece of acting!,"Daisy Ridley has grown so much since her last appearance in the Star Wars movie. Quite frankly, I 've never followed the Star Wars themes, so I wasnt expecting much. But the scene setting, art and development of the film were wonderful. Almost every scene and setting had an artistic touch and visual angles brought the movie to life and added to it. There was also some humor which has been sprinkled in the correct places. Not many other actors stood out except Daisy Ridley, she is the best find from this movie series, a great talent to be nurtured and developed, she's got a bright career ahead of her!!!"
1860,7,Bruh,"Bruh 'DISNEY DID RUIN STAR WARS', THEY GAVE US THE CLONE WARS, MANDORLIORIAN AND ALL THE OTHER UP AND COMING STUFF, AND THE HATE THIS MOVIE GETS IS UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT 2 OR 3 OUT OF 10, CANTO BITE SUCKED, ROSE SUCKED, BUT REALLY"
1861,1,A political statement from start to finish,"It dug a shallow grave for the Star Wars legacy and spit on it. Luke is nothing like a Jedi, there is no reason for several of the things happening in the movie and men are portrayed as testosterone-fuelled trigger happy monkeys."
1862,9,Best since the first trilogy,"The Last Jedi is the most controversial star wars movie yet. Rotten tomatoes and Metacritic reviews think that it's the closes to the first trilogy. Audiences and fans on the other hand, they think Rian Johnson, the director, had an idea on this franchise that people didn't like and thought it was the worst star wars movie. I mean, look at the 1/10 ratings on this website. I want to keep this short and say that I am on the critics side on this. The only issues I have with it is Luke Skywalker's personality and Rose Tico. The movie overall was a beautifully shot movie with fun action and Kyle Ren."

1864,7,"Mainly very enjoyable , in places a little disjointed but Mark Hamill was fantastic.",Not gonna say too much in way of Spoilers.
1865,10,"""There will never be a last jedi""","I really don´t understand why there are so many negative rewies, for such a movie...seriously now, if the action does not happen the way you want you start criticizing it? Or is much more emotion in this film than you can handle?"
1866,7,The magic is missing!,"After I watched the ""The last jedi"", my feelings were mixed. In my opinion this movie was much much better than ""The force awakenings"", much more spectacular but still something wasn't right. Mark Hamil was the best thing in this movie. Besides that the new ""Star wars "" trilogy plot is flat and unnatural. It's sad now everything is made just for the money. The magic is gone!"
1867,10,It's your fault Luke!,"I thought this movie had everything in it. Action, thriller, comedy, drama. I can't wait to see the next one. "
1868,6,Full of plotholes but visually delivers as promised,"There are a number of vexing plotholes in the story and subplots that feel redundant. Emotionally charging scenes are undermined by aforementioned, glaringly obvious plotholes and the abrupt, inappropriate comedic moments. "
1869,5,"Entertaining, but ultimately confused and","Very surprised that the critics gave this a thumbs up. It's possibly among the worst Star Wars movies (including the prequels). It's entertaining, for sure, but in the way David and Jerry Zucker films of the 80's were crowd pleasers. This isn't something you go home thinking about or affecting you when you go home, at least in a good way."
1870,10,Great star wars film,I really enjoyed this film!!! It was a great movie and I can't believe people are giving it bad reviews! It has good cgi a good storyline and it was overall a great movie.
1871,6,No emotional story line,"No emotional involving, the three plot are very cold"
1872,4,"Sadly, this movie was bad.","This was not true to what the Star Wars story was all about or what those of us liked about the storyline. The storyline dragged and at times was truly BORING. I'd have hoped for a better movie, but given this was missing a George Lucas touch, I see why. Disappointed."
1873,8,The entire series of Star Wars movie,"To begin I was lonely one day and when the age of 32 in 1976 I joined friends from the physics department of Washington University to go see this movie. They insisted I would enjoy the time spent...at this time I had a broadcast pay TV station and obtained 3/4 inch master of the movie. My children now 47 and 50 can recite the entire movie...Now the point of this review...I see many amateur reviewers telling me why this is junk as well as some of the professionals giving it a thumbs down. I really do find it amazing that those reviewing individual movies have missed the point. This is something that was very evident in the first three chapters...But these days because many of the reviewers were either to young or not born yet and missed the beginning of the adventure...This has been a visual novel created for over 40 years..When someone gives criticism, no matter how well intended they are just talking about one chapter of a very long book and have yet been able to view the completed project. The benefit they receive it is visual and they do not have to spend months reading and trying to figure out who did what to whom...To those who say the chapters do not follow the theme I do really wonder if any of them has ever bothered to read a novel... when chapter 3 was released for the most part those who have negative comments seem to have missed the totality of the project.... This has been a 43 year adventure in story telling and if those who judge this series poorly get off your lame rear ends and do it better, yeah those will be some fine productions...heh in closing I recently read another poor review by a young woman of the age of 22 who created an account just to tell us how bad this chapter was, I did find her evaluation amusing. Maybe I just like a good story and enjoy movies and am not an unpaid critic. Do you go to the movies to have an enjoyable time or to sit there taking notes on your 6 inch computer screen annoying those sitting around you, you are worse than a screaming 3 year old in the front row"
1874,,Second worst Star Wars (so-called) After The Force Awakens,"I am almost at a loss for words here. The hype machine rolls along, critics love this film beyond measure and it has a 7.5 rating on IMDB (should be 1/10), but we hated it. The nonsense showed that Star Wars is long dead and buried. How long do the producers think they can fool people?<br /><br />Over and out.<br /><br />PS: Such unattractive 'actors' and 'acting.'"
1875,7,"A good Star Wars film, ignore pointless reviews and judge yourself.","When one looks at the reviews in here it seems the movie is a complete abomination, yet the overall score is still above 7, how can that be?. Now, when someone rates a movie like this one with a score of 1 out of 10, based solely on how it disappointed his/her expectations, regardless of production values, film score, and basically everything that goes along with the making of a film, you know you can't trust reviews for they are utterly biased."
1876,10,Don't read the Haters and Trolls reviews! The Last Jedi is AWESOME!!,"I've seen every Star Wars movie during its opening week in the theaters. I was 7 years old when I saw the first one. I am huge fan of Star Wars and one point in the past my younger brain actually had all the dialogue from episodes IV, V and VI memorized. I could recite any of these movies on command. I have a betamax copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special and I can sing you ""R2D2, we wish you a merry Christmas"" and ""What can you get a Wookie for Christmas?? (When he already owns a comb)"" I have them on vinyl. "
1877,6,"C'mon guys it wasn't that bad, surely?","Guys, it's been 40 years since episode IV, you were probably 13 when you saw it back then - every big movie looks amazing when you are 13. Now you're 53, middle aged and grumpy, which is why the newest movie looks bad."
1878,10,A Magical Adventure that Charges Up the Franchise,"The Last Jedi was an absolute thrill ride of a film, and really sets up an amazing finale for Episode 9. The movie was well cast, and the pacing and excitement builds and flows to its ultimate and legendary climax. The space battles were top-of-the-line Star Wars, and the addition of Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro really gave the film that extra ""kick"" it needed. Kelly Marie Tran also surprised many in her heart-warming role as Rose Tico. The new planets were incredible, especially Crait...and I can't say enough about Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. Their chemistry is amazing, and it will be a treat to see how their stories end up in the next chapter. Well done, Rian Johnson and Disney!"
1879,6,Star Wars Episode VIII (is quite good),"I think people need to step back and view Star Wars realistically; I wouldn't consider myself a Star Wars fan at all, but I think the fans themselves need to realise that Star Wars has always been pretty darn campy and is not a cinematic masterpiece by any means. But the originals are certainly fun, enjoyable, turn-your-brain-off films with great set-pieces and likeable characters, and The Last Jedi continues this tradition."
1880,3,Heartache and pain,"This goes for both the movie and me. I´ve been an avid Star wars fan since 1977.<br /><br />I realize that 4, 5 and 6 were a novlety in so many ways that comparing with those is simply unfair so I´ll steer clear as much as I can from that.<br /><br />When TFA came I felt pretty good. Yes, it was very close to a re-make of 4 but still I liked it. Then came Rogue One and so far (I haven´t seen Solo yet) it was close to excellent. Hoping that this would carry on the rising trend I had felt eager to see TLJ. And then I felt blasted out of the sky.<br /><br />I REALLY understand Mark Hamill's dislike regarding this one. You can sense the conflicts behind it between Mark Hamill and Rian Johnsson who should have been banned from it as well as Kathleen Kennedy. How she is still with Disney is beyond me.<br /><br />There are loopholes the size of Texas in the story but that´s not the biggest problem. The essense and the feel of the franchise Lucas started is sucked into deep space. Luke is almost a sad side kick and Kylo Ren is still acting like a spoiled brat. I hope and pray that 9 will bring the story back full circle and reinstall Star wars as the great saga it once was. That is the ONLY reason to see this. Sadly the force is weak with this one..."
1881,9,Star Wars VIII: What With All That Negativity?,"I was 13 years old when I was totally blown away by ""Star Wars"". Just ""Star Wars"". Not Episode IV, Not V... No just ""Star Wars"". And boy, what a load of negativity when George Lucas came up with Episode V. Five? Are you for real? That couldn't be right. Or could it? And we all know that ""Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" was and still is the best movie in the whole franchise."
1882,6,The Force is Lost...,"I haven't written a movie review for more than 10 years, but I felt this was the right momentum to do so as one of my favorite sagas once again was on the big screen. While for a second time the hopes and the anticipation were colossal, equally huge was the disappointment and the frustration after leaving the theater. "
1883,1,Absolutely garbage movie for garbage audience,The writers really disrespect their audience by showing them this. Not a single original idea in a 2 hour movie. They must have had an AI read the previous starwars scrips and regurgitate star wars the last Jedi.
1884,8,"Come on, guys, it wasn't THAT bad","Well, it seems like many people here don't like this movie. Honestly, i can understand them. Some of the changes and moves in this movie may seem a bit radical. But that's actually a good thing."
1885,,Disney prints all over,"This movie is 2+ hours long. There is no reason why it cannot be edited shorter. There are a lot of stuff that are just not necessary. I would prefer they give more time to the new stars, and delete the new characters in this movie. It is OK to give cameos to Luke, Leia etc but their time have come and passed. The story is not focused and some scenes are just not believable. For SW fans, this is heresy! Others like myself, we just want an entertaining picture. Personally, I prefer the Disney animated movie as the story is more believable and coherent. Wait for the dvd to come out or watch it at the discount cinema. No one is going to talk about this as a classic, must see movie."
1886,7,"An inconsistent blockbuster. Fun to watch, hard to digest.","The Last Jedi is a long and fun roller-coaster ride: beautiful scenes, breathtaking action, crisp dialogue. And it's massive in it's epic complexity. At moments it seems to be two or three episodes in one. If you are new to the Star Wars universe, you'll love it. If you're a die-hard fan... that's another story, because Episode VIII is flawed."
1887,9,Best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back,"I went to the cinema with the praise of the critics (normally they are very tough with the Sci Fi/Fantasy genres) in one hand and in the other hand, some disappointment by some ""fans"" (should I say haters?). I was very confused in which side to believe. After watching it, I share my opinion. "
1888,6,very Mediocre,"It could have been waaaay better, a lot of awful decisions have been taken for this movie."
1889,8,Star Wars: The Last Good One,"Rian Johnson injects some much needed originality into the sequel trilogy. Instead of just acting as a puzzle piece; a stepping stone to get to the final chapter, this picture feels like a fully fleshed film."
1890,6,Disappointing movie,"Going into The Last Jedi, I was optimistic and excited about the film but feel that I and many fans have been let down on what it could have been."
1891,1,Subverting expectations,"Star Wars - The Last Jedi is filled with plot holes from start to finish. There is a growing trend in reviews here, what I list below is generally what others have listed. This one just left a bad taste in my mouth, and I was sitting there in dismay while enduring the end credits. It's as if they threw the Pie/Star Wars in the oven, and forget to turn the oven off and then left the building."
1892,9,Stop hating on it,I'm a Star Wars fan and have been since I was a kid. But I can't lie I enjoyed this movie the writers and directors wanted to do what was never done before. To change things up a bit and people just can't see how that's a good thing.
1893,7,Good not great,"I love how they start the movie with full of excitement, i was nervous to see whether they finished their mission to destroyed the ship or not but they did and they lost all of their bomber (the part where the asian girl died is really something). The whole movie makes you feel excited but its not satisfying. If the movie is a guy and the girl is the audience and they had sex, the girl certainly not satisfy. Don't get me wrong, i love star wars, i followed the whole series since i was a kid well mostly fans do but there are too much missing in this plot. "
1894,1,I hate it when idiots destroy my childhood memories,The latest and worst star wars movie ever<br /><br />Although lets be honest they have not been that great even the originals had their flaws but this latest movie is the LAST nail in the coffin <br /><br />RIP STARWARS
1895,8,The Last Jedi 'like a catchy pop group',"It's now or never. They said it more than ones, this was also on the makers there minds. If you don't love Star Wars after this entertaining episode, you never will. The balance between humor and serious Star Wars stuff was perfect. The jokes were placed at the right moments. And the most important thing they did with the jokes is they mock themselves. This worked so well through the entire movie. After 7 episodes, 1 sidequel and more coming up this was the right thing to do."
1896,,Awesome Movie,This movie advances the plotlines significantly while being thoroughly entertaining. Rian Johnson has done a terrific job and should be highly commended. A<br /><br />The acting is some of the best I have seen in any SW movie
1897,7,"I thought it was not good, instead...","My husband-great saga fan- came home from the movie saying he did not liked it. I was shocked...<br /><br />So when I saw the movie I was expecting the worse of the worse, i actually liked it instead.<br /><br />It's fun and introspective. For sure different but good."
1898,9,Star Wars is finally back on its feet.,This is the best written and best directed Star Wars movie since Empire. I'm so thankful that Disney finally got this franchise back on its feet.
1899,7,No Imperial March ...?,A Star Wars without the Imperial March is not a Star Wars! The super iconic soundtrack should be revamped each time! Is like a 007 movie without the James Bond theme... impossible! Very Disappointed. Moreover.. too much Disney cartoon sweetness degraded the intensity of the saga! Pity
1900,10,Brilliant New Direction for an Older Franchise,"The character development of everyone, especially Ben Solo and Rey, was fantastic. Rian Johnson took risks that paid off, including the forcebond, the then Rey's parentage which has since been disappointingly retconned, the death of Snoke and Ben's proposal which added more complexity to Ben's character (who is easily my favourite SW character), and of course Luke's arc which was beautifully human and believable."
1901,7,"High School Essay of SW films: 2/3 Fluff, 1/3 Substance","Impression of Last Jedi: Good but not brilliant. The nonsensical fluff, lack of fruition and missed opportunities of the first 2 acts had me worried until the 3rd act's redemption--a very satisfying and powerful one at that. I'm afraid this second installment is just not as thrilling or re-watchable as Force Awakens. Snoke makes for a terrible villain (not in a good way), no where near as terrifying or sinister as the emperor and the character design is egh at best--the Gollum-esque Sith Lord doesn't do it for me. And those who compare Last Jedi to Empire have lost their Midichlorians. The most dissatisfying aspect to me was --SEMI SPOILER ALERT-- the Rey / Skywalker training scene or lack there of. I just wanted to love it more but there are moments of brilliance and scenes that will pull on your fandom heart strings.The comical elements are good and scattered throughout but at times at the expense of the plot."
1902,4,Thank goodness for the #metoo movement,"Are you all so sick and tired of watching women die in action movies while their male counterparts survive? Yeah, #metoo."
1903,9,"Unpleasable fans will Hate, the Lame will always Compain, All You Do is induce long lasting mygraines, I wan't to ship on You, Yes I do, Yes I do Ill ship on You!!!!!!!!!!!!",Just like very Star Wars movie you've got these grip of nerds who can't stop talking about the initially released trilogy and how great it was but each one after has just ruined their minuscule little lives! These are the same guys that buy the $800 Lego set of the Millennium Falcon and but still live in their mothers basement where they wrote the negative reviews and spent the day crying about ti with the nerd freinds.
1904,6,"The force is dead..in these days, it's all about money.","Star Wars is a cultural phenomenon, environment and a unique perspective for the cinematography industry! Unfortunately, in The Last Jedi, Disney and Rian Johnson managed to destroy everything that Star Wars was, the story, our beloved characters...the design of this movie can't be a match for any other episode from the franchise...the approach was to force Luke to throw back his father light saber??like throwing all other movies to garbage.. ''bloody hell'', ''bloody ship'' in Star Wars???these are the quotes used in Star Wars?...the characters introduced in the force awakens are not important, they are more like expendables...the soundtrack wasn't there..nothing new..it's normal for a composer like John Williams not to create a good soundtrack since the story isn't good, man has nothing to focus on...unfortunately the last jedi is the worse movie from the franchise...in these days, it's all about money..they've put their braines in carbonite for this one"
1905,1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"Walt Disney, I beg you, stop making the Star Wars movies. You have no idea what you're doing."
1906,10,Incredible,Keeps you guessing while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of the galaxy far far away.
1907,,"Bold moves, Disney! If you're looking for reasons to love this movie, here you go","I went to see the movie, came and saw all the negative reviews, went to see the movie again and I'm still loving it. ""Fans"" complained about TFA because it was too similar to ANH, completely ignoring the fact that TFA was meant to reboot the saga with a hint of nostalgia for the old fans while getting new fans interested. This one gets heat for being too different. "
1908,6,ok but not star wars,"For whatever its worth, me as a star wars nut since 77, yes im 65 yrs old, this did NOT feel like a start wars movie. Force awakens so much better. this, last jedi, I seen in theaters, and felt it was way too long and WAY too political. I would rate it a 6/10"
1909,8,"An unexpected artistic, risky but fresh twist on Star Wars.","This is almost the opposite in everyway to The Force Awakens. While JJ Abrams brought a very fast-paced energetic but very familiar and safe feel to The Force Awakens, Rian Johnson brings to The Last Jedi something that is slower, patient and refreshing new and unexpected. Johnson isn't too concerned with trying to satisfy every Star Wars fan but is very invested in swinging big in every direction that is risky but for most of it really pays off. <br /><br />Using a very meta-type of narrative to go against tropes one would expect in Star Wars, Johnson makes the audience question the identity of this space opera franchise that has been going on since the 70's. The film delves on the flaws of the past, religion, teachers, authority and idolized heroes and asks what is worth sacrificing during times of war. And just when you think the movie is ending the way you would expect; it takes a hard left turn to deliver a great third act."
1910,6,The Ghost of George Lucas Lives on,"Watching this, you'd think George Lucus had come back to haunt the series.<br /><br />Too many silly jokes<br /><br />Far too many alien creatures for no reason other than adding funny alien creatures (and the toy tie ins)"
1911,8,Great Film!,"The only reason people did not like it was because of themselves. There had been so much hype and anticipation, that people already had ideas of exactly what they wanted. There had been multiple speculations and theories, which gave people unbelievably high expectations. And, when these expectations were not met in the way that people thought that they would be met, people responded with hate. I think another problem with people already creating a story in their heads was that it made them biased, and they refused to see the movie for what it was, but instead point out all the tiny little detaails that people disagreed with. People were not regarding the movie as a normal film, but instead a ""Star Wars movie"". They were not open to seeInch new ideas play out on the screen, and instead, let their bias ruin a perfectly fun film for them. Also, people who watched the original Star Wars films as children watched them through pure, innocent eyes, looking only for wonder and fun. This created a memory of Star Wars that was not necessarily how they would have seen it today. So all I'm saying is; give the movie a chance, try to forget the previous films, and treat the movie for what it actually is. A fun, action packed movie."
1912,6,"Crystal Skull ""nuked the fridge"", Last Jedi ""flew the Leia""","I just can't get past the word ""odd"" it fits it so well. It was like Rian Johnson was just thumbing his nose at Episode VII and saying, all that stuff that Abrams made you care about and wait for answers for two years for...I'm just going to go ahead and just get rid of that, no explanations needed and then I'm going to turn Luke from grumpy into a comedian for the rest of the movie. I can see why Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with basically everything Rian Johnson did to Luke. What a mess. Some really odd head scratching decisions. I enjoyed it cause it was a Star Wars movie in name, but that said I'm thankful that someone else is doing episode IX. We need someone to restore some balance to the force. Help us JJ Abrams you're our only hope. "
1913,1,Storytelling at its worst,"How is it possible to f up a Star Wars movie? So many possible stories to explore in this universe. The Last Jedi managed to do just that. Luke my boy, what have they done to you..."
1914,8,Misleading title and dissapointed overall...,"The movie was good...for the first half part at least where we had to look at Rey's training and interaction with Luke Skywalker,the CGI effects were phenomenol as always,but the story kinda fell of after the first half from the movie,i wasnt expecting *SPOILER ALERT* luke to die and become a force ghost and he to at least have an epic battle with a lightsaber and using the force(which he didnt),Rey using the force ONCE lifting some rocks didnt make me feel any emotion...The force awakens and Rogue one were FAAAR more amazing and entertaining than the Last jedi.With that being said this movie is definetely not a BAD MOVIE,it was just a little dissapointing.But i enjoyed it anyways.Snoke sucked and the movie had some moments where u feel they were copied from episode 6 and were edited a little bit.Dont expect the movie to live on its TITLE,its definetely my biggest dissapointments of the movie"
1915,7,"Not a masterpiece, not as bad as some of these reviews might make you think","I'd probably give it more of a 6.5 score tbh. I feel like that lightsaber stuck between Ray and Kylo, but leaning towards the 'I liked it' side a bit more. The hate coming from some of the fans is sort of understandable, the movie makes some bold choises and some work out better than others without getting into specifics here. <br /><br />I really liked the Ray/Luke/Kylo storyline, I LOVED the answer to who Ray's parents are (I hope JJ doesn't just go ahead and change that in IX), I thought the acting was great across the board and am genuanly intirgued to see where this goes next. I also hope they give Finn and Poe a bit more to do in the next one, Finn's storyline especially didn't seem to matter all that much in this one and he was one of my favourites in TFA.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie everyone!"
1916,1,I cant watch this movie again,"I Will never watch this movie again and i refuse to belive that it was Luke in this movie. Im gonna watch the christmas special again, which is better than this monster of a fest thanks Rian Johnson you ruined star wars"
1917,9,What is going here?,I just went to the movies and finally see ''The Last Jedi'' today after all those bad reviews of this film I mean I didn't saw at least one single good review about this movie they were all bad I just couldn't believe them but I was still chocked.
1918,,"George Lucas, Happy Now With Your Cash-In???","Hope it was worth the billion you got to sell out, cash in and destroy your legacy."
1919,7,"Avoid, only if you are Star Wars fan","I could rant for hours to justify my comments, however life is far to short to waist on this is inconsistent piece of s**t.<br /><br />Rian go crawl by into the box you were thinking outside of & go make Brink 2.<br /><br />Or maybe go count your money along side Kathleen Kenedy!<br /><br />Leave Siar Wars alone."
1920,9,this movie was amazing and better than the force awakens,"This movie was one the best star wars of all, it was more darker and it had a big surprise in the movie that it should of had in the force awakens is that it had yoda to come back and help"
1921,6,Flawed but an improvement on Episode VII,"Disney's uncomfortable stewardship of the Star Wars franchise continues with the eighth episode this time directed by Rian Johnson, noted previously only for Looper. He presents a deeply flawed movie that goes some way to filling in the yawning chasms of missing back story in Episode VII but not enough to set up Episode IX adequately. There are some impressive space battles, some much-needed character development for the main protagonists, and a welcome dose of Jedi mysticism but some of the plot holes are too challenging even for the most stalwart Star Wars fan to accept."
1922,9,A fantastic continuation of a timeless tale...,"This episode does a masterful job of continuing the journey of characters we love, both old and new. While it grows more grave and urgent than its predecessor, ""The Last Jedi"" manages to be both dark and hilarious at times, thanks to more excellent set pieces and punchy dialogue which hearkens back to my favorite of installments: ""The Empire Strikes Back."" "
1923,7,"Honestly, Go See It! Ignore the complaining fan boys.","This Movie is Great! Visually stunning, great character development. Above all very entertaining. Can slow down at a few parts, but what do you expect from a movie with almost 2 1/2 hour run time? "
1924,4,Biggest Let-Down of 2017,"Let me first say this, I don't usually write reviews for movies, but with all the toxicity and hate going around I figured I would. Let's face it, TLJ was a terrible film, there's no going around that. And no, I'm not just jumping on the bandwagon, I actually saw this movie openin night and hated it from the first time I saw it. The pacing was so bad that my heart murmur is more steady. Big payoffs set up in Force awakens were tossed aside for a one-off joke that wasn't even funny. Overall, this movie is not worth the price of a rental. 4/10"
1925,9,Let's Have A Toast To The Trolls,"If you say you're a true fan of star wars & then say you hate this movie in the same breath you're a living oxymoron. just because it did not live up to the world's fan theories doesn't make it a bad movie, it just makes the world full of bitter people unwilling to change. plenty of action, dialogue, & fantastic scenes throughout. definitely could have been at least 30 minutes shorter though."
1926,7,It is not bad but still it is not better than original or the prequels.,"I dont write reviews that much and havent wrote one for the TFA because i was divided in opinion. I didnt know wheter to like it or hate it. Now i know. But this time i have to defend the movie because it didn t deserve the hate it got.<br /><br />Everybody in the movie tried their best including new director who brought some fresh ideas and turnovers in storyline which i found very interesting. I think we shouldnt blame the director because JJ Abrams played it safe in the first one and thus made it dificult for anybody who was next in order to direct. <br /><br />In TFA Abrams made a copy of new hope and except the character of Kylo Ren and much needed return of Han solo and Chewie didn t give us anything exciting ,intriguing or fresh. Instead he gave us a copy of luke skylwalker in female form , copy of a death star , copy of r2d2 , same enemies (stormtroopers,supreme leader) bla bla the list goes on. I have to add that the biggest problem was that characters were bad. I didnt feel connected with Rey , Finn was also very boring and non charismatic didnt care about him , maz katana also felt very unneeded , Poe was mediocre at best , Snoke non present .... Final battle was also very cartoony...<br /><br />Having exposed all these problems i have to say that it was very difficult for a new director Rian to step in to this mess. And i think he was very brave to follow his vision and tried to do something different. He gave us the longest movie, he gave us very gritty Luke , he made us care for the villain Kylo Ren , he killed of the main villain which was a ballsiest and very cool move in my opinion. It wasnt a great film but after that mess disney and JJ have started in TFA i think it is the best we could have got.<br /><br />This film has few bad elements .For example we dont see lightsaber fights that much anymore which should be the crucial part of every star wars movie. We should have always have more of these fights and duels and somehow they keep making less and less. I dont understand this. And big spoiler ahead , they shouldnt have killed of Luke , much better way to go would be to leave Luke for one more movie and let Leia rest deservingly in peace."
1927,1,There is a reason there is no buzz about this film,"This movie was terrible. There was no advancement in the story line of Star Wars. The characters are all inconsequential, even in death. The women in this movie are all superhero amazing, and the men are bumbling idiots. Take that as you will. There is a new twist on the cantina scene, but I found it mind-numbingly asinine. The movie lacks continuity, and plot lines that are introduced go ... no where. On the plus side, I saw some (two) cool things with an X-Wing, but then a really dumb one for comedic purposes. However, I also saw a spacecraft use gravity bombs. Yes, gravity. ... In space. There is more ridiculousness that happens in space, but I won't spoil it. But, it was truly a jaw-dropping, WTF moment in cinema. It made me wonder if the people who wrote this script had ever seen a Star Wars movie before. The only possible way it could've been worse was if the Klingons had shown up, or if their warp drive needed more dilithium crystals or something. I saw Star Wars in the theater 40 years ago. I do not intend to see Episode IX, even on cable. I no longer care what happens in this story. Disney has ruined it."
1928,10,"The Last Jedi is shocking, entertaining with complicated characters and emotionall depth. Simply amazing.","The Last Jedi is simply amazing. It is universally aclaimed by critics and concidered by many one of the best films of the year and the best in the franchise since The Empire Strikes Back. Unfortunately, there is a group of fans that are outraged by the film because it is original and dares to take the series to new places so they say it doesn't feel like Star Wars so the imdb rating for the film is criminally low(7.6 at the time I wright the review) Offcourse, I respect other opinions and thoughts about the film. <br /><br /> Story:<br /><br />The Last Jedi is original and shocking while it honours the rich legacy of the Saga. It has twists and revelation that will keep you in the edge of your seat. Despite it's runtime it never feels over-long or boring and it's totally necesarry for the characters to be fully developed. The tone is very dark and gives you a feeling of despair. Overral, the film is unpredictable,dark and has some wisecrack humor (that may feel a bit forced but it never fells flat and doesn't affect the dark tone) and is filled with great characters.<br /><br /> The characters:<br /><br />As I said the characters really stood out . I won't get to any spoilers but the film did a very good job with making it's characters complex and developed. Rey may be concidered by some Mary Sue but in The Last Jedi she is more human and flawed. Kylo Ren really steals the show by being one of the most emotionally complex and lovable villains in recent history and his character arc was impresssive and it showed the conflict of his character. Luke on the other hand is way more dark and sarcastic than the original trilogy. Some people didn't like that because it ruins their childhood hero but for most critics and for me that change in character was very well explained and it showed a more realistic side of his character. The supporting characters were also very good. Poe, Finn and the new addition Rose had personalities and a lot of chatacter building moments. <br /><br /> Rian Johnson:<br /><br />The writer-director of the film is one of the greatest new filmakers that directed indie and smaller films like the Brick and Looper and he also made some of the best Breaking Bad episodes. His script was simply phenomenal and his direction took the film and the whole series to new level. He made one of the biggest blockbusters of the year into an amazing film with artistic feel and quality something that most recent big budget films don't have because they focus to much on action, stars and bad cgi. I would dare and call it the biggest arthouse movie. (I don't say that modern big budget films aren't artistic. i.e. Blade Runner 2049 , Logan, Wonder Woman, War for the Planet of the Apes.) <br /><br /> Star Wars:<br /><br />As I've mentioned the film takes the series to new places but also honours it's legacy. All those things above made me as a film geek love this movie but the lore, the references and the whole asthetic made my inner Star Wars fun love this film even more.<br /><br /> Flaws:<br /><br />I don't want to sound like a fanboy and I recognise the flaws of the movie. There is a whole sequence in the 2nd act in Canto Bight that felt a bit forced and it wasn't as good as the rest of the film. The first few minutes were also not that great. The humor felt a bit out of place and annoying some times and I wished that it wasn't there but it was funny.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Last Jedi deserves your attention. It is mind-blowing. I don't want to insult people that didn't like it and I respect their opinion but for many and myself this was an amazjng experience."
1929,,Proof that it's not only beautiful white women (BBW) who have a little extra weight,"Orientals do too. And there is one specimen right in this film.<br /><br />Bravo studio and director for showing the truth. A strong woman admiral, a strong woman leader who has many wanting to give her a baby as she is a proud white woman and then the Oriental.<br /><br />There will be another episode soon (as read on Wikipedia)"
1930,7,It. Is. Just. A. Movie.,I feel like everyone destroying this movie is like the old man yelling at kids to get off his lawn. The movie was fine. Good action. Good storylines. Conflicting purpose. It's continuing down the same path Star Wars has always been on. Star Wars as a whole is not the masterpiece you nerds think it is. It's just a sci-fi war series between good and evil. Not some life changing or some meaningful work of art. It's entertainment. Everybody please just calm down.
1931,8,Beautiful and unique,The movie starts slowly but give it time and you will encounter many Wow/ did that just happen? I loved the twists in the story because you won't expect nothing until you watch it till the end. As a big Star Wars fan I can honestly say it was worth every minute! Ignore the naysayers because like in real life there will always be old farts who can't enjoy anything without complaining.
1932,6,"Underwhelming experience,","Coming from someone who loved Episode VII, this was not only a worse movie but it felt slow and was almost like hitting a beaten old joke. First of all,I hate how they don't fully commit to something. what were they going for with the purple-haired lady ie where is the fun if no one wins in a conflict, I might not know how to direct a better movie but this didn't feel like a satisfying turn of events. Similarly, I am also ambivalent about the Kylo Ren/Rey twist. Felt dry when the twist after the twist landed. Also, where is the respect paid to experience,hard work and culture/history. It's like none of those matter here. ie(Just a minor spoiler) Rey still is untrained(oO) and yet defeats a lot of people. WTH?. Now to the how the movie runs, the pacing was barely bearable, the graphics, fighting was spectacular and worth the money you spent."
1933,9,The Most Unpredictable SW yet!,"I loved this movie. Its better than Force Awakens in terms of story....Snoke gets killed by Kylo. Luke is anti social...Leia survives. Its an amazing movie. It's not quite perfect however. The part with Finn and Rose is rather awful but it was neccesary to the plot. Also having Luke die without actually fighting Kylo Ren was laaaame. Rey is a mary sue as her not really being tempted by the darkside. I mean come on? Even Luke was tested by the darkside in ROTJ....The best part is when Rey is brought before Snoke. The fight with the platorian guard is amazing All in all its a great film, but not quite a top 3 star wars movie."
1934,7,"Rey, Luke and Kylo bring the only bareable moments in the story","Besides the intriguing scenes with a Luke, Rey or Kylo, the movie is a long bore and a truggles everywhere."
1935,1,All the credibility on IMDB rating system just flushed down the toilet,"Seriously, how can this movie have a rating over 7??? This is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made and actually probably the worst scifi movie too. There's just so many stupid things on this movie and it just complete rapes the Star Wars universe. Please avoid this piece of crap at all cost, and Disney you can go **** yourself!!!"
1936,10,Best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back.,Late review but just rewatched it. Top 3 Star Wars films of all time.
1937,6,"More than holes in the plot, holes in the director","The problem of TLJ with respect to the original saga, is that G. Lucas very cleverly thought the characters from a philosophical standpoint, and with a KEY purpose within the whole history that includes its origins and importance of each character in the puzzle. R. Johnson and Disney not nearly doing anything like that, all they did was use the faces and names of the main characters, nothing else."
1938,5,Just sad.,"I don't know how we got here. It smells like greed and politics. And it ransacked this franchise. Went form a copy of ANH with TFA, and now we have ..this, pointless scenes, social commentary, and abominable writing. The only memorable scene I have from this movie is the fully silent space ship suicide.. only because it was something new. The other memories I try to supress because how Luke.. the casino scenes.. the asian girl saving finn in the most ridiculous manar, they are not jedi's, they don't have this force plot armor that allows them to do some unrealistic stuff."
1939,9,DON'T EXPECT A SKYWALKER CONTINUITY!,"SPOILERS! I just watched TLJ and really don't get where all the hate comes from, nor the easily explained plot holes and other details lots of fans nit picked about, like the bombs falling from space, yes that wasn't expressly explained in the movie, but it's totally possible they were magnetized or something, so that was one plothole i've seen discussed. Poe's conversation with Hux over the comms was clearly a stalling technique, even pointed out in the movie. the hyperspace tracker, though explained clearly through canon sources after the OT to be in development, still didn't stop lots of fans from trying to pass it off as lazy writing and impossible to do, apparently in fantasy relms it's possible! The ""Mary Poppins"" thing clearly showed how the force was connected to Leia. And just recently i read one about Luke's metal hand disappearing when he died, that was weak even then, turns out the scene was so far away you couldn't even tell if it had or hadn't. Those who complained about the writing obviously haven't seen a Star Wars movie before because the writing was very much on par with the writing of the rest of the franchise, full of plotholes and rife with conveniences lol, IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE!"
1940,,This Film Is A Tribute To The Casting Crew,"Rian Johnson showed up and said 'OK here is the deal. This film is being produced by Jar Jar Abrams. Therefore, it cannot be any better than The Farce Awakens. We got to make it stink. Really stink. We all now how much The Farce Awakens stank so this is going to take some doing. Get me the same cough cough actors and actresses as The Farce Awakens and I want a chubby Oriental woman.'"
1941,6,Something went wrong?,"Me and my son are a huge fans of the Star Wars and Episode VIII was the most awaited event of the year for us. But After watching this movie, I was a little confused. <br /><br />At first I rated this movie with 8 stars and it's very good in my book. But still there was something disturbing, something what was not present in the previous episodes. <br /><br />Because I am a Star Wars fan, I don't care about mistakes like gravity in space (when bombers dropped their load and those bombs fall straight down like they would fall on earth) and I am ok even with princess Leia's unbelievable survival - although it was one of those main reason why I lowered my points. It would have been totally acceptable if Leia have died there. What I mean by that, is that even Leia's death would have been better than this, where she were flying to the ship like true Disney princess. As we all know from previous episodes, even Jedi can die. But miracles happens and as I said, I am fine with it. But the for most main reason for lowering my points was the inappropriate jokes here and there. For shore those jokes were funny and I laughed for them as all the viewers did, but every time after that I find myself thinking ... really!! What kind of movie I am watching? Don't be mistaken. Star Wars has been always fun but this time it was so noticeable and it was too much for me.<br /><br />For my opinion, the best film in Star Wars series is ""Rogue One"" and it is not even the main line episode. So all my future hopes and dreams are placed to the Episode IX for now."
1942,10,Lots of hate from people who've likely not even seen it yet.,"Seriously, what's with all of the trolls? I guess some people just want attention, but don't want to spend the money to see the movie (or just don't like Star Wars). IMDB is starting to become the Facebook of reviews these days. Sigh..."
1943,6,From Good to Cringe (Complete Review - NO SPOILERS),"Two years have passed since the last Star Wars film. Last night I went to the cinema, not super excited about the film, but with some hope that it would be well made, well written and enjoyable."
1944,10,THE LAST JEDI KIND OF SAVED THE MESS OF THE FORCE AWAKENS!,This is going to be a review on this film with a comparison on the whole star wars franchise.<br /><br />a whole lot of mess downthere but worth it share if u have other opinions of the future film.
1945,6,Was this a sabotage on the SW saga?,"I'm giving it 6/10 because it bares the ""Star Wars"" title. It's a mediocre movie, nothing more. Shame on Disney, they ruined the fans' expectations."
1946,1,Disney is killing Star Wars,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this movie really was so bad. It had so many plot holes and was a huge disappointment."
1947,9,Impressive! One of the best of the eight Star Wars Episode films so far!,"""The Last Jedi"" 2017 covers a lot of ground regarding characters and story. Rei meets Luke Skywalker and continues her journey learning about the force, her background and how she fits in to the resistance against the new order. There are some unexpected plot twists and surprises in this film. Mark Hamill turns in his best acting performance in any Star Wars film. Director and writer Rian Johnson clearly knows and understands the Star Wars characters and story well and is willing to take risks with the characters and story. This is a film about the ending of the old and the beginning of the new, in regards to character stories. I've seen all eight Star Wars full episode live action films and can say with confidence, this one ranks with ""A New Hope"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Force Awakens"" as one of the most emotionally engaging films, since it all began with ""Star Wars: Episode 4: A New Hope"" back in 1977. So far, the Star Wars postquels are surpassing the prequels in overall storytelling quality and emotional engagement. Director J. J. Abrams is scheduled to return, to direct Episode 9 due out during December 2019. Originally, it was George Lucas's plan to have nine episodes of Star Wars. This destiny of nine Star Wars episodes will become a reality during December 2019."
1948,7,A Recap for them that have seen the Originals..,"Lets just hope that the next film is not a mash up of ""A New Hope"" & ""The Empire Strikes Back"" & ""Return of the Jedi"" like these first 2 were in a way and they come up with an Original script.. I reckon why ""Rogue One"" was so good, as new, fresh and original.."
1949,4,Eh.....,"Where do they go with the story from here? It's nice visually. Not a fan of how the characters or story are handled though. And as far as the casino goes? That was a complete waste of time. I feel like this was the trilogy wrap up and not the middle of it. Creatively I guess the slates wiped clean but that's all. ""Super Leia"" in space is very laughable"
1950,9,A return to core values,"The Star Wars series is entertainment, but I've always enjoyed the mystical aspects of the stories - though the swashbuckling is all well and good."
1951,,I want my 100 bucks back and 2 and a half hours of my life,"I haven't been to see a star wars movie for a while, but this was just abysmal. I cannot think of any redeeming features, there was no perceivable plot, just a lot of the main characters shooting knowing looks at each other. Let's see, stuff gets blown up, the rebels seem to do a better job of wiping themselves out than the dark side, Jedi Jedi Jedi . The acting is appalling, it's like they got a bunch of rejects out of the Disney club. It's not helped that the kylo ren character bears an uncanny resemblance to Keanu reeves and has similar acting skills. Even the special effects were rubbish, it's saying something when 40 year old effects in the original look better than these. Just save our money"
1952,7,I liked it,"Avid SW fan, enjoyed a lot of this film, hated parts. Vehement rage is the sign of a wanton mind."
1953,10,A Star Wars movie,"This is exactly what you want and expect from a star wars movie: exotic locations, strange creatures, wars everywhere, the rebellion, the empire (now dubbed ""first order""... I am a star wars fan since the first movie and frankly I do not understand why people are upset. The actors are doing a terrific job the director not so much (J.J. why did you leave the director's chair?!), overall they are creating a wonderful movie perfect for an afternoon with the family. I wish the side story with Finn and Rose were shorter, but anyhow it was nice to have it, I do not agree with the fans hating it. I will go again and proud to the star wars conventions wearing my Darth Vader helmet, this one rules as the originals!"
1954,6,DISNEYFIED,"In a movie, every little detail must have a role and a meaning. In the Last Jedi I felt random things were thrown into the ""space"" - so they can sell those freakin' merch-s. I hope the 2000's kids liked it, because if not there was no point in DisneyFYING it."
1955,10,Amazing,"Just returned from an opening night showing of Star Wars. It was 4 am and I was literally the only person in my particular showing. I have to say, I absolutely loved this movie. I had read some of the early user reviews on this website, and I was absolutely dumbfounded because I had also seen the rave reviews from critics, the majority of whom seem to appreciate this movie. After watching the movie, I'm relieved to say that this is a great movie."
1956,6,Disappointed though there were good scenes too,"Ok, I've never written a review on IMDB before and will try to do so now without spoilers.<br /><br />First of all I'm a fan, you know the ""seen-the-movies-more-times-then-i-can-count-and-been-to-celebrations-own-loads-of-posters type of fan."
1957,3,What? That was a dream right? Or a joke?,"Just came back from the theater and I'm so conflicted. I don't know what to say. I really really want to love it but I really don't like it. The force awakens left so much potential for an amazing movie but this was huge chance missed. Instead I saw a misguided incongruous and incomplete movie that saddens me to my core. The magic is gone, I don't know what else I can say."
1958,8,Deserving of a better review.,"Despite the overwhelmingly negative reviews by the fanboys who are afraid of any form of change, or any form of progression in the movies, the movie was great. "
1959,6,There is no payoff in anything,This will be spoiler heavy and there is no easing into it so I will just go ahead.
1960,1,RIP Star Wars,This movie was the final nail in the coffin... As a Star Wars fan I never thought I will ever say this but I'm profoundly disappointed.
1961,10,The »Empire Strikes Back« of our Days,"»The Last Jedi« (TLJ) is the »Empire Strikes Back« (ESB) of our days. It proves that Star Wars is not bound to endlessly recycle its predecessors' nostalgia focus nor retread anything the original trilogy (OT) did. The OT movies are a special case of lightning striking. Rehashing what they did would be fruitless, but rethinking why the achieved what the did is exactly what TLJ is doing. It pays reference to the greatest and most foundational theme in Star Wars: Hope. And it develops, in Kylo Ren, the most complex villain ever, and with Rey a hero that chooses to be a hero - not unlike Luke Skywalker in the very first Star Wars movie. It is a divisive movie for some, but it approaches you with an open heart and if you approach the movie just like that, you are in for a ride of a lifetime. TLJ is doing for Star Wars today what ESB has done for Star Wars back then: it gives it a future beyond its past."
1962,,A Mix Up,"I just watched the Last Jedi, here's my verdict:"
1963,7,A movie with some great twists but doesn't answer questions,"This movie is a great movie on its own but doesn't deliver when trying to fit it with 'The force awakens'. There were many questions in episode 7 that left fans wanting to be answered in episode 8 but weren't. Also I expected some more backstory on Snoke, a little more action from Luke Skywalker and The Knights of Ren. When Snoke said in episode 7 to Hux near the end, to bring Kylo Ren to him to complete his training, we saw none of that (or very little) in episode 8. On the whole this is a movie worth watching and could be a great addition to the star wars saga if the upcoming episode 9 tries to solve, justify and explain the auestions raised in episode 7."
1964,8,Luke Skywalker and the Pokemon Factory,"I never really liked the moronic hysteria around popular franchises like Star Wars. In fact, I am part of a large silent minority, who does not think the first films are perfect, feel that the prequels have their charm or that the last saga is the worst or the best of everything that exists in the galaxy."
1965,6,Average,Average at best. Expected a whole lot more especially after the trailer made it look so good.
1966,10,Pay Attention to the little things!,"I don't understand why people have such a hard time with TGA and TLJ. I mean, do y'all refuse to pay attention to what matters? Dialogue, people! Imagery does tell us quite a bit about where the movie is headed. It's called foreshadowing. Try it. "
1967,6,Bad Movie with amazing scenes,"It doesnt feel like a starwars movie at least for the first 50 minutes. Some shots, some jokes, some dialogues are recycled from other SW movies, it feels wrong instead of adding cohesion to the movies. <br /><br />Bad edition and Too many humor scenes damage the dramatic effect that audience should feel about Kylo´s conflict, about the obliteration of the rebellion.<br /><br />The escape scene on the casino part is horrible, it felt like jarjar all over again. Although there were a few awesome scenes, movie was dissapointing."
1968,5,I'm writing this review two years and I see it's damage,So I just Finished watching The Rise of Skywalker.... first off it's not as bad as people are saying but that's for another review.
1969,9,Don't believe in those salty fans!,This is the best star wars movie since empire strikes back!
1970,6,Falls Short,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi, this film has undone basically everything that was loved about all the films that came before it. There are so many plot holes and bad decisions that ruin many years of character development. What they did to Luke in this movie is a huge let down."
1971,2,metascore 84?? for real?,"Of course, the visuals and music were really great, but except for these, there is nothing positive about this movie."
1972,9,Anyone can be a Jedi and use the force!,"Okay, where do I start? I hope for the sake of the industry that we don't stop showing movies in the movie theatres! And That we don't stop going to see films. I've been rewatching all the movies at home and it's not the same as going to the movies. Especially if you end up in a full seated theatre with star wars fans, the amount of reactions that was pulled out of the film made everyone react together if that makes sense, it was like a big family JUST like all the Star Wars characters toughening in a big family. "
1973,,The Cultural Logic of The Last Jedi,"The purpose of The Last Jedi is to kill the idea that the Resistance need Luke Skywalker to ""spark hope"" in order to grow the Resistance and further it's aims. In order to achieve this end the film destroys all of the pillars established by the original and prequel trilogy about who the Jedi are and the value of what they bring to the light side and the Rebellion: individualism, heroism, mentoring future generations and traditional doctrines. This film doesn't just kill off Luke Skywalker - it destroys his legacy too. The Last Jedi renders the events of Luke's inner journey, the high points of the original trilogy that shape and build him as dangerous and misguided. "
1974,6,It was good in places bud also bad in others,"While the film was OK, the 'face off' at the end was a complete kop out and some of the 'random' scenes which made no sense ruined the film a bit and gave it a bit of a phantom menace film. I'd say better than the prequals, but not as good as force awakens."
1975,8,pretty fun to watch,"I never thought star wars was that interesting, just an excuse for some fun effects.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching Rian's version, very fun."
1976,7,"Good moments, but overall a step down in the saga.","I like some moments and ideas of this movie, but i was very disappointed with some of the characters and decisions they made. The movie has pacing problems, and the whole sequence with Finn and Rose could be replaced with more of Rey and Luke. Snoke and Phasma are wasted, Luke is dead and we didn't even get to see him slashing some fools.f"
1977,10,Entertaining and a fitting sequel for the series,"I enjoyed this movie and regardless of all the haters, I felt it's another good episode in the continuing serial. Don't look for any deep meaning, if you just allow for suspension of disbelief, you will enjoy this installment."
1978,7,Wasn't as bad as people have made out,"Firstly this movie wasn't the best Star wars movie ever. However I don't think has earned all the derision that it has received from a lot the ""Hard core fans""."
1979,1,An absolute insult to the Star Wars franchise... makes the Phantom Menace look like Citizen Kane.,"Without question, this is the worst Star Wars movie ever. It's not only bad, it's an insult and a slap in the face to life long fans. Kathy Kennedy has some explaining to do... she's really messed up here with Rian Johnson."
1980,10,the greatest Star Wars movie after The Empire Strikes Back,"I'm not great at reviews, but hundreds of other consumer reviews on this site are unjustiably negative and childish, so don't be fooled by them."
1981,6,I wanted so much more... SPOILERS AHEAD,"Okay so my first problem with it is how they character assassinated Luke Skywalker, he was THE Jedi Master and instead, he became an old man who complains about everything, then they killed off Snoke before we even got to see what he could do, then they kill off Luke but not Leia really? Sadly Carrie Fisher is no longer with us so I'm surprised Leia is still alive and Luke isn't. Also, the whole thing with Rey looking into the Mirror of Erised from the first Harry Potter was pointless and stupid and did not do anything for the plot. AND they killed off the potential of who Rey's parents could have been. JJ Abrams even said he told Daisy Ridley who her parents were and that they were something big. And then this new director just completely killed that idea. Phasma once again had only seven minutes of screen time and it ticks me off, I love Phasma and Gwendoline Christie and they just keep on wasting her awesome character. She is so much cooler in the comics. AND MY FINAL problem with the film was how Rose saved Finn, it made the whole him being a martyr thing stupid because we all knew he wasn't going to die. Now it wasn't all bad so here is what I loved and honestly what gets it a six from me and not a four. I loved how they went more in depth with the actual Star Wars Universe by that I mean the creatures and the planets. It totally felt like star wars, I like how they did Ben Solos turn to the Dark Side and why it happened, and I liked Poe's character development in this film. We didn't get to see that a lot in VII so I'm glad they made up for it in VIII."
1982,4,Remarkably Terrible,You must choose. 
1983,10,I enjoyed the movie,"I noticed the references to A new Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. I liked the story line better than The Force Awakens. "
1984,,The Good And The Bad,The Bad (there is lots of it):
1985,7,A great Star Wars film that needs more appreciation.,"Anyone can have their own personal opinions about the Star Wars saga, but I personally believe all of the hate from this film comes from the people who grew up watching the original films. I do personally believe that the original films are still better than The Last Jedi but this film doesn't sit far behind. I grew up in the time of the prequels and I loved them then and they play a big part in the story and even though they were hated they still tie the saga together, just like this new trilogy. People need to understand that even though Luke Skywalker was portrayed in a disappointing way which I felt as well, this film is trying to set up for the new characters such as Rey and Kylo Ren, which has easily the best fight scene I have seen in Star Wars, the way light and dark came together in the film and then were split apart from their different choices was great. Yoda clearing up the prequels was a very good addition to the film because it gave an understanding to it and a great deal of coverage. Something that people seemed to hate is Snoke and how pathetic his death is, which I thought when watching it but then later on in the film it shows that it made Kylo Ren more angry and make him seek more power which will make the ninth film extremely good. I do believe that Rey and Luke's scenes needed to be more important than Finn and Rose which had a plot which officially went no where. "
1986,10,"Beautiful, Unpredictable, Exactly What We Need",A beautiful continuation of the Star Wars saga.
1987,6,Better then The Force Awakens,"First of all, I never have written a review before and I'm sorry if I make some grammar mistakes. "
1988,9,Good movie overall with some issues,"I've seen a lot of strongly mixed reviews about this movie -- understandably. It was a lot to process. TFA left the audience with a lot to think about, asking a lot of questions. No matter how Johnson decided to answer those questions, someone was bound to be disappointed. The people making outrageous claims that it's ""worse than the Phantom Menace"" are just wrong. Yes, there were flaws in the movie, but it was a solid continuation of the franchise overall."
1989,6,What Were You Expecting?,"Everyone is saying how bad The Last Jedi was. Really? People and their nostalgia. Your remember the first Star Wars. Yes, the one where the Death Star was powered by a second hand camera switcher that Lucas got from an art school. Where the trouper uniforms were made of such cheap plastic they barely made it through the shoot. Give me a break. They say that the acting was bad. Since when could Mark Hamill act? He was always terrible. Actually, this last performance was one of his best. Carrie Fisher held her own and I do miss Harrison Ford, oh well... People say there was no plot. There was a plot: The Rebel Alliance vs. The Empire or some variation thereof. You got your blasters and lightsabers and dogfights galore. What more do you want? If you are looking for meaning and purpose, then go watch a documentary. If you are looking for a couple of hours of mindless entertainment, this Star Wars does the job. Keep cranking them out Disney."
1990,1,Phantom Meanace,"Is no longer the worst Star Wars movie. I always give any thing that deserves a rating of 3 or less a rating of 1 because when you get that low I wished I hadn't wasted my time or money and there is no real way to redeem a movie that is truly that bad. Its like critiquing the bouquet of the men's room. Yes it ""might"" be better than the odor of a toxic waste dump but is that really a valid criteria for a review? Descending into the sewer is little different from descending into the gutter that drains into the sewer. That said my real rating for this film is a 1 and to be honest that is one point higher than it should get but you can't rate any movies a zero. Hollywood has to have their pity star."
1991,9,A spectacular addition to Star Wars!,"I grew with Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, they all brought something original to the stories in a galaxy far far away. The Last Jedi is no different in it's originalality and the writers have certainly taken risks."
1992,7,"Great direction, bad plot","There was too much packed into one film, it could have concentrated a lot more on Luke, Rey, the force and its philosophy, but clearly the decision was made to create yet another clichéd action-fest instead. The pacing was wrong too, with the story jumping around too much without giving us a chance to absorb what was going on; as a result plot felt like unimportant afterthought. This is of course typical of contemporary big budget movies, patronising us by thinking we've all got the attention span of a hyperactive kid."
1993,1,"Embarrassingly Stupid, Cartoonish Star Wars Movie",Spoilers....<br /><br />This movie seemed to be made without any regard to common sense or understanding of the Star Wars universe. For example how does Leia get to breath in space. The worst stupidity since Superman quest for peace. Since when do Jedis get the power to make holograms from another planet. How did Rey get <br /><br />fighting skills without any training. How did Rose suddenly become a fighter pilot? Since when do droids get to pilot military vehicles? Why is first order still so stupid? How is Snoke so easily killed right after saying he can read the mind of his apprentice. What was the point of Luke sky walker again here? And how was this cringe worthy dialogue approved. In short George Lucas Starwars was at least grounded in some reality and believability. This one not so.
1994,10,Throw Your Preconceptions and Theories Out of the Window - Massive Spoilers,"What can I say? I am a massive Star Wars fan, I went to see this movie with my own preconceptions and theories of how I thought Star Wars should move forward."
1995,,Prepare to have a lot of what you liked about the OT destroyed.,"Directors seem to often have to make a trade-off between sticking to the Star Wars canon and lore on one side and creating a new piece of art on the other. Regardless in what order you rate the original Trilogy (OT), they seem to have (mostly) struck the right balance between these two extremes. Hence the rabbit multi-decade fandom. Arguably Star Wars fans put up with Episodes 1 to 3, because even though they were terrible films, they paid homage to the universe. You felt that you were, even kind of, watching a Star Wars movie. The Force Awakens drew criticism for basically following the same plot as A New Hope. Yet seemed to generally win over fans by mostly striking this balance. Paying homage to the old (too much for some) but introducing the new."
1996,7,Just an average starwars movie,"I saw this movie twice and the first time I saw it I hated it. I hated it because I'm a big starwars fan and we didn't get anything we wanted. We didn't learn who Rey's parents were, Snoke was cut off way too fast, and Luke was a coward who didn't have a big last stand. "
1997,10,Possibly the BEST Star Wars movie yet!,"No spoilers here, But I just walked out of the theatre thinking that this is my new favorite Star Wars movie, even above Empire Strikes Back."
1998,7,huge disappointment!,"The movie was edited very poorly!<br /><br />and never reached his full potential,shame."
1999,8,Maybe for the new generations...,"I can say , not a bad at all movie, but... as i grew older, became more cynical and start to like sf. more related to our planet than in a galaxy far, far, away... <br /><br />Valerian and Star Trek , are in my view relating more to me than some flying penguins and some ugly nuns from a Jedi's Scottish island. <br /><br /> Valerian with its new and fresh faces, was way better done , more so when we know now that the greek boy stole many ideas from them and John Carter ...Also, Star Trek does change the style and substance from one movie and tv show to another, so , it's also fresh and challenging . <br /><br />That being said ( written...) i enjoyed the acting of these new actors ; like the old ones, i believe we will see more of them... <br /><br />The CGI where as i expected, also the direction was really good. <br /><br />I gave only eight stars, maybe for the reason of tiredness. <br /><br />It's time to finish it and start something else. <br /><br />Maybe a challenge to humanity while emigrating to other stars ? I mean something serious , scientific, and with a big budget ."
2000,7,I strongly dislike this movie.,There wasn't enough red in this movie.
2001,1,The Star Trek V of the Star Wars saga...,"I decided to watch it a second time with fresh eyes since it's on Netflix right now. I wanted to see if maybe I'd like it better. I didn't. In fact, it brought me face to face with all the reasons I hated it that I had forgotten about it. "
2002,9,"""Let the past die... Kill it if you have to""","When I first left the theater on opening night, I was very mad and confused. I thought, ""Was that really a Star Wars Movie, or a parody. "" Everything just felt wrong about the movie.<br /><br />My original score here on imdb was 6/10 stars. I didn't think the movie was awful (I could never give it 1/10), in fact, the visuals were stunning, the music was amazing, and there were several moments where I was on the edge of my seat. The issues I had were the same issues as many of the others who have been reviewing the movie on this site. <br /><br />""But why are you rating this movie 9/10 stars?"" you might be asking me. <br /><br />The movie took some time for me to digest. It wasn't until I understood the Motif of the movie that I started to understand why Rian Johnson went the direction he did. As Kylo Ren/Ben Solo says twice in the film: ""Let the past die, Kill it if you have to.""<br /><br />This is the theme of all the decisions made in and for this movie.<br /><br />In the movie, we see several characters from the original trilogy die. This is one of the more literal examples of this theme. But the theme also describes the direction of the movie itself. Rian made changes to the traditional Star Wars formula. For example:<br /><br />-This is the first main series movie that does not feature a lightsaber duel.<br /><br />-This is the first Star Wars movie to use a flashback as part of the narrative rather than using a force vision.<br /><br />-This is the first Star Wars movie that doesn't end on a shot of a Skywalker"
2003,7,"Worth seeing, but not a masterpiece","It's alright. You came out of the theater pissed. You disagree with the direction your childhood hero went. That is ok. It's understandable. But relax, it's just a movie, a STAR WARS movie at that. This franchise isn't some genius thing. It's a franchise of dumb, fun action movies."
2004,2,The worst sequel,"When you thought it couldn't get any worse after the first one, the last Jedi makes episode 7 look like the godfather. Beloved childhood characters get's embarrassed in order to make place for new less likeable but more ""diverse"" ones."
2005,8,"A ""reasonable"" response to the negativity (in an unreasonably long post)",A few disclaimers to start off with:<br /><br />
2006,,"Poor, brain-dead writing","So many plot holes, pointless characters (Rose), ... the writing is extremely poor and basically kills off this trilogy since there is nothing left to do. Kylo Ren vs Rey in Episode IX? Who cares about that, these characters are cardboard-thin and not interesting in the slightest."
2007,7,Mixed feelings,"Clearly not the best script ever, but I certainly enjoyed the action in the second half of the movie. Truth be told, the first half felt liek punishment to a star wars fan."
2008,8,Up there with the Empire Strikes Back as one of the best Star Wars movies ever made,"Really impressed with Star Wars: The Last Jedi! As much as I liked The Force Awakens, it followed the plot of A New Hope a little too closely. This film, however, takes the story and the characters in directions I was not expecting. Rather than just retread what we love from Star Wars, the film expands the universe and takes us places we have not yet gone before. And it was great to see Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher actually get something of substance to do this time around."
2009,7,This movie have heart... but is not too good,"The movie itself is good, the photography is great and some details that the director put into it are very... very nice. But when the movie fails it does very bad and we can say the this movie killed all what J.J Abrams was planting for the Star Wars Universe and create new stuff taking away the mistery that the people like and with just one movie of this trilogy to be released that make this trilogy a little bit less interesting.<br /><br />In my opinion this movie is not good but is not bad, and some arguments that are going around in the fandom are extremely exagerated. The plot of this saga is not dead by a one bad movie, thats what i´m talking about, if you don't liked you have the choice to like the next movies, and the canon series, comics, books, etc.<br /><br />Just enjoy this saga, because now the movies are just a little part of it.<br /><br />And may the force be with you"
2010,10,"Ridiculously good. Depth, humor and insight. The force is back!","This movie is different, does takes risks and does not feel in anyway like a rehash of earlier movies. I loved the force awakens and i love this movie as well. I am sort of mixed on the prequels. The Last Jedi actually makes every Star Wars movie that has come before it better. Its character developments make sense but actually require something from the viewer and no it doesnt go they way you are going to expect but in a really good way. This film has a philosophical maturity that those stuck in an early adolescent cool guy with powers fantasies are not gonna get and as evidenced by the myriad negative reviews that i see on here prompting this one. Its just possible that closing the imdb boards pushed all the crazies onto the reviews instead of getting their troll habits out on boards. In any case this movie is ridiculously good, powerful, fun and completely perfectly star wars. anyone who tells you different is either a moron or a plant. or a delusional fanboy that wont be happy unless their own personal fantasy is up on screen and maybe not even then. I couldnt stop grinning coming out of the theatre and seriously considered simply getting right back in line. See the movie and dont listen any critics or anyone else. even me."
2011,6,"GOOD MOVIE, STUPID STUFF","So, overall the movie was good! There is flaws big and small that needed to be fixed/cut. "
2012,1,A film with no story...,Can there be a star wars film with no story? Can there be a film with no story?<br /><br />This is it. It's the last jedi. The effort to make the film look beautiful is visible. But it looks like no effort was made in creating a good story. A sequel that didn't even bother to continue after it's previous film (FA).
2013,8,"The Force is Still Strong in ""The Last Jedi""","Well, usually I like to give my usual speech about the film, but I don't want anyone to think I'll spoil anything, so I might as well jump into my thoughts on one of the biggest films of 2017, Star Wars: The Last Jedi."
2014,6,Star Wars Has Gone Typical Hollywood,"DiverseDiverseWith the new addition of Star War making its appearance this weekend, everyone (Including me) have hit the theaters in hope after seeing the 93% on rotten tomatoes that this will be the Star Wars that brings back the series. After watching The Last Jedi I agree with what Luke was saying the whole movie it's time for the Jedi to end. And what I mean by the ""Jedi"" I mean the Star Wars series as a whole. AT THIS POINT DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FILM TO BE SPOILED. The movie started like a now typical Star Wars film, with many people dying on both sides and a few ""heroes"" giving up their life's for the resistance (which is pretty much the knock of version on the Republic). Although the scene was captivating to watch, it skewed typical Disney/Marvel opening scene. I give the whole movie a 6/10, like bad parts there was some good parts. For example, the best part of the episode was when the five second commander of the Resistance light speeded her ship into the ""Empires"" main vessel destroying both ships.. ( The main ship of the Republic that was seen throughout the series, so it was ""a hit at home"" type of lose for all the true Star Wars fans.) Besides that sense and one other, The Last Jedi seemed like Disney was trying so hard to not to be predictable and failed. The cast, of course, contained some from pervious episodes like Rey (The most annoying character of series in my opinion), Princess Leia, Finn, Snoke, Ben Solo, and Luke Skywalker. It also introduced new characters like Rose and Codebreaker, and to be honest these characters were nothing but filler and fresh faces to make the series look my diveres"
2015,4,Can you even say this is Star Wars?,"What an embarrassment. I couldn't even begin to list everything wrong with this film, both from a film perspective and a Star Wars franchise perspective. There are so many plot holes! There are legitimately more plot holes than an actual plot. Is there a plot ? Or is it an implausible sequence of events that defy logic, physics, and the own established rules of the Star Wars universe?"
2016,10,Sorry if I'm stupid but I liked it,"I've read some of the reviews and they are all negative. I saw the film yesterday and I can only say that I liked it. Loved the action, loved the humour, loved the story line... So sorry if I'm stupid and gullible but this episode took me back to my youth and how I feld about starwars when I saw it for the first time."
2017,,I really liked it,"Yeah there were a load of things wrong with it, but I watched it and I enjoyed it. Would recommend!"
2018,6,It's an OK movie.,"The movie was ok. I liked the changes that it brought to the universe, I liked the visuals, I liked some scenes... But I think some character development was poor. Some plots elements seemed unnecessary. The plot in the casino, however, seemed to me like JRPG trying to make the game longer. Find a Code Breaker in the casino that would allow to enter the First Order barrier to then disable the tracking device. Finally, this would make it possible to the Rebels to escape. But all those efforts, turned out to be pointless, as the real plan was to just go to a nearby base. There are many plots in the movie that felt like that: Develop the plot and finish it in an anti-climax manner (Finn's attempted sacrifice, Luke's lackluster involvement, Snoke disposal, Ray struggle against the dark side...)."
2019,9,The Boldest Blockbuster in Years,9/10
2020,7,I changed my mind from 1 star rating to 7. Here's why.,I watched The last Jedi on release day and came away from it very disappointed. I even said I hated it. <br /><br />As a life long Star Wars fan I felt everything I loved about Star Wars had been ruined in 2 1/2 hours. 
2021,8,"Not without imperfection, but vastly better then some are complaining about.","First off, there are huge holes in this story line, in additional not all the written story script and lines fit together nicely. "
2022,6,You know that feeling of awe and excitement when you leave the cinema after a great movie? It didn't happen after TLJ,"Interesting film from Rian Johnson due to the decisions he made throughout the film. I have been an avid SW fan since the early days and have followed the story with a very close eye. Although The Force Awakens wasn't a major movie in some people's eye, I felt they did a good job with the production and storyline and successfully used it to prepare us for this film. However there are some big issues."
2023,1,Scandalously overrated film. The audience deserves a honest evaluation!,Any movie enthusiast can see this movie is appallingly bad. So I wonder how IMDB managed to give it a 7.5 rating. This is simply inacceptable.
2024,8,Entertaining,"Yes.. an 8 but please don't hate me :). I was entertained, I like the story (minus some cheesy and feels like unnecessary side stories like Rose/Finn). I read some of the user reviews and I was horrified to see how badly they were disappointed. A '1' ?? That bad, really ? But to be honest, I am not a hard core Star Wars fan, so I don't fully get such comments that this ruined the star wars saga. If it did, I am sorry to hear that and feel bad for you. I think the story overall put a new beginning and anticipation to what will happen next to this Star Wars saga, and I do feel excited for the next. I didn't feel that watching this was a waste of my time and money."
2025,6,Disappointed and let down.,"While I loved many scenes in this film there were some that were written horribly. 1st, the scene with Leia I will affectionately call ""Carrie Poppins"" was just plain stupid. Even the CGI work has horrible looking in my opinion 2.) The entire Canto Bight series of scenes were not only filler garbage for the plot but look and felt like they were not even part of the star wars universe. Rian Johnson has single handedly shown he can not be trusted with anymore Star Wars movies. I will not be seeing any other Star Wars movies that he directs. The only reason I give it 6 stars was because some scenes stood out and were well done but not enough to forgive the others."
2026,1,This rubbish is an insult,"If you buy a five-dollar Rolex copy in a shady market, chances are that it will at least still work. If you spend your money on this atrocity, however, you will find that poorly thrown-together copies made by pople who haven't a clue sometimes don't.<br /><br />When Disney took over Lucasfilm, you could hear the tills ringing all the way to galaxies far, far away. Now the cost must be retrieved at any price. So let's quickly pull together a bunch of second-class Star Wars fans from the nearest geek fair and have them churn out a few flicks according to the formula ""same as the first ones, only more - and don't forget the merchandise placement"". The result: As palatable as a cup of coffee left on the counter since 1977 - it tasted good a long time ago, in a time far, far away. <br /><br />There are simply too many faults with this cringefest to list here. Suffice to say is that the passion and artistry from the original movie, that made it jump out like a golden droid at us among all the droves of crappy sci-fi movies that littered theatres in the 1970s, are long gone. <br /><br />I'll take the fake Rolex over this any time."
2027,8,The Last Jedi doesn't disappoint with some disappointments included,"Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi is the second installment in the third trilogy of nine mainstream Star Wars movies that started back in 1977 with Episode IV: A New Hope. Back then, there was no such thing as CGI or 3D. So filmmaker George Lucas invented technology to make his vision come to life. His films were groundbreaking and laid the foundation for some of the greatest advances in cinema. Episodes IV, V, and VI were movies that changed how movies are made. They were ahead of their time and still hold up forty years later. In 1999, Lucas went back to tell us how it all began with Episode I: The Phantom Menace. CGI technology had come a long way, but it wasn't perfect. For his original trilogy, Lucas invented new technology to create what he saw in his mind. He received heavy criticism for Episode I as he seemed instead to settle for what technology was available at the time. He listened to the critics and scaled it back for Episode III, but it still lacked what made the original trilogy so special. In 2015, JJ Abrams and Disney joined forces (pun intended) to release Episode VII: The Force Awakens and it was the perfect blend of technology versus actual characters and actual props. Episode VIII continues Rey's (Daisy Ridley) Jedi training with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)."
2028,,A Wasted Opportunity,"It was this movie's duty to expand on where The Force Awakens left the state of the Star Wars universe, & also to patch many if it's predecessors plot holes."
2029,6,storyline and script were horrible,Its is such a shame as this should have been killer and is a flop
2030,9,Everyone's so morally outraged? 1-3 star reviews? Sign of times.,"I'm 39. I grew up watching Star Wars on UK Christmas TV, and later on VHS. I wouldn't say they were the be-all-and-end-all for me (like some of my childhood friends), but of course they were a real treat and gave me a taste of a future love; sci-fi. This film transported me right back there. I loved it. There's so much goodness packed into it, from the brilliantly dark characters, to the genuinely funny comedy, awesome fight scenes, vibrant colours and lovely cinematography from faces to landscapes. It really is a triumph and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some of the close up shots somehow feel so 80s, and nice touches like focusing on feet movement etc like old samurai flicks. The story had me engrossed throughout. The whole cast did a stellar job. Adam Driver I was unsure of having only seen him in Logan Lucky, but he did a top job. Yes.. more like this please! Don't let the 1-3 star reviews from the ""heartbroken"" and easily offended take away the awesomeness of this gem. "
2031,7,Rian's passive aggressive love letter to J.J,"Prior to it's release Rian Johnson was said to be taking Star Wars in an entirely new direction, and he did exactly that, only it was in the opposite direction we'd all hoped for."
2032,8,"8 is what I thought when leaved the theater, but now I'm feeling dumb","While leaving the theater I was so excited, film seemed to be very good. Two or more hours in tension, thinking how in the hell would rebellion survive. My nephew (13 years, he didn't looked old trilogy) was far more excited, saying it was the best movie he ever saw. But then I started reading stuff, specially user reviews, and now I'm feeling so dumb. One or two star reviews are so true that I'm thinking what happened to me.<br /><br />Well, I think that I don't bother too much in analyzing script. While the movie stays in reasonable limits (like much of Vin Diesel films don't do), I just go and see it. Well, this was the case. The actors are really fine, technical aspects are an orgasm and, like I said before, most of the time I was thinking... Will it be a happy ending? Or at least something near it? Moreover, I didn't payed attention to hardcore fans' comments because I thought they would be a pain in the bum anyway."
2033,7,Good but different universe?,"To me this was a good movie but it didn't feel like Star Wars to me. The humor was too slapstick, the camera movements felt like another movie entirely, and the way it was cut din'dt have the same feel as other Star Wars movies. So is this good or bad? For me this was the first Star Wars movie were I actually didnt care about the rebels and if they succeed or survive. Boring repetition of war was the feeling for me. The reveal about Rey's parents felt underwhelming. And even te return of Luke wasnt that spectacular although I did enjoy some of his scenes with Rey."
2034,2,"Great visuals, very poor script","Disney always puts up a good show with lavish CGI and the best special effects in the business, but all the best visual work in Hollywood can't save this movie from it's awful script and direction."
2035,8,Moves the franchise in an exciting and new direction. Despite its flaws it is in the top 3 films of Star Wars canon.,What I loved -
2036,7,Good but no great.,"There is much to like in this movie; big action scenes, heroics, space battles, lightsaber fights, the return of old favorite characters and unexpected humor. <br /><br />That being said for me it didn't feel like a Star Wars film but more like Guardians of the Galaxy. also there was a whole subplot about Finn and Rose on a mission that went nowhere. If this want a star wars movie I would give it an score of 8 bit to be honest I wanted more out of this."
2037,1,The Last Jedi.....let's hope so!,"You would think that for a Star Wars film, with all the money at stake, that Hollywood would sequester the very best writers they could find and would not let them out of the room until they came up with a home run, no, a grand slam script worthy of the epic series they were writing for."
2038,10,Great just great,It's Star Wars and it's great.<br /><br />Can't understand all the negative reviews.<br /><br />Just think it's a trending thing to do people like to be negative.
2039,,The Last Star Wars,Rian Johnson killed Star Wars along with Luke Skywalker. the galaxy did not need Rian Johnson and his deviations.
2040,6,Too less for so much hype,"I had high expectations for The Last Jedi, especially after they announced that Rian Johnson was going to direct it. I was curious to see where he would take the story and how he would answer certain questions we had after The Force Awakens. Needless to say, I was disappointed when I left the theatre, as The Last Jedi was not as good as I hoped it to be. "
2041,10,"Pretty much what I expected, and that's fine.","So this one was dumb, silly, goofy, contrived and in some cases pretty flawed... and yet that's what a Star Wars movie is."
2042,7,Mixed Bag,First off anyone who says this is the worst Star Wars movie ever either hasn't seen them all or is on something. Likewise for anyone who says it's the best Star Wars movie ever.
2043,9,This movie is going to please and anger fans...,"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a very difficult movie to talk about... not just because of worrying about giving away spoilers (which I will NOT DO), but mostly about what is so good about the movie, and what isn't. Having seen it twice now, and properly digesting it, it is a great movie. Personally, I feel that 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015) was slightly better simply because the pacing was faster, and the story was minimal, though simple and straightforward. "
2044,6,Mixed Feelings,I think this is an ok film but for a Star Wars movie I expected much more. It started out decent enough but after 10 minutes or so I started feeling bored and anxious for the film to actually get somewhere. By the end it barely felt like a Star Wars movie. 
2045,2,A disgrace,"I'm not upset about the direction that Dizney has taken the franchise. I'm unhappy with the absolute horrendous writing. Star Wars or not, this movie was awful. It was painful to watch. I'm not going to waste my time watching any more of Dizney's Star Wars movies. I'll cherish my memories of the first six movies - made with love for the story, not love of box office draw."
2046,10,The Best Star Wars,The best Star Wars film ever made and I love all of them.
2047,6,Many disappointments,"While TLJ movie was a lot better then TFA (so far in this trilogy) I cant say the movie was great. Yes i know, cinematography was outstanding but it felt like move was full of mumble-jumble of ideas, felt like producers were forcing certain characters and certain romance. Dont get me wrong, I am a huge nerd of Star wars and I love every singe aspect of it but Disney could come up with a lot original ideas about certain villian. I cannot ignore some scenes where thing just...didnt make sense..but same goes with brave and innovative approach in certain scenes, which was very satisfying. Many fans like to be annoying but its true about Reys character-there is no development in it at all. Also i absolutely disagree and dislike everything that happened to Lukes character, feels like wasted resoure and same goes with Snoke, which we all thought would be some new big bad and tough guy...Overall movie was normal, it was not bad nor good."
2048,1,A visually spectacular trainwreck.,Visually stunning with some fun scenes with some of the worst writing and dialogue since the prequels. So disrespectful to the franchise the characters and the fans. A bloated hollow vanity project for Rian Johnson.
2049,9,The Last Jedi is the most important chapter in the saga.,"After getting home at 3:30AM, after the midnight premiere, I just couldn't get to sleep. I was left with a huge deal of stuff to think about. Not just about what I saw in the movie, but about the world, about how we behave, and about how and why we always make the same mistakes over and over again."
2050,,This is not going to go the way you think!,"This movie was great but of course it was not great as the original trilogy but it was a diffrent take on star wars which i really liked. you think the movie is going in one direction and it goes different way and i liked that. Also Rey, Luke, Poe and Kylo were great in this one. Dont want to spoil anything but i think if you love star wars you should go see it."
2051,6,"Original, but not necessarily great","This film works on some levels -- there are great action sequences, new worlds and ships, as well as some pretty impressive performances (especially Adam Driver as Kylo Ren). However, the script is muddled and the treatment of classic characters is somewhat poor."
2052,10,10 only due to massive fan hate. Really I'd say 8/10,"The new trilogy is a departure from Star Wars in many ways.<br /><br />But to say it is bad...?<br /><br />No, it is not bad. I have seen all movies and have appreciated them all.<br /><br />There are bad things in TLJ, sure, but there are also good things.<br /><br />I have read several die hard fans review, and I will say a few things about the most disliked issues:<br /><br />1. Too little character development. Partly true, there is no classic development, with defining moments for all characters - all action paused for the audience to understand the moment. But the characters grow in real time. There are many new characters, which is normal if you think of it, and the movie cannot be paused for all of them.<br /><br />2. Bad subplot with the codebreaker. Well, shockingly as a fan of SW, I enjoyed it. Always knowing what happens, it kills the suspense.<br /><br />3. Too many build ups not used. Yes, they were many. But I fell for all of them. So in my opinion, they were well used. Not being sure what comes next, I would say it was refreshing for the SW franchise. It is what was missing in parts 1-3, where we knew how they end. <br /><br />4. Snoke died too soon. Arguable I would say. This levels the field and allows a range of endings. And it is in the spirit of the entire series. Both Jedi and Sith were defeated by their arrogance. In a way, it made a lot of sense. As we did not think it was possible, because Kylo Ren was young, and inexperienced, probably the sith thought that as well. <br /><br />5. Lack of real romance between characters. Sort of. And is love always shared? Finn has 2 ongoing possible relations. I would say both are not for him. He cares about Rey, but their relationship is kinda platonic. Same with the other girl (don't remember the name). My bet is he did not meet his partner yet. Rey fits well with Kylo Ren. Not sure that they don't end up together in the end. But the movie was very fast, so it is true, you can't build romance @ that pace.<br /><br />6. The First Order not making a small jump to catch the rebels. Yes, you have that right. I agree. Did not think of it myself, so I enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />7. Luke's development. How is his withdrawal ruining the series? Why do you expect a man with all the answers? You assume that wisdom implies action? Sometimes, wisdom implies inaction. And his emotional scar was indeed deep. To train his sister's kid and be so close to killing him? That was a difficult decision to take and such a thing can break a man. In a way he ran from the consequences of his actions. He knows he is to blame, and that fixing things can lead to making them worse. In a way, he does fix them, as the force comes to visit him, and reactivates him. He was once again needed. <br /><br />I could go on, but I will stop by saying this:<br /><br />A departure from known paths is a risk, but so is staying in the same mindset. For me, the most difficult thing to accept was the new setup with a First Order so strong. It really did set a dark tone to the new trilogy, and I disliked that it made the efforts of all characters in the original trilogy to be for nothing.<br /><br />But as I rewatched episode 7 now, without watching episode 6 before, I think that judging it on its own, it was not bad. So episode 8 was also not bad. A bigger departure from Star Wars than all other episodes, but in my opinion, something the series really needed."
2053,7,Honest thoughts,To start I'm 40 years old. I remember my mom taking me when I was young to watch Return of the Jedi . I enjoyed it now as much as I did then . As the years gone on we got the back story of Star Wars the fall of Aniken Skywalker the rise of Darth Vader Rogue one to tie the old with the new . Now we are on a new trilogy a new story with new players . But...... something is not right with the force . Let me elaborate
2054,8,Good not amazing,"The entire Finn and Rose story line felt like a waste of the movie. And Poe and Holdo causing so much trouble cause they couldn't communicate like adults was very stupid. But the movie looked good, and the entire Rey and Kylo vs Snoke was great."
2055,6,"Takes RIsks With Some Successes, But a Lot of Failures","Let's start with the good. For one, no one can say that The Last Jedi is a mere rehash of a previous Star Wars story, which was a (pretty fair) criticism leveled at The Force Awakens. I respect Johnson for trying to keep the franchise fresh, and I think that made for a better movie going experience. If TLJ simply retread Empire, then we would hear a lot of complaining about that, too. "
2056,1,Milking the cow,"Don't waste your money, this isn't Star Wars. This movie (and the previous one) just ruined everything the franchise established to this day. Nonsense story, filled with contradictions, characters destroyed and so on. Just another sequel created to keep stealing money and brainwash those with naive minds. New age trash filled with ideological and political propaganda, visions and concepts."
2057,10,A different kind of Star Wars movie,"And that's a good thing. The movie is a great departure from past star wars movies. Looking at Jedi lore is a awsome experience. The movie has multiple great messages and goes into many sides of the war. Great acting, especially from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. Funny, and all around enjoyable"
2058,6,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly",This review contains spoilers******** You have been warned.
2059,1,What's the deal with all the fake reviews?,Terrible movie. So many fake reviews.
2060,8,The Last Jedi Is Enjoyable!!!!,Having seen it 3 times at the cinema and twice on Blu Ray it gets better the more you watch it. It's not perfect but what movie is perfect. Highly recommend!!!
2061,,Not good,"As a long time Star Wars fan I was left confused after leaving the theater and since then as the days have gone by I find myself hating it more and more. The plot holes, the blatant political statements, and complete disrespect for the lovers of the Star Wars series are just a few of the many problems with this film. While admittedly the movie looks very good and not everything about is the absolute worst, in its entirety the film is almost like a shot to the head for anybody who enjoyed what Star Wars used to be."
2062,7,Enjoyable but loosing the essence,Lucas Starwars had a better story and were a bigger fantasy with more amazing worlds and grandiose. These new movies feel like soup of the day with some old parts to give it Starwars flavor.Make no mistake the movies are enjoyable but not as memorable. They are starting to feel more like Marvel movies where action is more important than the plot.
2063,9,Let the past die,"First and foremost, I am a huge star wars fan since I was a kid, I collected the toys, adored most of the Star Wars games (Knights of the Old Republic, The Old Republic, and so on), then something happened with eps 1 - 3. It became corny and a joke to itself, and I pretty much gave up then. "
2064,6,Such a shame,I applaud rian Johnson for taking risks and trying something different. but different is not always better. Things I really disliked:
2065,10,Don't let the naysayers fool you,"Go watch it if you're a fan of Star Wars! Judging from the overall reaction of everyone, you will either love it or hate it, but either way go and judge for yourself! <br /><br />Personally, I loved it and feel it's the best one so far. What they did with the story and how different it is from any other Star Wars Universe plot is EXACTLY what I have been wanting for forever now. As someone who is as obsessed as every other fan boy and girl, I personally feel this new direction and overall feel is exactly what was needed. What they did with the original trilogy characters I felt made them more realistic and relatable, and no longer the larger-than-life legends they have been, and I appreciate that. It has me super hyped for the new trilogy directed by Johnson!"
2066,6,I've watched every Star Wars in a Theater since I was 10 and this one?... eh..,"I've been one of those die hard Star Wars Fans since I first seen Star Wars back in 77. As a child, Star Wars was like nothing I had ever seen and completely captured my imagination. I fell in love with the concept and the story back then and continued to be intrigued by how the story unfolded. I bought the books, toys, VHS tapes, DVDs and watched the movies so much that I could receipt almost every line for the first three."
2067,1,Social Justice Wars results in sacrificing quality for money,"This movie was just plain bad. It felt like a B-rate sci-fi film with the star wars label slapped on it. Everything about this movie was off, or illogical. Characters choices were disappointing and dumb. It is as if they cater this movie primarily to the remnants of Hilary's campaign, relying on social themes rather than quality."
2068,8,A sci-fi fan more than a star wars fan,"This movie had enough action and plot to keep me interested for the length of the movie and I'm glad I went and saw it on the big screen. Are there better sci-fi's, sure. Though just being a new Star Wars movie I know it would have to be incredible for true Star Wars fans to give it a huge rating but I enjoyed it."
2069,7,A excellent addition to the Star Wars universe.,"Expectations are always taken to insane heights with each release of a major franchise film with Star Wars: The Last Jedi being no exception,<br /><br />Following on directly from The Force Awakens, the film is given an opportunity to do what the first film, disappointingly, did not do; develop the characters."
2070,2,"I would say ""garbage"" but that is recyclable.","Star Wars has been dead for some time, but then mostly the younger generation needs something. A new series needs to be created for them and this one needs to be buried. The movie is so predictable. Nothing new here. Disney will milk it for all its worth since they paid billions for it. They probably shot enough scenes for many more releases but this cow is truly dry."
2071,10,I loved it,There was the old feeling of hope in the movie. Fire away for the next one. The fight continue. May the force be with you
2072,,Mostly great for fan service and mindless CGI action,"The action is mindlessly enjoyable and fast paced, the special effects and CGI are impressive and clearly cost a lot of money and effort, and there's plenty of fan service, critters, and homages to past episodes. As someone not intimately familiar with the Star Wars franchise, I felt that The Last Jedi made for a very enjoyable if not typical stand-alone blockbuster experience."
2073,7,The Good and The Bad,"Wow this movie was a mixed bag, but overall I found it to be entertaining.<br /><br />Here's my list of good and bad:"
2074,10,"An amazing movie, not so much an amazing Star Wars movie.","TLJ has obviously angered a lot of Star Wars fanboys, and that is understandable, it tears away a lot from the original trilogy and George Lucas' original direction. But beneath all of the changes, lies a great movie which a lot of people are in denial about due to choices Rian Johnson has made.<br /><br />This really was an amazing film, by far the best since Empire Strikes Back. From the excellent visuals, good script, a controlled amount of humour, excellent performances all around- especially from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver; who give some of the best performances in the franchise so far."
2075,7,"Mixed Bag, but something shines through.","If you looked past some of the pacing issues and occasional lack of focus, there's a ton of interesting themes this focuses on. I love the movie. Can I give it anything over a 7? No. But can I recommend it? If you're not willing to watch a DIFFERENT Star Wars movie (that's still a Star Wars movie) then you are guaranteed to not like this. But if you're going into it without expectations from all the marketing, and you're willing to think about what you're watching beyond the superficial blemishes, then you very well may find a movie you really enjoy."
2076,9,I didn't just like it...I almost crapped my pants lost my mind liked it!,"Wow! All I wanted was Luke. And boy did I get the almost perfect dose of him. WOW. I liked a lot of things in this movie. And some I didn't. What a creative filmmaker Rian Johnson is. Entertaining from beginning to end. I can't get over the things that happened in this movie. Although I could have done with some things being left out. Or entirely different. Funny. So refreshing to see a movie that takes risks. And feeds you a story so fast. It reminds you that this is what Star Wars movies are all about. Tonight with my gang. And a great audience. We laughed, we cheered, clapped, and maybe just maybe. Got a little choked up. Very well done! It felt as new and fresh as the sequel to the original Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back. And Mark Hamill knocked it out of the part. Yes I wanted more. But I'll take what I got. The series could end right here and I'd be ok with that."
2077,7,When your anti-hero is WIMPY..,My review for newest starwars (not a starwars fan but decent sci-fi viewer since 1979's TV)
2078,1,Adding insult to injury,"Adding episode 8 to 7 is like adding insult to injury. Well, I mean - why? They could make just another rehash. They could make just another 'lively' pew-pew childish J.J.-movie. But no. What they've made is a spit in the face of all the SW fans, they've ruined all that was carefully constructed for decades. The question is - why? They are businessmen (and obviously businesswomen), so they wanted to make a profit. But what's the point in insulting people? Is it profitable? Was it really necessary to throw all the SW legacy to the trash bin? What's the purpose? What exactly they were trying to achieve?"
2079,9,Best Star Wars Movie Yet?,NOTES
2080,7,Disney and Star Trek as cover,"Those childish creatures and pink hair of the rebel's vice admiral were not a star wars thing. <br /><br />The plot is very close to episode V - empire strikes back and i'm asking myself is this a remake or is it a new episode. The cantina changed to a casino, final battle similar to the battle of Hoth, another weapon similar to the death star, what is going on in these directors's minds, don't you have any single new idea? Deep deep down there are still some elements that bring us back to the original star wars atmosphere, but it's fading."
2081,1,Utter drivel,No through narrative. A series of set pieces adding up to nothing. Second rate acting from Mark Hamill as he attempts to bring profound meaning to throwaway lines. Poor attempts at humour. Music that amounts to nothing much more than wallpaper. It's an insult to our intelligence and an insult to that first great film.
2082,8,Mean spirited reviews with no merit,"I have never seen anything except Gigli reviews that showed an obsession with rating something this low. The movie had plenty of flaws but Ive seen 3 times and enjoyed more each time. As a lifelong fan, I was pleased with shift in direction (which was necessary due to aging stars) and look forward to the journey of Kylo and Rey. I can see being frustrated by lack of answers or what you perceive as dissing the classic Luke Skywalker but its simply not a bad movie. Not sure why the hate is so palpable. Almost seems to have a political or religious level of intensity that no movie deserves. The John Williams score alone is worth price of admission. so again, you don't have to like it but don't pretend that its that bad or that Disney out to get us. Its in their best interest for these movies to be revered not hated. As Aaron Rodgers would say.... ""Relax"" <br /><br />and enjoy the journey<br /><br />May the Force live on forever"
2083,,Just horrible,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. No character development, cheesy plot line, unforgettable scenes and just no Star Wars imagination. It's as if the New Order created affirmative PC action on all of us."
2084,6,Close,This film definitely took a step back after a very well put together film two years ago.<br /><br />-Way too much comic relief<br /><br />-Overdone CGI<br /><br />-Corny and cliche scenes with dialogue<br /><br />-Childish movie overall
2085,10,The Last Jedi Brings the Weird Pleasures of Star Wars Back to the Multiplex,"Although Abrams and Kasden did the heavy lifting, setting the new trilogy on an exciting new path, Rian Johnson may have had the most challenging role to date-writing the screenplay and directing the sequel that matches our expectations of Empire Strikes Back, probably the most highly regarded film in the whole franchise.<br /><br />Rather than drawing the same plot structure, per se, he looked to Empire for inspiration tonally. He needed to write a story that brings these characters to the edge of what they think is possible, including those still alive in the original cast.<br /><br />Within the familiarity of the archetypes, comes a lot of quirkiness. There are the porgs. There are all the other fun creatures that beautifully inhabit the various planets where battles ensue. There's the witty banter as people young characters try to be heroic, with mixed results.<br /><br />And there's Luke's character, thirty-years older, but with some surprises up his sleeve."
2086,7,"It's an ok movie, but we miss George...","If you are a devoted Star Wars fan, then you know about the story of George Lucas and how he fought against the entire studio system of his era, in order to realize his vision and create this cinematic phenomenon called Star Wars. Now after two movies without him at the helm, you can't help but appreciate once more his great intellect, his ingenuity and most of all his originality.<br /><br />I truly love Star Wars, I grew up with it and it's the main reason that I love going to the movies so much. But last Thursday after having watched ""The Last Jedi"" I got that same feeling walking out of the cinema like when I watched ""The Force Awakens""."
2087,10,I have no idea why so many people hate The Last Jedi !.So much better compare to The Force Awakens.Just go and see this movie!.Dont listen critics!,"I have no idea why so many people hate The Last Jedi !.So much better compare to The Force Awakens , and one of the best Star Wars movie ever !.The last 30min of the movie is so Epic and emotional.Just WOOOOOOOOOOW!.Because episode 8 is so much different to the other Star Wars movies, I love it!.Something new , and something fresh !.<br /><br />I love the story.I love all charaters.I love comedy scenes,and I have no problem with Rose Tico ,that many people hate her!I really like her character.She was great for sure!.<br /><br />All action scenes were great and special effects were awesome!.So much better compare to The Force Awakanes!(I hate that movie ;]).<br /><br />Too bad that the Soundtrack Music is not as AWESOME as from Star Wars The Phantom Menace ;], but even though the music still was OK!.Nothing special ;]."
2088,6,This level of scenario can't be accepted for a Star Wars Movie,It's my first movie critic ever and I strongly felt I had to write one for this movie due to all the hype that this movie gets whereas the scenario is worth nothing and it is only a visual performance. 
2089,1,Absolutely SHOCKING!,I have been a big Star Wars fan for years. The last Jedi completely sent the film in a new direction which is not the Star Wars a lot of fans have come to love. The comedy in the film and the depressive Luke script was an embarrassment to the die hard fans.<br /><br />After waiting for such a long time to see luke with powers. All we got to see was a boring man you could not recognise anymore.
2090,10,Character driven with strong performances from the cast,"This movie isn't going to be for everyone, especially people who had major head canons going into this. I loved the experience. This movie was way more introspective and dark for a Star Wars movie, but still keeps that Star Was theme of hope running throughout, even when things seem bleak. Also, it was beautiful. And sometimes silly, because it's Star Wars."
2091,6,I know you like Star Wars but this movie may not be for you.,"You can skip this entire movie and directly go into episode 9 without missing a beat, everything that was invested into making the first film (TFA) with characters that were beloved for obvious reasons is gutted like nothing at all. The last Jedi is a long filler of nothingness and to add the name Star Wars in front of it, oh my."
2092,1,Still beating the same dead horse,"Did we really need a ninth Star Wars film? Is there really anything new they could have brought to the table? Not really, and for the most part they don't, but I actually thought this was a minor improvement over The Force Awakens and definitely leagues more entertaining than the bland and abysmal Rogue One, but that doesn't really say much."
2093,10,The Sequel Trilogy now has life,"When I first saw TFA, I knew that there were issues but was just happy that Star Wars was back and that it wasn't boring. On rewatches, I realized that the movie didn't make any goddamn sense and was filled with contrivances. JJ opened up a mystery box hoping that would provide intrigue, but it was really just poor storytelling. "
2094,,looking through the eyes of love,"Everything i say here is for me and how i feel i am not writing this for anyone else but me. (I am not rating this film )<br /><br />I went to see this film with the love and expectations of the original trilogy just like i did with the phantom menace and the following films, and was left disappointed and angry at what i saw.<br /><br /> For me this is a film for the future, for me it was made with profits over feelings and how it would effect future viewers, i will give an example.<br /><br />Myself and a friend (who isn't a Star Wars fan but likes sci-fi) went to see this film."
2095,6,Not overall terrible or good,It seems that most people either hate or enjoyed this movie. I feel a bit of both.
2096,8,"Emotionally Charged, and Visually Stunning","After having read some of the user reviews here, I did my best to stop getting my hopes up, which turned out to be completely unnecessary. Entertaining to the core, this movie has sharp graphics, some clever plot twists, and is action packed. There were a few moments here and there when it moved a bit slowly, and the dialogue was lacking, but those elements were few and far between. This one was absolutely worth the money to experience in IMAX 3D."
2097,6,I think there is a set up here...,"Ok, so I am not a Star Wars ""nut"" in terms of, it doesn't really affect my life, though I've seen all the films, and enjoyed them all - even the middle ones, ok maybe, Ep2 I didnt enjoy. Saying that, this film in truth left me a little flat. I was expecting something, so much more, and this has left me feeling flat. "
2098,8,Disregard the shallow reviews,"I went for the third time and enjoyed even more. Not once, have I felt cheated, disrespected or feel that my lifelong movie franchise was being dragged down by the powers that be. I am not a film critic but I've seen a million movies and this movie is not bad. Does it have plot holes, and things to be debated? Yes, but not enough to ward off my love of this franchise and the way that it has shifted gears to carry on the saga of Rey and Kylo. I never felt that Luke was disrespected. No more that Han being stabbed and thrown into the abyss. Luke was going to get his island obliterated and choose his own fate (force Ghost to come). Bottom line is that making these movies is impossible task with the scrutiny one will face. I enjoyed it, will continue to enjoy it no matter what anyone says and look forward to more adventures in the years to come. Thanks to Kevin Smith for his thoughtful review and insight. Made my 3rd viewing even better."
2099,6,Disappointing entry in the series,"I have very mixed feelings about this entry in the franchise. I loved The Force Awakens and I had really high hopes for this one...well let's just say I was a tad disappointed. Good parts: Acting(Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are great!), a pretty good start, good visuals and some really nice shots,some funny moments. Bad parts: bad character development, making a mockery of Luke Skywalker and what he represents for this series, drawn out plot(this movie is 2.5 hours long and they had time to show the whole casino scene),presenting Supreme Leader Snoke as an unstoppable force just to get rekt and go out like a bi*ch and ALMOST NO LIGHT SABER ACTION. Overall a decent movie but far from the best in the series, I hope Ep.IX will clear the air a bit."
2100,3,"I said ""Disney... mmgh! Stop it now!""",Everyone told me<br /><br />Not to stroll on that beach<br /><br />Said Disney gonna come<br /><br />Poke me in the coconut<br /><br />And he did<br /><br />And he did
2101,10,rave reviews from me (and my krewe),"I'm 49. I was 8 years old when I saw the first trailer for the first Star Wars movie back in 1976... and I had just turned 9 when the movie opened and my family and I saw it in a rare trip to the cinema. I had known from the trailer that there was something about this lore, this galaxy, that was meant for me. My friends at school all liked/loved the franchise, too... but none seemed to have the affinity for it that I had."
2102,7,A Star Wars film for non Star Wars fans,I don't normally bring myself to write reviews but I felt compelled to after watching The Last Jedi (predominantly for a sense of catharsis rather than thinking i'm any good at writing).
2103,1,The Death of Star Wars!,This movie is a disjointed mess. It is like the director Rian Johnson never read a Star Wars book or never watched The Force Awakens. It makes no sense and demolishes every Star Wars movie that came before it. A big thumbs down. Not only should Rian Johnson be fired but also Kathleen Kennedy and whomever edited this crap of a movie. I could make a better fan movie.
2104,9,Enjoyable,"I am not sure what all the bad reviews were but I found the film to be very entertaining and I am a Star Wars nut. I would have changed a few things during the story, however I am not the writer. Nonetheless, I found it answered many questions and left me with many more, on to the next story. It will be interesting to see how they write Leia off the series, she played another good roll. Everything else is left open for the next installment, and it looks to be a good story line."
2105,,OMG ! So dissappointed,"I am a Star Wars fan. It reminded me of the original Star Wars crossed with original Jumanji and Indiana and the Temple of Doom. Too much silliness, This codebreaker guy was horrible. What was it with a coffee mug in his hand. Some parts were ok with Kylo Ren, Rey and Luke but it was sometimes too much. This new film is a combination of all that is in the others without much new. It is one battle scene after another, etc. The editing tries to tell too many stories at once and ends up killing the pace as it stops a high action scene and slows the film down with a lot of emotion and confusing talk. The plot is muddled. I still have no idea why Luke kicked the Empire's butt then headed off to live in a cave. And this movie is way, way to long at 2 hours 40 minutes. Especially when you are seeing the same battle over and over just in another place. It just goes on and on and on. They could have cut 40 minutes and made it tighter and better. Visually stunning, great John Williams work on the score. Waiting for number nine."
2106,7,"Overall empowering film for women and people of color, not enough lore expansion IMO","I'm seeing a lot of just completely negative responses to this film on here, so I thought it was important for the other side to speak their peace so that many do not read reviews thinking it's all over and everything has gone to hell for the Star Wars universe. "
2107,8,One of the best Star Wars,"Luke and Kylo are Just Splendid characters in this One. Luke Is the best characters of all Star Wars, and his rendition in this movie Is just what the character needed. Truly the best Jedi ever. Kylo Is so imprevedibile and wild, it's amazing. The actor Is also great at playing him. Without Them, it's still a decent movie, with Amazing cinenatography and special effects. But Luke and Kylo are what make this movie one of the best (if not the best) star wars movies ever."
2108,6,It was OK,"I really wanted to like it, but the more I thought about it, the more plot holes stuck out in my mind."
2109,10,The Last Jedi is the First Fulfilling Star Wars Flick in a Long Long Time,This is a long movie filled with actual characters and sub-plots that made you invest in the characters. Overall there was less copying of cliche Star Wars tricks and replays. 
2110,6,"Wasn't terrible, but could have been much better.","TL;DR If you're a Star Wars fan and/or loath the nostalgia of the infamous characters, you may not like this film. If you're in for the entertainment/action and can look past the plot holes, this film may be for you. "
2111,1,Hopefully the last time I watch this?,"Ya pretty much annoying from start to finish. I don't mean to mansplain to you this film, but my friend Poe already got told. Visually this movie is impressive, a more salty Empire Strikes Back. Follow that fox! Luke is a fantastic force troll, much to learn I still have. Snape Jr is as angsty as ever and looking fly with that hair. And that poor flashy less than fantastic storm trooper(wait what are they called in this movie?) gets wasted and dosen't even do anything cool. Run run run, as fast as you can, you can't catch me, oh but the PC director can!"
2112,8,Not perfect but still a great film,"This movie is seriously over hated. I understand people's complaints but to my eyes they're mostly contrived in my eyes. I agree the casino planet was wack but the thing is the film is 150 minutes an it takes up only 20 minutes while other plot lines are happening. The first half of the movie dedicates most of it's time to Rey and Luke which is the best part of the movie to me. A lot of people despise the movie's portrayal of Luke. I love him in this film. He's a truly broken person. People hate that he tried to kill Ben but here's the thing: Luke is not a perfect person. He never has been. He almost killed Vader, HIS OWN FATHER in ROTJ, even when he saw good in him. Now imagine what he would do if he saw evil in someone. Back to Rey and Luke. The force scenes are beautifully cut. This movie's visuals are gorgeous, and I love Luke's redemption arc, it's brilliant paced and executed. The Poe and Holdo plot line is decent but bot outstanding like the Luke stuff. Holdo is an iffy character and people hate her cause she didn't share the plan, but it's pretty obvious she didn't tell cause Poe just caused most of their fleet to die. Makes sense why she wouldn't trust him. Later when Rey goes to confront Ben, it is built up greatly with all the conversations they share in the first act. People hate that Snoke is killed without any explanation to who he is but don't complain that until the prequels the emperor was killed without any explanation of who he is, so it's kinda hypocritical. Why can't we just say he's an ancient powerful Sith Lord? His death shocked me and got me hyped for the rest of the movie. The throne room fight is neat. The ramming scene is beautiful and makes sense in the universe cause even in the first SW movie ever we're told it's dangerous. The idea of admiral Ackbar doing it is stupid. The Salt planet battle is cool and Luke's final confrontation is very powerful, and I love his death scene. It uses the force theme beautifully, starting his story and ending it with that beautiful score is great. Overall, a great film with great themes and ideas, not perfect but got me excited for Episode 9, too bad that movie sucked."
2113,6,Black Hole Size Plot Holes,Distinctly average.
2114,2,Over all reviews,Just look at the reviews of this movie?<br /><br />2094+ a 1 rating<br /><br />694+ a 2 rating<br /><br />Only 519+ gave it a 10 rating
2115,8,"Dissappointing, not terrible",(I know that I will most likely be hated just because I didnt hate this movie and am not giving it 1 out of 10 stars. But that wont stop me from sharing what I thought. Screw off and grow up if you dont like it. Apologies for the lack of apostrophes and quotation)
2116,,Should have been greater,"Overall, a lot of the story wasn't terribly engaging, though it did have moments of brilliance. Several aspects of the plot felt contrived or convenient. The effects were, of course, top notch."
2117,6,Could be better...,"As a Star Wars fan, I have spent these last two years boiling of excitement about this episode 8. I love the Star Wars universe, its heroes, its bad guys and all the great stories behind. While waiting for this episode 8, I had the great pleasure of watching Rogue One which is a masterpiece when it comes to respect what I would call the Star Wars spirit. Watching Rogue One, I felt home. Everything was just pure pleasure and fun. I have watched hundred times the original trilogy, the prequel and episode 7 waiting for this episode 8. And now I have finally been to the last Jedi. It would be exaggerated if I would say that this movie is bad. It is entertaining and full of good moments and fun. I loved Poe and the first space battle introducing the movie, I loved Kylo Ren and BB8 is just so cool. But the Star Wars fan in me is heartbroken. At the end of Episode 6 I imagined that Luke would have had a great life and is a great hero. What I discovered in episode 8 was not easy to understand. How could the guy who believes in the light inside bad people, inside Vader, try to kill his nephew? How could Snoke the guy who smashes people on the ground in another ships (just with his mind) not notice a lightsaber turning in his right? Where are the knights of Ren? Princess Leia flying in space? Seriously? I agree that Rian Johnson has all the freedom to make a movie in his way. I understand that sometimes it has to be different, we have to be surprised and things have to be disruptive to create something new and exciting. However I know that as a Star Wars I have as well the freedom to make my judgement and for this episode 8 I believe it could have been so much, so much better. I will take a break now from Star Wars hoping that episode 9 will be better."
2118,8,Not perfect but close,****SPOILERS****
2119,6,Disappointing,I can understand why people are upset with the ending.
2120,8,"Sigh what the f**k, Disney?","Okay so right off the bat, I am not a die hard star wars fan. I simply enjoy them as good entertainment and good movies. I am not this die hard fan who collects star wars merchandise or care much about the EU. I am more fan of other stuff, but star wars never captured me the same way it did with the others. Why do I say this? Because its an incredible achievement for me to be this much extremely disappointed in a franchise that I don't care much about. "
2121,6,"Not bad, but not great","Honestly, it was entertaining, but some of the questions The Force Awakens leaves us hanging with is a serous concern."
2122,2,"I love Star Wars, but this is not or feels like something not related","Don't bother! It's not worth it!<br /><br />IMDb won't let me make a short comment !<br /><br />It's a sad movie, feels disconnected from the franchise!"
2123,8,Star Wars maybe without the force that accompanies it.,"Star Wars The Last Jedi is one of those movies that you wait with animosity that is epic and ends up leaving you with that emptiness that I miss something that never came, the film has a luxury casting, Daisy Ridley as King, her performance is incredible, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren at the end of the characters has a clear definition of what he wants to do with him, Oscar Isaac as Poe and John Boyega as Finn is better noted his place as characters in this film, Mark Hamill is certainly a great actor and sad that they want to pigeonhole it on just this character, as Luke presents a rather interesting side of the Jedi side and Carrie Fisher (peacefully rest) does an excellent role, all this great cast and still does not have a plot solid enough to be epic and this leads to a problem, the same problem that is noted in thor ragnarok, going from a moment that was epic, to one that they want to be fun and I do not think it's a problem of the director Rian Johnson who in looper showed that ue has talent to tell a story with incredible details and is present in every visual detail of the film you can tell that he knows this world of star wars, has sequences that keep you entertained, the soundtrack where John Williams is self-homage is incredible, but no more that, there is no that makes star wars love us so much, it is a film for fun and the option to see the weekend and the following week, it is not totally bad, but if you are a fan of star wars maybe you leave somewhat disillusioned, in conclusion the film sins of trying to be like the empire strikes back and ends up being like the return of the jedi"
2124,7,It could be better if there hadn't been monsters & all the time the same music/ sound effects!,"I think that the movie could be a lot better if there hadn't been these weird monsters like Chewbacca, Casino members etc. (They could be humans)...... It would not be so boring & annoying if it had not all the time, the same and the same sound effects, agony, sad or hope music, too! At least, they would be great to are a little new-times remixed..... !!!"
2125,4,Okay...,"I rated it a 7/10 after I left the theater, my opinion towards it has only gotten more negative and is likely to go down even more. I know there are things in it that I like from a filmmaking perspective, some thematic and narrative choices in concept, and there are things in it that I want out of a Star Wars movie. But the script is just a mess."
2126,9,Hold your fire...,"There has been a lot of criticism of this movie, and it certainly doesn't go the way many expect, but this is not a bad movie, and remember there is one episode to come."
2127,,This movie is so utterly abysmal that Kylo Den wants a reboot...,...and I give it Negative Infinitesimal NaN. Nuff Said. Now I am wanting to #RemakeTheLastJedi #BringBackJar-JarTheHeroOfTheEmpire #Jar-JarIsTheHeroOfTheEmpire<br /><br /> #ActuallyDoNotAsDisneyWillRuinTheHeroOfTheEmpireToo
2128,6,The dark side has come to many reviews,The internet is an angry place and it is a shame that rather than helpful and truthful reviews we are left with subjective bile. I want to place an honest review and I do not have my own agenda. 
2129,10,Don't listen to the negative reviews.,"In TFA there were many who complained and called the movie unoriginal. The Last Jedi is the opposite. It is too original and too far away from Star Wars, as we know it. Is it people's aim to hate the movies no matter what? "
2130,6,"Interesting parts of the film's predecessor are viciously stamped out of the plot, and what is left is too contrived and thematically confused to stand on its own.",NO SPOILERS:
2131,9,Review by a 90's kid,"So i grew up with the star wars movies. 4-6 where movies i watched with my dad and i loved them. I had never seen anything like them. I watched 1-3 in the cinemas and they were okay, but i still liked how they expended the universe."
2132,7,Huge fan but this sucks.,I'm a huge Starwars fan. I have seen alle movies at least muliple times. But I just couldnt get into The Last Jedi. The humor was so cringeworthy and some of the story borring. What's up with the spacehorses? Why was the main storyline revolving around a non existant chase so confussing? Why was Luke not like Luke at all? I yearn back to the days of Ewoks. At least that made sense.
2133,3,"sorry, its just bad","I wanted to like this film, really, I did, but it just bad, huge huge plot holes, stupid pointless sub stories, its trying really hard to be deep and meaningful but the writer was obviously just a mentally deficient precocious child."
2134,9,I throughly enjoyed the movie despite a few plot holes and weaker story areas,A visually exciting movie this expanded the horizon of the star Wars universe and I thought on the whole the movie was well written and directed
2135,6,Lazy!,"Episode 8 was a very interesting movie. It was a great movie, if you are not looking t it as a star wars fan. However as a star wars fan, I was disappointed. "
2136,4,Failures .. and more failures,"Without dwelling much into the original trilogy or the prequel trilogy, lets talk about the rebooted versions. I liked The Force Awakens reboot. It had all that nostalgia which I associated with Starwars plus awesome CGI and action sequences, even though the story was exactly ""A New Hope"". I was actually looking forward to this second instalment hoping that it would keep all the new awesome things from Force Awakens but give us a new story and not just rehash Empire. What we get is a mis-mash of unconvincing story-lines and disappointment after disappointment for the entire duration of the film."
2137,8,"Thoroughly enjoyed it, Fresh, Original and full of Stars Wars spirit",The haters of this film have forgot the spirit of Stars Wars. It's a swashbuckling space adventure serial at heart. This not only nails that but has better awakened the series for me that TFA did. It is not a rehash with a new skin like TFA was but a fresh shift in direction that has me looking forward to the new adventures and new heroes to evolve. A few choices in dialogue I would have written different but in the spirit of keeping it light hearted I can understand why some lines were what they were.
2138,,The Last Jedi leaves on with two experiences...,"I was left with two separate and distinct experiences after watching The Last Jedi. <br /><br />On the one hand, as a fan of big budget spectacle sci-fi adventures movies I was blown away. In that regard the movie delivers. It's exciting and runs at a brisk pace delivering action and peril for its characters in equal measure.<br /><br />On the other hand, as a Star Wars fan, I was deeply disappointed. After waiting two years since The Force Awakens, and thirty some odd years since The Return of the Jedi, the movie failed to deliver on some key moments we were hoping for.<br /><br />And therein lies the rub. The Last Jedi is a good well made movie that fails to deliver what its fans wanted. I still recommend this film, as the average movie goer will enjoy it, but if you're a hard core Star Wars fan... curb your enthusiasm."
2139,6,Bye Bye miss American Pie,"No spoilers, but If you haven't seen The Last Jedi stop reading now. It's been out long enough if you haven't watched it you're probably not a huge star wars fan anyway. Here's my brief rant about the film. Katherine Kennedy (Lucas Film President) along with her Co-defendant Director Rian Johnson have destroyed the Star Wars Film Franchise. I'm not alone with this assessment. Literally on wikipedia if you search Katherine Kennedy it says - ""Kathleen Kennedy is an American film producer and is the reason for the downfall of the most beloved film franchise, Star Wars."" I won't go into the individual reasons why the movie is so ridiculous, because my review would be as long as the movie. When you look at the complete devastation this movie has done to the franchise (on a likability scale) it will rank just a little higher than the Phantom Menace for future generations. But honestly the even the Phantom Menace did a better job on character development and plot. Disney had a lot riding on the new era of Star Wars and I think they've tarnished their brand a bit with they way they've handled this. With his original trilogy, George Lucas created something unlike the world had ever seen to that point. Star Wars was special and left a lasting mark on popular culture and fans like me. Star Wars will carry on from here, but only in name and not in spirit."
2140,10,It was extremely amazing experience when watch this movie,"I love suprises and risk the film took. I like this advanced storyline. But something the character had a lot of wise option to take but they decided emotionlly as in movies. I love acting, scenic. Dramatic. I give The last jedi 7,2/10"
2141,6,A Bad Good Movie,"I'd describe The Last Jedi as a bad good movie. On the base level, I feel like it could be a breath of new life in the franchise that could save it from becoming another stale and repetitive entry. However, if you look into the film and its story, it starts to show some major holes that create an inconsistent and incoherent film. Don't get me wrong, The Last Jedi is no Episode 2. There are some redeeming and good parts of this film, some of the most interesting and unique concepts we've seen from a galaxy far far away."
2142,8,Take a chance with Last Jedi because the movie itself takes chances.,I liked the Last Jedi because it took something that was missing from The Force Awakens. Chances.
2143,6,A fun but uneven entry into the Star Wars franchise.,"The Last Jedi is a little frustrating to watch from the standpoint of Star Wars fandom. It is far better viewing experience than the majority of the prequel films. I felt that when The Last Jedi was good that it was incredibly good, but the same could be said for it's less appealing moments. That when bad it is really frustratingly bad. I can only assume that a lot of this comes from studio interference."
2144,1,Disaster,"I'm original fan of the original trilogy. To many of us at the age of 12, we saw Star Wars and we was amazed. I'm sorry but this is a disaster."
2145,8,Great,"Hated ""The Force Awakens"", this one was pretty good. Visual treat with good directing and writing. No idea what everyone is so upset about. Probably just the toxic community around the SW franchise. (I'm not an avid, die hard fan of it)"
2146,1,I'm hating Disney,Disney is out to destroy pop culture and western civilization. That's the only way to explain this vile vomit bag of a movie. Whoever thought up the Rey character needs to go for a long walk through the suburbs and talk to real people. I'm so tired of these wooden strong women who are all Mary Sue's. Did they not watch the episodes 1 to 6? Did they not read the books and other source material? Do they hate Star Wars ? How much do they hate brave masculine men who are flawed but sacrificed everything.
2147,9,such hate..,I do not get all the negativity of haters on this movie. This was way better than the force awakens. The franchise is clearly headed in the right direction. I for one am looking forward to the next one. To all the haters I say gather your resources together and make a movie franchise yourselves because clearly you all have better stories and ideas.
2148,9,Looks nothing like his original,Looks nothing like his original progenitor.
2149,9,Bold and entertaining,I can't remember seeing a Star Wars film before and genuinely being unsure as to which path the main characters would take. That gives the film a depth and intrigue that Star Wars lacked. Throw in stunning visuals and a career best performance from Mark Hamill and you have an excellent sequel to The Force Awakens.
2150,1,Appalling abuse of a loved franchise,"Hollywood (Paramount-owned Disney) is quite clearly on a mission to break all established popular culture in movie in order to reshape it with their preferred characters, politics and themes."
2151,9,A true Star Wars feel to it,"It's hard to rate TLJ and TFA against the rest of the saga, but this movie ""does it"" for me. Brings out nearly every emotion, and all I can think about is heading back to see it again. TLJ I enjoyed, and I think TFA is a good follow of . R. Johnson really shines."
2152,2,Shameless ruin of a beloved franchise,The problems with this move are multiple.
2153,9,"Risky, but rewarding","Last Jedi was wonderful for everyone who didn't take a deep dive into theories on the origin of characters. Phasma, Snoke, and Rey's parents didn't have significance to them like fans had hoped. Johnson took the risk by not making everyone ""someone"" in the Star Wars universe. But Phasma is no different from beloved Boba Fett. Rey's parents are no different than Anakin's parents. Star Wars fans have recently bathed themselves into the idea every character needs to somehow be connected to another to be significant. <br /><br />If you don't feel that way and love seeing the story unfold, Last Jedi will be a film you'll watch over and over. Also, Johnson has taken the powers of the Force to a new level , past just mind tricks and moving rocks. With the Force, users are capable of much more than we ever expected. Stop watching YouTube theory videos, and you can't have much to complain about with this fun and gorgeous movie"
2154,9,Entertaining and Enjoyable!,"Seriously! Go see this movie. You'll enjoy it. I'm almost 50. I've seen them all. <br /><br /> Too many sensitive and critical people review this and are driving the rating down. That's too bad. Wahhhhh. I think people forgot what a whimp Luke was in every single episode right up until the end. Always whining and needing to be pushed. <br /><br /> Go back and watch. Give me a break. Leia was always stronger. This film is full of surprises. It had a lot more comedy than I would have expected, but maybe the jokes just landed better than the cheesy jokes in the older films (sorry George). There's a ton of scenes that will put a nice heartwarming smile on your face and a bunch that will make you go WOW! I plan on seeing it again!"
2155,8,I liked it......but I am a little sad.,"I have to say the move was well put together. Also......there was not the typical happy ending. The movie was solid, and was a emotional roller coaster."
2156,1,The disaster that ruined star wars,It's been two years and after much thought I've concluded that this movie single handed ruined the Star Wars comeback- an ego driven vanity project by Ryan Johnson that is a slap to the face of fans & the previous films. Disappointing & disastrous.
2157,10,What a bunch of crybabies!,"This movie was awesome! There were some plot issues but there is in every movie. Too many EU fanboy crybabies on here giving a bad rating cause all they can do is complain. TFA was ripped on because it was too similar to A New Hope. This one goes in it's own direction & had a couple surprising twists, but now since it's not like Empire, fanboys are crying like the little mommy boys they are. Can't have it both ways"
2158,1,"By far the worst film under the ""Star Wars"" name..","How is this abomination rated overall at 7.2? I dont get that.<br /><br />Everything about it is the pits. The characters, the acting especially the leads, the ludicrous plot, the ruination of previously loved characters; i.e. Luke.. The pathetic attempts to ""diversify"" the franchise..<br /><br />Nothing engaging, nothing memorable, nothing thrilling just an attempt to ruin a franchise which I think they're very close to have done.."
2159,10,Good movie with depth,"It is a good move which has depth in the story. It is different from previous trilogies, and it has changed for good."
2160,8,Movie wasn't bad like everyone is writing,The movie I thought was good not great like some of the past movies but still had plot points that surprised me and left me guessing. Sure there were some disappointing aspects in the film. And honestly towards the end I thought the movie was going to be over probably 3 different times so possibly some parts were a little slow. And I'm guessing all the one star reviews possibly not lowering the overall rating is to account for trolling. If you all started to put two stars instead of the worst rating some of you can think of because the movie wasn't what you imagined maybe the overall score would reflect that.
2161,10,One of the greates Star Wars movies,I don't know what is wrong with people and all this hate.<br /><br />It is a great movie with very star warsy end.<br /><br />I don't understand how somebody can complain about things in this movie that have an equal in original trilogy and at the same time glorify original movies.<br /><br />It is very hard to explain his without spoilers.
2162,1,This film broke a lifelong love affair I had with Lucasfilm,"What on Earth has happened to Hollywood? First Batman v Superman and now this monstrosity. I'm known for longwindedly bissecting films, film is my thing (well and writing), I have an encyclopaedic knowledge dating back to my first experience in the cinema at the tender age of six."
2163,9,"Rian Johnson: You've done good, real good!","I have been involved in the Star Wars universe since 1977, and I've seen all of the Episodes (Including Rogue One) in the cinemas. I have my own ""First-to-worst"" list, like everyone else on this planet. Like many, I too have a relationship with the Star Wars universe. Well, after seeing ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" opening weekend, all I can say is ""Rian Johnson, you've done good, real good!"""
2164,1,Heart Broken,Where to begin? This film takes a gigantic crap on everything fans love about Star Wars. Destruction of the Skywalker Legacy; Huge Plot Holes; Flying Space Lea; Heavy Handed Liberal Agenda; Snoke????? 
2165,8,Star Wars,"I loved it. I have no issue who didn't like it as much as my wife and I did but I found it entertaining, and overall a really good movie. Yes I have minor gripes but overall I really enjoyed it."
2166,8,Some reviews are laughable,Reading through some of these reviews has left me with an inner chuckle and left me thinking have some people commenting had their Blue Milk laced with something. 
2167,9,Deviates from the Star Wars formula and stands on its own,"The Last Jedi leaves the audience where they left off, with Luke (Hamill) on the receiving end of Rey's (Ridley) lightsaber pass. Meanwhile, Finn (Boyega), Poe (Isaac), Leia (Fischer), BB8 and a myriad of other characters including newcomers Rose (Tran), Admiral Holdo (Dern) fighting along the resistance. They are countered with Kylo Ren (Driver) and General Hux (Gleeson) the First Order set on a path to eradicate the Jedi religion. "
2168,1,"Complete dung. Bad humour, story & characters. The priority was making a statement of 'Political Correctness', not making a good Star Wars film.","The humour is awful, very tongue-in-cheek and just doesn't work, it makes the film aware it's a film - I can't think of the correct way of saying this, its almost a spoof at times, parody, just really bad.<br /><br />The story is bad, lazy, messy and full of huge plot holes, it isn't even worth thinking about too much as the writers obviously didn't. It feels like they had many writers not communicating well with each other go off and create their own separate set pieces designed to launch new toys, these sections are clumsily strung together into a showcase of FX. <br /><br />The effects were impressive for the most part, only what I expected though and it isn't enough to hold attention when the story is so bad and badly told, I didn't care about much of the action because I didn't care about the reasons for the action. One new creature was particularly bad FX too.<br /><br />The characters are dull and forgettable, most seem to be there more to make a statement of 'diversity' etc than anything else. There's a couple of older women in it who really smashed any small sense of immersion I might of had, just bad acting and weren't convincingly competent. The general rule is: the white men are evil or weak, females or 'POC' are inherently good, for the most part anyway - it's just patronising, juvenile and very tiresome.<br /><br />I think this film has been poisoned with current political trends and virtue-signalling. Making a film to please modern Feminists, Leftists and SJWs has taken priority over making a good Star Wars film and it really shows, they've gone heavy on The Force being a metaphor for millennial 'feels' too, very cringey. Look out for next Star Wars film making a big statement in support of 'Trans rights' (a 'Trans' Wookie maybe?), and Rey blaming everything on Kylo's 'toxic masculinity'.<br /><br />I've wasted enough time on this film already so I'll end my review here, just be aware if you plan to see it that there is none of the familiar Star Wars magic, no feel good factor, no reason to care and certainly no reason to pay good money to see this. I hope this film fails as hard as the new game is, and I grew up a Star Wars fan."
2169,8,Why the hate? Luke Skywalker shines!,I really don't understand the negativity directed toward this movie by many Star Wars fans. I only found a few things to be negative about:
2170,1,I cant watch it again,"Right from the first few minutes I thought I was in trouble watching this film, the stupid joking around between Poe and General Hux acting like her couldn't hear him kn the phone was just so childish. There were so many elements that just seemed so pointless like the whole Rose and Fn story wasnt needed and was there just to fill time from an already boring story, that's not even the worst part of the film. What they did to Luke's character is the worst part, he is the hero, the hero so many people and has been for about 40 years so what they decided to do was turn this amazing hero who inspires hope into a grumpy useless man who doesn't actually help train Rey in the slightest, the only cool part he had was with that fight with Kylo but that wasnt enough to save it."
2171,8,Finally Disney has a good one,I don't do movie reviews. I saw the first Star Wars back in my 20's and have seen them all more than once since then. I'm actually more of a trekkie but Star Wars is good scifi.
2172,8,There are 2 way to look at this!,"1. Enjoying the moment: if you want to be entertained then this movie is great. Great visual effects, great fighting scenes and it does fix some of the ""The Force Awakens"" worst moments."
2173,10,This is a masterpiece!,"Haters be damned! Rian Johnson took ""man babies"" nostalgia and stomped it to the ground instead of giving you box office ""fan service"" he took the force to levels we have never seen and created a whole new world for the rest of us to enjoy!"
2174,1,THE LAST TURD,"Quickest explanation for folk just scanning through the reviews is:<br /><br />Wanted to walk out of the cinema after 20 minutes, but was too embarrassed - the dark theatre was hiding my shame."
2175,10,The Most Visually Stunning and Character Driven SW film of all-time,"Rian Johnson has delivered a very different Star Wars film to our galaxy. One drenched in symbolism, heroism, character failures, and awestruck visuals."
2176,1,Can you say stupid?,Worse than that. Terribokulous.
2177,10,Bringing balance to the Force: Rey and Kylo/Ben,"Saw the movie twice already. Once on IMAX and once on a Standard 3D cinema. Absolutely LOVED the movie! I seriously don't understand what's up with all the hateful reviews here on IMDd. Never thought I'd say this, but I certainly hope Kylo/Ben and Rey figure out a way to bring balance to the Force together. Balance is not about the Galaxy being ruled by the Sith exclusively nor the Jedi alone. Balance means exactly that. Balance! According to Snoke they are equally matched on opposite ends of the Force. There's no denying the Force-Skype sessions between the two lonely and misunderstood misfits Kylo/Ben and Rey have brought them together in ways no other Jedi/Sith have ever connected before. They achieve a level of emotional intimacy at a very deep level. If there's one word I could use to describe their connection now is this: sensual. Supposedly, it was Snoke who arranged the Force-Skype sessions, yet by the end of the movie, after Skoke was already dead, Rey and Kylo/Ben managed to connect via Force-Skype yet again. Their paths are intertwined in ways neither of them yet realize. I know this is not meant to be a romantic type of movie, but it would make sense to have the two opposites meet in the middle somehow. This approach didn't work for Padme and Anakin, but hopefully it will work for Rey and Kylo/Ben. It would be a win-win for the entire franchise. Nobody is ever 100% good or 100% bad. Bring balance!"
2178,9,All new Jedi; Good space fights; Cool sword fights; BB-8,"It a incredible movie for fans, They give more insight of Jedi power; Although some stupid story plot line . Even though altogether it was fun movie !! Part of it felt like serials though such a long movie!! Any one watched rebel animated series will also like it they kind of bring stuff from there as well."
2179,8,True star wars fan is inspired again :),So basically I decided not to watch this movie after reading all the sad reviews that are super negative. It expresses how silly reactions on the internet can sometimes turn out.
2180,1,Worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen.,Hello.
2181,10,"So amazing, I watched it 10 times","This movie despite it has some unexpected events like the Yoda-like death of Luke and the weird relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist, it has also good action and drama. I funnily thought the creepypasta that Yoda was a Sith was true, because of Luke trying to burn the tree. Talking a bit more seriously, I loved the art that carries the movie itself, the charisma that previous Star Wars movies has is still there in a great way (despite it unimportantly Lucasfilm is now part of Disney of course) and the acting is plainly pleasant. I recommend you first to see the whole Star Wars franchise to then see this masterpiece to have an equilibrated-but-entertaining experience like no other."
2182,1,Possibly one of the worst films to ever have been made,How did people actually sit around a boardroom table and decide that this was a great story?
2183,10,An emotional rollercoaster,"Rian Johnson loves Star Wars. It's evident from the knowledge and respect it shows to the source material, the work of George Lucas."
2184,8,Average Star Wars Fan review,So I grew up in the late 80s I missed the originals in theaters but watched them on VHS all throughout my childhood (Even the Ewoks movie) I was a teenager when I-III came out and now almost 30 I am an adult watching this new round of Star Wars movies hit the big screen. I am a bit of a fan I have played star wars video games own a couple t-shirts action figures even was Han Solo for halloween last year. I would not consider myself a hardcore fan by any means. 
2185,8,I loved but there are some issues drive me crazy,"The movie is all I expected, really good! But there are some issues in the plot, some are too crazy to be true... a part from that, great!"
2186,1,Nonsensical addition to the Star Wars world.,This movie doesn't move the overall story along much. There were many parts that were frivolous or didn't fit. Disney taking over appears to be terrible for SW.
2187,8,Better than most recent Star Wars films,We were entertained during the entire 2.5 hour movie. It had more grit like the old Star Wars movies than other recent ones.
2188,2,Prequels come back! all is forgiven,"Watched this again at home with family after taking my nephew to see it at the cinema. He enjoyed it but we didn't. Had to know if my initial reaction at the cinema wasn't just a one off. My disbelief at such drivel, walking out the cinema was palpable.<br /><br />To be fair the first 10 minutes was good & the last 20 minutes too, so about half an hour of this bloat was worth watching.<br /><br />I could almost have accepted it if it wasn't a savage attack on Luke Skywalker one of mine & cinemas favourite heroes, there isn't actually any good reason that he doesn't turn up in person at the end. If he dies anyway. <br /><br />What I expected - a rip roaring adventure, starring Rey, Poe & Finn with some cool support from Leia, Luke, Chewy. <br /><br />Almost none of these characters come out well from this film, and some shoehorned in ones take up a ridiculous amount of plot space. <br /><br />In the deleted scenes apparently there was one where you saw Luke reacting sadly to Han Solos passing - there wasn't room for this in the final cut. Just think about that for a minute.<br /><br />Apparently the critics loved this I can see why, but really they are pathetic for trending reviewing."
2189,8,Raised on it,"I was raised on Star Wars, Star Trek, Lynch's Dune, and The Day the Earth Stood Still. My stepfather would buy the SW novelizations and I read them obsessively as a kid. I also read the kid series that he didn't buy (support your local libraries!). I think it's safe to say that I have some well-grounded, pertinent knowledge. I feel when rating a movie like this (with the well-publicized reactionary reviews) I have to present my bona fides first thing. <br /><br />I liked this movie a lot. Was it perfect? No. Was it the worst movie in the series? HAHAHAno. How does it compare with the original trilogy? I think it compares rather well. But that also means it suffers from some of the same weaknesses of the original series while facing an audience less willing to handwave said weaknesses away.<br /><br />The main thing I saw people who weren't being reactionary complain about were plot holes. Were there as many as people say? Well...not really. The phrase gets thrown around a lot when people are ragging on a movie, but the accepted definition is still the one in common usage. There were plot WEAKNESSES, definitely, but a plot hole is a gap in the narrative that (and this is the key point) ""goes against the flow of logic *established by the story's plot*."" Which means if something follows the internal logic that has been established...it's not a plot hole. There were a couple narrative choices that made me roll my eyes, there were moments that seemed illogical to me but fit the previously established characterization, and there was one section that just seemed so pointless. I didn't like those bits and it took this movie from a 10 to an 8 (well, more like a 9.5 to a 7.5). They weren't plot holes, they were just poor choices.<br /><br />Overall, I think this movie has a solid standing in the Star Wars pantheon. I know fans who raved and put it as their new number one, I wouldn't go quite that far. But it's definitely in the top half of my rankings."
2190,10,this movie worked for me,"I get how a lot of people feel passionately about this movie... either for or against. I'm pleased to say this one worked for me! I'd say about 96% of it I found to be unexpectedly pleasing... only 4% I might've tweaked myself, but that stuff is negligible. "
2191,8,The Shroud Of The Darkside Has Fallen.,"Let me preface this review by stating that I completely understand why there is so much divisiveness among fans for The Last Jedi. This film takes Star Wars in a place many probably didn't or couldn't have imagined. <br /><br />After the first viewing, with all my Star Wars fanboy insides questioning every moment and trying to enjoy the ride, it was very hard to. It seemed as though there were a lot of poorly written moments, or even crazy (even for Star Wars) moments that didn't make anymore sense than a Gungan riding a Bantha. "
2192,1,Uuuuuuuhhhhhg,"Massive raw potential... all wasted. I legit don't care about episode 9 now. In fact, After this, i am going to make a point not to spend anymore money on star wars... ever."
2193,8,Adult Crybabies Ruin Their Own Movie,Let's start with some facts:
2194,1,May the force be with you,I gave this movie one star but honestly I'd rather give it the Death Star.
2195,10,Terriffic.,The middle of the trilogy is another Empire - full of surprises! I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film never sure what was coming next. Utterly delightful.
2196,8,A movie that given some time will be looked back as the best Star Wars movie ever made,"I wasn't planning on seeing this one. I don't have the typical Star Wars itch most people have. I'm a film lover first and not a fantasy or sci-fi or superhero action film lover. I normally stay away from those unless someone says it is worth watching. After seeing all the poor reviews I began to think that there is a real reason for me to watch this. I was intrigued to watch this ""disappointing"" film. Guess what? It was amazing. Not perfect, but creative, complex and yes fun! What Rian Johnson added to the Star Wars universe was a much needed jolt of realism and complexity. I think the major reason most people dislike it is that they don't like to feel uncomfortable or unsure, but they are willing to watch the completely unoriginal ""The Force Awakens"" and left satisfied? Are you kidding me? There are a lot of social problems I'm not going to go into that makes me think why the masses tend to behave this way, but anyone who loves creative and thoughtful explorations in film (Blade Runner 2049, The Arrival to name a few) will enjoy this one. Those that want to see regurgitated adaptation will not. One thing I promise is that in the next few years to come this movie will finally pick up steam as being one of the best if not ""the"" best Star Wars movie ever made. Just you watch."
2197,8,Dear ALL- Star Wars is a story for children. That's it. Sorry.,"It really is. And that's ok. There's nothing wrong with stories for children. It just gets a bit awkward when you're an adult and expect to relive the same magical experience you had when you were twelve. It's not gonna happen. And because you're an adult you then start to rationalize your disappointment- oh, the character development is lacking, oh the plot holes, oh the pacing, there was no 'spark' or 'emotion' or 'spirit' or whatever euphemism you find for the bright & fuzzy memory of your lost childhood. None of those things are the problem. The problem is that you're 35 watching a movie aimed for the emotional and intellectual expectations of a 12 year old audience. OF COURSE it will have cheesy lines and plot holes and deus ex machina and one-dimensional characters. If you had first seen a New Hope at 35 you would have said the same thing about it too. "
2198,3,The worse movie ever. Period!,Where to start?
2199,10,If the next one is this confusing stars will be lost,"There is no doubt that fans will recognise and relate to the Star Wars universe and be happy about it. However, I find the story confusing. The story lines of all the Star Wars movies up to now have been crystal clear and pertinent to the title. E.g. A new hope - the empire has taken over and the rebellion gets organised. This one does not seem to have sense of purpose. Is it the end of the Jedi? Is it the begging of a new Jedi order? The contours of the new order are fuzzy and so are that of the rebellion. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there a many positives for which I have given a rating of 7. But sometimes you get a feeling that the motive of was essentially commercial - to create a transition from the old to the new and lay the foundations for a new number Star Wars movies including television series and spinoffs. In the process they forget to tell a good, old fashioned story - which I believe film making should be about. <br /><br />I also do not understand the need to have broken the flow of everything that was set in motion in the episode, The Force Awakens. It feels like the producers, directors and script writers have had a good fight about where to take the franchise thereon. <br /><br />The promise of a new lead that takes over Luke in the first series and Anakin in the second is not fulfilled. Rey, that was such a powerful character in The Force Awakens seems to have lost her clout. The attempt to pick it up in the end, to me was not enough. The most exciting question after The Force Awakens was her origins which had a very lukewarm treatment in the sequel. The love plot fizzles out. We see no remnants of the Republic that was supposed to have flourished after return of the Jedi. The training of Rey is nothing compared to that of Luke in the Empire strikes back and lacks the many spiritual layers of Yoda and his Dagobah refuge. <br /><br />On top of that, The Last Jedi introduces so many elements that do not deliver, the code breaker, the dark level of Luke's planet, the vestige of the Jedi heritage, Snoke's death, the planet promised to be special where the rebellion goes to take refuge. <br /><br />On a positive note, it is the Star Wars universe all right and leaves a good aftertaste for a fans like myself. But a feeling of incompleteness and a flawed attempt to make a film with the DNA of the Empire strikes back just as The Force Awakens was made of the DNA of a New Hope. <br /><br />Let's say I found the film good in form but lacking in substance. I would agree with the critic who said ""I am not sure if I saw a good film or a bad one."""
2200,1,An absolute disgrace,It's an absolute piece of trash. By far one of the worst viewing experiences I've ever had.
2201,10,"Ignore the haters, they are wrong","So when the Force Awakens was released in 2015, many people complained that it was the same old Star Wars, nothing new, nothing different and the same rock steady template had been done to death. Fast forward 2 years and now the complaints are that they deviated from a winning formula and that it ""doesn't feel like MY Star Wars anymore"""
2202,10,among the best,"I had a feeling THE LAST JEDI would be divisive purely for the fact that Rian Johnson (who is known for complex, unusual tales) was the lead creative force behind it. For me, this movie was excellent! It subverted expectations... yet what it did deliver were events, emotions and character arcs that I had no idea I wanted until I saw them. So, the surprises, the substance, along with the permission to break new ground fit with my sensibilities. "
2203,8,Entertaining!,There's a couple of things that happen that make you think well that was quick and pointless but other than that people need to get down off their directors chairs and just enjoy a film again. It's a film where you should just sit back and enjoy. Disney have put the money in and perhaps the story is alittle off it's still a good film. People are constantly looking for faults or comparisons to other films instead of just enjoying something. At the end of the day it's not real so just enjoy the action and the new characters! It's still a good film!
2204,1,Another Disney fan fiction.,"Just as episode VII ruined the ending of VI, this film ruins the character of Luke Skywalker, at least if you consider these Disney created films as canon. Many of the core elements which were present throughout Lucas' films are again absent in Disney's third attempt at making a Star Wars film. For example formerly central characters such as C3PO and R2D2 again take a back seat, popping up only occasionally to silence fans who might criticise their absence. Similarly beloved characters Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia are again treated like garbage to make way for new characters who are not even half as interesting. Likewise, lightsaber battles are again almost non-existent despite their universal appeal and a romantic comedy's worth of humour is shoe-horned into the film at the most inappropriate of moments.<br /><br />All of the mysteries which were left after episode VII were answered or brushed aside in the most lazy and uninteresting ways, leaving almost nothing worth watching to occur in the next installment. <br /><br />The film, like the last two, is a simple cash grab by Disney and a group of filmmakers who have no regard for the universe Lucas has created. It almost seems a compliment to call the film fan fiction as I struggle to believe any fan could serve up such rubbish. The highest level of canonical material is that which was created by George Lucas, Disney will tell you that their films are a continuation of his story, but in reality they are nothing but a tool for generating profit."
2205,9,Great Movie for Objective Fans,"First of all, ignore the haters. Most of their arguments against The Last Jedi are rooted in false reality that the original trilogy was without fault. Almost every criticism I have seen for this film (and Episode VII) can be applied to Episodes IV - VI. "
2206,5,"Holes everywhere, the crew and director better go hide in that holes...",This was a high budget garbage... I was really disappointed with Force awakens but this one sealed the deal... Disney is finished...
2207,10,Surprised with IMDB reviews...,"Ok. It´s not the best movie in the franchise, but it´s really not that bad.<br /><br />I think most people have a problem with change. They don´t like to ""let go"" some things... When Kylo Ren asks Rey to let go all this old style Rebel stuff, i find this very interesting, because now we could see that the light and the dark are sides of the same coin. Wich botters more me are the fact that most of the scenes were not well explored. They went to fast to various scenes and situations without exploring the deepness os the main plot. But let´s face some good points:<br /><br />"
2208,8,I don't get the ludicrous tirade. The Prequels are still FAR worse. The Last Jedi is better than what people bash it/praise it for(But not the best movie),"Yes, I get it. The Last Jedi is not perfect. It has cheesy moments like the Leia poppins scene, Luke milking a space cow(TMI!), Rose's cheesy line about ""saving who we love instead of fighting who we hate"", The Maz Kanata hologram, Snoke killed off ""too early, etc..... But these are not the problems in the grand scheme of things. The first 4 issues I listed are nothing more than an equivalence of a pimple on a beautiful girls face. The First Order are even more ruthless and cold-blooded than the Empire(my jaws LITERALLY dropped as soon as the dreadnought made a dramatic entrance), They added more layers Luke's character arc(the realism at the fact that he made a dreadful mistake having the thought of striking down Kylo Ren makes me enjoy Luke's character even more. Thats realism for ya. Humans making mistakes.) Rey I understand why people are angry that she has not lost a lightsaber fight - but the grand scheme of things is that she DID fail. Her whole main goal was to turn Kylo Ren back to the light since she was too over confident within herself given that she knew the story of Darth Vader redemption prompting her to do the same with Kylo only to get in more disagreements when they met in person. She may have PHYSICALLY won against Snoke's guards(She struggled against 1 guard at a time while it was easy for Kylo to take down 3 at once) but in the grand scheme of things she overall lost. She failed to turn Kylo Ren back to the light. She failed to do what Luke succeeded in doing in ROTJ. That convinces me she is far from a Mary Sue. A ton of other people say that instead of Holdo doing that sacrifice it should have been the meme character Admiral Ackbar - But these fanboys are not understanding that out knowledge of Holdo isn't any different from Ackbar. I get the fact it was a missed opportunity but don't you all think that it would have been strange that someone with the last name ""ACKBAR"" did a suicide action like that....? I shouldn't have to explain why.... Cause anybody with a functioning brain would know what I am referring to.... Anyways... I cannot wait until 19 years from now in the year 2037 EVERYONE will get over and grow out of their hate and appreciate this film's existence. Right now everyone is going on a tirade about how its such a ""sellout film"" but once time moves forward - everyone is going to appreciate this film more as the years go by. Luke's projection on Crait will go down as one of the best moments in cinema history. For now this film is shat on 24/7. But it won't be controversial for long once everybody grows onto it. I absolutely LOVE the scene where he looks at the binary sunset one last moment before he dies. A New Hope he started off as a farm boy wishing to become more than he already is - to become a hero. Then in The Last Jedi - he dies protecting the last of the Resistance and looks at the binary sunset one last moment before he dies. So powerful. It made me cry. I was hoping Luke would not die. But I am glad he died they way he did. Because I would have been dreading if he were killed by the villains."
2209,8,One of the better entries in the Star Wars franchise,"Some mild spoilers follow. The Last Jedi is a good but flawed movie - the good is strong character progress for Luke, Rey and Kylo Ren, excellent use of Leia, a logical progression of Force abilities (and no mention of midichlorians anywhere, thankfully) and excellent action sequences. "
2210,1,A film that is a deliberate middle finger to it's audience,"What a horrible mess of a film. A study in subversion lacking substance from a director who lacks any ability for story, setup, and pay off let alone to make a film that doesn't insult the intelligence of it's audience. Avoid at all costs this absolute horror of a cinematic experience. How Rian Johnson still gets hired in Hollywood defies logic, and comprehension."
2211,8,As someone who doesn't normally like Star Wars movies: this is the best one,"Visually speaking, you're not going to get a bad looking Star Wars movie these days (unless it's that acrimonious fan remake, of course). It's just not going to happen. That said, of the three new ones I've seen (haven't watched Solo yet), this has to be the most impressive in that department, with some incredible locales. Especially the spot where the final battle takes place, which is just stunning. The action sequences are once again top-notch, with the typically exhilarating dogfights being typically exhilarating. The music is also expectedly superb, though it does again cloak itself in nostalgia with not as much additions as I'd hope. It's well acted enough, with Driver and Hamill knocking it out of the park especially."
2212,1,It's awful.,"I'll add more later, just need to get this up. I'm sick."
2213,10,A good movie,"The CGI is amazing, the actors were really amazing, and I don't understand the hate send to Rey and Kylo Ren. They are good. I just think that the history of Luke get isolated isn't so good."
2214,9,this movie was amazing!!!,This movie was better than the force awakens and what the biggest surprise was in this movie was that yoda had came back though
2215,10,Don't listen to the bad reviews. It is a beyond great film!,"First of all I am shocked by the reviews written by so-called huge Star Wars fans who rate the movie low while half of them say they have not watched the movie but base their reviews from most of the other reviews and therefore comes to the conclusion that the movie must be bad. In TFA there were many who complained and called the movie unoriginal. The Last Jedi is the opposite, according to some. It is too original and too far away from Star Wars, as we know it. Is it people's aim to hate the movies no matter what? "
2216,3,"Bad plot, terrible logical errors, boring.","This was pretty much time wasted. Every interesting and/or loved character was written off the series (without reason) except for selected few, action was pretty much missing a point...when there was action and there was a insanely huge universe-breaking logical mistake at the end even worse than star-eating planet in the previous episode. No depth, no mystery, just argh. It would be miracle if the next episode manages to be better."
2217,10,"Haven't enjoyed a movie so much in a very, very long time.","To be completely honest, I feared that this episode might be something that would ruin SW universe for me, but I've never been more wrong. ""The Force Awakens"" seems dull and bleak compared to this one. "
2218,1,Star Wars Died In The Last Jedi,"I saw the original trilogy in 3 different theaters; the second film at a drive-in, actually, and the third film at a theater overseas. I had both versions of the original trilogy on VHS, the prequel trilogy in DVD's, and at some point I got both trilogies in box set DVD/Blue Ray combos. I got The Force Awakens in the DVD Blue Ray combo, then Rogue One the same way. Force Awakens and Rogue One both had certain things I wished were different, but those few small things were outnumbered and outweighed by greater things which I was grateful to see and experience. Not just nostalgia, but new stuff. A workable balance of old stuff and new stuff, interconnected, to make them fit together like they belong. Force Awakens and Rogue One needed to be that, and they were. Then some astonishingly underqualified folks with zero clues as to what Star Wars is meant to be came along and took a wrecking ball to the entire point of Star Wars, destroying its foundation, and with it, its entire mythology and purpose. Force Awakens had the potential to be one of the greatest Star Wars films, IF its many questions had been answered profoundly in The Last Jedi. Not only were The Force Awakens' questions NOT answered thusly, they weren't answered at all! In fact, many of The Force Awakens' points were outright contradicted! Force Awakens was highly dependent upon Last Jedi to give it its validation, which Last Jedi failed to do, so Last Jedi took Force Awakens down with it. Wasn't there ANYONE involved who could see during the process that this was a disaster in the making? Well of course, there had to be, but they were ignored by the clueless deciders who falsely believe they know best. There was one person in particular who has been involved since the beginning and knew Star Wars almost as well as its creator, and this person knew it was all wrong, but he was pressured to shut up. But you know, he was right. We stand in support of those who gave us the right Star Wars, as much if not more, than we stand against those who gave us the wrong Star Wars. It shouldn't have happened, and there were so many ways for it to have not gone this wrongly. I'd rather have a phoned in poor effort Star Wars than one which was an intentional strong effort to destroy everything Star Wars was and should have continued to be. Power madness is decadence, and Rome fell because of it. I don't have a Last Jedi DVD, and I never will. I didn't see Solo, and I won't. It's over. Star Wars is dead. RIP Star Wars."
2219,10,Star Wars fans suck!!,This was a great movie! I am a very big Star Wars fan and thought it was a very enjoyable movie. What do you Star Wars fans want!! It seems that you people are never happy and need to relax. Things have to change or every star wars movie would be the same. This is a much needed breath of fresh air added to the Star Wars universe.
2220,8,I'm a huge SW fan and I don't want to give it a low rate,The movie was well made when it comes to the special effects but the storyline was just painful to watch. Daisy Ridley and Adam did saved the movie for me because I like their interaction and they are such a great actors. Deep down I wanted Rey to be the grand daugther of Palpatine and that she join Kylo and they ruled the galaxy together. But it was more of the same! I hope ep. IX saves the trilogy!! I've got my hopes up!
2221,10,Let the Past Die,"Loved this movie!!! It definitely takes a different turn then expected. Johnson did a really good job writing a script that was fun, bold, surprising, suspenseful, and exciting. He made some choices that a lot of die hard fans might have a hard time with. <br /><br />One thing that I didn't like about the Force Awkens was how similar it was to A New Hope. I was a little worried this movie would copy the Last Jedi. <br /><br />Thankfully though, other than a few plot points, it doesn't. The story is an original well written story. It feels completely different from the last 8 Star Wars movies, but yet still manages to have that feel like a Star Wars movie. Forget all the theories you have heard about this movie. That is the best way to enjoy. <br /><br />New Comers to Star Wars are probably more likely to love the movie then the diehards. Johnson made some really bold moves, there both surprising and amazing. You don't get very many answers about Rey's parents or Who is Snoke., but this movie set up a bright future for the Star Wars Saga. I can't wait for the next one!"
2222,1,One of the worst movies of all time?,"Probably yes. What makes this movie even worse is the existence of the original trilogy. Heck even episodes 1-3 were gems compared to this travesty here. It takes special talent to destroy THE best epic space opera franchise in existence. And they managed to do it! Kudos to disney for achieving the impossible. Zero iconic characters, vomit-inducing plot, horrible action and almost nonexistent space battles. Not to mention overwhelmingly nauseating feminist agenda and the complete destruction of every iconic character this franchise had. Avoid like the plague."
2223,10,"People will hate me for this, but other than Empire this is my favourite Star Wars film","I just love this film. I love its themes, it's cinematography, and I especially love the conflict felt by the characters throughout it. I know that people didn't like how this film handled Luke, and I can understand why people wouldn't like that, but personally I love it."
2224,1,Theres nothing left for them to copy,"So we all know that TFA was just a rehash of a New Hope but on steroids. Well trust me, what JJ didn't steal for that film Rian Johnson stole for this one. There is practically nothing in this film that wasn't lifted directly from one of the other movies. When they do try to be original its an utter disaster.<br /><br />Leia in space - this doesn't even deserve comment.<br /><br />The longest, most boring car chase in space ever - I mean this thing just goes on and on and on, and even though they made a point of saying the cruiser was too far away for the weapons to do damage. Every time they gave a long shot of the pursuit, they were firing at them????<br /><br />Dumb humour - Right from the very beginning there was a never ending torrent of the dumbest attempts at humour I've seen. It just doesn't belong in Star Wars.<br /><br />I could go on for days about what is wrong with this film but I won't. It doesn't deserve the effort."
2225,8,"Changes, both good and bad.",Star Wars was never a masterpiece of cinema. It challenged norms in the 1970's by pushing practical visual effects to the brink while creating a universe that would later become the best extended universe that any series can bolster.
2226,10,EPIC!!!,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is EPIC!!!<br /><br />SO AMAZING AND BRILLIANT!!!<br /><br />WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!! 10/10!!!<br /><br />Love it so much!!!<br /><br />Luke Skywalker is a SAVAGE!!!<br /><br />Mark Hamill's performance is SO EXCELLENT!!!<br /><br />WHAT A GREAT ACTOR!!!<br /><br />WHAT A LEGEND!!!<br /><br />Thank you so much to everyone involved in making this masterpiece!!!<br /><br />May The Force Be With You!!!<br /><br />#StarWars #TheLastJedi
2227,8,Be your own judge,"Don't focus on the slew of negative reviews here. If you look closely, they're all duplicates and sometimes even more of the same reviews by the same people. That being said, you should see the movie and formulate your own opinion."
2228,1,"Wasted oportunity! (1st part spoiler free, 2nd part with spoilers)","***SPOILER FREE PART HERE***<br /><br />Where do I begin? I went to the theater having read all the spoiler free reviews this movie got starting from it's release date. So my expectations were at prequel-levels of low if you know what I mean. I knew there was going to be some controversy in the movie but I was like:""Hey... if they have a backstory or motivation strong enough for me to believe, I'll maybe like it."" But oh boy I was in for a nightmare. The film started with illogical space scenes, then went to stupid story lines that took the characters from point A to point B to get something from point B only so that in the end all the effort didn't matter. There was little to no background for Luke's way of acting in this movie, I mean he had no strong motivation, which was a problem that I saw the movie had from the beginning to the end which crippled it. Characters were changing motivations like weather and talking drastic decisions just for the sake of taking them without any ramifications or logic towards the future of the franchise. And let me expand this: The movie felt like it was made by 2 types of directors: one that build great climaxes towards huge twists and another one(like 5 years old or something) that would write idiotic conclusion the the twist that let me like: ""what?"" ""how is that possible?"" and no explanation further. Basically it felt as if Ryan Johnson build those moments for huge twists and then just slapped the audience in the face with incredibly dumb resolutions. Everything was awfully wrong and felt like a ""Batman and Robin"" disaster. To conclude this: all those awesome game-changing moments from the trailer are just lies meant to drag the audience towards something but actually scr*wing them up after."
2229,8,Better than I think,"I spected something worse but I truly enjoyed the movie. For me, was the best of the last 3 movies."
2230,5,Distinctly average,"Another hugely average instalment of the new STAR WARS trilogy, of much the same quality as the original. The big plot points are happily copied from the original films while bringing the original actors back just feels a little bit sad. I'm sure I heard that they weren't going to kiddify this stuff anymore, but what are those alien penguins all about? The script is dire - ""hey chromehead!"" being an example of typical dialogue - and the huge cast generally wasted. Daisy Ridley and Domhnall Gleeson give the worst performances. I won't watch it again."
2231,10,Over exaggerating die hard 'fans' trying to ruin a great movie.,"There are many things I disagree on in this film. So before I get into the positives, i'll get through the negatives.<br /><br />"
2232,10,A modern masterpiece,"Luke says ""things aren't going to go the way you think"" , an apt description of the movie! With so many brilliant visuals and excellent cinematography, background score , direction and high stakes , this movie blew my mind . The sheer epicness of this movie brought tears to my eyes , it felt like the force reached out to my soul and took me on a journey to a galaxy far far away!!!! "
2233,10,Pure amazingness,"I absolutely love the new Star Wars movies, they are amazing, great, fantastic. They have such a great story and I love the tension between Rey and Kylo Ren. I must say since I'm a Reylo fan, that this was perfect and made me love Star Wars even more. 10/10, will always support Star Wars and will always love it!! <3"
2234,1,The Jedi that never returned,So mucho been spected from this saga. The great scene when Rey gives the lightsaber to Luke Sywalker<br /><br />in that island gave an unexpected twist: A nasty one.
2235,9,The day StarWars evolved,"I did my best to keep it spoiler free, but seriously... haven't you seen it yet??!!"
2236,2,"Trash, worst Star Wars movie","Let me make this clear, I am not a Star Wars fan. I think the OT is good but not great. I enjoyed Rogue One a lot and I thought TFA was fine. This movie is not fine, it is terrible. The story, the characters and the script were all bad. The visuals are Good. That's it"
2237,8,This Star Wars fan loved it!,"I was a teen in 1977 and loved Star Wars and the Hero Luke. And as Luke says in TLJ "" This is not going to go the way you think"" so sit back and enjoy the ride. The movie is beautiful, the soundtrack is perfect and it's a well acted fun adventure. I was worried I'd cry when Carrie Fisher first appeared onscreen and I didn't. But I did cry at certain points of the film. Certain wholesome and worthy themes were fleshed out: ""Save what you love, telling someone you love you're sorry and nobody is too far gone"" are all brought up and portrayed beautifully. I'm happy with Leia's role and proud as a fan of hers to see this as Carrie's last film. Mark Hamill puts in his best performance as Luke. I love all the new characters. Rey is my fav! So glad to see more of Poe and I like the Finn storyline, it helps with those themes I mentioned. Overall I say let go of your ideas of how things should go and have fun! I like TLJ better than Force Awakens but not as much as the original trilogy. My teen and young adult children loved it as well."
2238,10,Mark Hamills best performance and easily a top 3 STAR WARS movie of all time,"I cant understand some of these low scoring reviews on this page .They seem to be made more to get some views, than actually rate the movie. "
2239,8,not the best but still an ok film,So a lot of people hate this film and go oh it ruined star wars oh i will never watch any again and to anyone who does think that your a moron but there are still problems with the film it's too long the new rose character is awful but the actor is fine and there are some plot holes it's not perfect but it's fine.
2240,1,Ruined the star wars legacy of our beloved heroes,"Truly awful, awful script, awful dialogue, out of place marvel style jokes, and most importantly (the sequel in general) ruined any hope of a good send off for Mark Hamill, Carry Fisher (now impossible to fix this with her death) and Harrison Ford from the SW universe."
2241,8,Great episodes are still coming...,"Not the best or worst either, but entertaining. And still hoping for more sequels to come...."
2242,1,"George Lucas, next time plan your future, thoroughly","Granted there were some new ideas in this movie, (very few!) a lot of the original George Lucas material was rehashed or recycled within this new 'money making' star wars commercialized 'SYSTEM.' In one of the climactic scenes ('revenue generators') we see kylo, Ray, and snuke can be substituted with Luke sky walker, the emperor, and Darth Vader. Ray watches through a window as her 'rebel friends' are being decimated while she is simultaneously being pressured to turn to the dark side by kylo and snuke (will she buckle under the pressure? I ask, I, a rusty tripped up 50 year old man reclining in my rocker, already having seen 'The return of the Jedi' from the 80's). Did Luke give in back then?!!!! =No But we already saw that play out, we've seen it!!. Kylo, even for the most part, rescued Ray from snuke like Darth Vader rescued Luke from the emperor; dramatic right? wrong!!). So why did Disney reuse this scene almost exactly the way George had it and why do they keep reusing everything else? Because Disney is trying to drain money from a naive star wars community; they strategically perused something they knew had 'made a killing' in the past and maximized profit margins. They've already made 3 movies in 2 years, and they will keep hanging bait in front of us until we finally deem it as rotten! JJ Abrams and Disney did the same with their other star wars film, they copied the entire plot from 'a new hope' 1977. George Lucas, you said it yourself, ""These are my kids"" Now theyre your basterds!! You shouldn't have sold it for 4 billion but I forgive you, only YOUR movies are epic, creative, fluent, dramatic, very good efforts."
2243,8,You haters are crazy!,"I read all the negativity before i went to see this, and i just don't get you people..... I was a fan before the world even knew of Star Wars, my neighbor worked for the...... well maybe I shouldn't say..... But I was told about the movie and was given 70mm cuttings from the movie before it was even released, which i still have... My point is, this film to me was as good as the first in my opinion, and episodes 1 - 3 were ok, they just had bad special effects/CGI, and i did hate Jarjar... not even sure i spelled his name right"
2244,8,Underrated.,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is probably one of the most hated films of 2017. But, personally, I think it's very good. However, the film does suffer from plot holes and questionable plot choices. Some character moments did not work as well as others, especially the kiss between Rose and Finn (which felt a quite forced and unearned). <br /><br />But what makes 'The Last Jedi' worth the watch? This film delivers some of the most memorable, if not iconic, moments in Star Wars history - the throne room battle, Holdo's hyperspace sacrifice, Luke using 'force-projection' to Kylo Ren, etc. The film is not afraid to make bold choices to explore uncharted creative territories that previous installments have yet to consider. The developing relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is quite interesting. The two flawed and chaotic characters clash and question their allegiances in their search for identity and purpose. The performances were fantastic! The Last Jedi largely excels on its technical aspects such as cinematography, musical score and VFX. Take Holdo's sacrifice for example: once the ship went through lightspeed, the heightened music explodes into silence as the audience witness a breath-taking composition of light, darkness and wreckage. There are a couple of other beautiful shots in the film including a wide-shot of Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker on a planet covered with white salt and red soil, with their iconic lightsabers pointing at each other. John William's score is, once again, amazing and the visual effects are impressive! The incredible attention to detail to the world-building makes this film feel much immersive and engaging. It feels much more personal and smaller-in-scale than its predecessors for most of its duration, but for its benefits. Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is bold, visually-striking and entertaining with some of the most memorable Star Wars moments in history."
2245,9,Great addition to the Star Wars franchise:,"Amazing movie!!! The movie adds much more depth and structure to the SW franchise. Its funny, dramatic, emotional, and fun. Rian Johnson and the rest of the crew should feel pround of this movie. Also a great last performance from Carrie Fisher. Cast standouts are Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Carrie Fisher. Although one of the critisisms is the lack of OG trilogy support characters. For exsample C3PO, R2D2, and Chewbacca. Similar to TFA, they were underused. But hopefully JJ can tackle that in ep 9. The movie also sets up the next episode perfecty giving JJ a flexible workspace. Cant wait to see what he is able to do with it. But the movie does drag on a bit. One or two of the scenes could have been taken out and swapped for something else, maybe more Chewbacca, C3PO, or R2D2. But the last 1/3 of the movie is perfect and has some of the most memorable moments in possibly SW or even movie history. Overall a great movie and would 100% reccomend you give the movie a shot."
2246,1,A script my 7 year old could have wrote.,Terrible story telling. Ruined an amazing franchise. Overpowered Hero and embarrassing characters. Turns legends into losers. The people who let this go ahead should be sacked.
2247,10,Stop trashing this movie because it dared to be different from its predecessors,Title says it all.
2248,5,total failure,I was really looking forward to this one but i enden up coming out of the cinema sad and depressed. this is the worst SW Movie i have seen.<br /><br />Still after 2 days i feel depressed.
2249,10,The Best Star Wars Movie,I love seeing fandoms mad over the silliest things. Yeah it totally threw off JJ's first of the trilogy. Yeah it didn't stay true to a bunch of Star Wars from the past. Yeah Kylo Ren was super brooding and you know what? It was better for it because Star Wars movies were always just okay to begin with.
2250,9,The best parts were...,"The best parts of this movie were the dialogues between Rey, Luke and Yoda. The ending of Luke was very good too!"
2251,8,Old people spoiling the fun,"I grew up with the original Trilogy, loving and rewatching it more often then i can count. But should i hate Disney for changing the course of the franchise? No."
2252,1,A terrible movie for terrible people,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This is zero-talent hackey trash that Disney threw together with duct tape and bubble gum at the last minute. The story is contradictory to the original content, the acting is embarrassingly bad, and the cinematography is literally just copying old scenes from the original trilogy. I want the two hours of my life I spent watching this dumpster fire back."
2253,10,The best movie I have seen this year!,"Honestly, I do not understand why people hate on this film so much. It is the best Star Wars movie in my opinion and even the best film I have seen this year."
2254,1,This trilogy should be left forever forgotten,I had high hopes for this trilogy. I was definitely wishing it would level up with the other episodes. Sure the prequel trilogy wasn't as perfect as the original one but it was still very watchable and entertaining.
2255,9,"Not the best, but still good","The last jedi is an action-packed movie, full of death, mystery, and porgs being cute. It is actually a family-friendly movie so DO NOT consider this as a good for nufink' 12 that no kid can ever see, as this is not true. When I came out of the cinema, my brother was moaning about how this film was not up to his standards, and I even had to go through the pain of having a text war with my uncle about the greatness of this film, but don't let that get you. This film is a really great film so go and enjoy it!"
2256,8,It's not as bad as critics want you to believe,"See when I was a kid, the prequels were all I knew. They were my life blood. I had 4 different Annakin figures and some Yoda figures. Everything about how terrible the movies were blew right past me as a child. Why? Because I didn't care if the child actor of Annakin did a good job, he was arad kid. I didn't care if lines were cringey or some stuff seemed unrealistic. This isn't a movie that is supposed to be hyper realistic. It's a movie that is supposed to be fun, flashy, extraterrestrial and just star wars. Sure the last Jedi may stray from it's original premise. Sure it makes Luke somewhat of a bad guy. But damn, none of that took away from my enjoyment of the movie. Not even the subplot, not even the bad death of the dear captain phasma. All of it was enjoyable. It was fun, flashy, extraterrestrial, and starwars. Some call it a convoluted mess I call that a regular starwars movie."
2257,9,Still about the attack on The last jedi,"I'm going to be direct, and if haters start their pestilent attacks with who they liked, fo ***, I LIKED A LOT OF THE MOVIE!"
2258,3,Not sure what that was...,I was a fan of the Force Awakens and this movie pretty much destroyed everything that was setup in it. Character choices were bizarre and the movie didn't set us up for the next installment. There was a lot of missed opportunities in this one and can't see how they will dig themselves out of it. I fear the third of this trilogy will suffer from catching up from this one. Lesson: don't start a trilogy from a large and established franchise and have different directors/writers for each movie!
2259,8,A movie that is about balance. For both film and fans.,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" is the eight episode and the ninth film in the ""Star Wars"" saga. It is written and directed by Rian Johnson and stars Mark Hamill returning as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher returns as Leia and is her last role, Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, Oscar Issac as Poe Damoren, and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. The film also stars Keli Marie Tran, Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro, Domhnall Gleeson, Andy Serkis and many more actors returning their roles. "
2260,4,SAD,"I just saw the last peace of Lucas going away. If someone had told me that I was not going to watch more Star Wars movies I would have sad come on, really but here we are. At one moment of the film I asked myself if the movie didn't have the name Star Wars what would have been the reviews. The Lucas legacy died with this movie. Moving forward the name will remain but not the content. Star Wars is a movie of the 90's where it was a monster hit and we shouldn't have touched it. This is why I am against making reboots, remakes or whatever. I'm so sad that there is no director that can come up with new ideas for films and we're just making reboots of classics. A movie is classic because it was perfect at the time it was made. Proceeding to reboot the idea but in 2018 is .... I can't describe it but here we are. Also you can count me out for the next one."
2261,9,Ignore the haters and make your own decision,"Just watched the Last Jedi and enjoyed it immensely. With a few twists and surprises, some fun battle sequences and some easter egg call backs the movie was fun and entertaining which is exactly what a movie should be. The star wars fandom has become weighed down by a vocal toxic segment, as seen by the hate aimed at the actress who played Rose and much of the bigoted comments easily found on twitter. Happily I've seen a growing movement to embarrass and ridicule these small minded fans. Not everyone will like this movie. .. and that's ok. But to call out the casting and demean the movie as many here have tells you more about them then their comments do about this movie. See it for yourself and make up your own mind."
2262,10,Good movie,I like Adam driver kylo ten but I don't like John boyega's finn
2263,10,my love for this flick,I enjoyed this movie immensely... even with the few little things I might've done differently had I been the director. But I let myself get swept away by the tale and I love where it brought me to.
2264,1,Worst Star Wars EVER!!!,I recently did something I swore I'd never do. I re-watched Last Jedi and guess what?! It still blows! Rain Johnson should never be allowed to touch another Star Wars movie again. It's unfortunate because Han Solo was actually good. The original characters were used horribly in Last Jedi almost like Potsie Weber on the last season of Happy Days. As far as I'm concerned this trilogy never happened. They all lived happily ever after on Endor!
2265,8,Well we liked it!,"OK, so the movie is not without it's faults. what movie is? My partner and I saw this on it's opening weekend and we enjoyed it and we're old enough to remember the original Star Wars movies."
2266,2,Even worse the 2nd time.,"Hoping it would get better the second time, it was not even close. <br /><br />I have to agree with people being paid to increase this film's rating- either that or <br /><br />the ""critics"" are all basically fake. <br /><br />It was worse the second time, good thing for fast forward..."
2267,10,My personal favorite Star Wars movie,"I consider myself to be a die-hard Star Wars fan, so I was there opening night for The Last Jedi and I will never forget the experience I had in the theater that night surrounded by other true fans who were blown away by this movie. "
2268,10,A Great New Instalment,"Episode VIII moved the franchise in the right direction. In many ways the film was very familiar with the original trilogy but Johnson ensured that he added bold, brave decisions with the story. It did something different and moved the story on. "
2269,8,One of the best Star Wars movies to date,People seem to put on rose tinted glasses when considering the original trilogy and are slowly starting to do that when thinking about the prequel trilogy.
2270,3,Magic has gone,Nothing has left from harismatic series. This movie will lower your IQ a couple pounts.
2271,9,"""This is not going to go the way you think"" -Luke Skywalker","The movie is an astonishing echo of the words spoken by the Jedi master. Over the last days I've seen something that has really bewildered me. A gap in the Star Wars community that has really left me in awe. In all my time as a Star Wars fan I've never seen such a split reaction to anything in the franchise. So just so you are aware, I adore Star Wars so take my opinions on the film with that in mind. <br /><br />Star Wars the last Jedi is a grade A film, period. The reasons why the community is so split are honestly beyond me. The film is as original as can be and takes risks never before seen in the saga, some of these risks have sparked the ongoing feuds in the community. But without getting into spoilers, the film expands on the rich lore and mythology of the galaxy we were first introduced to over 40 years ago. The idea of taking risks like these is something that Rian Johnson embraced fully as we embark on a story that is unexpected but right. <br /><br />It is not what you might have wanted at first but by the end the story turns into what you didn't know you needed. Developing characters like Rey and Kylo Ren even more so than in TFA. We also get major screen-time from Luke, Leia and Poe who were limited to smaller roles in the prior installment.<br /><br />This brings me to my next topic and that is Carrie Fisher, wow. It was hard watching her on screen after her untimely passing, but the way she was handled in this film is truly beautiful. She was also excellent in the film, much better than in TFA where her acting was a bit on the rusty side. <br /><br />Andy Serkis is memorizing, frightening and menacing as Snoke and gives an excellent performance alongside Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Who peels back the layers of his character making him one of the most relatable and complex villains in all of the saga. Overall the acting is on point and no single performance is flat or dull. <br /><br />Finally the direction by Rian Johnson is memorizing as he injects his persona into the heart and soul of this film. Flashy but full of heart and emotion and littered with moments of jaw dropping events that stack up against the best of the saga. <br /><br />And if I had one complaint with the film it would be a certain story arc that really detracts from those other moments in the film. It bogs the pacing down to a halt as we take a detour from the main plot of the film and are left wondering why was the subplot added in the first place. <br /><br />Having said that The Last Jedi is a great film, full of moments that hold up against the original trilogy. Everything from the action, development, cinematography and direction was immaculate and is some of the best in the saga. The film wasn't perfect though as a subplot in the film slows the pacing and takes our focus away from the overall plot, however it is still a dang great film. I would put it over TFA and RO and just over Return of the Jedi as number three in my list. I believe that the community is giving it unfair hate, but that is to be expected. However don't let them decide, go out there and see it for yourself and maybe you'll love it as much as I did. <br /><br />Final Score 9/10"
2272,3,I waited my whole adult life to FINALLY see Luke Skywalker at the height of his Jedi powers...,"...only for this awful director to turn him into just a whiny old man that barely does anything.<br /><br />First, the whole Finn storyline is bloated & ends up meaning nothing to the plot.<br /><br />Second, the Laura Dern faux-martyr nonsense was ridiculous! If you can just kamikaze a ship hyperspace backwards into the chasing fleet, why wait until your last ship to do it?! And why not evacuate everyone but a droid first?!<br /><br />Third, the final battle staged as though on a 2D tabletop rather than with aircraft capable of 3D aerial support was just stupid. And the holoprojected/astral Luke was also just stupid. At least his own damn sister would be able to feel if his true presence was there or not.<br /><br />Speaking of Leah, all the extraneous long shots of Carrie Fisher's CGI visage to long overdramatic music were just so tedious.<br /><br />But really that Luke Skywalker was written down to such a husk of a non-character was infuriating.<br /><br />Also, the just anti-climactic word vomit of the ""truth"" about Rey's parents was awful.<br /><br />Basically, the entire movie is a clumsy corporate effort meant to disengage the Jedi and The Force from the Skywalker family, in a way that destroys our memory of them so that Disney greed can make tons of other sequels about other random Jedi.<br /><br />This movie is a corporate piece of trash worse than any of the prequels!<br /><br />Yes, it's still Star Wars and the fanboy in me can't go lower than 3 stars but this is extremely generous. I truly hated this movie. It is as bad as Rogue One was good. It is Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull bad."
2273,10,Unique but still has the Star Wars feel. Visually amazing.,"I am a die-hard non-elitist SW fan. Sorry to hear that some of the elitist SW fans were disappointed, but what do you expect? Not every SW film can be just like the Empire Strikes Back. It's like if too many ideas from the original films are borrowed, it's a strike against the film; in contrast, if the concepts, characters, etc. stray from the original feel, it's also another strike against them. I guess I am not sure what people are looking for. "
2274,8,Why Many dont like it?,"I loved it, many old fans dont love it because well it wasnt their perfect story, Snoke died, Reys parent didnt get revealed, but lets be fair how would have that been logical in the story line? Rey going to snoke and snoke tellling his whole life story i agree the casino scenes were useless and that brings stars down."
2275,9,"Bold and powerful, the episode that dared to rebel","And wow, did it offend some people. I wonder if Rian Johnson predicted the avalanche of hate he would receive. In any case he deserves an applause. The saga was stale. Episode VII was too safe, almost a remake for the newer generations. The Last Jedi is what it needed to avoid becoming a relic. It poses questions previously not even considered. It is inflammatory indeed. Yoda approves, as he also gets tired of the holiest Jedi writs, teaching old Luke a lesson. The theme is change, uncertainty and the bluriness of order and structures, especially adequate for the current times. Though this is not where the good ends: all this the film does with great skill; every scene powerful, every shot beautiful. The basic SW elements are still there, including the cheesy moments. This entry does not destroy the franchise, it reanimates it. It's hated now but it will be remembered as an important sequel. What is worrying is that maybe the fanboy backlash was big enough to influence the future direction of the series, which I hope won't return to flat reenactments of itself and will instead continue through this exciting new path."
2276,1,A Star Wars Nightmare Realized,"Imagine watching Mission Impossible for 14 years on television and in the first film with Tom Cruise they decide to turn our trusted hero leader Jim Phelps (originally played by Peter Graves) into a mass murderer , killing off his own team. Oh wait, that actually happened! Was I the only one devastated by that? I wish youtube was around back then. I'm glad fans can now voice their opinions on what happens to our beloved characters... Now, we can only hope because..."
2277,10,"Excellent Movie, with a whole lot of fake bad reviews her on IMDB","OK, perhaps more of a 8/10, but the fake reviews/ratings are getting excessive. I keep my reviews on my own site, but I wanted to put in a word here with all these 1 & 2 star reviews running around. The Last Jedi is a lot of fun: Great adventure, solid acting, meaningful themes. It is one of the better Star Wars films--stepping up from The Force Awakens. It isn't particularly different in kind as it feels like a part of the franchise, so it isn't going to shock you. It's just a really fun Star Wars film.<br /><br />The grumbling is coming from a combination of nostalgia-kids who wanted exactly the same thing with exactly the same characters acting in exactly the same way and are unhappy that some things (mainly Luke) have changed, and Doomsphere residents who are angry that there are as many lead female characters as male ones and both a Black man and an Asian woman have prominent roles. Here on IMDB they seem to be mainly the first, and they are posting reviews here in mass. On Reddit and Twitter, mainly the second. Ignore both and just enjoy the show."
2278,2,RIP Star Wars,"The makers of this Star Wars episode, seemed to have made a non-intelligent movie, maybe thinking that the audience is not intelligent as well."
2279,9,I am totally torn about this movie. . .,"So I've been a fan of Star Wars movies all my life. Can't tell you how many times I've seen the Original Trilogy, and I'm even a fan of (certain aspects of) the Prequels. "
2280,10,A piece of art,"An unpopular opinion, indeed. When I first looked upon this thread, I was honestly shocked by the amount of people who are bashing this movie, claiming it is the worst one of the franchise and that it ""killed Star Wars"". I believe the sole reason why many hate this installment is that it is different from what we've seen before. Star Wars fans are well-known for their incapability to accept new ideas, or to look past the original three movies. That is why so many enjoyed The Force Awakens, for it was a cheap copy of the original. The Last Jedi, on the other hand, features a whole new approach, which non-fanboy fans will find more than entertaining. The sheer amount of symbolism and recurrent elements in this movie make it much more that a regular Star Wars. The numerous plot twists were among my favorite things about this movie, including the ""much-hated"" reveal of Rey's identity. Fans are used to this childish mindset that things are supposed to happen a certain way. She uses the Force so powerfully, than she MUST be a Skywalker. She speaks in a British accent, therefore she MUST be a Kenobi (or Palpatine). What they do not realize is that...the Galaxy is huge. Trillions upon trillions of sentient, force-sensitive beings. I, personally, really enjoyed the fact that Rey was shown to be a ""nobody"", proving therefore that the Force is not tied up to bloodlines, but can be found anywhere in the universe, even in the most unexpected places. This is, actually, the whole point of this movie, along with symbolically suggesting to not keep looking back, but rather forward. The originals exist, were amazing and will always be there. But, it is time for us to move on, and add new, wonderful concepts and ideas never explored before to the Star Wars universe."
2281,8,"THANK YOU, DISNEY!","Star Wars was my entire childhood. When the prequels came out, I thought they were wonderful, regardless their flaws. I was also hugely disappointed when George Lucas said that he wasn't going to do any more films after Revenge of the Sith, arguably one of the best Star Wars movies."
2282,2,The Lost Jedi,"This is my very first review on IMDb. I've always wanted to write a review despite my not very good English, and what better opportunity to review my all-time favorite movie - Star Wars!"
2283,8,Double entries over and over again,"Wondering where all the negative reviews are coming from?<br /><br />They are about 100-200 reviews copy-pastes here over and over again, making it about 1000 negative reviews in total.<br /><br />Take the dublicates out, and there is pretty much an equal number of positive, mixed, and negative user reviews.<br /><br />Movie itself was the best Star Wars movie since 1983. It has its flaws, but unlike Force Awakens, it was at least an original story."
2284,1,"Went to the movies happy, came out partially sad and confused.","I never thought I'd be saying this, but I have never been this conflicted with a Star Wars movie plot in my life. <br /><br />I want to go through the movie one point at a time:"
2285,8,don't believe all these unhappy fans,To start if you don't want to read all my review please if you do anything read the last couple of lines!!!
2286,10,Came to have fun and with high expectations - loved it!,"I know the whole Star Wars universe rather well, and I was happy to see a Star Wars movie like no other. The Force Awakens was just so similar to A New Hope, but this one... this one was different, but amazing. People here are complaining about ruinig Luke, but I loved his Mark Hamill humor, I think it suited him. As for other characters, they felt true. Visuals were about standard for a Star Wars movie."
2287,10,"I don't get the negativity, but we're all different","Yeah. I gave it 10. It had everything I wanted and then some, so I seriously enjoyed it to the fullest. No, it's not exactly like the other films in the saga, but they shouldn't be either. If you just keep doing the same thing over and over again, it gets boring in the end. This was far from boring. It was intense. It was hilarious. It was unpredictable. I have been a star wars fan right from the start (when I was old enough to know what it was) and I'm not disappointed. Far from it. I love it. I love everything about it. But we all have different opinions on how we want a movie to be, can't satisfy everyone unfortunately. I'm in love with the characters, especially Kylo Ren, cause he seems so unique and different from what I've usually seen in any of the Star Wars movies or other movies for that matter. Adam Driver is a damn good actor, right along with Daisy, John, Oscar and Mark of course. I'm watching that again. And again. AND AGAIN, oh yeah, try and stop me."
2288,1,Simply awful,The whole movie is a mishmash of earlier Starwars movies. It's hard to find an original idea anywhere. The last hour is painfully bad. The writer must have watched the first 3 movies and stolen ideas by the truckload. Mark Hamell is pretty good but this doesn't make up for the crappy story. It's like getting a Shemp!
2289,8,The Last Jedi Finally Brings Balance to Disney's Force,"Director Rian Johnson has delivered an intense, eye-popping, stirring and thought-provoking entry in the Star Wars saga, perhaps the best episode we've seen since the original trilogy. Johnson took the ""Christopher Nolan"" approach to Star Wars with this movie, giving it a darker, more realistic tone and a complex plot filled with reversals and reveals. In doing so, Johnson has created a far more interesting and involving movie than J.J. Abrams' bubblebrained retread The Force Awakens and the sloppy, unfocused Rogue One. While the movie lacks the dazzling visual splendor of George Lucas' prequels, most notably suffering from some uninspired creature designs, it makes up for that with its sheer sense of literacy. For the first time, audiences can have hope in the ongoing quality of Disney's Star Wars movies. "
2290,2,NETFLIX !!!!!!!!!!!!!!.........,"Cumulative Worldwide Gross: $1,311,425,821 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2291,9,Superb film! from someone who grew up with the originals.,I grew up with the original films and toys. I loved Empire strikes back. This film seems like a mixture of Return of the Jedi and Empire.
2292,10,A pleasantly unpredictable and mature spectacle.,"I'm an old dinosaur who has seen all the original movies on their release in cinemas and still enjoyed the slightly disappointing prequels. Then this new trilogy came along and brought back the magic and nostalgia of the classic movies of my childhood. The Force Awakens was a fantastic introduction to our new characters and a great first chapter of an exciting new tale. <br /><br />Now we have the second part of the story and boy, did it surprise me in a good way. The movie opens with a fantastic space battle that provides genuine tension and thrills. Then the story progresses into a desperate fight for survival for the Resistance who have been decimated with the loss of the republic and now only number a handful of ships and crew, relentlessly pursued by Kylo Ren's superior forces. I won't spoil anything but this movie throws many an unexpected twist and turn at you and the results weave a new and refreshing narrative which take the franchise into unexplored territory.<br /><br />Mark Hamill is great as Luke and we get to see the result that those missing 30 years have had on the man and is dealt with in a mature and realistic way. In fact, all the cast put in great performances, including the newcomers. We get some answers but not all, and are left dangling with some other questions which I'm sure we'll get explained in the final part. The cinematography, scenery, lighting and special effects are all superb, however I am knocking a star off for some slightly suspect CGI in the casino planet section.<br /><br />Highly recommended and great fun for all ages."
2293,9,the star wars sequel i expected,"This was not a bad movie. it was long, but that's to be expected with star wars movies. it was a joy to see the original characters together again for the first time in ever. idk why everyone thought it was boring, i was engulfed the entire 2 and a half hours. this movie was a true star wars sequel."
2294,1,Utter absolute garbage,Rian Johnson comes in and destroyed everything that was star wars. The plot is stupid and rian obviously does not know how the star wars universe works. Fuel has never been a issue now it's the core of this movie. Lazers in space follow a balistic trajectory even though it's space. The character of rose is just annoying. The whole canto bithe bit is point less and does nothing in the movie except shove in an animal abuse message. Rose who just that day lost her sister and is about to lose the group of people she calls her family and yer she absolutely needs to go on a animal rescue mission that in the end fails because they have to leave the planet and they don't take the animals with them. Even the casino security in the movie says to let the animals run for now because they know they can just easily capture them again. Del toro plays his most annoying character yet. Leia is all of a sudden a super powerful force user that can save herself from death by space yet admiral akbar is killed off in the most unrespectfull manner. If you waited thirty years to see what comes of luke then run away. Luke the guy who ever got darts vader to turn back to the light is all of a sudden some grumpy old fool of a man that has to die at the end of the movie in the most stupid way ever. All in all this movie is utter garbage and rian Johnson should never be allowed to make another movie. This is a disgrace and disgusting and the death of star wars.
2295,8,A worthy successor,"Summary: There are a lot of fanboys dissing this movie, but I loved it! It had amazing space battles, saber duels, etc. It had all the goods!"
2296,1,Worst Star Wars,"I have watched this movie couple times and this one breaks lore more than episode 1 with midichlorians. Movie looks awesome, but thats all it haves to give.<br /><br />Nothing makes sence in bigger level, Luke don't feel or act like Luke and this hyperdrive ram move breaks whole universe.<br /><br />They had this tech for thousands of years, using hyperdrive like this would be standard move and would have wound in first week. IF this is possible, then anything like star destroyer would be too expensive to make, if it could be taken down with single x-wing or just droiddrivingmissile with hyperdrive. One x-fighter could take down any death star or star killer base, no problem like this. So no need for looking for death star plans and whole rogue one is pointless.<br /><br />This is a thing that really should not be.<br /><br />Also when you start making trilogy, you should have plan for these movies and they dint have any and that is one thing how this whole trilogy failed and broke star wars.<br /><br />Thanks Rian and Kathleen."
2297,8,That movie fire,"That movie fire people just love to hate. If Star Wars was a western, as it was originally intended, that's what this movie would be. The Force Awakens backed itself into a corner and Rian Johnson saved the franchise."
2298,8,Enjoyable in a different way,"This certainly was a refreshing addition to the Star Wars saga. It is packed with action, humour, and wisdom, and explodes into life following the events of The Force Awakens. There are also some outstanding individual acting performances, most notably Adam Driver, Mark Hammill and Oscar Isaac."
2299,8,The First Subversive Force,"Star Wars. one of the biggest franchise on earth. some of you spent most of your life being a part of this fictious galaxy created by one man who's at some point of his life decided to think ""hey, the industry is filled with serious and artsy movies. i think this industry needs something enjoyable and easy to make that the industry can make a lot of money from for years in the future"" that man is George Lucas--though soon after this idea came out of his brain he decided to ruin it by creating the prequels but, I digress--this fictious galaxy that's being expanded by lots of brilliant and wondering mind all over the world. some of you might hate it so much, because I guess you're just so smart and intelligent that unless it's scientific experiments or naturalistic evolution that unfolds right in front of your very eyes then you won't find it interesting."
2300,1,Makes a Mockery of the Franchise,"What were they thinking? This movie goes out of its way to subvert concepts cherished by earlier films. The Jedi Order and long held knowledge is no longer important, training for vulnerable<br /><br />Novices irrelavent, and new powers and concepts that would have useful through eight episodes are introduced with no explanation."
2301,8,The Force Is With Us,"The cultural phenomenon that is ""Star Wars"" is transcendent. Watching one of the now 8 films is like being knee deep in presents at your grandparent's home for Christmas. The films warm us like a fireplace on a bitterly cold night. When the opening credits begin, our eyes get misty and we feel a sense of joy. For the next 2 plus hours we are in a galaxy far far away, and the cares of this world disappear for us. Thankfully, ""Episode 8: The Last Jedi"" does nothing to diminish the legacy of the series, or take us away from the aforementioned joy.<br /><br /> There were complaints about ""The Force Awakens"" which were justified. The film re-imagined the first Star Wars movie (which later became episode 4, A New Hope) and seemed to cement the reputation of J. J. Abrams as someone who can't tell an original story. I believe turning over the writing of Episode 8 to director Rian Johnson was a very good choice. I was worried that ""The Last Jedi"" would be a remake of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" given ""The Force Awakens,"" but fortunately there is only a nod in that direction. The story is definitely original in concept and surprises in a number of ways.<br /><br /> There are some who believe this new trilogy doesn't measure up to the original trilogy, in much the same way that some weren't happy with the prequel trilogy. I understand their feelings, but do not share them. ""The Last Jedi"" is Star Wars for a whole new generation, and you can embrace it or reject it as you wish. I choose to embrace the new trilogy, and I eagerly anticipate Episode 9."
2302,1,The Worst,"I'll take Jar Jar over the Last Jedi. It's absolutely absurd. Beautiful graphics and scenery. However, it does not make up for the insipid plot holes."
2303,8,"Better than TFA, but not the best.","I could write a lot of thinks, but I am not a critic. As cynical as I can be, I'll tell you that: The movie is really nice, Luke steals the show. The effects are excellent, the plot is ok, there is no parody, there are not bad jokes, it's more dark, more interesting and more superior than TFA. If you wave an open mind about the star wars franchise, then you will enjoy. If you are a star wars geek that expects to see the 2nd empire strikes back, then don't bother.<br /><br />And for all those who believe that Disney destroys the star wars franchise, i tell you this: Movies are for money, expecially that kind of films. Citizen Cane-like projects belong to the '40's. If you don't like it, then go to attend a film festival somewhere in Europe..."
2304,9,Oriental Puffy Cheeks,I disliked this!
2305,9,Are you ready for the unexpected?,"I liked this movie! First of all because it is different, fresh, and with new ideas! For me Episode 7 was very much predictable, and more or less a remake of ""A new Hope"". But The Last Jedi is completely unpredictable, at no point in the movie you could foresee the next step. That´s a quality! Most people didn´t understand the developement of Luke and say he is a weak old man and unrecognizable. Besides the fact that 30 years have passed and people change over time, Luke achieved a new perspective on the subject of the Jedi. He sees the ignorance and the failure, nobody owns the force, it is everywhere, everybody can use it for the good or for the bad. And to say, if the Jedi vanish the good vanish, is indeed arrogance. He is very strong in his attitude and I liked the fact that Johnson kept it this way. Of course people would have loved to see him fly away in the Falcon with Rey and Chewie to help the Resistance. But hey, he came to die on this island, he didn´t go in exile for fun...and by the way imagine seeing Yoda the first time again after Episode 1-3 in Empire Strikes Back. People would have said the same...what did happen to him oh my god he is attacking a droid with a stick begging for food. Luke is melking a seecow...of course thats exile on an island on the edge of the galaxy, so why not? Because Leia decided to keep on fighting it doesn´t necessarily mean that Luke has to help her. They are mature enough to make decisions by their own, Luke apologizes later because a little conflict still exists and it's a nice scene, but he keeps his own words and stays on the Island. The appearence of Yoda and his words that failure is the burden of all masters was a great moment and wise words indeed. From there on Luke made peace with his failure with Kylo and finds a perfect solution for his situation with his illusory appearence. Then most fans couldn´t accept the rising strength of Rey. too fast too powerful and I partly agree here, but its a new time, Snoke said the light is becoming stronger, so is the dark. They are both rising powers to mess with each other. And remembering that, could help accept the fast rising abilities of Rey. The fact that her parents are absolutely nobodys and that it is no longer a subject is indeed brave, and I liked it. What could be more boring than to have this topic again in the center of the story. It wants to say what I mentioned earlier, the force is everywhere, everybody can use it and it doesn´t necessarily has to do anything with your bloodline. Right so! The death of Snoke: For me, perfect, absolutely unexpected and from that moment on a new situation, fresh! And I can understand why Johnson didn´t make any efforts in telling his background story, his intentions and so on. The great villain has always the same intentions, and where he came from? From the dark side, what else do you need to know, who his parents were? The fact that the story of Rose and Finn end up in a desaster was nice too. Many fans say it was an unnecessary side story, ok, but they did it, I mean they tried, to help. It didn´t work out but thats life even in a galaxy far far away.. Anyway I hope to give you another perspective on the movie. Its not bad, just different, and yes the jokes are marginal sometimes and the scene with SuperLeia would have been much better as a ghost coming back to the body. The character of Hux is very poor too. Snoke explained why he has such a moron in such a powerful position at least. Thanks for reading!"
2306,3,The Last Jedi is definitely not The Empire Strikes Back,"Is it still a Star Wars story? I guess. I don't really know what to feel about it. Having just seen it a few hours ago...I think phrasing it in a nutshell is that: Star Wars is now just a franchise norm, unable to live up to the hype that it had all those years."
2307,10,This movie is actually great,"The Last Jedi pissess off all those fan theory lovers and puts the story straight.<br /><br />This movie is a great setup for letting go of the past and creating new, like it should."
2308,5,Why the First Order reigns after they lost the Starkiller base?,"I don't really know what to think of this movie. At the beginning the prologue says that the First Order reigns. What did I miss? The end of the last movie showed how the Resistance blew up Starkiller Base! Well...<br /><br />They learned to tell something moderately original, but the story doesn't quite work. It's confusing, contradictory and sometimes meaningless. They lowered several revolutions with respect to the previous one. There is action, but there is also an attempt to discover one's own identity and that of the enemy, however, I don't know how effective it was, really."
2309,10,"Not without its flaws, but still AMAZING!!!","Many people are simply saying that this film is sub-par, because it is different. The only reason that The Force Awakens has an 8 (currently) is because it is a remake of Star Wars (A New Hope). The Last Jedi is not entirely original, but is still more new than The Force Awakens. The film constantly draws you in, and is currently my third favourite Star Wars movie (1 - Empire Strikes Back & 2 - Star Wars (A New Hope))"
2310,10,My favorite Star Wars Movie!,"From beginning to end I LOVED this movie! Great special affects, great actors, great storyline! I'm VERY excited for Episode 9! From reading these reviews all I see is a bunch of crybabies! I guess when they were little they threw a temper tantrum because they didn't get what they wanted for Christmas! I'm definetly going to see this movie several times like the others! Nobody likes a crybaby! Get over it! I LOVED Star Wars The Last Jedi!"
2311,10,"Superbly constructed, emotionally charged, and visually stunning",I really don't get the fans that slam this movie. 
2312,1,Ha ha ha...,"A couple of nights before watching The Last Jedi I watched ""Everest"". It was quite a gripping movie and after reading around the subject for a while I came across the book Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer (who was one of the climbers in the 1996 disaster depicted in the movie). An enthralling tale of two teams of climbers who found themselves in the freezing and asphyxiating jaws of death at the roof of the world; I have to say it's one of the best books I've read and can highly recommend it."
2313,10,The Force is strong with this one,"Yet I am not sure how consistent my review will be, but please give me a shot."
2314,3,I'm glad to have discovered it wasnt just me ...,"I can honestly say that i have never left a movie theatre on any previous occasion and been angry. When I left the theatre one of our group asked me what I thought, i usually have something to say about what we've seen. I errupted, the anger was welling up inside. I can't really convey in words, the level of disapointment. "
2315,8,THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS,"Personally, I do not understand all that hatred. Many of us (including myself) do not understand Luke's ""cowardice"" at the beginning of the movie.Okey. But from there to demand its elimination from the canon ... Luke dies. At some point he was going to do it, or did they want him to die at the hands of the main enemy, like Obi Wan? Snoke is just a secondary character, or did they want to repeat the figure of the Emperor? Rey's parents are (in principle) scrap dealers, or did they want her to be Luke's daughter, or Obi Wan's granddaughter, or Yoda's niece, or what? Or did they prefer that Snoke had appeared and cut off Rey's hand, saying ""I am your father""? Would you prefer to constantly repeat the original trilogy? The characters are not going to be eternal, or would you prefer them to die in the explosion of a ship or while destroying the new base of the enemy, as in the Return of the Jedi? If you want a reboot, better go see the original trilogy. The best trilogy that there will ever be of Star Wars, but accept this new one that comes, and that tries to create a new story, not to repeat an already written one, however much you like it. My congratulations to Rian Johnson."
2316,8,Underrated and misunderstood in every sense.,"From the very beginning Director Johnson warns us: we get the usual opening, the usual Star Wars battle, and then it comes the first subtle but radical twist in the movie: Luke Skywalker's reaction when receiving his father's lightsaber. This film took a big risk and I think it got away with it: it tried to keep some things from the saga and broke up with a significant line of the saga's plot. But not by mistake, or misinterpretation; the film challenges viewers to take everything to a whole new level. And this is the main virtue of the movie. That's why it gets an 8."
2317,10,What Star Wars Means to Me - This movie got it right!,Star Wars has been in my life since I was a teenager. I have special memories of going to the Theatre with my best friend and watching them for the first time- we still go together even though we live farther apart.
2318,3,Three stars for CGI. The plot is nonsensical.,Rian Johnson defiled the Star Wars franchise.
2319,9,even better than last Lucas prequel's .,"There are some problems with the story, yes. -some unrelated connections etc.-<br /><br />There are also some problems with the editing of the movie, yes.-the continuity of the screens were lost few times-"
2320,1,There is no hope now !,"What a load of tosh... This is the worst .... Disney have utterly ruined it .... Star Wars, game over .... I hope the first order win and then we don't have to endure anymore ... it's crap ! As a child of IV my hope and dreams are destroyed... how could they do this !"
2321,9,Surprised by the divisiveness,"I don't normally bother reviewing movies. But I really enjoyed this instalment, am very much looking forward to the final instalment, and suspect that there are further twists in store that will change our perspective of this movie."
2322,9,Haters just have more time on their hands to write reviews ...,This must be the case if score doesn't match the written reviews. 
2323,10,I now hate Star Wars community,"After watching the latest piece of this amazing saga I can't help it but get angry at people! The film, in my own humble opinion, is great - it had amazing scenes, acting was good (except Hux), pacing was good, the whole feeling watching this movie was great. And now as I read the reviews I see hate everywhere. Diehard Star Wars fans are just mindless idiots who can't be satisfied no matter what. First they were angry at ""The Force awakens"" because it was too similar to ""A New Hope"". Now they hate ""The Last Jedi"" because its too new and different. I can't understand you people, WHAT DO YOU WANT??? ""The Last Jedi"" is something fresh and expands the powers and uses of the Force in a never seen before way. Nowhere in the saga is there a limitation to what someone is capable of doing with the Force, nowhere! I love the fresh taste this movie has and I hope next movies get the same innovative and different vibe. We can't just have ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" in every Star Wars movie we get. Sorry fanboys!"
2324,1,Starwars died with the release of this movie,WARNING SPOILERS!!!!
2325,10,Absolutely fantastic.,A little background on me: I never cared about Star Wars until this latest trilogy came out. So I guess there's that.
2326,1,Worst Star Wars movie yet,"The Last Jedi is a bad movie across the board. Acting? Awful. Script? Terrible? Storyline? What storyline? You'd think with how expensive it was, the special effects would at least be impressive, but even they are naff. "
2327,8,Great film great relaunch,I don't understand the constant negativity. A lot of reviewers justangry they didn't get what they conjured for 2 years. I laugh that this movie is called anything but Star Wars. Take off your assumption hat and go see it again
2328,10,Are you not entertained?,"All you 30- 40 year old nerds sitting in your parents basement need to chill out. The movie is PG-13 and meant for kids, like they always have been... It is a fantastic movie. If you truly hate this movie I feel sorry for you, and your mom who has a really tough job kicking you out of the house... GET A JOB ALREADY!!!"
2329,9,Falls short - disappointed.,"Wow lets totally forget about all the established Star Wars universe rules. The movie is full of plot holes, is sloppy, slow, and tiresome film making. They choose to conveniently forget about tractor beams, have force ghosts able to influence the physical realm, portray Luke as a bitter ""old man"", ruin Rey, make her a pointless passive protagonist, relegate Chewy to basically function as a glorified Uber driver for Rey, introduce a character like Rose that has less charisma than my big toe. Also the Harry Potter-esque Canto Bight scene with CGI small aliens and human faced dog horses that serve no purpose but to try prove a point about animal cruelty was just unnecessary. Spend time developing the Star Wars saga and do justice to the Skywalker story instead. Also the not so funny jokes that ruin the flow. Overall pretty darn disappointed."
2330,2,Goodbye Star Wars,"I just don't care about Star Wars anymore. Everything interesting is gone or watered down. Interesting character duo Rey and Fin: replaced with watered down and pointless duo Fin and Rose. Mysterious and exciting character back stories like Rey's origin: nope. Back stories just dropped. Luke Skywalker as the most powerful Jedi ever to live: nah, he gave up the force and has been sitting in a hole for the last twenty or thirty years. Lightsaber that has so much history that it causes Rey to have a force vision: we'll literally just throw that away and discard it."
2331,9,Judge For Yourself - Go See The Film!,"First off, great film, a lot of fun, a lot of action, a lot of stuff to leave you hanging, and a lot of stuff to keep you wondering. "
2332,1,Rian Johnson should feel ashamed,DO NOT READ MY REVIEW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE SPOILERS
2333,10,A Masterpiece!,The best Star Wars film of the saga... Only fools hate this...
2334,10,Star Wars Fans Should be Ashamed of Themselves - Not this Film.,"Don't believe the hate, this is a good film. The problem lies in the ""Star Wars fan"" who has for so long taken ownership of the franchise to the point where they, themselves, have turned into their own echo chambers of misconceptions and poor film analysis. It's never been disgusting than it is now, as evidenced by fake down-voting campaigns on social media and the sheer level of boneheaded distaste in ever single user review I've seen on this site. Have yet to speak to a single soul in person that didn't like the film, the film boasts an ""A"" CinemaScore among the average audience member that saw it (because in real life you only get one vote, you wack jobs), and it has lit the internet on fire and made Star Wars, for better or worse, more relevant than ever. If you really think that a film which makes its bed in not taking the easy way out of any creative decision is just ""too corporate"" then you've clearly lost all perspective as a movie-goer, frankly. Count this as one film and series where the critics have way more insight here than the ""fans"". Yeah, I put ""fans"" in quotations like that purposely, you're not fans, you're idiot children."
2335,8,Great Addition,"This movie was original, entertaining, and far more valuable than 50% of the fanbase will admit."
2336,4,"Funny creatures, lots of smashy explosions and some terrible acting.","Finally got around to watching this and blimey, it just keeps going doesn't it. Funny creatures, lots of smashy explosions and some terrible acting. About what I expected really... utter drivel. It really is time to call it a day. I know some people love this stuff and perhaps drivel is a bit harsh. There's a couple of decent lines, the CG is excellent and not all the acting is awful, but the few characters that aren't wooden and predicable are the exception. I really wish they'd stop flogging this long worn out narrative, but it seems that's not on the cards. I'm gonna stop putting myself through it though."
2337,10,"Brilliantly directed, superb addition to the trilogy, embrace 2017!",Where do I start.
2338,1,Huh,This film clearly doesn't have a 7 rating Disney are probably using bots or something to make it look like people actually liked this movie
2339,10,Love it,"For fabs of ficional, great! Love it, cant wait for next one"
2340,10,You Have to be More Open to this Movie!!! Not Everything Can Go Exactly How You Want It To.,"NO SPOILERS<br /><br />I can understand why a lot of people claim they ""hate"" this movie, and that it is the worst they have ever seen. But I think this movie is great. It challenges previous notions of the previous Star Wars installments and asks uncomfortable questions of some of the most important characters in the series. Yes, I agree. Some things made me very sad. I read reviews in which the writer says they are ""conflicted""; I think that's exactly how you should come out of the theater. Asking questions that the previous Star Wars installments avoided. That's all I have to say. If you're willing to enter the theater with an open mind, go watch this new movie."
2341,10,"Pathetic, soulless, vapid, shallow...I'm talking about the reviewers.","This isn't a review other than to say the The Last Jedi wasn't the strongest entry in the SW series, but it was far from the worst. "
2342,2,What a Atrocity!!,"I've been a Star Wars fan my entire life and I'm 37, and I had such great hopes when I heard Disney was gonna continue the Skywalker saga. Instead all I've got from this movie and the last is a big broken heart! They have trashed the whole thing by making these last two movies!! Just goes to show that all Disney cares about is the almighty dollar! If they truly cared about the franchise they would have kept Lucus on as consultant and went with his ideas for the continuation of the saga! Now that I've said my piece on to my review:<br /><br />The Last Jedi was cinamatically a good movie. Lots of bright shiny lights and one liners for humor. Otherwise, Luke Skywalker milking a beast for blue milk!!! Really, was that necessary?? Just about lost my dinner to that scene. Then Leia flying through space using force powers she's never showed any signs of!! Give me a break! And then you go and kill Snoke without even an idea of who the heck he was or where he came from and why his force power is so strong. THENNNN, to cap it all off,... you go and kill off Luke Skywalker!!! That's the last straw!!! Even if that was ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, it shouldn't have happened until the last film, if at all! If I knew then, what I know now, I would've been very satisfied with Episode 6 being the last Star Wars movie in the Skywalker saga."
2343,8,Pretty good and way better than what most people say,I loved it. Only problems were rose and how the bombs didn't make sense but overall a fantastic movie
2344,1,Desacaralizing a myth,It is becoming worse with each episode. When are they going to stop? It is an insult to the original series and its dedicated fans.
2345,10,Eight,"Continues the saga of the greatest series of all. Perfect in every aspect....story,acting and cinematography. My only complaint is that we have to wait for another two years or so for episode nine. RIP Princess, your final role was superb!!!"
2346,9,A Solid 8th Installment,"****SPOILER WARNING****<br /><br />To start off, let me just say that I really loved this movie, more than The Force Awakens personally. It didn't seem like a two and a half hour movie at all to me, and I was thoroughly entertained the entire time."
2347,10,Go in with an open mind and you'll enjoy the movie,"Been a Star Wars fans from day one in 1977. Watched the tv shows and movies, played the games, read the expanded universe books and comics, even did the Star Wars Celebrations."
2348,3,"A movie made by porgs, for porgs",An honest review from a NON Star Wars fan
2349,9,WOW - This just keeps on giving!,"Okay so we all love this genre ( well most of us anyway) - To keep it short and to the point this is probably the best Star Wars movie in the Disney Genre to date and it is not as much of a let down as ""The Force Awakens"" which was basically a copy of ""A New Hope""."
2350,1,"Overrated, silly pile of smug Rian Putrecence","Supposedly there exist somewhere in the world people who actually think the Last Jedi is a great movie. I overheard one on the bus once, but other than that the Last Jedi defenders seemed restricted to Internet reviews and comment sections. Maybe they're afraid to make their closet Rian Johnson love public. Maybe they don't care about the other Star Wars movies. (The guy on the bus didn't). Who knows. The truth of the matter is, the Last Jedi is not even a remotely good movie by any standard I can think of, and all the critical praise it garnered is pretty baffling.<br /><br />A few of the many reasons this is true:"
2351,9,"Visually stunning, philosophically satisfying",Don't be dissuaded by all the negative reviews about this film; just go and see it yourself before making up your mind. The vast amount of negativity on IMDb has started to seem like a deliberate smear campaign either against Disney or the director; but none of it seems to make much sense.
2352,10,Why The Last Jedi Is the best Star Wars ever,"I had massive hopes going into this movie. I could quote Star Wars before I could run. For me, Star Wars was how I related to my dad, how we communicated. Now, as a film student, Star Wars has become a point of contention. My classmates don't have time for this kind of popularist enternatiment, despite my attempts to change them."
2353,9,A review of the negative reviews,"The Last Jedi buids on all that made TFA great and does away with the bits of it that weren't so great. It manages to upset many expectations in a good way, and pays homage to Empire and ROTJ."
2354,1,Just a terrible movie,"There are too many reasons this movie is terrible, but the bottom lines are always 1.) plot and 2.) suspension of disbelief. The plot was terrible.... the looonnnnggggg pointless slow speed pursuit was awful.... the premise of characters decisions.... the side trip (chase still going) to get someone with codes on nearby planet....doesn't pan out.... how does Rey get back to them after dispatching Snoke? The plot is awful, and super distracting, making it impossible to suspend disbelief, which is critical in a sci-fi movie. There is no redeeming quality to this movie. I feel like they've ruined the franchise. Why did they?"
2355,10,Masterpiece that will be respected with time,"I am ashamed of the Star Wars fandom, but am not surprised. They are some of the most butt hurt fans in the world that are never pleased. They think they own the original trilogy and had a part in making it, but they forget how revolutionary it was at the time. Movies weren't made like that, it was new, it was bold. Empire had an entirely different feel than Star Wars, and Jedi had an entirely different feel than Empire. Star Wars is allowed to be bigger than one feeling. It is ok to laugh in a SW movie, it's ok to cry, it is ok for characters to change after 30 years of development. "
2356,1,Horrible,"Please refund my 3 life hours wasted on movie, by the end I was hoping they would destroy each other so we can finally put this series out of it's misery (and the viewers), this movie is a cash grab."
2357,9,As funny as other 'Star Wars movies' .....,"It's funny people complaining about the jokes in the movie when every single 'Star wars' story had jokes on them. <br /><br />Is not the perfect ""Star Wars' movie. They could do a couple things differently but overall I had a freaking great time at the movies."
2358,10,Everybody still mad about The Phantom Menace?,"I gave it a 6 because I like to rate movies based on the entire spectrum of the film industry...and there are some truly TERRIBLE movies out there. That said, in my book, a 6 rating is basically what I would consider as ""watchable."" "
2359,10,"You'l hate it, then you'll love it!",This is my first movie review so go easy...
2360,1,Why Disney?,What did we all do to deserve this piece of garbage? That's all i gotta say......this movie is garbage & pollutes the soul & legacy of the star wars universe.
2361,9,I get the anger but its an enjoyable movie,"Personally, I enjoyed TLJ. I thought it was the necessary change Star Wars needed to move the franchise along in a different direction. I've read a lot of negative reviews and get some of the arguments, but everyone needs to calm down with this ""disney killed star wars"" and ""worst SW ever"". "
2362,1,Just so bad,"I cant believe this was created. Its just really sad. I do not blame the actors or actresses at all, this was all on the writers. If you dont wanna feel a sinking feeling DO NOT WATCH THIS! This is not star wars"
2363,9,"Worth a second viewing, seriously.","My initial reaction to my first watch of Johnson's entry into the Star Wars series, shall we say? Was not good. <br /><br />Although watching a second time the message becomes clearer, it's like my eyes have been opened. Last Jedi is a story about finding place in the Universe, and the journey of finding yourself along the way, that answers to these questions are not easy. <br /><br />And how others actions inspire the next generation to come without being forgotten. <br /><br />It's message and Reys Destiny are very much the same. If Luke had returned to the Resistance/Rebellion to fight again that would have been predictable, Luke got himself out of the way from the galaxy, because he thought it was the best thing to do. <br /><br />But his actions actually inspire others to do better. <br /><br />It's a different kind of Star Wars film that we've never seen before, it's very cool and very new. <br /><br />But with Abrams returning for the third episode in the trilogy, it's a question now of what he'll do. Will he keep Rian's narrative going on throughout, or will he abandon it altogether? <br /><br />Very interesting."
2364,10,excellent,Very ery very very very good. i loved the movie. Awesome!!
2365,8,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one","As the movie follows the adventures of Rey, Poe, Finn, and yes Kylo Ren. We learn that the force hasn't been balanced and the dark side is taking over with the most powerful being in the galaxy being Snoke. The emotions that the movie awakens in the viewer are sometimes upsetting but indeed isn't that one of the strongest emotions, and even anger? As the light side of the Jedi is question, kylo brings the sith into a new perspective, do we really need to define the force as light or dark, isn't it more of a spectrum? Humorism as it's present in this review it's also in the movie, is well timed and respects the overall mood of the movie. The movie is courageous to take the story to somewhere unexpected but end up short because it doesn't take the leap that was really necessary to make the movie a statement of change by the director Ryan Johnson. He didn't let go, to quote Kylo whilst talking to Rey, which I think should have taken the dark path and left us completely in shock; however, that doesn't happen and Rey's character remains emotionally poor, only the relationship with the evil Ren and the old Luke gave her some light as a main character. Every refence is necessary as Yoda tells Luke I say to the fans, always focused on what we dream and want for ourselves, and not on what we actually have. In this case a great new fantasy movie that happens to be a Star Wars movie no one expected to see."
2366,1,"Star Wars is now a superhero movie - nothing more. Marvel, Capcom, Star Wars.","What sells? Action, explosions, slapstick comedy, over the top effects - super hero movies. Complex character development, consistent story lines, lack of loop holes, etc are no longer to be expected from the Star Wars Franchise.<br /><br />The most important aspect of ANY good movie is to cause emotion within the audience. Make you cry, make you laugh, make you feel anxiety, make you feel adrenaline and excitement, make you afraid. "
2367,10,"Best Star Wars, don't listen to negative reviews","It is absolutly fantastic from every aspect. Production design is spotless, acting is top notch (specially Del Toro), action is one of the best in Star Wars, story is well structured and has interesting turns which keep you glued to the screen. Fantastic"
2368,2,The Casting More Than Anything Damages This,Whoever was in charge of casting this should be ashamed. Not one single Star Wars fan in this. Not one single person is self-aware of their limitations. If they were they would not show up and 1- not embarrass themselves and 2- not destroy Star Wars like this.
2369,10,thrilling movie,"For me "" The Last Jedi "" was thrilling , congratulations to Rian Johnson and to his team , i'm from the generation of the original trilogy , and i can say that "" The Last Jedi "" is the best movie after "" The Empire Strikes Back "" i can't understand the hate from a lot of fans of the original trilogy , life is changing and nothing stays stable so even Star Wars can't stay stable , for my opinion people must not hear the negative reviews from the fans , the movie is amazing ...<br /><br />with all the respect for the haters :<br /><br />the dark side clouds your mind <br /><br />Merry Christmas <br /><br />and may the force be with us always <br /><br />Best regards <br /><br />From Greece <br /><br />George Argyris"
2370,10,Best film in the Star Wars franchise...,I have seen this film thrice in the cinemas since it came out. I absolutely adore this film excfept from one part. Rose. She completely ruins Finn's sacrifice and could've potentially ruined Episode 9's storyline.
2371,9,Finally some depth,"There has been some controversy around how Luke Skywalker's last days was portrayed in the film. <br /><br />I saw the original Star Wars on opening day. It remains one of the most profound experiences of my life. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after. I have devoured every movie since and am still a big fan. <br /><br />With that background I have to say that I can relate to Luke as portrayed in the movie. I'm about the same age. While we start out life as heroes in our own story, failures accumulate. If we focus on those, particularly failing those we love it can eat our will to act. A person may be great at many things, as Luke is, but not able to handle failure well. Anyway I appreciated the brave path the writers and Disney took. Luke did find a way past his despair in the end and was very clever about how he expended his power. <br /><br />The Star Wars universe is full of potential and frankly while I enjoyed the last few pictures immensely they are starting to feel a bit episodic, hitting the same themes over again with the same one dimensional characters. <br /><br />I have read many of the Star Wars books and they contain a richness that has not quite made it to the screen. For instance they also reveal the true capabilities of a Jedi/Sith. Some of those capabilities were finally shown in this film with Snoke's manipulation of Rey's visions and Kylo Ren's conflict about his path also making the connection between her and Kylo Ren possible. <br /><br />Star Wars needs a reboot, I hope this film is the start."
2372,2,Very very dissapointing,"I went into this movie after reading glowing reviews from critics, calling this the 'best Star Wars movie since Empire'. The Force Awakens was a decent outing, but just teased us with the Luke Skywalker appearing in the very last scene of the movie. The credits rolled before he even spoke a word. This film picks up from this point exactly."
2373,10,One of the Best in the Saga,"The Last Jedi is the marmite of the saga you either love it or hate it, it subverts cliche tropes and in it's deconstruction it alienates a large part of it's fans but make no mistake this film is a masterclass of melodrama giving us a look into what it means to fail and idealizing your heroes to a fault while simultaneously critiquing Modern blockbusters and the nature of sequels, The Last Jedi Defies what a blockbuster needs to be by giving us thought provoking drama that resonates with us on a human level oppose to being a wish fulfillment fantasy that's catered to the masses, The Last Jedi Doesn't care about being the popular Blockbuster, in fact it opposes it and does it's own thing and that's where the beauty lies."
2374,1,"Sorry, but not sorry.","So, here were go. Disney just had to go and do it. Take something that was already written, and fail at creating their own NEW Star Wars Universe. "
2375,9,The Force is strong in this movie,"When The Times pronounced The Last Jedi ""The best in the whole franchise"" I was a bit taken aback. Its definitely not that good but Its a stunning movie which kept me and my wife enthralled all the way through. Its VERY emotional and it keeps building on that feeling. I was not disappointed. There are some classic shots that are going to go down as truly great moments in cinema."
2376,10,One of the Best of the saga,"Great themes and execution overall. Dont believe the manchild fanboys who are hurting because Luke died, the movie is great."
2377,9,Thoroughly enjoyed it,"It had it all, great humor, CG, tons of violence."
2378,1,What a complete mess.,"From the little details to the plot as a whole this movie was bad. <br /><br />My biggest complaints involve Luke, Snoke, and the Finn side-plot. The first we see of Luke he takes the lightsaber from Rey (the anticipation of which was the only thing that made me come back to watch the next Star Wars movie) and throw it over his shoulder. This is such a huge turn away from the character we knew and an insult to the fans who eagerly anticipated the conclusion of that cliffhanger. We later see that Luke attempted to murder his nephew as a child. Not a believable thing for the character of Luke to do.. He is the guy who wouldn't kill his father even when Obi-Wan and Yoda wanted him too! <br /><br />Next is Snoke. This character made no sense in The Force Awakens, but I was willing to hear an explanation of him in this film. There was none. He died in a pretty cool scene, but now we are left with an inexplicable overpowered Emperor Palpatine knockoff who doesn't fit into the existing Star Wars universe at all. <br /><br />Finn was an unnecessary character in The Force Awakens who was clearly just comic relief and to diversify the cast. In this movie it was worse. The side quest his character and Rose (random frumpy chick) go on was utterly pointless and not even entertaining. It also included the most explicit political commentary in Star Wars to date, which is ridiculous and does not bode well for the franchise. (Yes, Star Wars has always had political themes and politics has been involved in the plot, but it has been very abstract and fictitious in a simple good versus evil way.) And when Finn was about to sacrifice himself and we were all cheering because we thought that was the end of his character, he is suddenly stoped from sacrificing himself by someone else's (potential) self-sacrifice. That is such nonsense. <br /><br />Now for the less important criticisms.. <br /><br />The movie begins with a fairly comical scene involving Poe, which went too far and just became awkward in my opinion. Later in the scene bombs fell out of a ship in outer space.. I know it is sci-fi, but come on, we all know there is no gravity in space. That is one of the defining characteristics. <br /><br />The ""code cracker"" character was ridiculous. The stutter was so idiotic and he just happened to be taking a nap in their prison cell, what? <br /><br />The anti-climactic end of admiral Ackbar was a disgrace. Not to mention the silly admiral who replaced him and caused the whole pointless Finn side quest. <br /><br />The way Leia saved herself from death in outer space was silly, and pointless because the actual actress is no longer alive to act in Episode 9. "
2379,10,"Chill, People...","First people complained that Episode VII was too much like the original trilogy, and now everyone seems to want to complain that this one isn't enough like the originals. I have been a life long Star Wars fan, read all the books, watched every animated epsiode. and I'm even a memorabilia collector. If you can't allow them to take the series in new directions, you've forgotten the joy of losing yourself in Star Wars. I never saw many of the character changes that Episode VIII introduces, but I loved every minute of it. People like to forget that when the original trilogy was released, it had incredible flaws (Ewoks were a transparent marketing ploy. So are Porgs. Get over it). But since most of us that are writing reviews here were kids at the time we first entered the Star Wars universe, we just let ourselves get lost in the wonder of it. Now that we're grown up, you want to nitpick something that has all the essentials of a Star Wars film-the struggle between the light and dark side, archetypal story imagery, and a simpler yet beautiful look at the universe. Let yourselves get past the negativity for a minute and appreciate Episode VIII for what it is: a new direction that pays homage to everything you loved about the movies when you saw them as kid, yet isn't afraid to try to push the story into new and creative wonder. I loved it."
2380,1,Star Wars Episode VIII - The last straw,"Ok, I promised myself I will stop going to the movies for the whole year of 2018, this was the last straw, Hollywood churned a lot of garbage lately and I'm sick and tired!"
2381,10,The movie that brought me back to Star Wars,"I was once a big fan of Star Wars and grew up even watching the Ewoks movies. The Phantom Menace came out and I wasn't as disappointed as most people because as much as the movie had its major issues, the lightsaber duel we got was a first of its kind on film and it made it worth paying for. Episode II was unwatchable and because of how terrible it was, took me time to finally watch Episode III. I gave up on Star Wars because of the Prequels, or maybe I just grew out of it."
2382,9,Amazing and i am a star wars fan,+ Soundtrack alone is one of the best ( Thank you john williams)<br /><br />+ Special effects are amazing the best i have ever seen<br /><br />+ The film sets so beatuyfull and stunning<br /><br />+ Rey(Daisy Ridley) here acting is great i feel the pain in her heart <br /><br />+ The figures and never seen aliens <br /><br />+ The star wars feeling<br /><br />+ The humor is fresh
2383,8,Ignore all ones and tens. Always.,"Not many of the movies ever created deserves a one star (and the same goes for tens), and seeing all the slaughter this one gets is ridiculous. Being a life long fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, I saw episode 4 as an eight year old in the beginning of the eighties and it was the best movie experience I ever had. Then came the prequels when I was an adult. They where horrible for most of us who had grown up with the original three, but I have still seen them a few times. When the new ones came I had little expectation. But I think they have been highly entertaining. Of course they can never be as good as the original three, but that is more about the age/time I saw them. The adventures of a young man on a desolate planet going from farmer boy to Jedi master was amazing. This one was fun, and entertaining. Plot holes okay, but this series is riddled with those."
2384,1,Rubbish pacing mangles an average sci-fi flic,"Take the original Empire Strikes Back, then strip away pacing, character growth, sense of good vs evil, proper, flowing story development and, most important of all, originality, and we're left with what is effectively a sequence of Star-Wars cliches without a reason to give a damn about any of it. There just wasn't any sense of menace at all in this, Kylo Ren being reduced to more of a side character with moments of telepathy. All this leaves an emotionless hole for 2 and a half hours full of countdowns to being obliterated by yet another powerful weapon while the good guys hastily cobble a plan together to escape again (usually involving one small ship evading all the bad guys. You've seen it before)."
2385,10,Wonderful and Refreshing,I've seen it twice now. And I love it.
2386,2,Bring Back Jar Jar,I never thought a day would come when an ugly Mary Sue with grandma hair and a chubby Asiatic would make Jar Jar desirable.
2387,10,My favourite Star Wars film,"Before this film came out, I was making fun of what it could've been. ""I bet Rey is Palpatine's daughter"". Or ""we're probably gonna learn the origins of that spider face guy"". But I was blown away that this was finally a film that was going to give this trilogy the legs it needed to stand on its own. Shame it wasn't followed through, as the last film relied heavily on fan service."
2388,8,Good Movie,Star Wars The Last Jedi is not the worst movie but not the best movie. Most of the surprises in the movie are expected except for some. Kylo Ren comes with a double surprise in the movie. The movie had great film but didn't seem realistisc. To me the movie was just really cheesy.
2389,9,I feel like I'm surrounded by trolls...,"Okay, I don't normally write reviews on IMDb, but after reading through numerous ones on here I can't help but scratch my head and wonder if the other reviewers and I saw the same movie."
2390,1,Where is Disney going with this???,"I was left disappointed! I'm actually sad with how Disney is turning such a great movie series into a total crap hole. They are too focused on ""progressiveness"" and ""diversity"" rather than sticking to a good storyline."
2391,8,"Good film, don't understand all the hate.","This is a good film, almost didn't watch it because of all the terrible reviews. Don't understand all the hate for this film, I really enjoyed it! The only thing I disliked was the terrible new little annoying animal that they decided to add in. Other than that, was good film. Go watch it, see for yourselves."
2392,2,Simply boring,"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and I ripped on the last one for being too safe (very similar narrative to A New Hope). But this film is just insulting in the direction it takes it.<br /><br />For one: STOP TRYING TO MAKE STAR WARS FUNNY/GOOFY. This isn't Marvel, it doesn't work.<br /><br />2) You know all the deep history of the Jedi and the council and the sacred beliefs? Yeah we're just gonna let all that die now and burn it all to ground (literally)<br /><br />Underused characters and unexplained characters. The Finn, Rose romance ? Trash. Captain Phasma? Trash. Kylo Ren ? Hyped as powerful descendant of the sky Walker bloodline, consistently beaten down by a scavenger who found a lightsaber and only real practice fighting is presumably from swinging a metal pole around fighting other scavengers from the last film.<br /><br />Boring, should never have tried for another trilogy with this sort of thin, half assed ideas"
2393,9,Excellent film,Not quite sure why there's so much negativity going around. The film was excellent and a lot of people I've spoken to agree.
2394,9,Good symbolism!,"I like the symbolism in this movie. However, some things are a bit random. Why are the First Order rulers so powerful with the Force, whereas the Rebellion heros feel much less powerful. For example, Snokes (Supreme Leader), is extremely powerful, Rey stands no chance with him. Why he is so powerful is not really explained, which makes the power balance a little unclear."
2395,8,Faithful to the series and answered many questions.,"Looks like the film succeeded and satisfying, but a number of fans decided to get whiny over nothing. This was superior to The Force Awakens, as it was more coherent and answered important questions about the series and the characters. It was faithful to the series and it's themes, and with lots of surprises. "
2396,1,Believe the Bad Reviews!,Total trash...not only did I never see it again but non of my kids asked to see it again.
2397,9,Not much wrong with the last Jedi,"Not a frequent writer of reviews, only on a few occasions when something is really, truly bad. In this case TLJ is far from bad, but I believe the many 1-star reviews are."
2398,1,Terrible,I used to Love this movie but watching it again I realize it's terrible it's weird boring lame not as good as the force awakens terrible movie not good at all.
2399,10,"No one hates Star Wars more, than Star Wars fans","I am not here, to change your perspective. If you hate The Last Jedi, so be it. But I felt, that in the sea of these negative reviews, where you can only validate your hate about the film, and be surprised about the high ratings, I would maybe provide the opposite side."
2400,9,Probably one of the best Star Wars movies,Sorry for the haters... :) but in my opinion this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever! 
2401,9,"Fantastic! Disregard the entitled reviews of the so called ""fan boys"".","This installment is fantastic. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, having seen every single episode in the theater when they each launched, and having read numerous novels from the Star Wars canon, comic books, watched TV shows, etc... I can honestly say that I'm dismayed at how many people (because I won't call them fans any more) have given bad reviews of this movie. <br /><br />After seeing it for a 2nd time in two days, I have to say that The Last Jedi tells a great story. Their is of course the amazing visuals, the music, the compelling characters, and a story line that isn't exactly what you'd expect but it is a great story none the less. I won't say anything more about the film other than it is definitely worth seeing. Go. Have fun. Enjoy it. It's worth it."
2402,4,"Watch it for the visuals, not the story","Likes: The hermit hideout of Luke, the porgs (mix between penguins and owls) and Vulptexs (crystal foxes?)"
2403,8,What makes Star Wars unlike any other Movie?,"Star Wars has become bigger than media. It's bigger than just a movie. When a Star Wars movie comes out it's an event not just another day at the theater. Only Harry Potter compares on a similar level (marvel and DC are getting there), but even that doesn't really compare. Star Wars is so ingrained in our culture, so beloved by so many people, I find it's almost become it's own worst enemy. <br /><br />The expectations for these films are almost unattainable and I feel bad for anyone who tries to handle one of these movies. The backlash can carry a painful sting I'm sure. I have loved Star Wars since I was a little kid. Watching A New Hope so much my VHS tape broke twice and we had to buy new ones. These new films will never compare to those originals. How can it? I feel people love those movies so much it makes it too difficult to enjoy the new ones sometimes. But there is still magic in these movies. Hope. Good vs Evil. Doing the right thing. Friendship. It's all still there and in my opinion it is worthy to follow those films I have loved since I was little. And here is why I say that."
2404,1,"I don't hate it, it was just boring","After heaving read so many negative reviews, I managed to hate the movie without seeing it. So I told myself: Let me watch it and give the hate some basis."
2405,10,Toxic Star Wars Fans are Babies,"This film is solid. Visually stunning in every frame. This also drives home the point the Prequels were trying to make, that the Jedi were actually not that great. Mark Hamill's best acting. The Rise of Skywalker's reveal makes everything Rey's character does that much more interesting. Sure it's not a perfect film but man these people are dramatic with their ""worst film ever made"" like the twilight movies don't exist."
2406,9,Interesting and surprising scenario,"Movie is full with action, interesting battles (final is the best), filosofical, romantic moments, mixed emotions within interesting scenario."
2407,9,It's star wars!!,"I totally disagree with what most people are saying! This is one of the most misjudged movies I've seen on here. The last jedi shows a part of star wars we've never seen before and introduced us to a hole new concept of star wars. The only bad part about this movie is that Carrie Fishers character Princess Leia is still in the movie until the very end, and JJ Abrams will have to find a way to write her out because of her unfortunate passing or use a computer generated version which we all know probably won't happen. The script is well written in my opinion. It brings back some old star wars themes that make us feel like we're watching a star wars movie made by Lucas. It also shows a new side of the star wars franchise that we've never seen before like characters physically coneceting threw the force which isn't a bad thing. Director Rian Johnson wanted to add his own little flare to the franchise and did so beautifully. If you like star wars you'll love the last jedi and I highly recommend it."
2408,1,A Real Review of Star Wars The Last Jedi,"After months from the release of this movie , Disney is still paying reviewers to score this movie over 7 or 8 stars. This movie was not only the worst Star Wars movie ever made, it was one of the worst movies in the last 5 to 8 years ever shown on a movie screen. The plot made no sense, the characters made no sense and even the ending of this terrible movie made no sense. After destroying a iconic character like Luke Skywalker in this crap fest movie , I'm done watching anymore Star Wars Universe movies by Disney. And yes the character of Rey is a joke and a over powered Mary Sue character that can never be beaten and never had form of training."
2409,9,Act 2 does its duty,"It's finally here-- The Last Jedi-- and after two years of waiting, it looks like we got a more than fulfilling result. The film picks up where The Force Awakens ended with Rey, Chewie and R2D2 on Achh-To with Luke and the rest of the Rebels trying to escape from the First Order. It echoes The Empire Strikes Back in some ways, one of them being that it's essentially a story about survival and defence, not attack. The stakes are set high and right from the first scene, we are plunged into action.<br /><br />The Dark Side, lead by Supreme Leader Snoke is shown getting stronger with each passing second and the Resistance is seen struggling to keep up their fight but hope is kept alive even in the toughest of times. Some early losses in the film set a somber tone and weaken the Resistance fairly, allowing the enemy to take advantage. But the Dark Side isn't perfectly focused either. With an inefficient General and a rather conflicted warrior at the face of it, their decisions don't always seem to be the best (as usual) but due to the sheer power they possess in this film in terms of artillery and manpower, the fight between the two sides makes for an exciting watch. <br /><br />Talking about conflict, we see it rising in the minds of almost all of the key characters in the film. The many different layers to everyone's psyche are explored and that's always something to love. Kylo, shown previously being torn between the Light and the Dark and having to carry the burden of being his own father's killer is more disturbed than ever and even Rey, tired of not knowing what her lineage is faces some moments of weakness. To add to this, the two are shown to be ""connected"" by the Force (the reason behind which is later explained) and this just increases the complications. In one rather cathartic scene, we see the possibility of redemption in Kylo but that is short lived and despite an inexplicable bond set up between the two characters, they resume their positions on opposite sides of the battlefield soon afterwards. Luke himself is an old and grumpy man with no interest in what is happening in the galaxy and it takes a fair amount of coaxing and our ever-so-cheeky R2D2, pulling a ""cheap trick"" in a really sweet throwback moment (you'll see), to get him to agree to train Rey. In a later scene, we see another character from the past, a Jedi Master whose name begins with the second last letter of the alphabet, make a small appearance and it warms our hearts to know that everyone and everything really is connected and those ties remain even after the physical selves cease to exist. However there remains a lot of tension in Luke's mind and a whole lot of back-and-forth about whether or not he should involve himself, even if indirectly, in the war again, takes place there. Haunted by what he believes is his failure as a master and his creation, Kylo Ren, he is never fully committed to what he is doing. We are told how Kylo Ren came to be and why he turned to the Dark. But in the end, Luke, very grandly and in a very unique way, regains his place as a Jedi hero.<br /><br />One of the dialogues in the film where he tells Rey that things are not going to go as planned runs true through every turn of this movie. Learning from The Force Awakens, this plot was created starkly different. Nothing seems to work out and nothing comes easy. The film has three parallel stories-- one with Luke and Rey, one with Finn and Rose Tico and the other with Poe and Leia trying to protect their army and the plans of all of these people fail when they needed to work the most. Even though it rendered the subplots practically useless and is one of the biggest reasons behind the big divide between the fans and the critics about how the film was (the fans disliking the movie, for a change), it's a take that I liked as it made the story seem more real because not everything goes according to plan in life. Rose is a new addition to the cast and is similar to Finn's character in that she too is an underdog who rises to glory through her will. Some other characters should have been given meatier roles like Maz Kanata and Captain Phasma, whose potentials weren't fully tapped. Hopefully the former shows up more strongly in Episode IX. <br /><br />One of the biggest questions from the previous installment was about Rey's parents. That is answered but it's not what was expected and even more frustratingly we don't know if it's completely true because we don't see anything play out in any scene, clearly, but instead just hear someone tell her about her family. I wish we'd have been given more of a definite revelation, in this film, like the one from the ""I am your father"" scene from its twin in the original trilogy. If the answer is true however, it would make the 'force' a more open power-- something that can be wielded by anyone and not just a special group of people.<br /><br />The film has been made funnier than the others in the saga but in just the right way and only when needed. After all, the events are very grave in nature and emotion rules stronger throughout. Since the story references the past more than The Force Awakens, it reminds us of what used to be and how the lives of the people we know have changed and those ignited memories create just the slightest tinge of nostalgia. Every time the Resistance takes a blow and boy do they take a lot of those, it hurts a bit more because it really does feel like we're losing a part of our family and the fact that the dashing Han Solo is missing doesn't help either. One such loss right at the end was especially heartbreaking. Star Wars just isn't Star Wars without some of the characters that have died recently but I guess that's life. Hopefully this person will return as a force-ghost in the last of this trilogy. The death was beautifully sentimental though as it mirrored one of the very first scenes we ever see of this character, symbolically closing the circle of life, so to speak.<br /><br />The Resistance is left lessened in number but 'reborn' as Luke says in the end. Their future is uncertain but they are safe, for now, and the final showdown in Episode IX will be one for the ages."
2410,1,So sad for a real fan whatch this,Cant understand why such an historical saga has the most stupid plotter ever!!! A movie about chasing a ship!! you can do better!!
2411,10,"Critics get this right, never mind the bitter fans who are proven wrong in their premature assumptions","A bold, stunning film that subverts expectations. The characters have so much depth and flaws which makes them human and more relatable to the audience. The stakes have never been higher, especially for the Skywalker family. Beautiful cinematography, top notch visuals and overall excellent performance from the cast. Adam Driver and Mark Hamill are the standouts. Will definitely watch this more than once. Kudos to Rian Johnson for taking this film to another level."
2412,10,Magnificent!,"I fully expected not to like this movie, having been entertained but disappointed by all that came after the first three. Well, I loved every bit of The Last Jedi! I appreciated the story arcs of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, portrayed beautifully by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (dec). Will I go see the next one? Yes of course, but still with a healthy dose of skepticism - one can only hope that it might be as good as this one."
2413,10,Cant really Explain my opinion in writing,"I really liked, totally worth the time.<br /><br />its fun, beautiful, and overall one of my favorite star wars movies."
2414,1,.Destroyed the purpose of the original saga with the ridiculous plot points,"Nothing more to say...beautifully made movie, cinematography was great. Story line totally mocked the Star Wars universe with poor humor and Rian Johnson's take on making something different rather than continue a saga. To me the saga ended with Return of the Jedi and these other movies are all poorly made fan fiction made by Disney."
2415,8,Great!.....Except when its's bad,"The Last Jedi is an anomaly of a film that i've thought about for quite some time now. technically it shouldn't exist. its one of the most genuine blockbusters i saw at the time, which shouldn't be the case with what is possible the biggest franchise of all time. you'd expect this to be some sort of coporate product. this really isn't the case it seems, and it seems like the director: Rian Johnson, really and truly had a vision he wanted to carry out, and he did."
2416,2,This is what happens when people that don't like Star Wars make a Star Wars movie,"This is what happens when people that don't like Star Wars make a Star Wars movie. The trio of Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams (his movies are no better) will go down in history as the people that marred the Star Wars IP."
2417,9,"Stop Criticizing So Called ""Fans Of Star Wars""",I wonder why they say that The Last Jedi is not like the originals but it is the same story George Lucas want. Mark Hamill gave Luke The Skywalker
2418,10,This film is actually really good...,"...don't listen to all the fanboys here whining because it doesn't fit their idea of a Star Wars movie. It's actually full of fresh ideas and has a great storyline. Is it perferct? No. But it definitely is a quality film, and there is no way that it is a 2-3 star movie like so many reviewers are saying here."
2419,9,Unfairly Bashed,"My favorite of the new Disney trilogy. It has some of the best choreography out of any star wars movie, especially when Luke (not Jake!) finally face Kylo Rhen. The character arc of Kyle, fitting end to the character of Luke, and more dynamic characters than any other star wars film makes this my third favorite star wars film, just bellow empire strikes back, and far bellow a new Hope. Btw, I am a huge star wars fan. Star wars fans can lik this movie, it's toxic fans who hate it."
2420,2,Excellent for the right spectator,If you like two no-talent hacks who should stay as far away from camera lenses as women in Georgia should stay away from McDonalds' drive-thru them this film is for you!
2421,10,Don't mind the negativity,It's my first time seeing Star Wars. I watched the movies chronologically by the action.
2422,1,It needs more than taking unexpected turns!,"Well, this movie is a DESASTER! And watching it was one of my worst experiences in my life!"
2423,10,One of the most divisive films in the saga.,"The Last Jedi is already proving to be quite a controversial film. Obviously people have very strong opinions about Star Wars, and after seeing it for myself yesterday there's a lot to discuss. "
2424,9,The best Star Wars movie since 1980,"I get why people have a problem with this movie. It's different to ally from previous installments. But, I think as a stand-alone movie, and as it furthers the story of Star Wars, it's an excellent piece of work. It's not perfect. It has some questionable decisions, for sure. But after watching the Rise of Skywalker, which I enjoyed, this stands head and shoulders above other Star Wars movies since Empire Strikes Back."
2425,8,Boo hoo i didn't like another Star Wars film,It's supposed to be for children not a bunch of moronic cry babes expecting a Star Wars version of Apocalypse Now get over your selves. Excellent film for the kids
2426,1,Be warned... low grade Star Wars fan fiction,"This movie not only was ""meh"" at best but in the process of its execution took a wrecking ball to most of what we all love about the series."
2427,8,"If it was not named ""Star Wars""...","Ok, before watching this forget everything you know about Star Wars. This movies seems to have done the same. IF it was not a Star Wars film it might have been good. But there is so little that connects this to the other movies. The main story is missing and most, if not all, new characters fail to impress. <br /><br />Disney's influence on the film shows a lot and it is not welcome to anyone familiar with the franchise.<br /><br />After finishing the film there is nothing to expect from the next one. There is just going to be another film but here is nothing left in the middle. Not that there was a plot in this on to keep you hanging."
2428,2,Incoherent nonsense,"Worst Star Wars film, all flash and no bang. I could barely follow it, and action sequences held together by no story. I thought the force awakens was bad but they went all out to make a worse film. Bring back jar jar binks!"
2429,8,Wow this movie just proves how people are afraid of something different and dont really knew what they want,Honestly ppl are entitled to like or not to like what ever they want its there perspective and opinion and i respect that but giving the movie a 1 or 2 to me is not justified.
2430,8,"As a fan I think It's brilliant, screw these whiny people who think they'll see another Empire Strikes Back","I could give a thousand of reasons why this movie is awesome, even with its flaws, but it would mean nothing.. these people called fans say they're done with the new Star Wars, lol. I'm  done with them calling themselves fans, I understand the people who don't like it, but saying it's the worst Star Wars film ever? you gotta be  kidding me.. Whatever."
2431,8,Stupid Millennials reviewing,"I bet that most of the negative reviews are being done by Stupid Millennials.<br /><br />Nothing is to good for them and they try to find meaning for every scene. i'll suggest them to keep with their Twilight Saga Movies. As for the movie, it maintains the Star Wars original essence in a very good way, very close to my favorite: The Empire Strikes Back"
2432,1,Idiotic film,"Rian johnson destroyed Star Wars, and this film is an absolute shame."
2433,10,Best Star Wars in a long long time,Best Star Wars in a long long time!!<br /><br />Many fanboy theorists are mad angry because they did not like the payoffs from mysteries and open questions from TFA. They are just cry babies.<br /><br />All others love it.
2434,1,"Absolutely rubbish, bring back George Lucas!!!","This film does not even deserve the Star Wars title... more like cars 4 would be more appropriate, but even that would downgrade cars."
2435,8,"This was a great film, people need to stop whining, just cause their fan theories weren't true.",The only way to please star wars fans is like this...
2436,8,Doesn't deserve the hate at all!,"This movie is getting lots of hate, which I think is ridiculous. Most people are slamming the movie for being 'too different'. The main criticism of the previous film, The Force Awakens was that it was 'too much like the original ones'. Just pick a side of the spectrum. You can't have both."
2437,10,Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is one of the greatest films of all time.,"I will never forget the excitement I had going to see Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. First of all, I loved Star Wars Episide VII: The Force Awakens, and I could not wait to see how that story continued. Also, I have loved Rian Johnson since the beginning of his career and was anxious to see what he can do with a Star Wars film. I walked out of the theater very conflicted on how I felt about the film, but I also knew that the movie gave me a feeling that no film had given me before. After subsequent viewing I have realised that Rian Johnson has made a masterpiece. Let's break it down."
2438,2,Was a waste of my money.,"I have saw them all, from the preview of the first one to this one.<br /><br />They were all at least good. But not this one. Got up and walked out after about 20 minutes.<br /><br />I will not be watching any more, they ruined a good movie series."
2439,9,Best of the new generation of Star Wars.,"I loved this film. It was funny, dark and very progressive. I really enjoyed seeing more lore in this movie, like vibro swords and staffs. The ships were awesome too like the flagship destroyers and the mg-100 bombers, so cool. The story was great, it's like we finally get to see what starts happening after the star wars of old. The way Luke was presented was fantastic, very noble like a samurai warrior, much how I've always perceived the Jedi. His sacrifice was legendary to say the least. Watch this movie with an open mind and you will understand it better!"
2440,1,Awful,"Walked out. Up to here with the political mumbo jumbo and R's constipated face. I want to watch science fiction, not political social justice in space."
2441,8,One of the best Star Wars films,"Haters gonna hate, I guess, but in this case I don't get it. I went into the film with critical eyes, waiting for the cringe to set in. Didn't happen. Went home, read the criticisms and negative reviews. Went to see it again, looking for flaws. Okay, yeah, some of the lines were cheesy. Some of the plot elements were a little far fetched. I wish they'd done more to explain Snoke. But really, none of that made it a bad movie. Maybe nudged it down a star or two, but in the Star Wars franchise, this is a great movie!"
2442,8,Give it a chance!,"I saw The Last Jedi on the opening night - at first I wasn't quite sure what to think, I really enjoyed some parts and I was unsure about others. I talked it over with some friends, read other reviews and spent time thinking about it.. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't love all of it either, at that point I probably would have given it 6/10."
2443,9,Really Good!,"I am a lifelong SW fan and I really like this film. Great performances, arcs, action scenes. Most of the stuff is really good expect the Canto Bight sequence. Rian stayed true to the Mythos of SW!"
2444,1,Franchise ruined.,"I'm not sure what the plan was here, the total franchise has been ruined and the films from my childhood have been ruined.<br /><br />To much SJW agenda, <br /><br />No consistency in the plot,<br /><br />Below average storyline at best.<br /><br />Extremely disappointing and i'm not sure how the reviews are so high as I can't imagine this film getting a score above 1.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money."
2445,8,The Last Jedi Delivers,"This was an enjoyable Star Wars movie.The special effects are there. The music is there. The acting is fantastic, and that's a rarity in SW films: Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, and Carrie Fisher steal every scene they are on (In fact, I am more than likely to say ""Daisy Ridley"" when someone asks me ""who's your favorite actress?""). "
2446,1,the worst send off to the original trilogy yet,And you thought the prequels where bad? They look like classic poetry compared to Disney's lazy calculated writing what they did to Luke Skywalker is absolutely abborent and totally out of character even mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with rain Johnson Disney and the script in regards to his character.
2447,10,Awesome movie!,Rian made a good movie! Pure Gold through whole the movie!
2448,8,THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING,"I don't like that so many people hated the last jedi.<br /><br />when I read the reviews that people wrote I was shocked, I thought it was amazing. near the end of the movie I was like ""what's going to happen?"" that was one of my favorite thing about the movie, I never knew what was going to happen it was so exiting."
2449,9,"Dont listen to the naysayers, they dont know what they're talking about","When the force awakens opened up in cinemas two years ago, I remembered being in awe of the amazing film which essentially carried on the star wars saga. This being said, I found it a little surprising that after a week of it opening up at the box office, star wars fans were giving it such a beating. Complaining that the film was played ""too safe"" and that it ""wasn't original"" or too reminiscent of a new hope...... which I understood to a certain degree, however I felt it was a good way to carry on the franchise nonetheless. When the Last Jedi hit theatres, it took me on a story line which isn't just unpredictable and completely thinks outside of the box in regards to both story line and how characters are introduced. You're invited to new worlds and shown chemistry with new and old characters, basically Disney listened to the fans and gave them something unexpected as well as imaginative...... and surprise surprise, as soon as the last Jedi hits the box office, you're greeted by the same whinge bags who moaned about the force awakens, the same people that said they wanted something different two years ago, are now not happy that the films have gone in a different direction. I don't want to get too much into the film as I want to keep this review spoiler free, but I just wanted to say don't listen to the naysayers, this film is exceptional and is up there with the empire strikes back.....Luke steals the show and watching Poe's character develop is something I didn't know I wanted until I watched the Last Jedi."
2450,2,A selfish movie,"I want to note, I wanted to give this 3 stars, but ruin Johnson being unable to handle any criticism (even valid ones) turned me off this movie even more. (Please note, the only movies I give one star to are woody Allen movies. I think we all know why)<br /><br />Some examples of valid criticism:<br /><br />1. Gravity doesn't work in space<br /><br />2. Jokes are fine, but not every 2 minutes<br /><br />3. The Rey/Kylo/Luke story was clearly what he wanted to make, but had no idea what to do with the other characters and story<br /><br />4. There is 76 tie fighters per star destroyer, why only send 3 and then worry about not being able to cover them? Especially with with the hanger full of fighters taken out.<br /><br />5. No romantic chemistry was built up between Finn and Rose for the whole saving and kiss thing.<br /><br />6. There is no reason to hold out telling the plan from the higher up like Poe. Also being a dick about it like that really doesn't help it<br /><br />7. The holdo move completely undoes every thing in Star Wars. Yes the shot looked amazing, but is it worth undoing everything else for it? Again, this being such a selfish movie, it thinks it is.<br /><br />8. The search for the 'slicer' is ridiculous. Surely someone could have written something, anything! better.<br /><br />9. Leia Poppins"
2451,10,I felt this was the best Star Wars film of the Disney era and is still a great film compared to the rest,"I'm writing this review as I feel a lot of the other reviews of this film are grossly unfair as this is not as bad as other reviewers are making it out to be. People hated ""The Force Awakens"" as they felt it was a re-make of a ""New Hope"" which I agree is very similar but are different films. This one has elements of ""Empire Strikes Back"" but has a lot of original story telling also. I'm going to say it, the originals are not the masterpieces people make them out to be. They are boring in places, has cheesy dialogue and has questionable story telling in places. Nostalgia has clearly clouded people's judgement as this film was a great film but no one is seeing it which upsets me. "
2452,1,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,"This movie is ridiculously bad. Rian obviously knows nothing about Star Wars and it shows. Rian and Disney are more concerned with virtue-signaling the audience instead of telling them a Star Wars story. So if you don't know right from wrong, maybe this movie is for you.<br /><br />There are fundamental Star Wars rules that were completely shattered in this movie without explanation. Any scene that starts to get serious, is ruined by a stupid joke - I swear, literally every time it has to end in a throwaway joke (Tarantino has mastered the technique but Rian has no idea how to pull it off, and the movie has dozens of these moments)<br /><br />For me, there are three major scenes that embody what this movie is about:<br /><br />1. When Luke is given his old lightsaber and he looks at it briefly, only to throw it away immediately. This shows the audience that Rian is throwing out all of previous film's work, so that he can make a standalone Star Wars film in the middle of a trilogy.<br /><br />2. Princess Leia getting spaced and then reviving herself, using the force to fly through space without life-support. Which foreshadows the absurdity you're about to witness.<br /><br />3. When Admiral Purple Hair doesn't tell her crew what the plan is, so that she can surprise-save-the-day by entering hyper-space to destroy an entire fleet of ships with HYPER-SPACE ITSELF. This scene shows us that Rian has is not a fan of Star Wars and wants to single-highhandedly destroy the multi-billion-dollar franchise."
2453,9,"With the current reception of the Last Jedi, it has become clear; Star Wars fans have truly forgotten what Star Wars has been about.","Now, I have seen this only once, which was 3 weeks ago, and I'm still thinking about this film. As I expected from the user review section of this film, it is what I expected; filled with one stars, two stars, three stars, complaining the fact that ""Disney ruined Star Wars"", or that it is ""filled with a mediocre script"", or that it was ""full of plot holes"" and a ""mess of a film"". But one thing I lacked to see here was any valid criticism, well, true, there are moments where most of the reviews here make valid points, but my true assessment on these reviews? Is that Star Wars fans have truly forgotten what Star Wars is built upon, what it runs on, and what made its 30 year legacy exactly what it is now."
2454,8,"A few missing plot points. One disapointment. But overal, Star Wars is amazing.","Note: I have a shorter, similar review that you may find on Rotten Tomatoes. But, I decide to share the longer one on here. "
2455,10,Absolutely terrific.,"Initially, I wasn't thinking about writing a comment on this movie. But after reading all these insults about Disney and the movie, I realized that it might be an organized attack on a specific purpose. I haven't read the books but watched the movies over and over. Older ones are cult but we cannot say that the newest one is total rubbish. On the contrary, I really like the way the movie expresses the voyage of the characters through the Force, their shifts from the good side to the dark and back. And also the newest characters are not celebrities or aristocracy, they are ordinary people like me and you. Turning a stormtrooper into a rebellion hero and showing how he questions his being is a great detail throughout the movie. A scavenger daughter becomes the last representative of a galactic order. Isn't it so good or am I too dumb to understand a good sci-fi movie?"
2456,2,Genius!,This putrid pile of offal made a billion dollars.<br /><br />SUCKERS AHOY!
2457,8,Good fun stuff!,"I see a lot of 1 and 2 star spam, all recent and from 1st time posters. It looks like the haters are just trying to bring down the rating. Ignore them. This film is fun escapism, just enjoy it."
2458,4,This film does not feel like a star wars film,"I'll keep this spoiler free apart from spoilers for the force awakens. I left the cinema after watching the force awakens so full of joy and happy discussing every point with my friends ""wasn't that bit great"", ""the return of the falcon was amazing"", ""when he took that extra step forward i knew he was dead"" so on and so on, but most importantly it filled us with questions. ""Who are Rey's parents, who is Snoke, what does he want, why is Luke on this island all alone, what has he been doing"" etc etc. The same question I'm sure you all have. "
2459,10,I like starw wars,"If you like fictional movies, and a great story, this is ine of the best! Motivional, great writing, serious , for us fans of lord of the rings etc! Great!!!!!"
2460,9,One of the best SW movies,"The amount of negative reviews is getting ridiculous. Ryan Johnson made one of the best films in SW-franchise and very decent piece of cinematography. His approach is actually quite close to that of George Lucas. SW began as independent film, bold and experimental, and Lucas always held to that, in prequels too, inspite of all the critic from old fans. Here, with Ryan Johnson, we see the same boldness, the same readiness to explore and invent something new. The so called Canon, set of immutable laws - as it always happens, not only on SW, but in life, - in public reception replaced that what gave life to the series in the first place - and that is imagination.<br /><br />Last Jedi is surprising, - it always goes not the way you think, with several major unpredictible twists, - fascinating and emotionally engaging, with accent on charachter development - which, again, was one of the main traits of Lucas's films.<br /><br />The metamorphose of Luc is actually the only logical explanation of his exile - how else would you explain his abandonment of all the people he cared about? It is guilt, that is rationalized through his critic of the Jedi way as such.<br /><br />Episode with Leya in space was a little over the top, but - especially in the sad context of this movie being Carry Fisher's last appearance - it played beautifully and moving.<br /><br />The logic of the chase scene is explained in the movie and makes sense, I don't understand the critic here.<br /><br />The whole Monte-Carlo sequence is overextended, it was made to explore the characters of Finn and Rose, but it introduces two important charachters - DJ, who is great in his opposition of the classic good-bad-guy Han Solo, being bad-bad-guy, and the boy who played a significant symbolic role in the end of the film.<br /><br />The whole un-answering-the-big-questions thing, that irritated the fans the most - is due to the fact, that Johnson shifted the accent towards the psychological exploration of the characters, sometimes at the expense of the plot development.<br /><br />This movie certainly has its flaws, but overall it doesn't deserve all this reactionary and irrational hatred that it received from fans. Mainly because it didn't resort to being the simple fan-service attraction (which you could have expected from Disney), instead being a decent stand-alone inovative and imaginative movie in SW universe."
2461,10,Definitely Worth Watching,"I would definitely recommend watching this movie, since it is a great addition to the Star Wars series. It wasn't quite as great as the other movies in the series, but it was still a great experience watching it and although it was a bit different, the changes were all good, and it was nice to have a change. The story lines in the movie are exceptional, and they were all easy to follow. It was also enjoyable to get to see more of the characters, especially the different sides of them that really added to the plot. And even though the movie was different, it was not a substantial difference, and the movie shouldn't stray too far from the wishes of most Star Wars fans. The characters were all really brought together, and many of the loose ends were tied up. The movie has an awesome soundtrack that I really enjoyed. This movie definitely brought out emotions although my only complaint was that it was lacking just a tad bit on the funny side. Other than that it was great. It includes everything a Star Wars fan could possibly want from the light side, to the dark side. The stormtroopers still can't aim and there are jedis and pilots and everything you could possibly ask for. This film has everything, and I don't have the slightest idea why anybody could hate it. I would recommend seeing this movie especially the theatres, since it is definitely worth watching."
2462,1,I broke up with Star Wars in 2017,Seeing this film on streaming platforms is like running into your ex at the grocery store. You stop for a second and think positive thoughts but then quickly turn away because you come to your senses and remember why you broke up with them in the first place...awkward! lol
2463,10,"The Best Star Wars movie, to date",A grandiose title for a near-perfect movie.
2464,1,Total Disaster: Not worth the paper the ticket was printed on,"As much as I wanted to love this movie, it utterly failed to deliver on so many levels. Disney, in all its previews, advertised the film as a serious epic focused on Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, with no doubt some appropriate comic relief as always. What they delivered was a farce-tripping over itself with excessive and ill-timed humor such that no scene could ever be taken seriously, even ones that were intended to be. That combined with frenetically paced scene transitions, too many new characters, and wasted sub-plots (casino scenes), meant the main story and characters were left undeveloped with few burning questions answered. The main premise, equivalent to a slow motion car chase with the First Order chasing the Resistance until they run out of fuel, was absolutely ridiculous. Perhaps most unforgivable of all was the treatment of Luke Skywalker. While initially promising, his diminished role and ultimate end were insulting to his character and inconsistent with everything we know about him. Shame on Rian Johnson."
2465,8,Seeing it a second time really changed me!,Hello hello! <br /><br />Okay so I review this on Thursday and I had a few things that I was unsure of. 
2466,9,I enjoyed it,"I sincerely enjoyed this movie. Music, transitions and lightsaberfights on point. The actors where all great, the chemistry between Kylo Ren and Rey and how they developed as characters stood out among all (also Hux, he was magnificent). Perhaps it didn't feel like a ""true"" Star Wars movie but nevertheless it got me hooked. When jedi mindtricks were happening, dang that was neat. "
2467,10,Almost Perfect - It's brave and bold and beautiful,The Last Jedi is astounding; Rian Johnson has done an admirable job. It's the first Star Wars movie with nuance and has genuine character development. Every shot means something to the greater whole of the movie and Johnson's approach fixes a lot of the force issues that Lucas introduced in the prequels. The middle section is a little long and doesn't add much to the overall plot and this is my only minor gripe. Stay the course because the final third of the film delivers with pay off after pay off. I'm upset audiences seem to have quite juvenile issues with this chapter because Star Wars need this - it needed a re-interpretation and re-imagination; it needed an auteur like Johnson tackling its mythology and 40 year characters because you simply cannot have episode after episode of the same thing repeated over and over. Thank you Rian Johnson for a movie with feeling and originality and for making The Last Jedi the 3rd best Star Wars movie (after 4 & 5).
2468,1,"""Oh, I'm afraid the Emperor palpatine will not be operational 18/12/2009","The last jedi was lack luster with the only villian snoke a hologram pretending to killed off and now with luke also being a hologram projection in scenes, it leaves little doubt to the fact that any vilian from the back catalogue,bad or good could appear and disappear without an R2d2 droid projection. This makes the protential bad guy in future movies just like wizard of oz."
2469,8,"Just because it isn't your vision, doesn't mean it isn't a terrific film","Having read a lot of the reviews, I can see an overarching theme. The majority of negative reviews seem to have been written by people saying ""I wouldn't have done this"" / ""This isn't what I wanted"". With a saga as incredible as Star Wars, everyone is going to have their own story in their head about how the story should go (I know that many of the things I wanted didn't happen and some incredible moments I didn't think of did). Just because this story isn't the one you came up with doesn't mean in isn't a tremendous continuation of the saga!"
2470,1,"""Oh, I'm afraid the Dismayland club will be quite operational .","The last jedi ever hahaha and no the emperor will be making a holographic apearance but who could possibly send a hologram of them selfs to another place. snoke was a hologram= luke was a hologram like oz so snoke was luke? Lea is the good witch and rey is Dorathy that sound like wizard of oz remake.<br /><br />Disney distoyed junglebook, lionking,dumbo, aladin,beaty and the beast with cheap live action remakes changing the stories. Walts dead and storys he brough and have been aquired are not lockedin they can be changed just like starwars, even the lion king was not original disney they copiedanother cartoon its on youtube. Whats new rise of skywalker and a baby yoda getting more hype just to get children watching starwars."
2471,8,I must have been watching a different film.,"It's easy to forget that in 1977, Star Wars introduced all sorts of unusual elements and packaged them into an accessible mainstream film. Religion, mysticism, beliefs, strong female characters, banter, humour, flawed characters, failure, the unknown, the unexplained. It deliberately didn't explain everything and it deliberately confounded expectation.<br /><br />It's pretty depressing seeing the ranks of one star reviews here. It's unusual for so many people to miss so much. <br /><br />The Last Jedi definately isn't is a one star film. <br /><br />It is also definately not worse than the Phantom Menace, which itself has some good moments. <br /><br />I think what people don't like about the last Jedi is that things they wanted to hear explained were not. The film is also quite unusual in its angle, tone and approach. <br /><br />The Jedi order was critically deconstructed for our viewing pleasure. <br /><br />There were strong female characters throughout, who did not give or get answers, but carried on anyway. <br /><br />Some strong male leads were emasculated for our viewing pleasure!<br /><br />At first I thought the Canto Bight sidetrack was a mistake, but actually, maybe it wasn't.....<br /><br />There were some bravely intimate and weirdly mystical scenes. Rey in the cave was amazing- a bit of Ingmar Bergman creeping in. <br /><br />The close up face shots were really compelling. I haven't seen a mainstream film recently where an actor has to face act in close up for extended periods (Ridley and Driver manage this really well). Again, it was like Ingmar Bergman!<br /><br />In fact, the film is unusual in that a strange surreal atmosphere hung over it, almost building to unexplained foreboding. <br /><br />Kylo Ren was amazing, especially with Snope gaslighting him to make him more angry, just as Rey discovered more by Skywalker refusing to engage with her. <br /><br />The scene where Ren focuses everything on Skywalker, like a furious Don Quixote trying to attack a windmill is memorable. <br /><br />There were certainly a few tense Serge Leone stand offs in the film. The Rey / Ren fight scene is probably the most intense in the Star Wars series. <br /><br />All the time, the rule book was being torn up. Often, we were made to laugh at the points where the rule book went up in smoke (in one case literally).<br /><br />I was really happy with this film, I think it went back to the fact that we have forgotten that the original Star Wars was weird, intense, unsettling,unusual and original- unlike anything else that came before. <br /><br />As far as I am concerned, Episode 7 was back to basics and getting us back on track. Rogue One began to blow the dust off the franchise, and Episode 8 has continued with this and thrown everything up in the air. <br /><br />And yes. There are clearly alot of people who don't get it. And it's all the better for that. Because, as hinted at in the film, there will be kids who watch, who will get it and will be blown away, like when the original was released."
2472,9,I liked it very much and I don´t see this movie as finished yet...,"Sad to see all the negative reviews... It seems like people thought that Star Wars would look just the same for all eternity and that´s just weird. If Star Wars was to continue on, something new had to happen. The new is of course all the younger characters, most of them very good actors and I like them all. "
2473,8,The Last Jedi Review 'potential spoilers',"I really enjoyed most moments of this movie, My only con that I believe the movie lacked was a lightsaber duel. Having a duel would of brought this review to a ten and I'm sure would of increased the reviews for other people as well. I still enjoyed seeing Rey and Kylo Ren fight against Supreme Leader Snokes guards, Luke dodging all of Kylo Ren's shots was very cool also, however an offical duel would of stregethened the film. This was still an amazing film that I reccomend to others. I hope this review can make episode 9 even greater. <br /><br />Thank You"
2474,1,Will never pay to see Star wars again,"This Film, was so off in so many ways, as a Star Wars movie Fan (not books) you will wonder what they were smoking. You will also feel insulted that the Characters you once knew are bent out of shape in odd ways. If you cant sit thourgh it twice you will literally start mothing ""why"" at loads of scenes."
2475,8,"It's original, and not what you expect","By all means, this is not a perfect movie, but it certainly NOT the train wreck that users on here would have you believe."
2476,3,Let me explain how this movie happened,A confluence of events:
2477,8,"The last Jedi, good or bad?","The thing is, I couldn't find a correct critic, because the movie we talk about, is Star Wars, so it can only be super good or super bad. Let me share my own thoughts about The Last Jedi. (No spoilers, HOWEVER I DO SUGGEST EVERYONE, TO WATCH THE MOVIE WITHOUT CRITICS, AND OTHER'S JUDGMENTS):<br /><br />Things that were bad:<br /><br />I think we can put the ""A little bit too much"" label on almost everything, which sadly makes the movie line a little bit jumbled. For example: 1) More characters then it was necessary, and I think they should have give us a deeper knowledge about fewer of them. 2) I also think there was a little bit too much action. Personally, I'd like if the story sometimes just chill a little in the neighboring tavern, or dance with the aliens at Jabba's... 3) A little bit to much moral messages, dramatic moments, but that's also cool at some point 4) A little bit too many adorable... things :D 5) And I'm sure most of you have already guessed this one is coming: Too much jokes. No. No ""little bit"" here... I mean there were a lot of good jokes, funny moments, which were all in all good, but some times it has no other effect on me, but ruining the dramatic moments, or making me feel embarrassed, uncomfortable. These things has their place in Marvel movies (which by the way I like very much) but not here, and especially not at these moments. It's a waste... without them, it could easily get 9, I may even consider the legendary 10. Why?<br /><br />The good things:<br /><br />1) I don't care how many people disappointed in some of the characters but most of them were awesome. Especially (!) those who could use the force. Everything has a meaning on that story line, every character did his or her part magnificently. Everyone had a little dark and light inside of them, and I really think it is a very good message. Even Luke's character became more complexed that way, and yes I liked it it very much. I even accepted that Rey has a base knowledge of the force without training. (Based on episode 7, no spoilers) First of all, she had a raw talent of using it, which I can accept. Second of all I realized it, that she already learnt sword fighting so she might be able to handle a lightsabre. And Kylo Ren was simply amazing. 2) The fighting scenes and battle scenes were truly monumental 3) We have seen many things from the Star Wars universe, which are only known by the gamers, or even new elements, and they were fantastic, I loved to see these things on the movie screen. 4) I think all the jedi got back their long missed dignity and mystery I always thought they should have before the prequels. Like wise mysterious monks hidden on barely known planets, coming only at the time when they are needed, not a bunch of old politician dudes living in a CGI d..k,, swinging glowing rods by the help of their genetically mutated X-men midiclorian genes or whatever..."
2478,10,"Star Wars goes in a completely different direction, but I loved it","So this is my first written review on IMDB, and I have always been someone who scored the odd film but left the comments to others. However the sheer amount of vitriol aimed at this film, its director and Disney has prompted me to add my comments."
2479,8,Rain Johnson walks the SW franchise off the cliff's edge,"A good step in the right direction. Not everything worked, but overall a massive improvement on TFA. The biggest difference is that it wasn't as mind numbingly predictable as the previous installment. Also, I started caring about the characters little. <br /><br />P.S. The wheelbarrow crushed by a falling rock is an instant classic on the par with the most (intentionally) funny scenes in all SW movies"
2480,1,Arguably the worst movie in the Star Wars saga.,This movie pretty much killed any desire in me to see another film that has Star Wars in the title. I'm done. 
2481,9,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"Eagerly awaited by fans of the series, the last Star Wars takes the ingredients that made the success of previous films: rhythm, a neat narrative, breathtaking special effects, charismatic characters and a certain audacity of the plans. A good moment of rhythmic cinema, with a great visual intensity."
2482,2,Subverted expectations...,I expected a good film.
2483,9,I feel a disturbance in the force...,Love the new twists in the storyline. Love the build-up and uncertainty with Rey's future. Love Mark Hamill's acting with Luke's internal struggles with his guilt. Pleasantly surprised to see Leia pull a hat trick out of the bag. Felt a disturbance in the force when the movie started adding funny punchlines almost all of which were aimed at Hux. (I feel for him. Seriously.) A little unsettled with Snoke's fate and how it all played out.
2484,9,"Haters gonna hate, the rest of us have the Force",I feel a moral responsibility to at least say that this movie is great and that the *thousands~ of people crying grand conspiracies rigging IMDb in The Last Jedi's favour are severely paranoid narcissists so terribly threatened by the idea that they have no meaningful ownership over the multibillion dollar corporate slam dunk we call Star Wars. 
2485,10,"New, creative, inspiring.","At some point Star Wars had to move on from the original trilogies and god awful prequels. TLJ still has that ""Star Wars"" feeling but with a new edge to it. People that hate this movie hate it because it's not what they expected or wanted to have happen in the end. In my opinion it's just what the franchise needed. Rian Johnson could've done the obvious then people would knock it for not being original. I love this movie because the characters have depth and weight to their roles and to me that's what is Star Wars. They are by no means winning or coming close to finding their place in the galaxy and I think that's what makes it a truly special movie. Like some of us they are either running from something, wanting answers, or just willing to fight for something/someone/themselves. They are growing throughout the movie. To me this film has so much to relate to and turn it into a positive, it's a breath of fresh air. Like the great Master Yoda said ""You must unlearn what you have learned"" and I take that literally to have an open mind and new experience to this great franchise."
2486,1,Oh the humanity,I find it terribly sad that Disney with all the tremendous wealth and access to talent created this POS.
2487,8,Sci Fi Reflection of American Culture and Society,"The movie smacks of political correctness and inclusiveness buzzwords of contemporary American society racial and cultural identities. The introduction of the short chubby Asian female and the African-American actor who plays the ex-storm trooper as sub-plots further heightens the notion of an ongoing theme to incorporate aspects of American society into the Star Wars trilogy films. I might please American audiences but overseas might not have the same appeal. But an otherwise all-Caucasian characters would be really controversial in the current social climate. Also noteworthy are the British accents of some of the especially Imperial characters. The Star Wars film characters and plots were always inspired by and adapted from previous elements of American society right from the original Episode IV. Location shooting introduces nothing new from the last film Luke is still away on his little island home although the introduction of maintenance worker creatures and the little bird-like big eye animals is questionable to the story development. Those old enough to remember the entire series since 1977 will be reminded of their age especially when looking at General Leia and Luke in their very apparent older years. Given that Carrie Fisher actress has now died we would expect her to be killed off in this sequel but apparently not so. As always, great space battle special effects and well choreographed fight scenes does not disappoint. The ending of the movie is a little bit puzzling showing some seemingly unconnected children who presumably will somehow play into the next sequel possibly to become the new generation of Jedi warriors."
2488,2,disappointment around every corner,I tried really hard to like the movie. I failed.
2489,10,Very satisfying Star Wars movie and new direction,A very unpredictable movie with plenty of 'star wars' moments.
2490,10,Wonderful!,"Im not fake review. I loved what Starwars is, not what luke was. Expectation was a problem for who dislike this movie."
2491,8,Contrary to most whiners this is episode can hold its ground,"I was initially conflicted about whether I should go see this episode after cold-shower that episode VII was. I went in the theater with very low expectations. I have to say that the movie faired better than I expected. Acting is superb with Fisher and Hamill showing the younger folks how it's done. My gripes have to do with Adam Driver who really has remarkable potential but neither the plot nor the directing allows his real talents to shine through, leaving you with a 'meh' feeling sinking like a rock in your stomach. The other gripe I have from this movie is its over-use of comedy. I think that they overdid it in this regard in a superficial way, un-becoming for a star wars movie. Apart from these 2 dark spots the movie is engaging in every other way. If you want to throw a rotten tomato or two throw it at episode VII. Episode VIII is getting things back on track. Thumbs up (yes even to you Adam Driver)."
2492,1,"Thanks, Ruin Johnson","Way to waste years of awesome storyline just to earn millions of bucks. Says a lot about the current state of society in general. This movie doesn't just throw previous stories and development into the trash can, but it also makes it so that the directors of future Star Wars projects can just invent new abilities or laws of physics that adjust to what the plot needs. It takes a lot of talent to ruin a franchise, and Kathleen Kennedy and Ruin Johnson managed to do it; they should earn an award."
2493,8,I'm glad this movie came out,"This movie isn't perfect, there are very few that are. But what I love about this movie is how they show realistically what would happen if Luke failed at something, and took it too hard on himself. If he was the pure optimistic person people wanted him to be, he would seem more android than human. I also like how they talk about the force in a way they never done before, it helps you understand better without ruining anything. Like the force isn't owned by the Jedi or sith, it's its own entity, and if Jedi died off, the force would still be there. That's just part of it."
2494,1,Absolutely horrendous movie,"After watching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", all i can say is that the movie was a complete mess, poor direction, horrible editing, the fight sequences were good but utterly pointless. Luke sky walker's character has been decimated to the point of no return."
2495,9,There are a lot of dishonest reviews here,"I get why some people have issues with this movie. It takes risks, something this cinematic universe was in dire need of, but risks that will upset certain viewers nontheless. However, to give this film an incredibly low score based purely on issues you have with choices made in the script is dishonest. This is a well written, well acted and well produced film that makes harsh decisions regarding it's characters, but that ultimately allows those characters to react properly and with internal consistency based on the context written around them."
2496,10,One of the greatest Star Wars films I have ever optically discerned.,"The Last Jedi is genuinely a great movie. I don't understand why many people disrelish this film. First of all, The Last Jedi has astonishing and paramount themes. I don't optate to spoil the film but it edifies us a great edification about failure. We all can learn a thing a two. Rian Johnson is an astonishing film maker and he did do equity with this film. We fail, our heroes fail, no one is impeccable. We all make mistakes and we can learn from them. The Last Jedi withal had phenomenal acting, an astonishing plot, fantastic cinematography, wondrous fighting sequences, great themes and it left us hopeful at the cessation. Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley additionally did an astonishing portrayal of their characters. I inculpate the people who misprized this film were the downfall of The Rise of Skywalker. The studio and executives got trepidacious of verbalizing risks so they made Episode IX Frankenstein's monster of a film. I dote The Last Jedi because it was not trepidacious to take risks and I veraciously believe that it paid off. I ken for a fact that Russian Cyber-farms heavily influenced many Star Wars fans to hate this film. Even if some TLJ detesters weren't manipulated, those ones just hate change. Change was additionally an astounding theme of The Last Jedi. Here's my conclusion: The Last Jedi is a fantastic film with great themes, I would recommend anyone to optically canvass this great film."
2497,10,The movie that broke the wheel,"The more I think about this movie the more I realize this is actually doing what the ""Targaryen Girl"" said in Season 5... This is the movie that broke the wheel. This movie ""broke"" not only the Star Wars traditional narrative but also the whole narrative we've been following since The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings books where released way back in the 50s... This is a movie that dares to deconstruct good vs evil, the same narrative so present in Tolkiens books and that inspired a whole era of cinema including Star Wars (the original trilogy can be very easily summarized to Lotr in Space) Game of Thrones is an attempt to do this but still there are the good guys one roots for and based on the latest season that's where the show is headed, and will be another lotr based fantasy show in the end (to probably the dismay of many)."
2498,1,Star Wars: The Last Plothole,"Don't waste your time. This slagheap of a movie is an exercise in how to kill a trilogy in what should be its rising action. It's staggering how awful the ""plot"" of this movie is. Picture the slowest chase scene you can imagine, then throw in some terrible jokes, plotholes wider than the sarlacc pit, lack of any kind of character development, and a butchering of existing, beloved characters, and that's what you've got. At least everything looks and sounds nice as the franchise crumbles around Rian Johnson's heels in smoking ruins."
2499,9,An Exceptional Chapter of a Less-Than-Stellar Franchise,"Force awakens, what's with all the hate on this film? I thought it was an outstanding movie and I can't wait to see it again. ""The Last Jedi"" was an improvement on Abrams' hole-filled new chapter, and an exceptional episode to what has been -- less face it -- a less-than-stellar movie franchise. "
2500,1,"Awful, just awful.","Before I start, the main score is being fudged by IMDb. I've gone through all the ratings and it should be 4.0. Not 7.0!"
2501,10,This is a 10 star film if you like.....,"This is a 10 star film if you like and loved the prequels episodes 1-3 and the holiday special  and have always dreamed of a star wars film written directed and produced by Jar Jar Binks, also throw in a slice of Superman IV ( the Leia scene of her floating through space (marionette style) ). I'm a Star wars fan But this has seriously made me hesitant and nervous about Episode 9.... Help us JJ your'e our only hope. JJ abrams has some serious mopping up to do."
2502,10,Extraordinary! What movie were you 1 stars watching?!?!,(Extremely light spoilers ahead)
2503,9,This is not going to go the way you thought,"Spoilers *** Don't read until after you have seen the movie<br /><br />So, yah I wasn't a fan of what happens to Luke and how it's handled, and there seems to be some dialogue missing and the theory of chasing a fleet down, as opposed to jumping past them, well... Rule of Ninja, Stormtroopers and Imperial fleet Commanders in affect and the next Gen of Jedi don't need much training. And we need more Chewbacca."
2504,1,Worst movie I have ever seen.,I really cannot express how much I detest and hate this movie. I was I could it give it half a star as it doesn't deserve a full one star.
2505,10,Quit Hating,"I don't understand why everyone is hating so much. The story is way better than the old ones. At least accept it for what it is, which is not a 1, and just enjoy it. "
2506,2,"Rian Johnson: Genius, or imbecile?","Imbecile. I, unlike seemingly many others, actually quite enjoyed the Force Awakens. Of course it didn't come close to reigniting my love for the Star Wars universe or anything, but it was acceptable. Especially in retrospect after watching this one."
2507,10,So Much Hate..Not From Me,"I really enjoyed the movie. It was everything I wanted. Humor, action, characters, and tension. When characters were in peril, it really felt like they were in danger. You never knew who could die. The casino part and Phasma were underdeveloped, but that is a small price to pay for the excellence of the rest of the movie. People were whining about The Force Awakens being like A New Hope, but now they are mad about this movie feeling different. I bet many are mad because they spent months theorising about Snoke and Rey, and none of that mattered. Luke was better than I hoped, and we will see more from him going forward. "
2508,9,Excellent addition to the Star Wars universe.,I found this movie to be an excellent addition to the Star Wars saga. I realize that a seeing Luke deteriorate to a withdrawn hermit or the rebellion being reduced to a rag tag group may be disappointing to many but what many people see as flaws is the genius of this movie. 
2509,8,I liked it.,I think that this movie was something great and new. Episode VII was basically recreation of episode IV and everybody loved it so I don't really understand why everybody hates this one.
2510,1,Worst film ever made???,So bad ... words can't describe it.
2511,9,Not the nostalgia-fest that audiences had hoped for.,People are very angry at The Last Jedi because it was different.
2512,1,Potentially the worst Star Wars film...EVER.,The humor doesn't work...it's like they were going for a more guardians of the galaxy vibe with this one...the plot is horrible...the message is so so (minus the political message) it left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm not excited for future Star Wars projects. This is by far the worst of the 8(as of now) Star Wars films.
2513,10,LOVED it! my favorite episode so far :),"This movie is fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed every single bit of it. The story lines, action, humor ... great entertainment. I've been a Star Wars fan since the first one (and quite frankly loathe the prequels) - these sequels & Rogue One have been excellent."
2514,10,Rian Johnson dares to be different to great success and allows the audience feel the force like never before,"Rian Johnson with a triumphant entry into the STAR WARS saga.<br /><br />Has the nerve to dare to be different from any STAR WARS film before it, making it fresh but managing to keep it familiar.<br /><br />This has resulted in a wonderful piece of cinema, not just visually but emotionally as well.<br /><br />How Rian Johnson has subtly created plot twists throughout the film by harnessing the audiences emotional anticipation is simply genius and extremely rewarding.<br /><br />A truly enjoyable film, that lets you feel the the force like never before."
2515,10,amazing!!!!!!! can't stop talking about it best performance from mark hamill,Star Wars the last Jedi didn't reach the peak of The Force Awakens but it was really close too. the movie had this amazing characters. there were a lot of questions regarding the force awakens character origins and there were a lot of them aswered but there were a lot of new questions.
2516,2,I Really Tried,I tried to watch this again for the first time in a few years an it's just as bad. Well the first 30mins is as that is all I could watch. I will never understand how anyone could think this movie isn't garbage. All the 3 of the last movies have been horrible. I wish Disney would sell the franchise to someone who actually cares about it because they've literally destroyed it.
2517,10,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR,"I loved this movie so much: the references to other 'Star Wars' movies, the performances, the plot. *SPOILER* May the force be with you Luke Skywalker."
2518,1,Disney officially kills Star Wars. The Last Farce!,"Right from the opening this movie lets us know we are in for a rough space ride. The jokes don't land, humour is misplaced, the first order are made out to be the bad guys from Space Balls. Completely understand we are in the universe of a space opera, but space bombs defying gravity didn't work. Luke Skywalker is wasted, and basically his character is ruined. He is a lonely old angry hermit who has turned his back on the galaxy because he had a bad day at work (the new Jedi academy)."
2519,9,awesome,Superb film in line with the previous ones. RIP princess Leila.
2520,9,My favorite Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi,There were a few things in this film that I didn't like - namely a certain character in a sparkly gold bathrobe.
2521,9,Don't understand all the hate,For me this was a great Star Wars movie and I really enjoy it I don't know what the hell people was expecting
2522,1,"Hollywooditis, nice looks, no substance","Star Wars has also been infected by the disease called Hollywooditis.<br /><br />Movie looks nice when it comes to effects, cinematography, etc. but the story is beyond poor. If anyone has spent more than a day on the storyline he or she should be ashamed."
2523,10,The force like you've never seen it before,"All in all The Last Jedi is another triumph for the franchise, but one can't help but wonder if it could have been written neater to seem less like 3-4 episodes of a TV show and more like an actual movie. For a film that runs so incredibly long it sure as hell doesn't address quite a few plotholes either. We still have no idea who, how or where Snoke came to be or who the alleged ""Knights of Ren"" are that Kylo took with him in his rebel against Luke. It also has time to create new plotholes like how did Rei suddenly become so adept with a Lightsaber when Luke literally taught her no combat skills or why is Finn still considered a main character? It fails as a sequel in the sense where it races to tell us more before resolving questions inspired from it's predecessor. This isn't to say The Last Jedi is 152 minute failure though, in fact outside of the former problems mentioned I think it did an exceedingly great job bringing new character ideas and story elements into the franchise. Especially the relationship between Kylo and Rei as they walk parallel with each other in discovering their connection/role with the Force. A lot of the subplots went beyond expectations because it's arguably there just so there's epic Sci-Fi battles to be had (A necessity in a Star Wars film, no?) I was really impressed with how much newcomers Dern (Admiral Holdo) and Tran/Ngo (Rose and her sister) quickly became favorites on screen. I stepped out of the theater exhausted but still pretty satisfied with my Star Wars experience. Like The Force Awakens there's a lot of nodding to existing lore in the franchise and a lot of new stuff to sink your teeth into, I just wish it was written and presented more efficiently. There seems to be a lot of the general negativity from fanatics. They're probably just unhappy with where they're taking the story or certain characters, it's unfortunate but loyalists will always hold onto that sense of entitlement."
2524,4,Subversion for subversion's sake...,If you don't want to deliver on narrative promises set up within a story arc then don't write/ direct the middle/ episodic part of a serial story.
2525,8,A Fresh Spin,"First and foremost, I should note that I'm writing this review as a ""super-fan"" of Star Wars, but I try my best to remain unbiased."
2526,10,"This is the worse episode of the other 2, but I liked it.",I don't have words. But Ilike it. And I like the story and Yoda.
2527,10,Amazing Movie,"Im somebody who grown up on Star Wars. Original trilogy, I saw this movie twice. When i came out from the first viewing i was very conflicted. I didnt know what to feel. There were parts what i liked and i didnt liked. After the second screening i started to fall in love with TLJ. "
2528,2,"Like Windows 8, Star Wars 8 was a complete mess. Only they have to make another movie based on 8.","I've read a lot of reviews and pretty much everyone has said it all. For me this is one of the biggest mistakes ever in film. Badly written, massive inconsistencies, plot holes, terrible character and story development and badly.........everything."
2529,9,"Unique, Unconventional, and Underappreciated","I've seen many people take to their podiums in the past 24 hours and attempt to stretch their vague and empty reasonings behind why this film is ""The worst Star Wars EVER"". No film is perfect, but the ""imperfections"" being pointed out in this film are mostly unjustified. Yet it seems many of those in the Star Wars fanbase are unwilling or even incapable of understanding the subtleties that make The Last Jedi a genius landmark film for the franchise."
2530,2,Heartbreakingly Poor!,"Visually a Star Wars movie, but... the 'story' is just terrible! Don't waste your time!"
2531,8,I don't get the hate,"Let me establish my Star Wars cred first. I'm 56, I saw A New Hope when it came out in theaters when I was in high school and it was just known as Star Wars. I loved it so much I saw it another dozen times that year, back in the day when you had to actually pay to go back to the theater to see it again (I also had to carry my lunch to school in a pail and walk uphill both ways). This was several years before there were even VCRs. When we bought our first VCR, Star Wars was the first tape I bought. I've seen the original three movies (now episodes 4-6) dozens of times. For the record, I hated the so-called Episode 1, moderately disliked Episode 2, and grudgingly admitted that Episode 3 (Revenge of the Sith) was good."
2532,10,best SW film since the last 10 years,"Just look at the ratings not the review. It is currently 8/10.<br /><br />Don't look at hating review.<br /><br />This is one of the best<br /><br />No longer super ace, over-powered republic.<br /><br />Republics lost and lost again. So much sacrifice. So much changes towards characters as the story uncovers.<br /><br />People cant accept the fact that Skywalker was a dumbass. He drunk milk from a disgusting creature. I watched the previous last jedi when I was 8 years old and I didn't like him as well. He turned his back against the young Kylo. What else Kylo can do?"
2533,10,Simply Amazing.,"Disney knocks all expectations out of the park. This trilogy continues to be a passing of the torch from the old to the new. When all hope seems lost for the rebellion it is up to a handful of survivors to try to keep the resistance alive. Can the resistance survive the onslaught of Kylo Ren, and the First Order?"
2534,4,"Decent-ish. But honestly, not a great sequel.....","As I have said before, I love all the characters and hope they get another chance soon with star wars tv shows to help further develop their character. This movie was decent, but it could have been much much better. Rian Johnson did not do the greatest job with this film. Mark Hammil was definitely right. Overall, Not a great sequel, bland plot, movie was decent, but a lot of things i would have personally changed to be honest."
2535,8,Better than force awakens!!!,Just not boring.<br /><br />The thing that I didn't like is the Chinese actress.
2536,2,Incredible movie,"This movie is incredible, not only does it destroy a franchise better than any Deathstar, it even has the greatest fight sequence in the history of cinema.Rey kicks 3 expert fighters with one kick and these expert fighters are so good at fighting that they do spins for no reason what so ever, they even go so far as to block each others strikes in order to make the fight more equal. I cannot stress enough how much this fight made me laugh, at some point i even wondered if this was a kung fu movie from the 80's."
2537,10,What is wrong with everyone?! Amazing Movie!,"The Last Jedi kicks off right where the force awakens concludes with the mystery of Luke Skywalker on the island world of Ahch-To. First off where the Last Jedi picks up is made beautifully clear by the opening crawl setting perfectly what we want and need to see, even my girlfriend who isn't an avid Star Wars fanatic found everything to be explained. We start off with a purely magnificent action piece, the space battle includes so much of what we haven't seen before in a Star Wars movie. We have in depth looks at the resistance fighters and their fear of the First Order. As well as the First Order understanding the potential the Resistance has against them, also the comedy in this piece as well as the rest of the film is perfect."
2538,10,Was a lot better than previous one,It was a lot better than the previous one. I would say it was more artistic some nice shots And it does fit the overall story of the Star Trek but where were the Klingons ^^
2539,10,"IN WITH EXCEPTIONS, SAD COME OUT, YOU WILL...",Giving this film 10 stars due to the fact that the film was GREAT AND there are multiple people giving one star reviews.
2540,1,C'mon Disney :(,Light spoilers...
2541,9,This is the movie that you are looking for,"First of all, this movie is a 100 times better than the Force Awakens, it aint perfect.<br /><br />There were some useless scenes and some bad jokes. But great twists, beautiful acting, brillant space scenes, stunning lightsaber fights."
2542,3,Has it come to this?,"If the movie held up in its own right, then I could almost forgive the character assassination of my childhood cinematic hero, Luke Skywalker."
2543,10,Why so much hate...,"This entry to the series perfectly blend so the original trilogy and the new Disney era of films. Many of the complaints are from the floating Leia and disappearance of Luke. In Empire, we learn that Leia can speak to Luke through the force, meaning she has it, so it's not out of the question that she can pull herself towards places using the force. Luke's disappearance, while strange, I believe was necessary. As we've learned, sadly the stars won't live forever. The movie perfectly sets up upcoming films that are soon to follow."
2544,10,"If you are a true fan, you will love this film!","Utterly fantastic from start to end, the last jedi is a stunning, fresh movie that has everything you could possibly want in a Star Wars movie. This keep me guessing and surprised the entire 2 and 1/2 hours, and it never lets its pace up for a second. Ones of the best movies of the decade. Period."
2545,10,Astonishingly good,Mesmerising from the first moment to the last. The way they introduced nuance and conflict into Luke Skywalker was excellent. Pushed the boundaries of the core idea of a universe saviour but stayed the right side of that. The demise of Luke and the hoodwinking of Red was brilliant.
2546,2,Could any of these actors carry sitcom or High School Play?,"Mark Hamill ... Really one dimensional,type cast as Luke forevere <br /><br />Carrie Fisher ... Looked like she was out of rehab..ahh physically rehab<br /><br />Adam Driver ... Really?...Darth Vader the 2nd.That was the best that Disney could do for a personal friend of a friend at the expense of fandom.<br /><br />Daisy Ridley ... Attacks the camera with frenetic mugging.<br /><br />John Boyega... Jar Jar minstrel show<br /><br />Where's the next Denzel Washington?<br /><br />Oscar Isaac ... Who?<br /><br />Poe Dameron...Who?<br /><br />Andy Serkis ... Who?<br /><br />Lupita Nyong'...Token short Asian chick banging down relationship racial doors."
2547,10,Honestly? Screw the haters.,"I'm personally gonna just give this movie the rating it deserves. I adored it more than anything. I laughed at the Porg shenanigans, Yoda's entire presence made me burst into laughter at certain points (mostly the fact that he burned the tree because Luke was too chicken), and I sobbed like a baby. I cried when Luke said goodbye to Leia, when his robes dissapeared, and during the final dedication to our late Princess Leia. It doesn't matter if the movie had ""too many female characters"" or ""ruined the Star Wars movies."" If you're a die hard fan of the original trilogy, then don't see it. If you're open minded and like to see something with a little more spice and a little more variety while staying true to a specific universe and theme, then by all means, go see/buy the movie. It's phenomenal. And to all the haters, I say a hearty ""screw off."" The movie was amazing, and it doesn't matter what your fanboy rage has to say about it. Give the new trilogy a chance for a change. Who knows? It may even surpass the originals."
2548,1,Why,I don't understand why rian Johnson hates star wars so much? Like really! Why?
2549,9,Fan service be gone!,I'll keep this short and sweet.
2550,10,Perfect for me,"I watched yesterday wih my wife , It was a fantastic movie i've ever seen , well especially when the star plane crashed with the speed of light and made it divided into two. Best Star wars series for me."
2551,10,CONFUSING,"There is no doubt that fans will recognise and relate to the Star Wars universe but the story is very confusing. Watching all the Star Wars movies, you would be able to describe the story in one line that would relate to the title. This one does not seem to have sense of purpose. <br /><br />You get the feeling that is main objective is to create a transition from the old to the new and lay the foundations for a new Star Wars series and opportunities to create spinoffs. In the process they forget to tell a story - which I believe film making should be all about. <br /><br />They also break the flow of everything that was set in motion in the episode, The Force Awakens:<br /><br />The promise of a new lead that takes over Luke in the first series and Anakin in the second. Rey that was such a powerful character in The Force Awakens seems to have lost her clout in the second. The love plot fizzles out. We see no remnants of the Republic that was supposed to have flourished after return of the Jedi. The training of Rey is nothing compared to that of Luke in the Empire strikes back and does not have the many spiritual layers that were laid. <br /><br />Then they introduce so many elements that do not deliver on their promises, the code breaker, the dark level of Luke's planet, the vestige of the Jedi, the planet promised to be special where the rebellion goes to take refuge. <br /><br />The film is good form but lacks in substance. I would agree with the critic who says ""I am not sure if I saw a good film of a bad one."""
2552,1,S(tar) J. W(ars): The Mary Sue Jedi,"After some time i have to make a point. I see a 7,3 as total rating. Yet almost every single written review on here shows how much people hate this movie. Only one conlcusion, bots dont write reviews."
2553,8,A welcome addition,"The Last Jedi takes what has been established and expands it further. This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, there are call backs to previous Star Wars films, you should go definitely watch this movie. lmao at you crybabies on here whining about this movie."
2554,3,What was this?,"So first something about me. I saw all the movies, I like the books, I even whatched rebels and I played maybe games from Star Wars. So for me it is difficult to look at these new movies. The story is different then I am used to."
2555,8,WHAT A MOIVE!,"So here we go, this is going to be my review of The Last Jedi. "
2556,10,Perfect,"Top movie making and story telling. Emotional with real heart felt fun in just the right places. A tip of the hat to the great star wars film before (Empire) while moving onward to a few generation and new ""hope"". To bad the people and so called professional ""critics"" can't see past their stupidity and see what this film was doing. Thankfully these people don't make films... well those that can do... and those that can't become dumb critics. I fart in your generation direction critics - this film is perfect. Period."
2557,9,Star wars: Os Últimos Jedis,"I loved the movie. One of the most daring of the Saga. Instead of opting for SAME OLD BALL RECIPE OF THE SEVEN MOVIES, they have created something new and totally welcome for the series."
2558,4,A wasted opportunity,"This movie achieved nothing except the character assassination of Luke Skywalker. The only feelings it evoked in me was bewilderment, anger and boredom. Mostly boredom."
2559,10,Fans need to stop being so butthurt,"Honestly, this movie was fantastic. Don't get me wrong, it was OUTRAGEOUSLY different from the other 7 movies (8 if you count Rogue One) but it was really really good! The plot line was scarce, there was a lot more comedy than expected, but it was still a great visual experience and I still give it a 10/10. No movie can ever be worse than Phantom Menace, and this was honestly great. "
2560,1,So bad,"No words, it's really bad. The old movies were much better."
2561,10,What a bunch of whiners!,"Well, I have been a fan for most of my life as well, but I went to a great movie yesterday. I watched a Galaxy become complacent and the punishment for that complacency! And, as with all of the great Star Wars movies, saw the light of hope in a few. "
2562,9,The First Order strikes back / Shut up haters!,"While episode seven was a modern remake of episode four. The 8th installment of the movie series is just loosely oriented on episode five (""The Empire Strikes Back"") and add a lot of now ideas - in visuals and in storytelling."
2563,8,It was an ok movie.,"I am not going to exaggerate and give rating like 10 or 1. I vote 8 because this is my overall impression. Then,again I think episodes 1 to 3 were the best, while most viewers disagree, but that's just me.<br /><br />And I totally agree about removing Han Solo And Luke Skywalker from the story.Han Solo and Luke Skywalker had to go sometime. Get over it"
2564,1,A dump on star wars,I'll start off with what I like but it's a pretty shorts list. The soundtrack and VFX are some of the best in the series and Adam Driver and John Bodega did an amazing job. However this movie is a dump on the name of Star Wars. The whole movie was the most boring movie I ever watched. They turned Luke Skywalker in to an old hermit who attempted to murder a child even though he was the same person who believed that there was still good in Darth Vader. Then there is the most boring chase in cinematic history. And the Mary Pop-ins Leia scene. An the 2 worst parts Rey and Rose. Rey is an overall annoying character that magically knows how to do everything immediately as she tries. And Rose was fine until she stops Finn from stoping the canon and says love is how you stop a war I swear my brains cells died in that moment.
2565,9,Unquestionably the best Star Wars movie.,"Interesting, funny, subversive, engaging, beautifully shot, bizarre, mysterious. Unafraid to subvert the source material. It's a fresh take on Star Wars but continues the best traditions of the series. It questions tropes and is the only Star Wars film that feels like actual cinema. The best Star Wars film, by a long shot. Similar to andor it treats the audience as adults that can understand meta-themes and recontextualize Star Wars into contemporary cultural perspective. The action scenes are simply excellent. Character development is subtle and complex, as it is with actual people. It's brave enough to throw off the vestiges of the past for a brave new perspective."
2566,1,What the hell is this film?,"Honestly. A superman-version of Princess Leia, a cheap Chinese-red backdrop for a certain battle scene (Don't worry. I won't mention any more details), a severely out of character Luke, a useless skirmish within the rebels just to fill up another half-an-hour, and terrible... I MEAN TERRIBLE acting by Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux. Honestly. Is George Lucas teaching Domhnall Gleeson how to act? I know he's a good actor as seen in other films such as Ex Machina, but in this film, he was worse than a Craigslist hire or a cheap amateur porn star actor on Brazzers. What the hell is wrong this this film... all I can say is, smh..."
2567,8,Hear me out...,"Let me start out by saying that The Last Jedi is flawed. The whole Canto Bight arc is pointless and way too drawn out, Snoke was a disappointment, Rey is OP, Finn is a wasted character, and don't even get me started on how much I hate Rose.<br /><br />With that being said, I really appreciate this movie. Coming after TFA, which is essentially a remake of A New Hope, I believe Star Wars needed something new, surprising, and interesting. For this reason, I respect the leap of faith Rian Johnson took."
2568,9,One of the best movies in the Star Wars Saga,An excellent movie with lots of twists and turns. This movie is a bit different from the traditional Star Wars saga so far and has expanded the reach & nature of The Force now. There are endless possibilities now in the 9th part - the director has opened up various results now.
2569,10,why millennials? why?...,"I have 3 things to say before I dare to review this title: 1.- I'm not a good critic, I happen to like mostly every movie I watch. 2.- My critique here goes to a sector that I'm kind of identified with, wich are the millenials, 3.- English is not my native language, so I probably (and as you probably know by now) have many mistakes in the writting process.<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why this movie failed so big in the public's eye... I search so much, every critique I could read and watch, and none of them made any sense to me. I even happened to have the experience of people around me that get out of the theatre as they have experienced the most incredible movie, even some of them saying that it was ""the best SW movie since Empire"", wich I remember it sounded very pretentious to me, but even so, my experience happened to be very similar. Those same people, a couple of days later, were reviewing the movie as ""the worse that happaned to their lives""... and I couldn't understand... why people is so far away from their real feelings, sensations, and experiences?... why is it so important to have a similar opinion with the rest of the intelectual sector? I totally agree that there must be a group of people that simply don't like the movie, didn't enjoy it, didn't make sense to them, that's OK. But I don't understand why some people must get rid of their emotional-sensorial-magical experience, just to acquire a sense of belonging, a membership to something that i don't catch it's importance yet... a millennial type thing, that is mostly OK, but I have to say, just sometimes, it simply bothers me that need to be smart by being unsatisfied."
2570,1,A Bold New Low,"Wow. Just, wow."
2571,10,Everything I never knew I always wanted from a Star Wars movie,"The Last Jedi continues the Meta-Narrative set-up by its predecessor The Force Awakens by being just as much about a new generation of characters continuing the legacy of Star Wars as the films themselves are being made by a new generation of filmmakers continuing the legacy of Star Wars. But while The Force Awakens was about trying to live up to and recapture that legacy, The Last Jedi is about learning to move on from it and become your own thing while still respecting the original legends that inspired you in the first place. Characters are given fascinating and unique story arcs that manage to subvert expectations while still delivering thematically satisfying conclusions. The story explores aspects of the Star Wars universe that I never really thought about before, but now want to see get explored more in dozens of new stories. The central mythos and themes of the franchise are questioned, deconstructed, subverted, reaffirmed, and ultimately brought to an expansive new level. It perfectly balances radical new ideas and creative filmmaking techniques with traditional Star Wars filmmaking style and franchise trappings. And more than anything else, it makes me excited to see this cinematic space opera continue to evolve over dozens of new stories released for decades to come. What more can anyone ask for from a new Star Wars movie?"
2572,1,A slap in the face,If you like star wars don't watch this. It ruins everything.
2573,9,"Met my expectations, seriously dont get all the low reviews.","I really enjoyed this one, kept me on my toes the entire time. They didn't go where most people predicted and that was fine with me. I don't understand all these complaints. I mean sure there are some scenes that may not be for everyone but the amount of back lash is really over the top. This was a well written and very entertaining movie, see actual professional critic reviews praising it. I know they are not always right but coming from people who rate movies for a living and know what to look for in good movies, i would listen to them over a bunch of folks who just want something to complain about. This board is also littered with the most absurd complains on the force awakens too so no matter how this movie was done you wouldn't be able to please everyone."
2574,10,Amazing,Last Jedi captures the true essence of Star Wars while breathing new life into the Saga.
2575,8,SpoilerFreeFilmReviews for Star Wars The Last Jedi,"In some respects, reviewing this film seems like a waste of time because the whole franchise is Marmite. (For my non-UK readers, Marmite is a strong, yeast based spread which ""You either love it or hate it"" and nothing will change your views).<br /><br />I freely admit to being a hard-core fan since I was in New York when the first film opened as saw it on Times Square in its first week.<br /><br />After seeing this tale from the series, I was left feeling conflicted. There is something missing from the spirit of the film, which I think I have identified.<br /><br />What is present is an atmosphere of foreboding. Part of this is the realisation that Carey Fisher will not be in any further films, but also that the story is losing itself in a circle of plot clichés.<br /><br />So what is missing? Joy. <br /><br />The simple, innocent joy, that in the eternal fight of good vs evil, knowing that good will always be triumphant. <br /><br />The more complex joy of confidence that evil will always loose. <br /><br />Finally, the joy of love and laughter."
2576,1,should have stopped with3,"With each new""saga"" disney proves it cant match the originals. but crafty number juggling makes it all better, yes?"
2577,9,This is a good movie,"All these reviews are just insane. This was a good movie and people just want to over analyze it and tear it down. It CAN""T relive your childhood memories and it can't live up to them either. Sorry but that is not how it works. "
2578,1,I ain't buy that 7.0,I hardly endured this movie on the cinema between falling asleep and raging over my lost time and money. Almost ALL comments scored less than 3.. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE IT HAS A 7.0!!??
2579,9,Can't believe all these 1 star reviews on here,I genuinely can't get my head around the amount of hate on this review page. 
2580,8,What a mess of opinions we have here,"A lot of Star Wars fans appear to be very upset about this film, mainly because they do not like how this is different from previous films in the franchise. In the words of Darth Sidious, ""Ironic"". After The Force Awakens angered some fans for not being original enough, The Last Jedi angers even more because of the bold choices made by writer/director Rian Johnson. "
2581,9,one of the best star wars movie of all better than the force of awakens,"This movie has a genius plot to it and i dont know why people have issues to it since luke hasnt really died in the end of the movie though, he was in the spirit world with the other jedi's for something that he has to do though"
2582,1,"A very disappointing movie in terms of Production, Directing, Editing and Storytelling","How should I describe this movie without feeling a traumatic headache at the end..?<br /><br />As I write this review, 6 months have already passed so I will not consider anything written as a spoiler at this point in time.<br /><br />The Last Jedi was a horrible movie by and large in every aspect of movie making. In this review, I will describe the different movie directing and editing aspects, as well as the story aspects."
2583,9,Everyone calm down,"All the star wars ""purists"" had their feathers ruffled, but this was a great movie for a new generation. The force is evolving, as it should, and this movie kept itself from being stale. The laughs were well placed, the characters have good dialogue and development and I was truly surprised and thrilled by some of the twists and turns. I love the oldies. I recently watched 4,5 and 6, but... they are old. They probably aren't as perfect as you remember. They were good and we loved them, but don't let your sentiment keep you from enjoying the new and evolving installments. They are good, really good, and they bring a great series back to life in a fresh way while staying true to great characters, classics good versus evil and some cutting edge visuals! Enjoy :)"
2584,2,Worst StarWars movie so far,The plot didn't make sense in any way and it felt more like a stand alone movie than a sequal. None of the mysteries from TFA were resolved and they turned Luke into a nihilist who didn't care for anything or anyone. There's no cliffhanger ending. Just a status quo that left me indifferent and not caring for what happens in episode 9.
2585,9,Ignore the Haters! Worth a watch!,"To be frank, when I walked out of the movie theater, I felt none of the negative emotions that so many of these other reviewers seem to have. I thought it was well-written, intriguing, and had excellent character development, with many interesting twists and turns and a new character that I liked. "
2586,8,Luke Triumphs,"I saw TLJ before reading any reviews. A few acquaintances had recommended it with the stipulation that the story ""takes risks"" and ""doesn't hold back"". This of course had me intrigued, plus the fact that the audience score was rather low for a SW movie (the lowest of all SWs in fact, as far as I can tell, save for The Clone Wars). And so finally after the nearly 3 hour viewing at my local AMC in a recliner chair pressed against the screen in the front row corner seat, I walked out of the theater very satisfied, smiling from ear to ear. Then a few days later I came here to read the audience reviews."
2587,10,the best ever star wars movie,"This was the best Star Wars movie ever made. The plot was interesting, full of surprise, interesting turns and logic. The movie creates interest at the very first battle. Battle scenes... battles scenes were elaborated, every detail well-developed and full of emotion and logic, in the meantime. Music was fascinating, as in all previous movies. Daisy Ridley was at her high, very good play, even though the play by Felicity Jones in 2016 was better."
2588,1,I will never again pay to see a Star Wars movie!!,20 Euro thrown out the window...wish i had burned them...would be such a better investment with the heat generated.
2589,,"(Spoilers)A Refreshing, Better Star Wars On The Right Track","My wife and I won free tickets to the prescreening. I was excited to see where this journey would take us next! I loved the relationship that was shown between Kylo Ren and Rey, the fight scene when Snoke was killed and the impressive last battle scene! The movie wasn't perfect but A New Hope had Lea and Luke kissing so I don't expect perfect Star Wars movies. I thought there was too much forced humor. They need to get away from that. It's not necessary but it no way destroyed what this movie was about!"
2590,8,"A lot, but I want more.",SMITHERS OF IMPRESSIONS 
2591,1,Worst film I've ever seen,"I actually wanted to cry because I can't believe they did this to the franchise, especially after The Force Awakens was so good. There are SO many things wrong with this film, a multitude of plot holes and weird things that happened uncharacteristically. Here is a small list:"
2592,9,Very surprised at the reviews I am reading. I loved this movie.,"I have been a Star Wars fan since the 70's. Watched the movies a ridiculous amount of times, books, video games, comics you name it. This movie (as did Rouge One) stayed in the Star Wars realm but was DIFFERENT. That is something that is lacking in movies. This movie broke tradition while honoring it, took chances, and tried to go in new directions. Is not that what makes great art? Please don't read the rest if you haven't seen it as I will discuss spoilers "
2593,10,"A new perspective, which is needed.",*Spolier Warning*
2594,10,Love,Thank you Rian Johnson for letting us see the layers of Kylo ren and raising the emotional stakes - I HOPE KYLO HAS A HAPPY ENDING!!!
2595,1,Don't watch it,"This ""Star Wars"" film was absolute garbage. The Fantom Menace was a better film than this, and I didn't like that one either."
2596,10,Simply amazing,"With a story that makes you await for the next plot scene and surprises in events, Episode VIII makes me feel like a kid in 80's."
2597,1,... What the hell happened!?,"I just don't know what to say. This Star Wars movie might actually be the worst of the lot. No this isn't ""Empire Strikes Back of its time"" syndrome, this is a genuinely awful movie... And it has some of the best talent assembled. I'm not kidding, this had a solid director along with a dream cast... What the hell happened!? I don't fully know if it was pushed by some stupid agenda (many quote Producer Kathleen Kennedy for that reason which sadly holds incredible weight), if it was the wrong director for the job or what but this movie is just BAD! I felt both wounded and insulted after watching this movie, the same way I felt wounded and insulted after Transformers 2; Revenge of the Fallen. After reading that, you must be wondering why I am saying all of this... Well, here we go."
2598,8,a welcome return to the thematically challenging and irrevocable story turns of the original trilogy,"The Last Jedi is easily my favorite Star Wars film outside of the original trilogy (I'm a huge OT fan). When I saw the disparity between the glowing professional reviews and the damning fan reviews I expected to side with those who hated the film but in the end I thought the good FAR outweighed the bad. Yes, it suffered from lots of cringe inducing over-the-top moments, some generic Marvel-esque production values at points, and 45 minutes of distracting subplot, but it's core (the other 105 minutes which contained the major plot points) was magic, the simple and elegant story of Luke Skywalker and his two students, one representing momentous regrets and the other representing the possibility of redemption. "
2599,8,Now that is how you make a movie!,"So, that happened."
2600,10,People are dumb,"Writing this just to combat the people who still haven't gotten over themselves about an greatly made, written and produced film that came out over 2 years ago now."
2601,3,Episode -0 - The Last Star Wars Movie.,"OK, this movie wasn't ALL bad. The cinematography is amazing. I enjoyed the scenes with ""Luke"", mostly, even though I agree with everyone who says it was a huge misuse of the character. Everyone who says it was original is dead wrong. (Rebel base discovered, which leads to a long chase through space, where a scoundrel betrays our heroes, while the young protagonist gets trained by a wise old Jedi culminating in a duel with the Bad Guy who makes a big reveal. Uhg - seriously?) Mark Hamill (Not really Luke.) makes a good, dramatic exit. Easily an hour could have been cut (the absurd side-plot) and I wouldn't have nearly fallen asleep watching this. I am annoyed that Johnson didn't follow the original arc of the story, but I could say the same about Abrams. Did they have a plan for these movies at all?? It sure doesn't seem like it. Lucas may be a terrible director/ writer, but he's an incredible ideas guy - he probably should have been listened to as far as the original story was conceived. The Force Awakens was executed fairly well, but it also had huge problems, so ultimately this trilogy can not be fixed, no matter what they end up doing with IX. (Maybe a scene where Luke wakes up and it was all a bad dream? I'd take that.)"
2602,10,For Star Wars fans it's a must,Awesome movie. Looks like people can't accept something different little now.
2603,1,"Absolute garbage, a literal stain on an American Cultural touchstone","As someone who grew up with Star Wars and has an open mind about things and realizes that nothing lasts forever, this movie is an absolute pile of trash. I actually really liked The Force Awakens so this isn't an old man hates new things rant. Let me head off all the lazy defenders of this catastrophe: I don't have an issue with a female protagonist. I don't have an issue with a visually diverse cast. I have an issue with stupid plotting, stupid writing and a complete and utter failure to understand what makes Star Wars successful. It's not special effects, it's not light sabers, it's not cornball jokes, it's not space ships. What makes Star Wars special is it's simplicity of telling an epic story of good overcoming massive obstacles to defeat evil. The Last Jedi is a total violation of everything that makes Star Wars special. You have basically a checklist of marketing and identity politics concepts thrown into a space movie with no regard for plotting, structure, writing or directing. Characters make stupid and nonsensical decisions. Established characters do things that completely fly in the face of their previous portrayals. Example: Luke abandoning his friends. That's literally not Luke Skywalker. Even Mark Hamill knows this. Things happen that completely ignore the rules of the universe that have been established through 7 other films. Examples: You can't use hyperspace to run into things. Force ghosts aren't capable of altering the physical world. Spacecraft don't run out of fuel. You don't ""drop"" bombs in space. The Force does not protect you from the vacuum of space. The Millennium Falcon does not teleport. And the worst thing of all is that at the end of the movie there is nothing, I mean nothing there to bring you any kind of sense of joy or enrichment. There is nothing to excite you about another movie because The Last Jedi broke Star Wars. I saw it twice to make sure I was seeing the same things over again and not imagining it. It has taken something from me that had an big influence on my life and defiled it. It's an absolute disgrace and it absolutely broke my heart."
2604,9,"Thoroughly enjoyed, not willing to standby and see it rubbished","I usually just rate my films, but I couldn't believe what I saw when I read all the negative reviews on imdb for this film so felt the need to come in with a different perspective."
2605,9,It's a Love/Hate relationship,"You'll either love it or hate it. Not much middle ground. I loved it because it was fresh and new. Lots of surprises and I loved the humor. It wasn't a ""Space Opera"" this time around and that's why the die hard Star Wars fans will hate it. The inner nerd in me still wants to know where Snoke came from and Abrams will probably address that in the next one. It's ironic how the last Star Wars had all the ""Star Wars"" die hards saying how much it was a copy of ""A New Hope"" and now they're whining that a truly original story has ruined their universe. In the words of Willam Shattner, ""Get A Life!"". This was pure fun and a very entertaining film!"
2606,8,Star Wars man,If you like star wars movies you should watch this one and i like this movie a lot and if you like action this has a lot of it and the story of star wars is very good and the characters a very good to and i found no problem with the movie and the beginning and end of the movie were very good and also the rest of the movie to. :)
2607,1,How to turn a Billion $ IP into a multi million $ IP...,"This movie was horrible, so bad I couldn't watch the so-called Rise of Skywalker, especially since there are no Skywalkers left, Leia was never a Skywalker, and her kids are named SOLO."
2608,8,Ignore the trolls,"Lots of nonsense reviews here (anyone rating this film as 1/10 needs to take a cold bath, I'm guessing you haven't seen any real one star films). <br /><br />It's a genuinely thrilling ride this time around, Some awkwardly jarring humour which seems out of place but the franchise needs to progress. 8/10"
2609,4,Mehhhhhh,"I expect so much from a Star Wars movie this one was predictable, Harry Potter-ish ( I'm a harry potthead but I certainly don't want the type for Star Wars), Under developed characters and just plain mehhhh...."
2610,9,Contriversal,Cinematography was phenomenal and I loved the visual effects. The acting was great and I enjoyed how some parts were unexpected too. However some parts were not true to what Star Wars is and there may have been too much comedy. There are many great visual metaphors though.
2611,10,For true Star Wars fans,"The Last Jedi has plenty of surprises, twists, and amazing action that you could ever want in a Star Wars film. No offense, but those who didn't like this movie are not true Star Wars fans."
2612,,Has Hollywood issued a new film in the lastd ecade where women were not the leads?,"Star Wars (so-called this crap isn't Star Wars), Star Trek, Annihilation, Mad Max, X-Men, Ghostbusters, Atomic Blonde and Oceans *. Even the last so-called Thor movie had a woman bossing Thor around and kicking his read end (but don't worry Thor found his inner stand up comic side)."
2613,10,Enjoyed every minute of it,"Enjoyed every minute of it. A great adventure. I don't understand why people have decide to troll this movie, but I guarantee this is not a bad movie. On the contrary, it's quite amazing and enjoyable."
2614,1,There is something rotten in Hollywood.,"Unfortunately this is what I expect form big budget action blockbusters now.<br /><br />Lots of action and CGI. Plot, story, script, characters these seem to not matter in the slightest.<br /><br />The Hollywood marketing corporate machine has worked out how to make lots of money basically from special effects and CGI, not much else seems to be required.<br /><br />In this case just stick Star Wars on any generic thoroughly mediocre sci-fi drivel and the audience will hand over their money. As others have noticed the glowing so-called critic reviews seem highly suspect for such an awful film.<br /><br />I was actually hoping the bad guys would win and eliminate the nauseating scooby do Disney goodies and put an end to this shlock, alas it was not to be they survived.<br /><br />Actually I find it quite fascinating just how abysmal these films can get. The next one will have to work hard to be worse than this but I feel confident they can do it lol."
2615,9,Dont believe the hate!,"I usually don't review films, however seeing the hate this great Star Wars movie received I just want to say that if you understand Star Wars you will love this film."
2616,1,An absolute offense to fans,"This is my first ""review"" ever on IMDb because I just had tot tell how bad this movie is."
2617,10,A cinematic wonder,"After J.J Abrams eased fans back into the franchise with the force awakens, Rian Johnson delivers what could take possibly be the best instalment in the Star Wars saga. As the credits rolled the cinema I was sat in sat in a stunned silence at the pure brilliance of this film. It contains everything that makes Star Wars great whilst bringing a fresh take on the new universe. Gritty action scenes and magnificent dialogue brought together by stellar performances from the cast, past and present, have crafted not just the best star wars film but also one of the best films period"
2618,10,A great sequel that does a great job at both borrowing from the previous movies and bringing something new,"I understand many people who were disappointed after watching Episode VIII. There were some wtf moments, like Leia not dying in an open space and using the Force to drag herself back to the ship. Snoke is completely wasted as a character. However, it was a great and surprising plot twist that made possible for every major character to die. The plot and small romance thing between Fin and that girl is just not satisfying. Also, some moments were a little bit childish, but they had to do it to approach greater audiences."
2619,10,I don't get it.,"It seems like a lot of have big problems with the movie.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong the movie isn't perfect, but no movie is. The movie is DAMN good though, and according to me, one of the best star wars movies, including the original. That takes a lot for me to say."
2620,1,Complete disrespect to 40 years of Canon,"Not a Russian bot. Just a human being that absolutely hated every story choice in this film. This being said, it was very pretty but one of the most disrespectful and careless films in any franchise ever. This was not Star Wars. This was a joke."
2621,10,"Second best Star Wars movie I've seen (after the first Episode 4, that is) - which I was fortunate to see the 1st night of its release in 1977","Who knew then what Star Wars would become, what an inpact on movies, culture, (merchandising) and, unfortunately how film has become considered a commodity as opposed to an art. Thank goodness for the rise of smaller, independent studios. (But can anyone clear this up for me. How does Disney, alreadt owners of The Muppets, LucasFilm and the Marvel Movies NOT have a conflict of intrerest I acquiring Fox Programming,"
2622,4,It adds nothing to the larger story,This is a very open and shut movie. Plot lines that were laid in the previous movie aren't really resolved or expanded on as much a brutally severed and it fails to create any new ones for the final part of the trilogy.
2623,9,LOVE THIS,I am a HUGE fan of thunder thighs and thick calves and this delivers BIG time. Any real man likes women with MASSIVE bellies and fat legs and The Last jedi is eye candy therefore.
2624,10,Best movie of all time,Best movie of all time.I can't believe people hate it .I watched the movie 12 times (and I'll watch again)and I still enjoy the movie.I think if you didn't like it you aren't a real fan.
2625,8,"Not what I expect, which is a good thing.","Should put more backstory on Snoke. Luke's final appearance at the end was EPIC and deceiving. Overall I enjoyed it, although lots of lingering questions remain."
2626,1,The Last Jedi is a nightmare ...that you can't wake up from,I watched the Last Jedi 3 times at the theater because I wanted it to change ..I had hope that each time I saw it I would find something to like but each time it got worse and worse. The old characters are treated with so much disrespect and the endless jokes are so annoying. The new characters seem like they have moved into the Twilight zone and for some reason in a few hours or days they have had a complete personality change from interesting to zero. R Johnson has created an atrocity This will be the only Star Wars movie that I won't be buying EVER .. Don't waste your money and time on TLJ Order a pizza and watch the prequels or the original episodes the rest is trash ...sorry
2627,9,Let it sink before judging!,This is my first review on this site simply because I'm surprised about the backlash this movie gets on here.
2628,1,Everything that's wrong with blockbusters today - all flash and no substance,Hello All! 
2629,10,Bold new steps,"I felt compelled to create an account and write a review on here following the negative backlash this film has received. To put things into context, I've been a die hard Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I still have Dark Forces II and Republic Commando installed on my laptop, and yes, I still watch Star Wars Rebels. That being said, I still recognize and criticize the flaws I see. The prequels are nostalgic to me and I still love parts of them, but overall they're hugely flawed, from script to acting to an abundance of poor CGI. Rogue One was great, yet lacking in any real semblance of character development or depth and TFA was just a rehash of A New Hope. I was then surprised to see the reception this film has got from other lifelong fans of the series, who like me criticized the cliched path TFA took. It surprised me, because this film did the complete opposite. Johnson has given us a film that's gone against the now predictable formula of the films before it. Spoilers follow as I feel they're necessary to convey the way I felt about this film. I've seen the Last Jedi twice now and actually liked it even more the second time round. The shocking death of Snoke was a fantastic choice, it stopped us from having another Emperor Palpatine and portrayed the opportunistic and emotionally rooted Dark Side perfectly. Rey not having any famous parents is greater still, working brillianly in conjunction with one of the films many messages of trying to live up to a legacy. (I'm confused as to why everyone wanted the same story as the originals and the prequels again.) With regards to the plot, the film is about the characters themselves growing, and even though I agree that the Finn/ Rose plotline felt out of place on first viewing, I don't think that gives anyone any real justification to rate the film 1 or 2 stars out of 10. The characters in this film were done beautifully. Mark Hamill was amazing as Luke, a deeply flawed hero of sorts who regretted this one split second decision he thought about for a 'fleeting moment'. Ridley was much better than in TFA, playing this confused learner, 'trying to find her place in all this', drawing a lot of parallels with Luke in ESB. Driver was fantastic too, along with all of the other now familiar faces. The music was stunning, far better than TFA, my hat goes off yet again to John Williams. Hearing the Tie Fighter Attack music from a New Hope as Chewie slides the Falcon through the crystal caves of Crait gave me goosebumps. Everything was filmed beautifully, even the action scenes; a rare thing nowadays. The throne room scene has the best filmed action scene of any Star Wars film in my opinion; brutal fast paced and without the stupid spinning of the prequels. All in all the Last Jedi is my favourite film of the year. It had flaws in it's humour at points and I felt the Finn subplot could have been improved on, but everything from the acting, the directing, the script and the music to the beautiful send off for Luke was fantastic. I know you guys are all going to downvote this to oblivion, feel free to if it makes you feel better about yourself. Sorry for how long this was, thanks for reading."
2630,9,"It's 8,5 but let it stay 9. Movie has issues.","SWTLJ definitely has a different tone than rest of SW episodes.<br /><br />It is packed with a lot of action, but it also has a drag part (all summed around 30min) .<br /><br />It is clear to me now that Disney wants to ""slowly"" reboot the saga.<br /><br />I can't blame them tho.<br /><br />The force awakens was a letdown in a way, but I realised that that force awakens just sets the new tone for Star wars saga, and therefore I see FA from a different perspective now.<br /><br />I'm a fan, but not a fanboy, so I will try to clearly point out why the movie is good, and why it's bad."
2631,10,What the actual **** is with these bad reviews?!?,"A recommendation to die-hard SW fans... Watch the film once. Hold your review. See the movie again and try and watch the film for what it is, not what it isn't. What it is, is an AMAZING and challenging film."
2632,4,Even failed a second chance,I watched this in the cinema - and like most thought it was terrible. Didn't follow a lot of previous Star Wars law. And apart from certain cameos didn't really feel like Star Wars. More like cos play version with x wings and blasters.
2633,10,"Brilliant! Original, captivating!",Ignore the trolls and the bad reviews from the so called 'fan base' half of which were not even born at the time of the original trilogy... <br /><br />Don't read any of the spoilers - go and see it with open mind. Take it from an old fan that's seen all the star wars movies thousands of times. 
2634,1,Not written by star wars fans.,"This honestly could have been a great movie. But it was doomed from the beginning as the director did not have a grasp of the characters in play. Plus the general plot flawed with a scenario that would never happen, plus pointless side quests that take up a majority of the film. Big fail."
2635,8,"Film gets an 8, Rian Johnson, ZERO!!!","Of course the film looks great. They have the best in the world making sure of that. But Rian Johnson went out of his way to destroy everything the story/saga had going for it. And worse, was not only arrogant about the garbage he came up with, but had the audacity to blame people not liking it on them being crybaby fanboys rather than accepting hes a joke who has no business on any film set. Unless it's getting a real filmmaker coffee."
2636,10,"Despite some slight issues, still one of the best movies.","Really people? Saying you're not going to see another Star Wars movie? Get a life in all honesty. The fact that we're all still here seeing Star Wars movies literally 40 years after the original came out is evidence enough that we are all going to continue to accept anything that is thrown at us. And, in addition to that, we have lived through some pretty rough Star Wars moments: the ewoks. The special editions (don't even get me started on the song ""Jedi Rocks."" Also, Vader screaming ""NO"" as he throws the Emperor into the reactor shaft is one of the worst scenes in cinematic history. It literally killed the climax of the original trilogy). THE FREAKING HOLIDAY SPECIAL!!!!!! Ewok tv shows. The Phantom Menace. The abysmal CGI in Attack of the Clones. Anakin and Padme's romance. Padme dying from a broken heart. The Clone Wars movie (not the TV show. The show is incredible). We are going to live through all of these things, and yet people are still going to complain because they didn't like the explanation about Rey's parents or the fact that they made a new plot and Kylo Ren doesn't just come back to the light like Vader did, but instead kills his master and becomes an even greater villain than he already was. <br /><br />Is this movie perfect? Absolutely not, but what movie is. You can even look at some of the best rated movies of all time and they are not perfect. Did I love every second of this movie? Not entirely. Finn and Rose's story wasn't the best. Phasma still sucks. But, LUKE FREAKING SKYWALKER??? He literally did things with the force that no one had ever imagined was possible before! Crashing a rebel cruiser through a Star Destroyer at light speed? Such an incredible scene. The awesome WWII style bombers that take out the dreadnought are amazing. Rian Johnson, while not a perfect script writer, did an amazing job with this movie. In his defense, there are a lot of new characters in this new trilogy and he did a great job of trying to balance the old and the new.<br /><br />Finally, all of you naysayers are probably just the people who could only find one major complaint with The Force Awakens: it's similar to a New Hope. So your major complaint about a very well executed movie is that it's similar to literally the first blockbuster of which it is a sequel? Furthermore, you criticized the prequels for being too different. And for anyone who's saying it's a carbon copy of IV, I'd like to ask, ""Where's the second sun on Jakku? Where is this mystical missing Jedi that they're searching for in New Hope?"" The similarities are there, don't get me wrong, but they are 2 seperate movies. And can you blame Johnson for taking risks? Abrams got ripped apart for not being original enough. So Johnson does what people wanted and creates a new story that phases out the old Star Wars gradually while bringing in the new generation of heroes. This movie is incredible and anyone who tells you otherwise probably thinks that Hayden Christensen's line about sand is one of the finest moments in Cinema as well."
2637,8,Fresh take on the Star Wars universe,"This movie had a fresh take on the Star Wars universe. I specially liked the grey characters of the movie, and the grey themes of the movie. It was a fresh take. A fresh direction and sentiment that was getting established from the Clone Wars series onwards."
2638,1,"Nope, nope, and nope.","My family just got back from seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Some great ideas, but it's injected with Marvel-style humor, Disney-style merchandise masquerading as characters, and ultimately trashed by the worst kind of lazy writing. Not sure what the critics thought ""we"" needed, but this was not it. I've read many better comics and novels with most of the same characters, and now they've been rendered into ""myths and legends"" by a wave of the Disney hand, and replaced by this garbage."
2639,9,"As a lifelong fan, best yet.","Yes, I said it. Rian Johnson gave the finger to the fans, and I thank him for it. Get rid of the crummy nostalgia the last one rode on the back of. TFA wasn't bad, just wasn't great for me. Same story we have seen before. This one has humor, almost a bit much at first, but then tapers off a bit. It's a star wars movie to reach new fans, not to just try and keep a dying breed of fans. Faithful to star wars lore. Yes the jedi ""bible"" states you can force project for those powerful enough. As for no snoke development. . .did we see that with jaba the hut initially? did we see it for Boba Fett? No, but there was a mystique about the characters that kept our imaginations alive. I enjoyed the hell out of it. More I watch it, the less I see so called plot holes, that even myself picked out, and now see how interwoven it was. Maybe people are being too superficial expecting it to fill their fantasy of what they think it should look like, but now the story must change, and it will for the better. . .best I can do for early morning write up."
2640,1,I just wrote a random review so,I just wrote a random review because i liked a film.
2641,10,Fantastic Star Wars film reinvigorates franchise...,"The evolving relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is taken in a bold and unexpected direction, really fascinating and very well done, these two characters are the beating heart of the film. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley hit their performances out of the park."
2642,10,"Fantastic, funny and gripping","The acting is superb, the action and humor equally so, and there is not a dull moment in the film. There are some parts of the film that I feel could have been done better, but it is very much a great Star Wars movie none the less. The story also does not go where you think it will. "
2643,9,A proper ending.,This movie was more original than some of the previous plot lines. It wrapped up several story lines with true character development for both Kilo and Rey. It was campy at times and downright sappy and as a true fan I teared up a few times. I don't understand the negative comments. No way could anyone who saw this give it a single star. Typical trolls I would imagine. Enjoy it for what it is.
2644,2,Carry on Cosmos.,"Star wars the last jedi is one of the most sickeningly awful modern day movie cash ins of all time. Disney shamefully and explicitly destroy the Star Wars franchise with this installment, its 9th (including Rogue one) and most certainly MY last."
2645,10,"My Favorite Star Wars Film, and I have been watching all of them for 40 years.","I am not a die-hard fan that has read all of the books, so I can see why some would dislike this movie. It does have a Marvelesque feel to it, but the Marvel movies make tons of money and they also make people happy, so what's wrong with that?"
2646,1,Star Wars: Episode VIII - A Modern Mockery,"So many flaws it's hard to believe this movie actually got made, but I can't believe that some people actually like it when compared to George Lucas' work. This film gets so many thing wrongs when it comes to Star Wars. Star Wars has a certain feel, that this film just doesn't have, and everything that makes the series unique, and fun, this film emulates poorly or just turns a blind eye. They've made a mockery of a great film series, and they know fans will support it because of their love for the series, but Disney just doesn't have the direction to do it right. Instead they're thinking about what they can do that they can emulate and add rides to their dumb theme parks."
2647,10,I don't understand all the hate.,"Sure I had a few issues with the film, but overall it was a great movie with good plot progression and well choreographed action scenes. It even managed to completely surprise me three times which is a rare feature in movies these days. Overall I probably would have given it an 8.5, but I will give it a 10 to compensate for some of these haters who give it a 1 and no review."
2648,9,A very divisive movie... but I enjoyed it a lot! (SPOILERS!!!),Where to begin... 
2649,10,Great film for people who are not 90 yr old fans,"Not sure where there reviews come from? Oh wait...I do...from old Star wars fans who struggle to release their now arthritis soaked fingers from the past and move on.<br /><br />The whole three new generation of Star Wars movies were not trash in anyway, its just idiotic fans who complain when the story isnt new, complain when peoplentry something different, complain when theres no mixed gender, complain when there is, complain theres not enough fight scenes, complain when there is...."
2650,1,This movie is a disgrace,"It's what you get when you know nothing about the story of Star Wars and try to make a film out of childish images you saw once for 10 seconds. It completely destroys established characters like Luke Skywalker for no reason at all, other than to do produce a cheap drama for 10 seconds on the screen.<br /><br />Nobody should ever score this more than a 5/10 if they know anything about storytelling."
2651,8,"Much better than the prequels, why all the hatred??!!","As a life long Star Wars fan (my first VHS was ""Empire Strikes Back"" and yes, I can quote the entire movie!!) and after reading the plethora of poor reviews posted on these pages, I felt the necessity to contribute my first review on IMDb."
2652,5,Nothing left,Be aware - spoilers ahead.
2653,10,A movie that I'm going to rewatch a lot,For me it was one of the best Star Wars movies ever.
2654,9,Star Wars is back!,"First of all, if you gave a rich movie like this 1 star, it says more about you than anything else, please go away."
2655,8,"Not as bad as many make it out to be, it's a challenging film, a different, imperfect film.","First off, I do understand this film has issues and I will get into those first. However, overall, I like the majority of what this film does."
2656,1,The bad guys won.,The bad guys won. The bad guys won. The bad guys won.
2657,8,The Last Jedi Brings Hints of the Expanded Universe to Canon,"I went to the premiere of The Last Jedi with expectations that it would be very different, and it proved to be so. This movie is not like the Original Trilogy. Anyone who is wanting the Original Trilogy feel will be disappointed. Rian Johnson challenges viewers to ""let the past die"". This is the new Star Wars. "
2658,3,Not Star Wars,"Disappointed. Felt more like Star Trek and GOTG is too many places. Just a few good scenes but mostly a mess and a disappointment.<br /><br />Go watch episodes 4, 5, and 6. That's Star Wars, not this."
2659,8,More Questions than Answers,"As the subject line of my review indicates, the movie leaves a lot of things open, with no idea how it would get tied up."
2660,9,The Last Jedi is very impressive in different direction!,"I encourage you all to discharge those bad review about The Last Jedi, and see for yourself. I learned to appreciate Star Wars: The Last Jedi with different aspect and perception. I have been hardcore fan of Star Wars since it first released in 1977. This movie was not what I expected to see and expected to conform to what my theories is all about. This movie proved me wrong, I was surprise to see it take different direction and approaching in what it is take in next step for 9th episode. "
2661,10,Don't Believe the Negative Reviews,"I did not expect this film would satisfy any avid Star Wars fan, especially those whom believed that the film would be closure with grandeur. "
2662,1,If you value Star Wars dont see this movie,This movie is an epic fail on a massive scale. One of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. <br /><br />No plot no decent acting ( except a bit from Oscar Isaac ) 
2663,9,I love it!,I just loved it!<br /><br />Serious emotions in this movie. Well done Disney. Cheers.7
2664,2,So bad!,"The good : beautyfull to watch and hear<br /><br />The bad : characters, story, humour, twists, and a lot of things...."
2665,8,Could have done without a lot of the jokes but other than that I really enjoyed it.,"I don't understand the hate, esp. people saying they prefer the prequels to TLJ.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there're things I don't like but overall I really enjoyed the film, Luke most of all."
2666,9,It's an ok movie,"First of all, I'd like to point out what i like abou this movie. I loved Hamil as Luke, Del Toro as DJ and porgs. Everything else is up to debate. The runtime is too long and the movie isn't engaging enough to keep you paying attention. There are some subplots that erase every perception I've had about some characters in The Force Awakens, by which I mean if before going watching TLJ, I liked Rey, for example, and now I just don't care for her anymore. I think it's worth saying that there are many inconsistencies in the writting of ST characters in TFA and TLJ, whoch doesn't make sense given these movies span two-three days. <br /><br />As an addition, I loved porgs. They were a merchandising addition and it pains me to adimit that Dinsey has given them a more consistent treatment than any hero/villain in the movie. Without detailing any further, this movie feels like erasing in a bad manner any mistery/curiosity TFA has created in me. As someone who wasn't completely into TFA, TLJ worked to erase my desire to rewatch both these movies or the ninth installment of the saga, unfortunately. <br /><br />On a side note, don't waste your money in 3D if you can avoid. It's just not worth it!"
2667,9,"Coul'd someone remove ""Ordered By: Helpfulness""?","A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias, literally ""milky"", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass."
2668,1,Bloody Awful,"I love Star Wars. I really like the previous film. However, this, is NOT Star Wars. It's gone all disney/daytime tv. It's like the brainchild of Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift and Lorde when they were having a sleepover. I walked out before the end it was that bad."
2669,9,A risky and challenging film for Star Wars fans,"I decided to wait on writing my The Last Jedi review/rant until I saw the movie for a second time. I thought it was only fair to do it that way because I came out of The Last Jedi for the first time with a lot of different emotions, which is typically the case for every Star Wars film for me as a complete and utter fanboy for the Saga. I knew I liked the movie after my first viewing, but the movie was such a rollercoaster of emotions I had difficulty pinpointing the way I felt for sure. Did I love the movie? Was it better or worse than The Force Awakens? I adored nearly everything about The Force Awakens and came out of that movie instantly loving it. Upon my second viewing of TLJ, I discovered that I do indeed love the movie, despite its flaws. It isn't a perfect movie, but the shining moments of the movie are some of my favorite of the entire Star Wars Saga. "
2670,1,Dreadfully boring,"It's 2.5 hours of one ship moving slowly away from another ship, whilst mostly uninteresting things happen to people you don't care about in the background."
2671,10,"""Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.""","I seem to be one of the few Star Wars geeks, who enjoyed this totally new approach to the Star Wars saga. I found the movie excellent, the characters a lot more human and interesting than in the previous Star Wars films. <br /><br />The movie has so many layers to it... it is very different from all SW movies so far, a lot less pathos less myth, and it is being honest about it, does not try to cover itself behind the ""delusion of grandeur"". It starts with showing how weak heroes can be, and they make bad choices, but when they do the right thing they will become legend through their sacrifice. Then there is the concept that sometimes people do things totally useless due to misunderstanding, then there is disagreement and disobedience in the rebellion leadership (the strange thing is that there was none in the original trilogy). Heroes and villains are not perfect and all mighty, the force is not just black and white and I could continue. The burning of the Jedi scriptures and the tree, done by Yoda himself is the climax of this statement. You need to learn to let go. "
2672,,Stay As Far Far Away As Possible,"You don't need to read pages of reviews, this movie is terrible. no spoilers here, just suffice it to say it's a terrible Star Wars film, fans should stay 'far, far, away', and it's a pretty mediocre film in general. This is nothing but another Disney vehicle to make the quickest buck and to push an agenda, having 'Star Wars' attached to the title is practically incidental. There is nothing here whatsoever that will get you excited, either the critics are all high, or were paid very handsomely for their cooperation. This is a disaster, a joke, a slap in the face, not just to star Wars fans or to George Lucas, but to the art of film making itself, possibly to rational human thought. I can't imagine even small children enjoying this, and I would never subject my own children to something so completely bereft of any redeeming qualities."
2673,10,Not the Story I Expected And Better for It,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi wasn't the movie I expected, and I believe that this trilogy is better served for it. A lot of fan expectations were that this film would continue the call backs to the originals and fan service of Force Awakens, but these things don't make a lasting film franchise. <br /><br />It's difficult to argue why I lived this movie so much without spoilers, but I'll simply say that this film managed to combine character growth, new character introduction, with some great action and world building. The story sets up a future for Star Wars that doesn't ignore it's past but also doesn't depend on it for a compelling narrative. I enjoyed the movie so much that I went to see it again within days and will probably go again before it leaves theaters.<br /><br /> --My only real critique is that the 3D picture quality was poor. (Though that may have been the fault of my local theater so I didn't bump down my rating for it.)"
2674,9,New generation,"People just don't understand. Are they expecting to see the same thing of the old movies or a remake? Original actors are old, so is time to introduce others, and continue the saga. Everything evolves, but the force remains the same. Before hating the movie try to accept the end of the old characters... nothing is eternal. I hope the producers won't fell unmotivated about so many haters. It's time to move on and continue with Start Wars. I can imagine infinite ways of continuing the story from the end of this movie. Open your eyes people."
2675,3,A Grand Charmless Mess,"No charm, and a jumbled superficial grand mess. Harrison Ford played a handsome rogue, and, like Sean Connery as Bond, the story was rounded with a bit of wry wit. Here, the attempts at comedic relief and wit are misplaced and rough."
2676,10,Negativity is By Far Unfounded,"I absolutely adored this movie, and I think by far it is my favorite in the entire franchise. For me, the negativity is SOOO unfounded. By no means this movie is perfect, and every movie has plot holes including the original saga, but that didn't stop people from rating other movies a 1. And especially the worst part about the majority of negative reviews is that most of them say how they walked out of the theater. How are you supposed to rate a movie if you don't even see the ending?!?!?!?!? The Force Awakens didn't do anything but repeat the original trilogy, and got heavily criticized for it, and now The Last Jedi does something unique and original, and you all are still is complaining!?!?!? These negative reviews are coming from people who went into the theater expecting a repeat of the Empire Strikes Back, and when they didn't see any similarities started to cry because it wasn't how they wanted Star Wars to go. Guess What??? Its a new generation, and its time for something new to take place! Don't have expectations of whats going to happen, Luke said it in to trailer, ""This is not going to got the way you think it is,"" and it didn't for a reason. If you want so see Star Wars how you want it, watch the Originals, this isn't is remastering, it a sequel, its not the same, so don't expect it to be."
2677,3,A horrible mess of a movie,"I am appalled with this movie. There were a lot of unnecessary jokes that did not work. One single character, the biggest character in the series by the way, does things that go against everything his character would've done. A lot of the movie was padded with boring material, and the big bad villain is made into a weak an useless character that dies mid way through the movie. The storyline was weak, and a lot of things that happened made no sense. I understand why many people are down about this movie, but what I really don't understand is how this still has a 7.5 rating on Imdb. Maybe some writers were paid off to give this movie high marks as some other reviewers have said. I will say the special effects weren't bad, and the actors did a pretty good job with the material they had to work with. That's why it will get a rating of 3 stars out of 10 from me. Overall, it is a poor film that is way worse than even the prequel films."
2678,9,Character disagreement leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to 1/10 ratings.,"I am not a die hard star wars fan. As such I am not looking for anything specific, nor do I have any expectations that can be crushed if the writers were to take the plot in a slightly ""different"" direction than one might expect.<br /><br />That is what has caused such a polarized set of reviews."
2679,9,Exceptional movie,"I've been using IMDb for 20 years, but it must be over 10 years since I've left a review. What compelled me to review this movie, is reading some of the utterly biased reviews on here. Some even admit that they haven't SEEN the movie, yet give a 1/10 rating... Or men shaming ?? I enjoyed the very realistic image of men vs women in this movie, which is that we are equally strong in most areas (Kylo Ren/Rey), but different in others (more physical strenght in men, Rey/Snoke, more empathy in women Leia - Holdo - Rose). Poe Dameron clearly (mis)judges Vice Admiral Holdo by her ultra feminine looks, but Leia doesn't scold him for being male, she scolds him for being rash, for 'jumping into an X-wing'. She would have said the same thing to a rash female character like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica. So men shaming is a totally biased perception here. On the contrary, when Poe isn't listening to their conversation any more, both women express their appreciation for him. There was no negativity in their laughter, only a recognition between women in charge that for the X-th time in their lives, a testosterone driven man has questioned their authority... Or do you think Poe Dameron would have questioned Holdo's decisions in the same way if she had been portrayed as a 60 year old male (e.g. a captain Kirk figure) ? "
2680,9,Superb visuals,I don't know why so much hate for this movie i find it better than its previous installments it was a visual delight the effects were so astonishing u'll certenly get goosebumps . Background score was good storyline was engaging the acting performance were great specially adam's .. maybe it was not the movie everybody expected it to be but certainly it was amazing and divining .. u'll definitely like this one if u care for visuals and talents involved
2681,1,"""A Disney-approved Sci-Fi Comedy""","A movie that tries extremely hard to be politically-correct, while being inclusive and embracing diversity, that it forgets what it means to be a part of the Star Wars lore. One of the greatest protagonists in cinematic history has been reduced to an uninspiring hermit drinking milk off an alien-cow-dinosaur hybrid. Supreme Leader Snoke could potentially be a greater villain than Darth Sidious but unfortunately killed off, Darth Maul-style. Meanwhile, forgettable and insignificant token characters such as Finn and Rose were kept alive all in the name of ""multiracial-diversity"" and ""political-correctness"". And don't get me started on the space battles: It was vomit-inducing."
2682,9,"Despite the Hate, a Great Entry into the Star Wars Saga","Simply put, The Last Jedi is a solid entry into the Star Wars saga that charts a new course for Star Wars. My advice: go see it yourself and go with an open mind."
2683,1,Not Worthy to be in the Star Wars Universe,Rian Johnson & Kathleen Kennedy have single handily Ruined Star Wars & divided it's fanbase
2684,10,Who the hell paid all you people to leave these garbage reviews? The movie was incredible. It's just that simple.,I don't know who paid these ppl to write these reviews but WOW are they WRONG. I was on the edge of my seat until the end. The character interaction and development was amazing. To all the folks who said Snoak was not like Palpatine blah blah you're exactly right because he's NOT PLALPATINE. Every Sith Lord master was murdered by their younger more powerful apprentice INCLUDING PALPATINE AND PALPATINES MASTER (Palpatine killed him in his sleep). The only way Ben killed him was because in his mind he saw him turning the light saber which he was doing with his own at the time. 
2685,8,for me Iam Satisfied and happy,"At some point i decided not to watch the movie after i read a lot of bad reviews , <br /><br />but i said : what ! its Star Wars , and it is The Last Jedi , the Movie should have some thing , i want to see Luke as old man and a lot of things that those who watched the epic need to see it , so i watched it and ... it was not bad as i thought , actually it was good , actually not good , for me its fantastic <br /><br />in short words I Enjoyed the movie , i don't care if there was some thing missing or some people are disappointed , i saw some good surprises , i enjoyed and that is what matters"
2686,9,Better than old trilogy,"Yes, you read that right. Old trilogy was inarguably worse in so many elements it would take hours to mention them. But people still love it.<br /><br />This did better job, didn't fall for traps set by J. J. Abrams and delivered almost perfect Star Wars. I love new approach with characters, I love little jokes on the side of deep story (mostly about not dwelling on old stories when there are new stories to tell).<br /><br />I love how unimportant was one presumably big character. I love shocking reveal of Rey's parents. I love all that unexpected twists."
2687,5,"Slightly Intriguing, but Ultimately Disappointing","PROS:<br /><br />Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and Adam Driver are still wonderful as the new blood of this franchise. They all play rich characters that we absolutely care about. However, Mark Hamill stole the show for me. While some people disliked his performance in this film, I felt that it showed how he's seen a lot over the years that changed him.<br /><br />The visuals in this film are top notch. I was surprised to find out which scenes were CG and which were practical (the stone hut destruction and the ship dropping bombs were both practical), which is a huge compliment.<br /><br />The story was a mixed bag for me, but I did really liked it when it was about Rey training with Luke, as well as her having a connection with Kylo Ren. This story element was extremely fascinating, but there were enough bad elements in the story to counteract this.<br /><br />The fight scene with the Praetorian guards was stunning. The action was so well choreographed, and it looked so cool.<br /><br />Also, I loved the Porgs. They were really cute, and they weren't in the movie long enough to get on my nerves, so I'm glad about that."
2688,10,Blown away by its dialog & deep wisdom,I thought Star Wars had no where to go except rehashing nostalgia. This film surprised me in a good way. It even has relevant messages for what our culture faces today. Too much to explain w/o spoilers . But I can still simply quote some of the dialog lines which blew me away.
2689,2,Terrible addition,The story had many many holes. Felt like the Empire was all white guys vs women with big noses. Anyone can jump in a fighter and be a pilot. Political correct Hollywood film missed the mark. I can spend hours explaining my disappointment but a turd like like does not deserve it. Luke could have been much better. In return of the jedi he comes back like a bad ass. Here he is a weak old man on the big nose team
2690,10,"If you hated it, go see it again. Best since Empire.","This is the best Star Wars movie since Empire, if not since 1977. The haters are just wrong - they got turned off by opening 90 seconds of admittedly not very good jokes, which I think jolted them out of the heart-felt brilliance of the remaining 150 minutes. I spent the second half of the movie either in a mess of tears at seeing old friends reunite and rediscover their heroic resolve or mentally punching the air with cathartic joy as Rian Johnson bought together epic visual (and vehicle) design, heroic self-sacrifice, and the most successful evocation of that 'Star Wars' vibe since the 80s (spoilers>): ramming the Snoke ship at light speed, the heroic lone bomber fighter in the opening battle, the falcon intervening in the Crait battle, those speeders, all of Mark Hamill (but in particular his emotionally devastating and surprisingly athletic final lightsabre showdown with Kylo Ren - the power of this duel is quite subtle and will take a second watch to sink in), fleets of ships desperately warping through the galaxy under imperial onslaught. "
2691,9,Fantastic film,Luke is incredible in this movie. The ultimate Jedi. Positive message about failure and hope. Everything a star wars movie should be. Thanks Rian.
2692,9,Why so much hate? Very good story and positive suprise,"I was positive surprise with this movie. I didn't expect too much and I didn't compare whit all other Star Wars movies. I must say, I don't understand, why so much hate. The movie has a very good story, enough action, but not too much and many moments are very tense. I must say, that this movie was the best positive surprise this year. Just go watch it without expectation and you will be positive surprise. 9/10"
2693,4,Using nostalgia in a bad way,"My biggest problem with this movie is how illogical the character of Luke is, the man that turned freaking Darth Vader back to the light side thought of killing his padawan when he even sensed the slightest of darkness. Also Rey is someone that's to perfect to be true, she had barely any training and is already stronger than most well trained jedi and even Kylo Ren (in the force awakens). So basically ruined a nostalgic character just too promote a feminine Mary Sue. And also Leia supermanning herself back to the spaceship without dying barskinned in space is just B. S."
2694,10,"Unpredictable,",I have no idea why some people are being so negative about this film. I thought the way Luke was portrayed was clever and much more in keeping with his character in the original trilogy. I really liked the fact that you were never really sure which was it was going to go.
2695,1,The new trilogy is really bad.,Worst thing that could ever happen to the series is the new trilogy. We have seen 2/3 of the films and there is no room nor hope for improvement. They must not be considered as canon. They are abysmal. They ruined the franchise. The prequels are precious gems compared to these films... Imagine that!
2696,8,Liked it.,"I have seen them in chronological order since they first came out and JJ Abrams did an excellent job with this one. He keeps the plot moving so there were not many slow spots. I liked it, but I pretty much like them all."
2697,10,True to the Old Saga. Love it.,"I must say, that I really like this movie. It was fun emotional and back to very roots of the old movies. I really do not understand the reviews here, or maybe I am too different.."
2698,10,An Amazing Film - but it needs a 2nd viewing to really appreciate it,After watching TLJ for the first time I have to say I was underwhelmed. It felt like an overlong film with too many things going on. I wasn't impressed.
2699,3,Bad Script and Great Visuals equals a Superficial Movie,"This movie is beautiful to watch. The visual and sound aspects of the movie are perfect, quite frankly. The script, though, is awful. It almost seems as if it was written on the fly. They really needed a quality filmmaker like, say, Bob Zemeckis who can write a coherent script that makes sense rather than this horrifyingly bad nonsense that does great injustice to the characters who have been in the franchise since the beginning and are pivotal to the overall story. The movie seems obsessed with new characters and other fluff that has no bearing on the plot. They could have done away with all of the CGI animals and half of the cast because they had zero impact on the story. "
2700,,Best Star Wars movie to date!! Mind blowing!!,"Thrilling from start to finish, Best Star Wars Movie since Empire Strikes Back."
2701,8,Funny and Interesting,"The Last Jedi brings fresh air to the saga. Its humor was the thing lacking in the saga. I surprised myself at how much I laughed watching this movie, I loved it."
2702,1,The most pointless Star Wars movie ever,"Let me be clear - Lucas' prequels were worse as movies, had worse performances and technically looked like poor CGI. But at least those movies helped to establish Star Wars cannon and lore. They added worlds and characters, and helped to expand the universe we love. The Last Jedi, in comparison, is a parasite movie. It rides along on the lore it inherited, contributing nothing while consuming everything, it uses up and destroys lore and characters, but adds nothing. It's bungling director clear had no idea he was meant to take the baton, then pass it on."
2703,10,Best star wars movie,"Great action, some good dialogue, great soundtrack, great visuals. All the characters are much more interesting than in TFA except for Finn and maybe rey. Poe is awesome and so is Snoke and if you think this movie is liberal propaganda or some crap you need to think a little more critically."
2704,8,Accept the movie on its own terms,"Some people are going to tell you how bad the movie is and how you shouldn't see it and how it ruin Star Wars and blah blah blah. The truth is if you just watch the movie as it is instead of wanting it to be something that you wish it was you'll enjoy it. The first time I watched it I thought it was about 6 out of 10 now I think it's 8 out of 10 and a great movie. There's too many man babies, too many Trump supporters, too many podcast listeners and too many Star Wars man babies out there. Grow up and accept the movies how they are and stop taking them so seriously. It's not real life, it's just for fun, so calm down and enjoy."
2705,10,"NOT whining about what I ""would have done"" to prove I'm the best fanboy","I've heard some people say that Star Wars The Last Jedi is not about anything. I don't know what movie these people were watching, but what I saw was an emotionally substantial, evocative, intensely meaningful movie.<br /><br />The overarching message of The Last Jedi is the notion that the needs of the many outweigh the WANTS of the few. Luke imparts this message to Rey when he reveals that the Force does not belong to the Jedi, but to everyone. Rey tries to convey this message to Kylo Ren as she strives to win him back to the light side. Leia and Holdo teach this lesson to Poe when they attempt to show him that rushing in and being the hero is far less important than protecting the light. And Rose beautifully expresses this sentiment to Finn after she saves his life and urges him to understand that the war against the First Order will be won by saving what they love, not killing what they hate.<br /><br />The story is about the importance of collectivism, of embracing and protecting community and rejecting self-centered pride. It's interesting to note that the characters that express these major themes the most are female characters who are attempting to inspire and open the eyes of male characters. It is true that women tend to be more communal and it makes sense that the female characters would be the ones to spread this message of rejecting selfish dreams of glory and accepting the strength and power that comes from togetherness and unity. Such a great and unexpected theme to find in a movie series that is historically about some guy who is the chosen ONE who must save the galaxy.<br /><br />In one excellent scene, Leia admonishes Poe for recklessly attacking the First Order dreadnought, an attack that costs many lives. Poe tries to defend himself, saying the people they lost were heroes. Leia responds with ""Dead heroes. No leaders"". Leia gets it. She has seen her share of hotshot heroes and she knows that it is better to raise up leaders who will bring the people together than to glorify heroes who will ultimately fade away.<br /><br />This is why Rey is so important. She seems more interested in leading than gaining power or renown for herself. The revelation that Rey's parents were nobody of significance was so essential. It takes us back to the message of A New Hope, to the idea that even a nobody from nowhere can be special. Rey doesn't have to descend from some space-royalty bloodline to matter. Who cares who her parents are or who anybody's parents are. What is important is using one's power to lead with compassion. This is why Rey will be the greatest Jedi; she doesn't have to be a hero or a Princess, she can be a leader who shares the Force rather than keeping it for herself.<br /><br />The Last Jedi is brilliant and it is certainly not about nothing. There are so many powerful messages in this story, timely messages. It is about the folly of vanity and hubris. It is about the importance of humility and forgiveness. It is about the idea that anybody can be a leader. It is about the danger of running away from feelings. It is about the destructiveness of greed. It is about the universal significance and power of hope. It is about the strength of women. It even takes a jab or two at organized religion and its tendency to anoint itself the arbiter of all good things. At its heart, it is about putting the needs of the whole galaxy ahead of the needs of the vain and the greedy and the conceited few.<br /><br />Who will save the galaxy? Who will bring balance to it all? Probably not a lone man with a sword or gun out for glory. Instead, it will probably be a group of people who believe in balance, in equality, in protecting the greater good."
2706,1,I'm sorry. This one was a stinko.,"I well remember standing in line for the first film back in 1977. All in the series have suffered by comparison ever since, but most of them were watchable. This one dragged horribly."
2707,10,Best STAR WARS Film,"The more I watch The Last Jedi, the more I enjoy it. After first viewing, it was solidly in 3rd Place for me, but I now think Last Jedi is even better than Empire."
2708,1,The people responsible for this film should go to prison,"Really, jail-time for them."
2709,10,Ignore the haters,Don't waste your time reading the negative reviews. Most people love this film. It's absolutely amazing.
2710,9,Great movie!,"I agree with the critics. Some choices were strange and wrong, but overall it was a great movie. I believe that the next movie will explain all the plot holes from this movie. J.J. Will once again take the helm and I trust him to make an amazing movie again. All these negative reviews and blind hate are pissing me off. It deserves a lot more praise. Phantom manace is still the worse sw movie followed by attack of the clones."
2711,9,I liked it.,I enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one.
2712,1,A Betrayal to the Legacy,"I was expecting to be dissapointed before ""the force awakens"" but after seeing it, I thought, ""maybe I underestimated Disney, they can do this"". Then ""Rogue One"" came out, it was alright as well. I have watched all 8 movies again, prior to watch ""the Last Jedi""; dude, you got a good story, a stoormtrooper that ran off from the First Order, a young Sith and a Jedi who are having conflicts, Luke Skywalker, technology for incredible effects and so on; yet, what you shoot is a movie that stoortrooper is a coward and a hopeless romantic; Sith and Jedi fall in love each other; a Supreme Leader whom we still don't know how it got to be a leader (at least we knew the story of Darth Sidius before) and who dies like a freaking young jedi; we have the legend Luke Skywalker who became crazy and coward but somehow immortal. We have the main characters WHO JUST DONT DIE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. Disney must return shooting the High School Musical; they have ruined Star Wars, they have ruined the best memory of my childhood. As a Star Wars fan, I could not help myself crying after seeing this movie which is worse than ""the Phantom Menace"". You need to be ashamed. You have betrayed George Lucas' legacy, you have betrayed the purpose of Star Wars. You now can be happy all the 10 year olds will love the movie, good job."
2713,10,Thematically perfect,So on point.
2714,1,Can you rate zero out of ten?,"A hot saber of garbage. If you don't believe me just ask Mark Hamill. Seriously. Youtube, Mark Hamill, Last Jedi."
2715,10,Its a great Star Wars movie. People just pretend to be so smart and over analyze things.,"The reason why we loved Star Wars as a kid back in the 70's-80's is because we enjoyed watching it with the whole family and just get mesmerized by the lasers and light sabers. Never mind if we dont have CGI back then. Who cares. . We just enjoy it as it is. A sci-fi movie. <br /><br />The Last Jedi is no different. It is supposed to be just a movie that we enjoy watching with our family and kids. <br /><br />I dont understand why people are discussing about unrealistic plots and poor script writing. Looks like a lot of people wants to appear to be so smart and over analyze the movie criticizing this and that. Pretentious smart wannabees.<br /><br />Just enjoy it as it is. Dont ruin the magic to your kids. Let them have their fun the way we did back in 1977. Unless you are in your 50's and actually experience Star Wars in theaters back in 1977, then dont even pretend to know everything and say The Last Jedi is nothing compared to the original Star Wars because believe me, you dont understand at all."
2716,8,People should stop complaining,Yes is there stuff they could have done differently. 1. That is definitely how Luke Skywalker should act. Yes he should be angry because he lost everything but it would have been absolutely awesome to see him show up on snokes ship and save Rey and face down snoke and Kylo Ren while poe leads the rebels against Hux. 2. Wayyy to much comedy. 3. They absolutely ruined Hux he could have been the next Tarkin instead he is just the punching bag for everyone. But overall at the end of the day it really is Star Wars and it's a movie we all love. At one point it would almost impossible that we would never see another Star Wars movie or ever see Mark Hamil as the most beloved hero in film history . But we did see it again. Let's all appreciate it while we have it. And John Williams is the all time GOAT of music scores it's not even close
2717,,This is the real restart to the saga,"In hindsight, this feels more like the actual reboot for the new generation in Star Wars. Where The Force Awakes is more a memory jolt and new template for how this reboot should look and feel, The Last Jedi starts building the new characters and maybe a different interpretation on what The Force really is?"
2718,8,8 star (wars),"The first of the Star Wars franchise to satirize itself with what everyone only talks about in other installments: the Force. Yes. Everyone talks about it, but hardly sees or uses it enough. But this movie explores it a bit, eh? In time. What about the Force? Does the ability to access her power guarantee happiness, for example? Noooo, and the story follows those who can do it and those unfortunate souls who can't, making it the best ""Star Wars"" since... ""The Empire Strikes Back."" All of that, and a tie-in to what comes next. Excellent work indeed."
2719,1,Wow.....,"Well,what can i say ?<br /><br />Nothing good about this movie! Seriously, i wasn't sure if all the negative reviews are right, but believe me, they are. Story is absolute garbage from start to the end and also the Acting is ridiciulous. I didn't thought after the force awakens it could be worse, but dont know how but they achieved it."
2720,10,This is NOT going to go the way you think!!!,"As a long time Star Wars fan (old skool!), I can understand some of the frustrations that people have. However, I think this film was a brave step by Rian Johnson. It is very funny in places, and there are some extremely moving scenes, not to mention several unexpected twists. It is far from perfect, (there aren't many perfect movies) yes it is quite long and the Canto Bight part was a bit meh but people, you need to accept it as it is, as opposed to how you imagined it in your heads :)"
2721,1,0 stars,"This film made me feel betrayed , when i left the cinema when it first came out i was in shock and disbelief at what i had seen. I've made so many rants about this film already so i'm not going to bother wasting my time ranting again but all i'm gonna say is why?<br /><br />Would rather watch Attack of the clones and the phantom menace because those films while disappointing , actually have some decent scenes and don't offend me like this film does."
2722,9,Haters gonna hate! This movie was great!,"People who have a problem with this movie went to see it with their own expectations and plot directions in their mind. They disappointed themselves. Other than the casino planet, the movie was epic. Luke pulled off the greatest Jedi skills in the history of Jedi's. Just ask C3PO."
2723,10,Best since Empire!!!!,"Rian Johnson is a genius, I can't say enough good about this Episode!! He took predictability and threw it out the window.<br /><br />The humor was spot on, the acting was the best out of all the Star Wars movies.<br /><br />Twists and turns to make M. Night go ""OMG""<br /><br />So many moments that had my theater cheering and clapping. This truly is one of the best, right next to Empire."
2724,8,Miles ahead of The Force Awakens,"I came into this movie not knowing much about it; I avoided most of the trailers and I wasn't keeping up with any of the theories and plot speculations online, and boy am I glad that i did. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the most intense and unpredictable films I've seen in recent years, and it blows The Force Awakens out of the water in almost every aspect. The characters here feel so much more fleshed out and the writing is a lot more mature and interesting this time around. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren is particularly intriguing, and it goes to places you would never expect. And of course, Mark Hamill's performance as Luke Skywalker is simply delightful. You can feel so much pain and regret in his voice, and he steals the show in every scene he's in (thankfully there are a lot). Overall the cast does an amazing job and the story takes so many fun and exciting turns."
2725,2,Worst Star Wars,"The worst SW movie ever made by a director with direct contempt and willfull mockery of everything SW. As years go by more and more will realise that this is noting but a potty potpurri of travesties, bearing the resemblance of some things SW."
2726,10,"Empire, you have a contender.","I have loved the series as a kid, and more so now as an adult. The Force Awakens was a worthy opening act, resurrecting the franchise from the mess of the Prequels, so it was only expected that we should expect an even better second part. "
2727,2,Worst Star Wars film ever (including the Ewoks movies),"Rian Johnson has pretty much destroyed Star Wars. Terrible use of ""comedy"", utterly dull and stupid plot. Some very strange choices the ""wonder woman"" Leia flying in space was a particularly dire."
2728,8,"First Star Wars movie in nearly 40 years, that I want to see again","The one and two star reviews here can only be attributed to the younger audience, who likely see the prequels favorably. To those who grew up with the original trilogy, The Last Jedi should be thoroughly satisfying. Best Mark Hamill performance in a Star Wars film. Best dialog in a Star Wars film. Best visual and sound effects. Great music. Original cinematography. Hopefully J.J. Abrams follows this route."
2729,8,This is not going to the way you think,"The Last Jedi non-spoiler review:After two years since episode seven:The Force Awakens, Star Wars is back! And I got to see it last night at the midnight launch.<br /><br />Star Wars has always been an opportunity for escapism ever since 'A New Hope' and I really think that Rian Johnson got that in this darker than usual Star Wars episode.I had an absolute blast with this film yet again I was thoroughly entertained from the first to the last minute.I'll start with what I think is the.most important part of the film,the character's.For me this chapter was predominantly about Rey,Luke,Kylo,Finn,Poe and ofcourse Leia.This for me is the best acted Star Wars film to date in my opinion,with Daisy Ridley as Rey and Mark Hamill as Luke stealing the show doing some of the best work I've seen this year I really love their character's.Adam Driver as Kylo Ren also puts in a solid performance and Poe and Finn bring the energy and comedy that is and has always been a part of the Star Wars universe.The look of the film is breathtaking once again,the space battles were amazing and dealt with with a huge amount of care,the lightsaber battles and general choreography is some of the best I've ever seen in a Star Wars film,it was that good.John Williams' score as always was composed with meticulous care and if anything is an improvement on 'The force awakens'.Where I think the movie has it's flaws is within the writing of the plot, and the direction of which it takes.The movie advances at a rapid pace,however the Finn and Rose plot had no payoff whatsoever.I was disappointed in how they incorporated Finn into the story in general and the casino scene jist dragged for way too long.People are always talking about the plot holes of Star Wars films and seems to be a common theme again in the Last Jedi,I agree that there are certain things that need to be discovered,but at the same time remember this is what we asked for when we got the prequels,and look at the result of that...I'm just saying we need to wary that's all.Nevertheless this is pretty much every thing you could want from a Star Wars film.Does it surpass Episodes 4 and 5?No,but I left the cinema pleased and had a blast with it."
2730,10,"Some thoughts from a fan, not a fanatic","Finally! A Star Wars Movie that is fun to watch, that dares to take new directions in this old, old Galaxy! I understand all the hate this movie is getting as it basicly tells all the fanatics that they were wrong, that there is no God, that Luke is not a hero, he is a person, a broken one and that the Force is not exclusive to a specific bloodline or immaculate conception (Anakin). For me, I think of it as a new beginning for the franchise, the one where Skywalker dynasty is not in the center of entire Galaxy and the Galaxy, the real people, start to fight for their own. Plotholes? When You disagree with the direction You will find them everywhere this is not an issue here, as they were not an issue in Empire Strikes Back. I recommend everyone to watch this movie, You will not be dissapointed! I only hope that creators will not chicken out and will continue to - boldly go where no one has gone before ;)"
2731,1,"I never write reviews, but this is just too overwhelmingly appalling","No, it wasn't horrid because Rey is a ""commoner"" and Luke is a pathetic jerk, those parts could have actually been interesting. And bringing less than hot female characters in is also pretty cool (never mind that the main is still, well, super hot). Oh and I get all the symbolism of breaking with the old times and doing it differently. But literally everything else was so cringy, I broke both my facial nerves watching it."
2732,10,"So much hate, yet most of these 'fans' will end up seeing Episode IX.","If these negative reviewers and so called 'fans' put this amount of effort into their ordinary lives, as they have done with their reviews, they might even be able to get jobs."
2733,1,Epic Fail,"Things that make me love Star Wars,"
2734,9,"Terrific, twisty take on the Star Wars saga","From a technical movie-making point of view, this is probably the best Star Wars yet; the scenes in deep space with the slo-mo chase are the only ones that kind of suck (why do the cannon shots from the First Order bend down- there's no gravity!) but the rest of the movie is just awesome."
2735,10,My favorite movie of the franchise,"So.... despite what a lot of angry fans might make you believe (and this is something I experienced with SEVERAL people I know coming out of the movie loving it and being utterly confused by angry reviewers on the internet) - this movie... this movie has incredible plot twists, good pacing, amazing and satisfying character arcs. If you go to the movie theater and watch it you will probably hear a lot of clapping and cheering when you get to the end (and, surprisingly, you'll probably join in). "
2736,,"Honest Review - Okay Movie, but ruined the Star Wars Lore Franchise!","Disney, or whoever decided to make this chaos trash, totally ruined the Star Wars lore. The character archs are not explained, incoherent or just fall off a cliff. Nevertheless, when you build massive evil character as Snoke and do not explain his origins which has been massive debate over the years, is totally trashed for what happened in the movie. Moreover, the director does not care about any of the historical characters and they are tossed away like meaningless trash. After just being aware of the force, Rey can dominate Praetorian Guards? What? Her fighting ability now unmatched without any training whatsoever? The movie makes fun of Jedi History and in essence and literally destroying all reference to Jedi anchient lore. There is literally nothing on Finn's development. Waste of all character developments in this film. This film is a mess. If you love cute penguin-like creatures and product placement, then go see the movie. IF you are a Star Wars fan, it will be an overall disappointment. Thanks Disney for destroying a franchise!"
2737,9,BOLD and Wonderful,This Movie was bold! 
2738,1,The Greatest Cinematic Crime of Our Generation.,"To think that a Star Wars film could represent some of the most negative aspects of modern cinema, modern pop culture, fandom, and even society, is the sad reality we live in. Once an institution of imagination, technological achievement and effective storytelling simplicity, The Last Jedi becomes the antithesis of what Star Wars once stood for, becoming an icon of one of the most cancerous social mentalities of our times, and its damage, not only to the entertainment industry, but to the cult of fiction (and even the making of such) should not be understated."
2739,10,I really liked the Last Jedi,"Personally, I really enjoyed this film a lot. Luke has lost his youthful optimism due to life experience and failure, and the central message of the film is to stop clinging to the past. This is intriguing. Moreover, the character development is strong. Luke finally overcomes his depression due to his past failure and manages a last act of dramatic heroics in a creative and powerful last stand. Poe Dameron starts to mature in his judgment of leadership tactics, preparing him for the greater responsibility he will take on in the future. People criticize the casino excursion, but it is through this experience that Finn develops commitment to a cause, rather than to be independent and sell himself to the highest bidder. Rey and Kylo Ren go through a fascinating development, pulled towards each other and yet apart. This culminates in an awesome fight scene, where they team up together against a common enemy, and then part ways. It's one of the best scenes, and Luke's final stand is a powerful ending. This has great characters, development and character arcs, incredible battles (space battles, lightsabers, and internal battles). It triggers emotions, and proposes a controversial philosophy for fans to discuss."
2740,1,How much does it cost to buy 10 star ratings here?,"Seems nobody likes The Last Jedi however still high scores in professional media. I liked it in theatre with moving chairs though. However treating one of the most iconic heroes of all time like that takes as special kind of amateurism towards filmmaking and the whole franchise. After seeing some reviews about the last Jedi on YouTube I agree that the story is realy bad and does not make sense it is that bad with so much budget. The level of political correctness is also unnecessary here, please skip it. Villains have the hair of the cartoon drawing of the royal horse of a prince (euh... princess nowadays) that is being shampooed and brushed daily while on the other hand the guy is the most terrifying dark mass murdering sadistic person in the universe. The people in charge of this franchise are just lacking the skills to create an awesome Star Wars movie. I can follow the logic that however pays the bills get to create what they want however so many amateur moves in play here that we can all agree on that this is going to go down in the text books as to how to ruin an amazing franchise. At least they make money selling the toys."
2741,,I can no longer see how to sort reviews by specific criteria (e.g. date),Has the site changed? How does one sort the reviews?
2742,10,I movie you need to see again. It makes us question.,"Star Wars The Last Jedi was Awesome! It is definitely a movie that you need to watch again to catch things that you might have missed the first time around. It is definitely better the second time around, because it gives you answers to questions you might have left the theater with the first time around. I love how the story makes us question the force, and many things. It has us question the character of the characters. It has us question whether Luke Skywalker turned bad when he tried to kill Ben Solo, but then shows us that he only had a fleeting moment of weakness, which had consequences that he couldn't redeem. It made us question the character of Vice Admiral Holdo, Whether she was a bad admiral, or really good. The Last Jedi fits well with both the original Star Wars, and the 90s prequels. It ties the whole thing together.<br /><br />Matt Ostrom"
2743,9,Different but good,The reviews so far are pretty horrible but I have to say that I enjoyed this movie very much. There are definitely things to complain about but I still liked it overall. I think I loved it but I want to see it at lease once more before I decide.
2744,10,More than anything I expected,"After The Force Awakens managed to efficiently introduce a new generation of characters and give a mirrored classic Star Wars story, I was expecting The Last Jedi to be an epic & fun to watch movie.<br /><br />But it is a lot more than that. Not only does it have epic & climatic moments, it also features a lot of deep meaning and ideas that are either new to the saga or explored in new and surprising ways. Many elements of this movie go against what you can expect, making it a refreshing and new story in a saga that already had 7 movies and 1 spin-off.<br /><br />The entire movie revolves around the theme of failure and what you can learn from it.<br /><br />Its climatic ending is the most Jedi thing ever shown in a Star Wars movie."
2745,1,Absolute waste of your time - Worst Star Wars movie ever -,"I was not a big fan of The Force Awakens when it came out, I like to support underdogs whether its in sports or entertainment and Rey's character was just too damn good at everything for me to support her. "
2746,10,Great movie - Reasonable storylines & awesome graphics!,Pretty good movie. Don't listen to the haters... Just love it!
2747,1,HUGELY DISAPPOINTING!,"As much as The Last Jedi seems to want to shake up the franchise and take things in a new direction, throughout the entire film that direction never becomes apparent. Instead what is left is a confusing mash of narrative, weak characterisation and really obscure creative choices."
2748,10,Brilliant!,Everything about this movie rocked. Best since Empire!
2749,10,The Last Jedi is amazing and you all are insane,"I guess you can't that this is a love or hate it kind of film.<br /><br />People cleary did not appreciate the fact that this was one of the greatest story in all of Star wars history because they where to attached to their absolute dog theorys.<br /><br />Each and every one of those stupid theorys if they actually happened in the film they would have the dramatic weight of a feather they're not good.<br /><br />If you don't see how this is much more relatable and a better dramatic reveal than just being somebody famous as daughter then you really do not appreciate good storytelling and if you guys where able to come up with said theories that's the definition of the word predictable, you just predicted it and that twist would have been exactly like Empire Strikes Back only noy good at all.<br /><br />Instead we get this whole new theme that yes Rey is a nobody and anybody can't have the force now Luke says it himself and say that Rian trashed what JJ set up is so not true.<br /><br />Go back and watch the Force Awakens and they coupd very well be setting up that she's a nobody, the film has plenty of that theme in it as well one thing JJ definitely did was leave a lot of stuff open ended but maybe too open ended because it led to way too much speculation. Now there is only one person that I know of that his prediction about Rey actually came true : ME.<br /><br />I think the idea that Rey is a nobody and that anyone can learn the force is a great concept.<br /><br />And if you really hate the Luke Skywalker storyline in this film, blame it on JJ not Rian."
2750,9,Finally Star Wars renewed,"Fresh blood, new ideas and conscious auto-creation. Great movie!"
2751,1,Worst Starwars by far,"90% of this movie was hot garbage. Most of the story is pointless and the parts that do matter are just remedial. One or two shining moments in the film, other then that a complete waste of your time. I will never understand how this movie is rated so high, Disney must have paid a pretty penny for good reviews."
2752,10,Quite literally the best Star Wars movie bar none,What else is there to say? Story? Good. Acting? Good. Special effects? Good.
2753,1,My 12yo kid said it's a stupid movie...,"I grew up in communism, with Star Wars being, for me and ALL of my friends, a motivational story to better ourselves. The movie plot and characters were something to strive for, we all wanted to be in the story and had our favourite role in that adventure."
2754,10,Wow the haters :D,"The way you hate this movie is so ridiculous. So you loved 1, 2 and 3? IMHO that was an actual garbage. They were so bad. The only one which was watchable was 3. SW 4, 5 and 6 are perfect and I love them. This one is different but not so much, it has some plot twists and some perfect music placement. I don't mind the plot holes they are everywhere why can't you just enjoy something without ovethinking? It looks so good and so true to classic star wars. I really like it, force awakens was just a copy of 4 but this one is new and fresh. I don't care about your stupid rules and dogmatic views. Grow up and chill. Yes the heroes are always safe. But what do you expect, everyone to die? This is not GOT. Are you angry about the force and how it's used? You are not a Jedi, you don't have to be so angry :D <br /><br />I LOVED THIS MOVIE. There I said it. Now go to your cocoon and hate everything."
2755,8,Finding Balance Between Physics and Entertainment,"I have watched every Star Wars film ever made many times, from VHS to DVD to Blu-Ray. Like Gollum's love and hatred of the One Ring, I have both loved and hated every Star Wars film, and for various reasons. "
2756,8,"Dear butthurt, and apparently the only 'real' Star Wars fans out there","I really wanted to write a review, as this movie is getting way too much negative attention, in my opinion."
2757,1,Ridiculous movie,One of the worst storylines I haver ever witnessed
2758,10,The Last Jedi is a film worth praise.,"By breaking the formula, the movie constantly leads viewers on only to surprise them last minute. Made for a very unpredictable movie and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole."
2759,2,"I went in with high expectations, however....?!@#$%^&*!","Days prior to this movie, I rewatched all Star Wars, from ep1~6, and rewatched (liked 5 times) ep7 in 3D. <br /><br />I could recall the moment while watching ep7. I had tears rolling when i saw the Millennium Falcon. I had tears flowing when Hans Solo and Princess Leia appeared. I had the most chills when the man the whole movie is dedicated to find, finally appeared at the end of the movie. I remembered some article mentioned that Steven Spielberg loved it so much, that he watched 4 times.<br /><br />Guessed he's disgusted by the latest installment now. I clapped hands with the other viewers when the majestic theme started playing. But i did not clap when the movie ended. I will try not to give away the plot, if you must know, other reviewers (normal users please, not those so-called critiques) have already mentioned a little too much. I get it that they tried to tell as story full of unexpected plots and twists, however, make some sense please?? You can't just give us a twist without any good sense of doing it! I am not picky at all, as some users have written, such as Cap. Phasma not given enough depth. But I walked out after the end of the movie with a WTF feeling.<br /><br />Maybe Carrie Fisher wanted no more part in this rubbish, so she decided maybe its her time (God rest her soul) to bid farewell for good. (I will edit and remove this part of the content should any members condemn me for joking about the most-loved CF, no disrespecting intended at all).<br /><br />This is not a review to sway Star War fans or movie-goers away from this ep8. This is rather (i hope) a wake up call for the Disney executives to turn from the Dark Side towards the Light. Good or bad, i will still watch, as it is Star Wars. May the Force be with Disney!"
2760,8,really?,"Who is so stupid to rate this movie 1/10 !!!!! What is wrong with you people!!!?<br /><br />For the worst haters, this movie is worth no less than 5. Talk to your doctor and don't waste your time for ratings"
2761,10,"A different Star Wars film, but a SW film nonetheless.","This analysis comes in response to the myriad of reviews here that are bashing the film. And while everyone is entitled to an opinion, I've found the majority of them unsatisfying, in that they barely provide any arguments to support their light critique. It seems that most of these reviewers are content in simply saying that the movie failed to meet their expectations and destroyed a legacy 40 years in the making."
2762,10,The Second Best Star Wars Film,"The Last Jedi reaches the depths of storytelling, pathos and imagination that haven't been tapped since the early 1980s. All of the storytelling and technical elements fire on all cylinders as Rian Johnson takes old fans and new on a roller coaster ride of emotions (which some may and will find unsettling.) He respectfully pays homage to the mythos and boldly expands on it to varying degrees of success."
2763,1,God speed rebels?! Ugghhh,"Absolute garbage from start to finish I'm sorry to say and this is coming from a Star Wars diehard from way back. As soon as this rubbish started with that pathetic attempt at humour (honestly I've read funnier eulogies) I knew that the Star Wars I've known and loved for so many years was officially dead and buried.<br /><br />The scene where Leia is blown out of the ship and somehow floats back in like Superman was the ""shark jumping"" moment for me and after laughing with shock and disbelief I almost walked out of the cinema.<br /><br />The New characters where extremely annoying and the moment when Laura Dern uttered that absolutely ridiculous quote ""god speed rebels"" I knew there and then that the greatest cinematic franchise in history was dead."
2764,10,DISNEY HAS DONE IT,"I swear 7 and 8 are now my most favourite films ever of the Star Wars saga. Because of the way they made the story as well as the visual affects. Which is awesome as well. But the downside to number eight is how Luke skywalker behaved which I heard over the news that almost 20,000 people sent a report to remove this movie from the Star Wars saga because of Luke skywalker's behaviour or not training Ray to become a Jedi. But I know for a fact that Disney also really good with visual affects and the visual effects in this film is stunning especially the way they've done Kylo Rens lightsaberIt feels very realistic but by far I reckon that rogue one out of all the new Star Wars film is Dave made is definitely rogue one and I'm really looking forward to seeing the new Han Solo film. I was really looking forward to Ray and Luke actually forming a partnership while training in the Jedi arts but apparently spoiler alert that doesn't happen so basically this film about Ray training to be a Jedi was a complete waste of time to go for where Luke skywalker was when he ran away plus also you find out the truth of why Luke skywalker run away as well which obviously they've got to include that in the film because then we wondering. we can't we can't figure it out by ourselves. So still I'm getting is a 10 out of 10 because the story I love and the way they made it I love hundred percent so yeah"
2765,1,Hate mail to the story,"Imagine a parent whose kid watches the original Star Wars 100 times, and the parent gets completely sick of it. Then they get control of directing the sequels, and deliberately wreck it so their kid never wants to watch it again and moves on to something else."
2766,10,One of the best Star Wars films yet,"+Excellent visuals<br /><br />+Brilliant score<br /><br />+Great acting, in particular Adam Driver, Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley and Laura Dern<br /><br />+Excellent plot with good expansion of previous lore/mythology<br /><br />+New and old ideas/plot points etc mixed much better than in TFA<br /><br />+Great cameos"
2767,10,Needs more porgs,If I could give a 0 Star I would - needs more porgs! They're the best part of the movie. Everything else can go to hell tbh
2768,9,Best since The Empire Strikes Back,"This movie is not, by any means, a perfect film. However, I do think that there's something to be said about how ambitious, entertaining, and daring that this movie is. If you read some of the reviews on here, and other places on the internet, you'll see some common complaints such as ""Luke's character was ruined"" or ""entire plotlines were pointless!"" I address these two specifically because I believe that they were actually some of the best parts of the film. Luke's character was, quite frankly, improved. In the original trilogy, he was a hero in training who wasn't perfect and almost succumbed to the Dark Side. In this movie, he's a grizzled, old Jedi master who has his reasons for questioning whether to get involved or not. It makes him way more complex and also isn't something completely out of the character that was originally established. As far as the ""useless"" plotlines go, THAT'S THE ENTIRE THEME OF THE MOVIE! Failure is readily apparent in this movie and aside from the very end, characters both good and bad are constantly failing. Luke fails Kylo Ren during his training. Rose and Finn's mission ultimately fails. Poe fails Holdo by turning against her. Kylo Ren and Rey both fail to convert the other. Snoke fails to retrieve Luke's location from Rey. The entire Resistance pretty much fails to exist. Leia fails to get backup. It's everywhere in this movie and quite frankly, it's goddamn refreshing to not have the heroes succeed. I know I'm not addressing a lot of the complaints, but that would take ages (and plus a couple of them are actually good complaints.) The romance between Finn and Rose is REALLY bad. It didn't need to be there and it didn't really make sense. The movie also did drop a lot of things that were brought up in The Force Awakens, but the things that it did drop I feel like might make a return in IX so I'm not too upset. Production-wise, and I don't think anyone is arguing this, this movie looks amazing. Everything technical from the special effects to the cinematography, it's a beautiful movie. The acting and script were both also pretty good aside from a few jokes that don't quite land. Overall, this movie is damn good. It's hard for me to believe that anyone truly thinks that this is worse than the prequels. The prequels are quite garbage. You can like them, that's fine, but saying that they're better than this? Unbelievable. For my ranking, I personally would put it below The Empire Strikes Back and the original movie, but I would actually put it above Return of the Jedi. Tough call there, but I think it's the right one."
2769,1,Worse than the Phantom Menace,"Awful storytelling, POINTLESS subplot in a casino that takes up at least 1/4 of the movie, STUPID death of Snoke for a POINTLESS and HORRIBLY executed plot-twist, with a GARBAGE fight scene to follow. CRINGEWORTHY death of Luke, and a STUPID battle between him and Kylo Ren that involves Luke force projecting himself and dying after, because, uh, MUH FEMALE PROTAGONIST. Just an all-around stinker of a movie. Completely ruined the future of star wars for most longtime fans. This movie is worse than a nothing burger of a story, it's a dog sandwich of one."
2770,9,Loved it as a lifelong Star Wars fan.,"This was an incredible story that took some major risks with classic characters. Luke Skywalker has always been my hero, and seeing him go from helplessness to becoming a spark for hope again was chilling! Other than some goofy humor and Rey being way too overpowered... The Last Jedi has become one of my favorite Star Wars films of all time!"
2771,2,"Had this been the first Star Wars Movie, il would have been the last Star Wars Movie.","Who wrote that piece of ,,, ? there is no continuity of the story. We still don't know who is Rey, her parents were nobody (An easy way to spare some intelligence in the storyline), how come she can fix the Millenium Falcon, why is the force with her, Luke Skywalker is now homeless and drinking out of the mammel of a space walrus and they waste 30 minutes of the movie on a boring space chase. I Don't Believe George Lucas wrote that for one second. Di$ney i$ probably making Ton$ of money but they ruined a 6 episode masterpiece."
2772,8,A complete disaster,I'm a fan. I loved The Force Awakens.
2773,8,The Last Jedi,"In my opinion, this movie was so much better than the Force Awakens and almost as enjoyable as Rouge One. It was fun to see Mark portraying the great Luke Skywalker again and seeing some good old characters again. Unlike other reviews, I thought the humor was fine. Sure it was a little different than the original movies but I didn't find it a huge problem. As usual, the visuals were a party for your eyes and John Williams did another wonderful job with his score.However the one thing I didn't really like is how Luke fades away and I'm assuming dies and I didn't really like Rose. I found Rose kinda annoying and useless but other than that, I'm pretty sure the majority of fans will enjoy the latest Star Wars movie."
2774,9,The Last Jedi is a Thought-Provoking Modern Blockbuster Masterpiece,"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' has very little to no flaws. Rian Johnson brings a perfect balance of humor, action, and emotion that is overshadowed by this film's darker tone. Johnson doesn't just make The Last Jedi a pure Star Wars movie, he makes it his own creating an epic sense that is beyond anything we have seen in Star Wars. From beginning to end, The Last Jedi takes what we love from each of the previous trilogies and surpasses them by creating an emotional story of family, friendship, and darkness that makes it the best Star Wars movie of all time by not only satisfying fans of the old generations' stories but by making this generation have their own.<br /><br /> Personally, I think The Last Jedi is outstanding, even if it has minor flaws, cause it is about the characters and every scene and every plot device is to push forward these characters. If you don't like The Last Jedi, that is perfectly fine but for me I think this movie does have very minor issues here and there but an overall masterpiece and achievement in modern blockbuster filmmaking because it is a director's film that is not afraid to tell his own story just like Christopher Nolan and 'The Dark Knight'. "
2775,3,Star Wars: The last time i give Disney my money,"I don't know what i just watched. This movie is utter cringe and is probably the worst Star Wars movie. How is this such a high score on IMDB? There were moments where I sighed. Apparently no one making this film knows what Star Wars is. The acting is BAD yeah worse then Attack of the Clones, dialogue poor and there is no story arc to any of these characters. The film is a mess and poorly written. It's also way too long of what it should be clocking at 2hrs and 30 mins."
2776,9,Very Very Different. But Contasts the Others Perfectly.,No Spoilers Yet- Minor details given- 
2777,2,"Oh, the horrible. It BURNS.","As someone stated on a message board, ""I should have known that it was horrible from the moment that I read that George Lucas loved it."" Like his prequels, it seemed like they were just throwing CG garbage on the screen for the sake of throwing CG garbage on the screen. Most of the scenes between Rose and Finn were the worst offenders. It seemed like their side adventure was getting deeper and deeper into the realm of a Saturday morning cartoon. It culminated in an ultra-goofy moment when BB8 is revealed to be the thing that it shooting up a bridge. He/it looked completely unnatural in that moment like it was in a Space Jam movie. I know that even a lot of J.J. Abrams's critics admit now that there is something to be said for using CG sparingly as he did."
2778,9,What did you expect from the creators of the MCU????,"Let me first say that I do not believe that this is a perfect movie, or even a near perfect movie. The dialogue is very mainstream and there are a lot of characters to keep track of, probably too many at times. The story telling for the most part is somewhat underwhelming with the flooding of characters and messages that were seemingly forced on the audience. This movie suffers from multiple endings and there are some scenes that you wish were paused in the theater to ask around to see if you understood what was happening correctly. For example, I was much more excited after first viewing of VII to see VIII than I am currently to see IX. There are other aspects you could pick apart if you really wanted to, but from what I can see almost all of the recent reviews have been picking it apart like vultures over a recently deceased antelope. "
2779,10,Possibly best Star Wars movie yet.,"Obligatory never written a review before, but the negative reviews triggered me, I guess. "
2780,10,No baby Yoda,I watched the whole thing and couldn't find where everyone is raving about baby Yoda in the new Star Wars movie? I'll still give it an 11 out of 10
2781,4,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"We both feel like we should make this a short and direct review. The moment the film starts it gives us at least a 10 minute action scene, which is actually very entertaining, but then after that it goes directly downhill! All the same characters from The Force Awakens return to The Last Jedi, including loads of new characters. The story leaves off exactly where the last one left off Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds and meets Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). It had the perfect opportunity to impress not only old school Star Wars Die Hard fans, but new Die hard fans. It just didn't impress me Jay And Nick (The Autistic Reviewers)."
2782,9,Fun ride,"I enjoyed the movie despite all the negative comments, I went in with no expectations and came out happy. It was a sci-fi fantasy action movie and thats what it should be watched as."
2783,1,Aside from IMDb's blatant review fixing. Film is straight to DVD movie,"The script could have written itself with decades worth of fan content and expanded universe theories. They could have revisited countless planets and models from the first 6 movies, why did Luke just give up? That's not the Jedi way or a good message. It's a mess, will not be paying to watch any more Star Wars movies."
2784,8,Iconoclastic - in a good way!,"I too am struggling to understand all the negative reviews. There was so much to like about this film, and for me it's the strongest of the series since the 1977 original. There are plenty of spoilers below, so if you've not yet seen it - just ignore the negative reviews and go!"
2785,,Understanding Luke's Motives,"I know that many fans are upset about the choices Luke's character made in Last Jedi. However, as someone who has classified himself as a failure for the majority of my life I can relate the to arc that Luke follows as he begins to doubt himself after his failure with Ben Solo. No! It is not the Jedi way to execute a ""Padawan"" (even in a moment of weakness). This is why Luke stops training young Jedi and goes into hiding. Searching himself for why he felt the need to destroy Ben Solo, Luke confronts his temptation to join the dark side once more. <br /><br />Luke admits it was a momentary lapse that led him to act against Ben Solo, and that moment of weakness shows the audience that even the greatest Jedi Master has more to learn. Luke hesitates to kill Ben as he realizes that darkness has guided his actions. Luke is then left for dead and awakens to see everything he has built destroyed by Kylo Ren. In his sorrow and anguish he recognizes his failure in training the next generation of Jedi as he surrounded by the bodies of his pupils and the burning remains of the Jedi temple he has built. <br /><br />Luke must realize that it was his own doing that has transformed Ben Solo into Kylo Ren. Yes, It was Kylo Ren who killed the Jedi trainees, but it was because Luke was about to kill Ben. Ultimately Luke is responsible for the deaths of his students. He has to see that as he pulls himself from the rubble. <br /><br />Luke's single moment of weakness defined the path that Kylo Ren was not aware was in front of him. Witnessing how ruthless his nephew was added to the torment inside Luke. If there was a line where Luke said ""I did this! It is all because of me!"" the audience might be more understanding of Luke's character arc.<br /><br />Luke's story is how he deals with failure. How he takes full responsibility for not just turning Kylo Ren to the dark side, but for the actions of Kylo Ren who killed the other padawans and burned the temple to ashes. Tempted by the dark side to kill Ben Solo because he sensed Ben being drawn to the darkness, Luke realizes that even the strongest Jedi is not immune to the dark side and if he had killed Ben Solo then he, Luke Skywalker would have turned evil. It makes perfect sense then that Luke would disappear and go into hiding. In that moment of temptation Luke abandoned his Jedi beliefs and if he could be tempted after everything he went through in episodes IV, V and VI, then what hope does any young student of the force have against the dark side? If Luke recognized this (and I believe he did), then his decision to let go of everything in an effort to find inner peace makes sense. <br /><br />Luke acted appropriately to banish himself to the outer reaches of the universe and await death. In his solitude he seeks peace in the only place he can...the first Jedi Temple. Frustrated by his failure by being unable to help Ben Solo control his rage (and knowing how difficult it was for him to overcome the temptation of the dark side as he faced both Darth Vader and the Emperor), Luke Skywalker feared that he could not live up to the legend surrounding his past. <br /><br />The constant fear of training a Jedi who might turn and become the next evil dictator is something that may have been gnawing at Luke's conscience. Knowing that fear is the first step toward the dark side he decided to stop fighting and simply gave up both the good and evil. Luke found the true balance between Light and Dark by recognizing that both exist and counter each other. It is a fascinating study in human behavior to realize how Luke justifies his actions. <br /><br />I know that fans will argue Luke was out of character and on the surface I would agree, but as you peel back the layers of the human psyche to reveal the true meanings and motives behind Luke's actions you will begin to understand why Luke was where he was. Why he acted the way he did. And why he resisted training Rey. Even the lessons Luke does teach are inline with his philosophy of life as he now sees it. Luke lives with the pain of losing everything he built and being tempted or tested again. I believe Luke Skywalker made the only choice he could by sequestering himself from the universe to be the Last Jedi."
2786,9,Think by your own mind,"This probably is my first review. And it's not even a review, but an advice - see the movie and figure out what it means to you all by yourselves. And not by what you read here.<br /><br />Obviously, all ratings from 1 to 6 are fake as Trump and work of fanboys that don't forgive that the story goes on a direction that isn't their one.<br /><br />Plain and simple as that."
2787,10,"We loved The Last Jedi, and saw it twice!","We have been taking our sons to see Star Wars ever since they were very young, and now they are taking us! We couldn't wait to see The Last Jedi, and it did not disappoint. We think that it really encompassed many facets of the story on film that have been lost over the years. Didn't you just love the way Yoda is like he used to be? So many scenes played the way us old timers have been missing in some of the newer films. This one helped to bring all the elements back together. I think if the film makers knew Carrie Fisher was going to die and never make it to the last film, they may have opted to let Skywalker live, but who knew? "
2788,3,What a waste off JJs good work,"It's as if the director has tried to construct a whole new narrative with nothing to do with the current story. He's killed of the main bad dude Snoke before the 3rd film creating a problem for JJ who now has to either invent a new Sith Lord or promote one. The director has tried and failed to make his film a one story wonder, terrible and narcissistic. What also worries me is he's apparently pencilled in to do the following trilogy of sequels. Shame on him I'd want my name no where near this garbage!"
2789,9,Best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back!,"I'm usually too lazy to write reviews, but seeing all the negative criticism directed towards this movie, I felt I had to say something."
2790,2,Thank you for ruining every Star Wars story line that ever meant anything.,Disaster. This franchise should have ended with Return of the Jedi.
2791,10,A few thoughts.,"Hello, world."
2792,10,A Breath of Fresh Air,"The release of a Star Wars film is something of a cultural event that enraptures audiences the world over. No other film series has been analyzed, praised, hated, adored, reviewed, or examined to the degree that Star Wars has seen. I am of the mindset that Star Wars deserves neither the blind praise nor bitter resentment that many harbor towards it. It is, primarily, a film series - and deserves analysis as such."
2793,10,"""There is no Death, there is the Force""","I just want you to know that i'm a new star wars fan, I just watch all the movies last year, and I was not so hyped by this new upcoming movie. But I came into the theatre expecting just the usual, and I came out amazed.<br /><br />Seriously, what are everybody complaining about? Yeah the movie have some issues, but give it a 2? Just 'cause your theory wasn't right, it dosen't mean you have to hate it. I cry so much when Luke became one with the force. Yeah, 'cause he didn't died. ""There is no Death, there is the Force"". Don't you get it? Something new is coming, you must to let the past die!"
2794,1,Not Star Wars at all,"Who's the bitter older fella that drinks blue milk? Absolutely not Luke Skywalker. I didn't even care what happened to him in the end because he has nothing to do with Star Wars. And what's with the casino that was just an absolute waste of film? And was that Leah Organa-Solo or Mary Poppins? Disney people, please do yourself a favour and watch the old Star Wars movies and read a couple of the books. Better yet, take the crew that produced the Mandalorian and give them complete control of any future Star Wars productions. And please get rid of that goofy Resistance or give full control to the Mandalorian crew."
2795,8,1/2 Was Great,"I loved the plot line with Kylo, Rey, and Luke. However, the Resistance plot line was boring, slow, and felt unnecessary. The only reason it was there was to show Finn, Poe, and Leia were still alive. It would have made no difference if the Resistance plot was cut entirely. Whenever it cut to the Resistance, I found myself waiting to return to Kylo, Rey, and Luke."
2796,1,Sasha Baron Cohen would have done a better job. I'm serious.,The film has committed more crimes against humanity that Bashar al-Assad and Putin combined.<br /><br />It single handedly destroyed the hopes of a movie going generation because Disney decided to 'take a chance' and become 'authentic'and original. They certainly managed to make a movie that is authentically rubbish. The director will go down in history as the bloke who destroyed the worlds biggest movie franchise.<br /><br />I have read reviews arguing that you can't have it both way; audiences want a movie true to the franchise but also something that is bold and fresh. Well you can do both things in the one film. Please see rogue one as proof of this.
2797,9,Star Wars it would seem has now spawned it's own fan internet rebellion,I'm stunned reading these reviews and maybe it's time the review section on IMDB went the way of the forums and are retired.
2798,8,Refreshing and worthwhile addition to the Star Wars Saga,"As a life long Star Wars fan, I went into the cinema with an open mind. I'd avoided spoilers and reviews, as I wanted the full impact and surprise of seeing a new Star Wars movie unspoiled and with fresh eyes, not tainted by other peoples opinions. As the movie started with the usual fanfare and crawl, you could feel the excitement and anticipation around the cinema. "
2799,,So Disappointed - no magic in this Star Wars,"I was so anticipating this movie but never in my wildest dreams did I think I was going to leave so unsatisfied. The movie was seriously lacking that Star Wars magic that brings you out of our world and into theirs. The newer characters were confused or confusing in their pointless plot lines. Our beloved Luke Skywalker's character so well established in the initial trilogy just destroyed. Leia flying through space was silly. Everything that we wanted to be addressed from TFA waspretty much just spat on and discarded like garbage. No magic here! prior to seeing this, I was already planning to take my kids to see it as well, but don't want to further invest any more money into this. If I wanted something other than Star Wars, I would have gone to a different movie. The fact that I went to go to watch Star Wars but didn't receive Star Wars but an overly ambitious, meaningless bunch of nonsense makes me really sad. After TFA, I was so looking forward to this. After TLJ, so not caring, no magic and no anticipation. Should have been and could have been so different. Please JJ Abrams - please try and resurrect Star Wars again true to its original form and glory as it means a lot to people who want to see a Star Wars movie and not Star Trek or any other movie for that matter."
2800,10,Literally the Smartest Franchise Movie Ever Created,"What an actual gem. In a sea of cardboard cutout plots and character, scenes obvious created with the sole and utter focus on action as opposed to meaning, and cheap reaction-grabbers in place of depth and interiority, The Last Jedi truly stands out. In what other blockbuster, mainstream film could you find this kind of complexity, metanarrativity, intensely thought out story and plot, and beautiful, rounded development of character and relationships? If it sounds like I'm gushing at maximum sap levels, it's because I am. Somehow this movie manages to convey deeply powerful and nuanced ideas with both clarity and subtlety simultaneously. The exploration of grey morality, individualism vs. affiliation, failure, hope, love, moving on from the past, and other important themes is so incredibly well done - I can hardly believe this is a big-buck movie. This felt more like a fairy tale than anything, with the same painstakingly executed symbolism and Bildungsroman elements, not to mention the gorgeous romance of it all. Already I'm finding so many more clever little layers the more I watch this, and that's the kind of film you know is a great one. A+++ job, Rian and crew!"
2801,1,The last nail in the coffin?,"""The Last Jedi"" is movie #2 in Di$ney's Star Wars sequel trilogy. It receives an OK pass from the first movie in the trilogy, ""The Force Awakens"", and doesn't fumble. But what it shockingly does, is kick the ball into the stands with full force -- on purpose. Then drops its pants, defecates, and takes a swim in it."
2802,9,"I loved it. Unique and quirky, but full of heart.","I guess I'm not completely surprised by all the negativity coming from fans. This movie was in many ways a departure from the rest of the series and took a lot of risk, but I loved it. It felt really refreshing and more like something new than the Force Awakens. It had character, was hilarious, but still fairly heavy and intense. I love quirky little indie movies, and this struck that chord for me while still being a big sci-fi fantasy adventure. It was a great addition to the Star Wars library and my favorite movie since The Empire Strikes Back."
2803,1,A Bad Joke.,"I don't know where to even begin with this movie, as another reviewer has said, it gleefully thumbs it's nose and mocks, via feminist and SJW claptrap, much of what made Star Wars great. Mark Hamill has said that he fundamentally disagreed with almost every decision Rian Johnson made for Luke's character and I've got to say that he's been quite restrained in saying that because what's been done to the character of Luke Skywalker in this movie is nothing short of cultural vandalism."
2804,10,The Star Wars we deserved,"A great Star Wars movie. It took risks, it shattered expectations, it didn't care what Star Wars geeks wanted... it burned the tree down. Add to that beautiful visuals, good pacing, amazing performances, a lot of symbolism and the right amounts of humor, cheesiness and heart."
2805,8,The Star Wars fan base is showing its true colors,When you look at all of these comments you have to imagine how a fanbase can claim to know more about Cinema than the critics who have been doing their work for years. 
2806,9,pseudo fans will ruin star wars IX,"So I'll be straight. I'm from the team that loved the movie. Not only because of the excellent special effects, the photographs, the action scenes and also in my opinion (from now on) the performances - MAs was not only that that made me put The Last Jedi, like one of the best films of the franchise, but by Rian Johssom do what no director would dare to do, and what JJ Abrans (Today I recognize), did not want to do, that was to leave the comfort zone, to present something new to the new public, a range of open possibilities, and not just do the that ALL SEVEN MOVIES did that is bring the same journey of the hero, Siths X Jedis and Skywalkakers and Skywalkers."
2807,2,Ridiculously bad,"Watching this movie you can effortlessly imagine the countless meetings of marketing staff that created this drivel. This is not about telling a story in the best possible way, it's about pleasing as much audience as possible to create after-market opportunities. Unsurprisingly, children age twelve or lower (and adults having retained this intellectual level and attention span) love the movie while mature moviegoers and Star Wars aficionados loathe it. It's all about ""did we include this for target group x?"" or ""do you believe that is strong enough for target group y?"". Lacking a decent script, it's rather a continuation of more or less connected scenes - much like ""The Force Awakens"": Whenever an excuse for a plotline grinds to a halt, a deus ex machinae steps in. Most surprisingly, production values and effects quality aren't too high either. Especially the CGI-Yoda marks a new low. Watch somewhen on free TV, if at all."
2808,10,"A superb film, with daring and unexpected turns","Rian Johnson shows absolute understanding of the Star Wars universe, warts and all, and goes to painstaking lengths to give us something fresh."
2809,5,There is nothing new!,There is nothing new the movie. Even the jokes are old!
2810,8,I am 40 years old .... the force is strong in this one,Am a huge fun of Star Wars ....After the force awakens I thought that Star Wars at my age was dead ... I found the force awakens a very bad movie ....2 years later my childhood dream is back...An epic movie with the battle of light and darkness at the middle... I totally diasagree with the bad critics...
2811,,Boring,"There are too many things wrong with this movie to list, but the biggest problem is that it is simply boring. Skip it."
2812,10,Hold on a minute,"I am honestly confused and frustrated by all the one and two star reviews that this exceptional movie has been receiving. I am really? Y'all think this movie was one of the worst movies ever made? I know, I know, we all did not expect a lot of things to happen that did happen. We constantly argued who Rey's parents were, and who Snoke could be. We didn't see Luke dying the way he did. Totally unpredictable. But isn't that what makes a great movie? I'd say the worst movies are the ones you can predict by watching the teaser trailer. However, those movies are the ones to get nine and ten star reviews while this one gets one and two stars."
2813,8,I'm not cool,"I know it is not cool to like new Star Wars movies but this movie is a good Star Wars movie unfortuately. It understands what Star Wars is good at its core and builds upon it. Its only big flaw is some confusing subplots that doesnt come together and pay off in the end in a neat way. Also, I like that this movie pays its due respects to Empire Strikes Back but also boldly says this is a new movie about new characters, new time, a new generation."
2814,1,"Not Only Is This A Bad Star Wars Movie, It's The End Of The Star Wars Saga.","I wasn't particularly thrilled with The Force Awakens because it seemed like a re-hash of past movies. I was happy to see the old crew and was hopeful all of the new mysteries/questions would get resolved in the next couple of movies. Some of the new players and story lines had me intrigued. Not only did The Last Jedi NOT answer any of the questions that TFA asked, it also took SIX MOVIES worth of history & lore and destroyed them."
2815,10,Great Movie!,"Saw it a second time and thought it was great, great end to Lukr and put to bed the old skywalker movies. Very excited for the up coming movies. Star Wars is in good hands."
2816,3,I CAN'T believe it,I rarely write a review but I feel I NEED to do it this time. I just watched The Last Jedi in 3D on a laser projector and the picture quality was top notch. At the beginning you can clearly see that the 3D effects in this film were going to be awesome. The ships in the opening scene were very detailed in a way I've never seen before in a 3D film.
2817,8,Best Star Wars film!,"Great film - emotion, action, entwining new and old - a classic is born!"
2818,8,A Star Wars worthy of Altman and Eastwood,"Lucas never could have given us a fresh re-examination of his universe. Nor for that matter Abrams or even Spielberg and after seven films it is about time. The Last Jedi is a marvel. That it exists within the ""canon"" is an opportunity seldom available in cinematic history. A major studio, investing hundreds of millions of dollars on a ""skewed vision"" of a tentpole franchise is a brave action by Disney and one I can not praise enough. <br /><br />I get fans feeling betrayed. Our culture of aggrievement certainly doesn't reward those brave enough to challenge audiences' preconceptions. Nitpicking for plot holes, misogeny and dismissive attitudes should be expected, but with greater reflection, those reactions dissolve and the brilliance of Rian Johnson's choices become clearer. <br /><br />Not everyone has sated their appetites of the reckless bucks on their ""hero's"" journeys but for those who are open to something more, the Last Jedi is refreshing, revitalizing and broadening."
2819,10,Sensation film and better with second viewing,"I am completely stumped by what is going on here. I can only guess that everyone with a negative attitude to this film has an anti Disney attitude, or decided how they wanted the movie to go and were dissapointed by what they got instead."
2820,3,Awfull,The only reason I'm giving this film 3 is because of the visuals and quality other then that the film was god awful. It had Dreadful story littered with plot holes. Ruins lukes character and just makes star way worse
2821,10,My New Favorite Episode,"Okay, I'm not the best at judging movies I love. I think TPM and AotC are perfectly acceptable installments of the franchise. I guess I'm sucker for special effects and nostalgia and all that (though I'm not the biggest fan of TFA). I really enjoyed this movie. It's like the satisfying payoff Marvel fans have been waiting for in Infinity War. I may need to watch it again to feel out the problems, but for a first watch, it was great. It answered so many questions left from TFA and even showed flashbacks to what Luke was up to these past thirty years."
2822,1,What could have been!,"First off I saw the movie when it came out and I was completely devastated. I was truly a Star Wars fan boy, I was happy with the first episode of the trilogy and was happy to see rogue one. But that went all down the drain when I saw the movie theaters. I digested for a while And then saw the movie again just recently. If feels like a slap in the face as a moviegoer and especially Morceau as a Star Wars fan."
2823,10,A New Direction,Takes the star wars movies in a bold new direction. what an amazing film! Congrats to everyone who had the courage to make something fresh and new.
2824,10,Best Star Wars movie of all,"I believe this current reviews of the latest Star Wars title are being unfair to the title. The movie was great, you can't expect any better than this... It is the birth of some brand new heroes, we couldn't stick to the old guys forever... Everything has a begining and everything has an ending... it's life! So we just have to embrace the birth of brand new heroes such has Poe, Finn, Rey, Kylo and Rose...It's time to leave the past behind... there are so many good plot twist and the movie becomes so unpredictable that you feel no character is safe, and that is quite something when we live in an era that most of our heroes are unkillable... This movie shines because of it, everything can happen, and you can't predict everything... Rey doesn't need an important and noble bloodline and snoke doesn't need an impressive backstory..."
2825,10,"good, but some flaws","1) biggest mistake was to make fun of Luke, letting him be a joke of a Jedi - we all looked forward to him, and then we get that.. in the cinema i lost a LOT for the movie when that happend. Some gained later tho but not all.<br /><br />2) second biggest mistake is that Luke is not in the last movie.<br /><br />3) we didnt get the touching feelings, you didnt really get the feeling inside your skin, you didnt put yourself in one of the char, somehting was missing.<br /><br />4) A lot are winning about the finn/Rose trip to the casino planet, but I think it was ok, but not great. You cannot just let the main char play off for 2,5 hours.<br /><br />5) why didnt the purple haired shoot her cruiser into the star destroy at the moment she found out it was shooting at the escaping freighters? How hard could it be to figure out?<br /><br />6) Why didnt Luke tell them that there were a back intrance in the mine? <br /><br />7) Rose saving Finn by flying into him just in front of enemy army ? both things should be a 1/100000 survival chance.<br /><br />And many other unexplainable things.<br /><br />Still a great movie."
2826,1,It's as though the makers of this movie didn't even bother to watch the OG trilogy.,Wow! Words cannot describe how bad this movie is. I think this movie went all the way through production with thousands of people involved and not 1 of them bothered to watch the original trilogy. I wont even mention any spoilers. Just avoid this movie at all cost especially if you are a diehard fan of the original trilogy. As I sat in the theater watching this mindless drivel I was actually thinking of how much better Episode 1 the Phantom menace was compared to this dumpster fire of a movie.
2827,10,Moving beyond,"I read a few bad reviews lurking around so I thought I'd give my two cents. <br /><br />I think all those who think this movie ruined their childhood are morons. In fact the reason you fail to recognize the beauty of this movie is the essence of what movie is about.<br /><br />It's about change, going beyond, off with the old, on with the new. "
2828,2,So much potential blown out of the sky.,Let's think back the The Force Awakens (we will be doing a lot of that) -- the entire movie centered around a single plot device: Luke's lightsaber.
2829,,Rian Johnson needs to be sacked!!,"After seeing the force awakens I exited the cinema with joy and excitement to watch it again. I had the same for rogue one, but after watching this film I left the cinema with a feeling of nothing but disappointment! I feel this film just took a massive dump over all its predecessors and made no sense at all! Nothing from the force awakens was answered in a satisfying way if answered at all. It turned the franchises ultimate hero in Luke sky walker into a boring old man who held almost no relevance to the plot. I don't want the story to be the same as the others and I loved the force awakens and all the new characters, but this film just tore it apart in my opinion. The 3 stars I gave all go to the actors and special effects who did great, but the plot and some of the characters arc was just so poor And disappointing it really ruined the film for me. That said I Enjoyed kylo REN in this film and he was probably the best part about this film. I can't see how anyone who worked on the previous film would be happy with this one. Overall I am big Star Wars fan and I am still interested in where it is going, I just feel this particular episode was executed extremely poorly and just took away all the things everyone has been pondering on since the force awakens!"
2830,10,Absolutely the best Star Wars movie ever!,"My first memory in life was seeing A New Hope (or just Star Wars to me) in 1977 when I was three years old. It left an incredible impression on me, and my whole life has revolved around that movie in some way. I have lived and breathed Star Wars for 40 years, and I never thought I would ever feel the same way about a movie, until I saw this entry in the saga."
2831,9,THE LAST JEDI NOT CARING ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT STAR WARS MAKES IT GREAT,*NO SPOILERS HERE*
2832,10,THE Last Jedi is an great Star Wars movie,The Last Jedi is a great movie IN IT'S OWN WAY. It shows the bond between Kylo Ren and Rey that we will explore in the FUTURE. Luke's character isn't bad. Yeah the film has some bad sides but what film doesn't have then. Some people liked it and I'm pround that I like it too. Look Obi-Wan went in to hiding after Anakin went to the dark side and NOBODY IS HATING ON HIM. The fact that Luke thinks the Jedi have to end is because he was afarid that another student would turn against him and that isn't a bad thing. We can't hold on to Luke FOREVER. STAR WARS IS A FILM ABOUT THE SKYWALKER FAMILY AND STILL IS. The fact that it doesn't follow Rey means it follows BEN SOLO(WHO IS SILL A SKYWALKER(MAYBE NOT IN THE NAME BUT IN THE BLOOD)). The next movie will tell the final story of the SKYWALKR family.
2833,3,"Star Wars: Please let if be the last one. (not a new hope, just hopeless)","With the story they had to work with, I would rather have spent 6 hours with Jar Jar Binks then watch this film again. Even if they overdid the CGI on Episodes 1-3, the acting was better, even if the ratings by IMDB were worse. "
2834,8,Very nice but Luke could be much better,"The movie is very intense and I couldn't close my eyes, but I don't like the way they made Luke so hopeless and selfish in the beggining of the movie"
2835,2,Disney has ruined Star Wars,"The jokes in this movie were endless and not funny. I felt like this movie was trying to be a comedy of sorts. The Last Jedi was a combination of episode 4, 5 & 6. They even rehash the same old lines from 4,5 & 6 in this movie. The bad guys aren't even really scary like Vader and the Emperor were in the original Star Wars films. I am so glad I didn't waste my money seeing this in the theatre, but rented it instead and saved money."
2836,,Part VIII: A snuffed hope,"There are so many bad things with this movie, I don't even know where to begin. Let the films die off and save the money before they turn into an even worse joke"
2837,9,The first Start Wars movie I am not feeling stupid about,"I was amazed on the amount of bad reviews for this. If you look on the previous pack of new movies - without CGI they are nothing, the original saga - it is quite straight forward and childish, there is not much to watch in terms of actors performance and Force Awakens was slightly better but awkward. "
2838,8,Why so many haters,"Okay its not a perfect movie! But what do you expect? Was episode 3 tm 6 perfect in every single way. No offcource Not. It is a fine star wars movie, great action and cgi, bringing back to old stuff and giving new elements to the force. Giving it 1 star that just silly..."
2839,10,This is not going to go the way you think,A step in the right direction. Moved on from the original trilogy and created a new fresh storyline. Star Wars fans will never truly be happy with the new movies because either they are too similar to the originals or they're too different.
2840,1,Blasphemous,"If you're even a casual fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, do the galaxy a favor and stay far, far away from this blasphemous convoluted mess."
2841,10,Star Wars like you've never seen it before,"The Last Jedi is a very different Star Wars movie. It does things and goes places with the story and the mythology that other star wars movies have not. Gone is the trope of Good vs. Evil and Light Vs. Dark. Instead we are given a genuinely human story. People are not inherently good or evil, conflict exists in everyone, and I think The Last Jedi portrays this struggle beautifully. The visuals are stunning, the performances exquisite, the action pulse pounding and the story engaging. That is not to say this movie is without it's flaws, the humor is a bit much at times and there are parts that feel unnecessary, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. When this movie isn't at it's best it is still a good movie, and when it gets going it's breathtaking. Rian Johnson has done a great job honoring what we love about stars, as well as doing new things that are bold, and work. The Last Jedi pushes the star wars saga into a new place, that I can't wait to see explored."
2842,3,So uncivilized (this is more of a short critique than a review),"For a Star Wars movie to be worse in 2017 than all of the prequels is pretty shocking. It's one thing to gripe with artistic decisions made by Johnson. For example, I'm not gonna score the movie low cause I think Luke's character was ruined. I'm scoring it low because that decision isn't substantiated by anything that makes logical sense. This is a running theme by the way. Stuff just happens, that on its own would be dumb anyways, but there isn't even a valid reason. Why does Holdo keep the plan secret? Why does Luke borderline murder his own nephew but wouldn't murder his father, arguably the most powerful darkside user of all time? How is Rey the most powerful force user of all time, based off of clear observations anyways? How does Snoke not detect Kylo's betrayal? Who is Snoke? Why does Leia demonstrate a tremendous feat of force capabilities only for no one to talk about or for her to use it again? This movie does not take you in any direction that means anything. The most important part is Luke's death. If you look at every character's arc from before this movie and after, nothing has happened. Snoke never even had an arc or explanation so him being gone already means nothing."
2843,8,The Force persists,"Despite the initial consternation and the poorly acting by John Boyega, alias Finn, The Last Jedi is a film that made me think for a couple of days. After the revival of the franchise with a way too nostalgic episode (something that I could understand, but not accept, due to critics that Lucas recieved for the prequels), I've felt during the probably excessive 2h31m a sense of moving forward, principal aim of the director Rian Johnson."
2844,10,INCREDIBLE FILM - Future Generations will Appreciate,"My wife and I are Star Wars purists. We were little kids when ""A New Hope"" was released, and, like many others, it changed and became a part of our lives. Loved ""Empire"" and really liked ""Return of the Jedi."" Personally, I never bothered seeing the prequels - I was so turned off by the look of the films from the commercials, I knew they would hurt my heart. (Many purists have since confirmed that I made the right decision.) My wife and I both loved ""The Force Awakens"" but still, nothing would ever replace ""A New Hope"" as the best of them all in our hearts. "
2845,9,"Well, that just happened...","I am a Star Wars nerd. Die-hard. I have watched the original trilogy countless times and to a lesser extent, the prequels. I saw the Last Jedi last night and boy oh boy.. it was quite the ride. The last Jedi took Star Wars to places it had never been which, as a fan, was really interesting. I won't say this is a perfect movie (like some people) or that this was an awful movie (like other people) but I will say, this movie is better than all the prequels and despite it's many flaws, I sit it next to The Force Awakens. "
2846,2,Does Disney hate Star Wars or something,Again before I start ranting just to start things off this is the eighth movie from the chronological order and it takes place The Force Awakens.
2847,10,I really think this is the best star wars movie since TESB,"When i saw this movie.I cry ,I laugh,I wonder and I really can't imagine what's gonna happend.<br /><br />The drama was really fantstic.<br /><br />It's true a star wars TDK.<br /><br />AWSOME!"
2848,1,Abomination.,An absolute abomination of everything we loved about Star Wars.
2849,10,Why I need to defend The Last Jedi's rating,The reason you won't find many great reviews on here has a lot to do with the hate generated by the vocal minority of so called 'fans'. 
2850,8,Such a Beautiful Film,"All those zero star reviews leave me completely puzzled. This would mean that there was no other film that was significantly worse"" (by whatever standard). Those reviews therefore cannot be taken seriously and I am with the professional critics on this one."
2851,10,"""Try to insert a smart title to rate the movie 2/10, the review""","Awesome Star Wars movie, with some of the best scenes in the star wars history, also has a problem with trying to be comedic at a times and not being able to. Id rate this film an 8/10 an encourage everyone who has watched star wars to go and see it for themselves, placing a 10/10 just to bring some balance to the hate trend train."
2852,1,Gut wrenching depression.,"The movie itself from the very start of the first scene which is a space battle, was completely and utterly illogical and technically incorrect. Watching this was like seeing a best friend die a horrible death that filled you with both gut wrenching depression as much as terror as it continues."
2853,10,This was one of the best Star Wars Episode ever Spoiler Warning before spoilers,With out spoilers I like to add the way they portrayed Luke Skywalker in this movie is perfect for the Luke we got at then of Episode 5 he barley had any training between 3aby and 4aby aka (Episode 5: Empire Strikes Back and Episode 6: Return of the Jedi) Don't listen to all these cry baby OT purist this movie was so amazing that I actually went to see it a second time to see what I missed and Still loved it then I pre-order the movie right when I got home from my first showing
2854,3,A long time ago when people could write,"Do you remember a time that Star Wars films were cool and they had actors that weren't wooden toys. So do I while Disney has created some great movies over the years. It's 3 Star Wars films are not and this last attempt and resurrecting an old franchise has fallen on death ears. While children that have not watched the films are treated to disney at it's so called fiWe remember the scenes that made the movies like the death of Luke's aunt and unkle in episode 4, Han frozen in episode 5 Luke's struggle against the dark side in episode 6.<br /><br />While there is some great flash and bang scenes and generally what you might want from a Star Wars film. It's missing something like the connection to the hundreds of books that got spawned from the series. Great job mr Abrams for being to lazy to read the continuum and leaving the writing to writers or the so called hacks that wrote this story. "
2855,8,A Disturbing Lack Of Faith From Those Who Believe themselves To Be Fans,"From reading the rest of the reviews here it seems the Star Wars fan base (Possibly a very vocal minority) have watched the film and looked to find all the faults they possibly can, attributing their own interpretation as Canon. I love Star Wars and I loved The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi to me felt quite distant from the fan service nature of TFA and Rogue One and while both were excellent films I feel Rian Johnson's take on this Chapter of the Saga was fresh and served a strong story and a great 2nd film. By no means is this film without fault, I felt the Dreadnaught 'Chase' and subplot on the Canto Bight were quite forced and took away from the pacing of the movie, if it were more involved with Rey's journey I would be happier but alas it only intersected in the end. I wish there was more to Snoke than what happened although I am now more invested in the journey Kylo is taking through this story. The redemption in this film for me was in fact Luke Skywalker and the interaction of the old and the new, it seems many fans are failing to understand that their interpretation was not the one Rian went with and his situation isn't what they wanted but I enjoyed all the moments he had on screen and was happy as a Star Wars fan to simply enjoy what was there. I could understand people not enjoying parts of this film but to rate it 1-3 stars is a joke. It had all the character of the previous films and took it in a different direction, people complained TFA was too similar and now TLJ is too different, with a franchise this big you cannot win but for me I cannot wait for the next instalment and the culmination of what both JJ and Johnson have created because while everyone is not happy with the way this turned out they need to take a step back and appreciate the decisions which have been made, trust in the filmmakers and just as we believed in George on the original trilogy believe in Johnson on this because we only understand the universe as far as the films and this is what we have to work off of."
2856,9,you're all wrong,"This movie is ace.<br /><br />Look at the other films in the series and they all have one liners, pointless characters and some bad acting. So what, this is a star wars film and one of the best. <br /><br />Us......the fans are destroying star wars. Just because the director did not give you exactly what YOU wanted boo hoo. This is for the die hards yeah but mainly for the next generation to enjoy and later find the other movies also. Move on people and enjoy these films for what they are and stop acting like babies who have thrown their dummy out the pram."
2857,10,As a long time fan absolutely brilliant,I will keep this review spoiler free but from start to finish the movie keeps you guessing. Characters still relatively new to the Star Wars franchise become really something in this movie. If any doubts were had as to where this trilogy was headed all doubts are gone.
2858,1,Lame,"I want to keep it short, so here's a brief list of beefs:"
2859,10,Very nice movie,"I simply cant understand why there were so many haters. The movie is quite fun, touching and not that predicatable. Look forward to the next episode."
2860,2,bad bad bad,"SW TLJ ruined SW for me ,his movie is so bad that a huge fan as i am begged for it to end.... bad as bad can be"
2861,10,THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!,"Let me just start by saying that I am 43 years old, so Star Wars has been a huge part of my life since I can remember. I didn't get a chance to see this movie until Tuesday, so I read some of the user reviews on IMDB and they scared me. I just didn't think I could endure another Phantom Menace, and that's what the user reviews had me thinking this was. "
2862,9,"By no means a perfect movie, but a great movie nonetheless","This is my first review on IMDB and let me start by saying I am a child of the 80s who grew up loving Star Wars. As a result, I loathe the toxic fanboy culture that has consumed this franchise. All they want to do is dump on Disney, the actors, the directors, the producers, the writers, and everyone associated with carrying this story forward into the future. They are like pathetic junkies looking for the ""perfect high"" that jacks their addiction to the next level while reminding them of their first rush. Then afterwards, in order to maintain their ""cred"" they compete to be the harshest critic to establish dominance in their very pathetic cabal of losers. As a professional creative, let me just say that the work that has gone into these new movies has been astonishing. Where most successful franchises only explore prequels or reboots (for the fan service and financial safety), very few attempt to write new chapters. I applaud Disney, JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson and this marvelous cast (newbies and vets alike) for trying to create something truly new and special. The injection of life and extension of the saga into uncharted territory has been joy and privilege to watch."
2863,8,"""To boldy go...""","It's pretty simple: if you take out the prequels, ever SW movie since The Empire Strikes Back, almost 40 years ago, revolves around the bad guys building a planet/star-killer thingy (and the good guys trying to destroy it) - Return Of The Jedi, Rogue One, The Force Awakens... Well, this one is different, and obviously the planet/star-killer-thingy-get's-blown-to-bits type of story loving fans, are not going to take it. "
2864,1,How to murder a billion dollar franchise in a single movie.,"Subversion, subversion subversion. Why write a coherent story or consistent characters when you can contort your character arcs and betray their history for SUBVERSION. Subversion is good thing right guys? This story for lack of a better word, is trying to pack as much subversion as possible to mask the fact that Rian Johnson has no idea what he's doing, nor does he seem to care. He thinks he's a visionary writer or something because he can pack as much subversion into this pile of excrement he offers to us as a movie. Who cares if it doesn't make a lick of sense, here quick look at this porg."
2865,8,Not the disaster everyone is making it out to be,"The Last Jedi is not The Force Awakens. Some words I would use to describe the latter are conservative, safe, familiar; the former by contrast is complex, surprising, unnerving, and at times just plain weird. It's not the Star Wars we're used to, but I would argue, unlike most of the reviews I've seen thus far, that in most cases - but not all - Rian Johnson's new take on the Skywalker saga is effective and compelling."
2866,1,"A big F U to Star Wars fans, but a great movie if you hate Star Wars and it's fans.","This film destroys everything you loved about Star Wars for the sake of race and gender diversity. Nothing wrong with either of those things, but having it forced down your throat is a problem and leads to pointless story lines. I don't know how Disney is going to come back from this. I'm not the only life long fan that's been turned off from the franchise. But that seems to be their goal. Out with the old and in with the new was this films theme. I guess I'll check out Star Trek."
2867,8,A fun twist on the Star Wars Universe,"To start out, this in my mind is no where near the crash and burn that Episode 1-3 were, and the fact that it is receiving lower ratings doesn't make sense to me. This adaptation takes risks, and helps people understand deeper the meaning of the force in an interesting way. "
2868,,Johnson stares down Fanboys and dares to be different...and it pays off,"It's clear at this point that this movie is the most controversial Star Wars movie to date. But why!? One look at the user reviews and you would think that this was a horrible movie, yet alone horrible Star Wars movie. Unfortunately, what you're really witnessing however, is a lot of emotional immaturity brought on by individual expectations of what this movie should have been, according to die hard Fanboys, rather than what it dares to be. Which is a refreshing, daring and exciting take on the possibilities of what the Star Wars universe can evolve into whilst simultaneously, albeit respectfully, coming to a conclusion to the Skywalker storyline in Epic Fashion. Passing on the torch to Rey and Kylo's story and the future of The Resistance and it's struggle against The New Order. "
2869,10,THIS IS SO GOOD !!!,Absolutly amazing ! Rian Johnson refreshes Star Wars with his directive style and storytelling that subverts every expectations we came to have for a Star Wars movie or a classic Holywood blockbuster. I'm sure that The Last Jedi will be considered as a classic in few years !
2870,10,The best and worst star wars movie at the same time,"The worst : While I thought Disney has nailed humour (a bit from time to time) it makes no doubt that many scenes were there only to sell toys later, and the first half of the movie I was very afraid to be disappointed. As a long time star wars fan I was pretty disappointed with that direction. While this is no Jar Jar Binks level it certainly is too much."
2871,1,Easily the worst star wars ever,Took all the build up from force awakens and threw it in the trash. Not sure who Mark Hamil was playing but it wasn't Luke Skywalker. Haven't seen the character since return of the Jedi and still have yet to see him again. The idea that Rey is a Mary Sue has been confirmed. Nothing she did made me care about her at all. In fact I don't really care what happens to her anymore. Rose and the purple hair feminist are the two worst characters in the movie. Rose is the worst of all 8 movies. Even worse than Jar Jar Binks. I used to be excited about star wars but this movie has killed any anticipation for the future.
2872,8,"A new, fresh addition to a franchise often over reliant on nostalgia","Good: The Last Jedi finally adds something fresh and new to the Star Wars franchise. Its definitely the most intellectual of the series by further defining the concept of the force and exploring another side to these galactic wars with Finn and Rose's journey to Canto Bight. Despite these additions, the film is still bustling with energy. The action scenes, namely towards the end, are some of the best in the franchise. The film also takes unexpected turns with its portrayal of Luke Skywalker and a huge twist at the end as well. The controversial twists and turns are what makes TLJ so refreshing. It is also important to note that the, now loved, Empire Strikes Back was hated by many fans upon its release, who rejected its bold direction. The Last Jedi is no different in this sense, change is good in order to keep a franchise moving forward - its just the fanatics that need to grow up."
2873,1,Guardians of the Fury Road Galactica,The first couple of minutes set up the tone for the rest of the movie. 
2874,9,Never seen so many dummies spat from prams!,"Oh how dare the Star Wars franchise give the world something unexpected!! How dare they not just dole out the usual obvious plot lines and go in totally forceable directions with the story... Anyone who gives this movie 1/10 is doing so in a pathetic hissy fit way that a spoiled kid would, and if you all don't want to watch anymore, fair enough... Stay at home in your bedroom wingeing to your 'online' friends... It's a great movie.. Everyone in the cinema I was in loved it, including me.. Now... Here's your dummy back.. Spit away.."
2875,8,I thought it was pretty cool,"It followed along some of the plot drivers as the original series, which works with the new worlds, new characters and better special effects. I agree that the Finn plot line didn't really add much (and got a bunch of people killed), but it was entertaining. <br /><br />As far as the Jedi stuff, the Force always wins, and Luke is right to point out the senselessness of trying to control it. Reys background is given, which helps explains Darth Vaders origin as well. One thing I thought when I was watching that fight on the salt planet, evidently the battle of Hoth wasn't well documented, because guys in trenches dont really work (there are a few things like this). But it was fun, entertaining, and had some unexpected twists and turns in it."
2876,9,Loved it all 3 times,"Yes, I saw this 3 times. And NO I was not upset that Lei lives and flies through space. I thought this movie was exciting, the characters were great, the story was well told and as a bridge film surprisingly satisfying. I loved it. I think the ""user"" reviewers are full of BS with their nit-picking and cannon nonsense. I have been a star wars fan since the first film and I think this one fits in with the first three 4-5-6 ! In every way. Loved it. Laughed, and enjoyed and was thrilled by this newest instalment. Happy that the newer films are diverse, powerful, and effin awesome. Can't wait for the next one."
2877,2,The most boring film from Star Wars,Dialogues were superb annoying and story was just not worth to watch. I am definitely disappointed about this film and prequels.
2878,8,Star Wars wins again,"The Last Jedi is an awesome addition to the Star Wars universe. It's entertaining, fun, and I believe it to be the deepest Star Wars movie to date. It focuses heavily on the force and how it works to balance the light and the dark. This brings something new to the table of Star Wars, and has changed the way I view the previous movies, to a degree. For me I had to watch this 4 times, and loved it every single time. I cannot wait till 2019 for the conclusion of this trilogy."
2879,1,Star Wars : The Franchise Killer,"How can someone kill a behemoth of a movie franchises that was Star Wars? The Last Jedi is the answer. Nothing about this movie is good : story, acting, lore. Somebody might say that the visuals and cgi are good, but they dont matter if the movie is horrible. The overall style of new star wars feels like refurbished version of original trilogy, nothing new or innovative is shown to the viewer. Just look at movie Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017), and compare overall visuals. In 90s The Last Jedi visually would be impressive, but now it looks bland and boring. This movie was rushed out to soon and made wihout love and passion, the result is the real fanchise killer."
2880,10,Amazing movie. There is simply no pleasing some fans.,The Last Jedi does not fail to leave you mesmerized. The various homages to Empire and cameos that will leave you with a sense of closure and wholeness. Not to mention a smile that you won't be able to get off your face. 
2881,9,Fan expectations hurt TLJ but it's the most psychologically engaging SW film since the 80s.,What happens when a 23-year-old who idolized his father and wanted to be with him so badly no longer has his father's redemption to guide him when facing a similar evil 30 years later? That's the basic question Johnson strives to find out in the misunderstood The Last Jedi. 
2882,8,Ignore the fan boys unable to evolve,"Star Wars is about a small group of brave resistance against totalitarianism. Pluralism vs dogmatic purity. Hope vs despair. This film captures that beautifully especially in the opening sequence, with sacrifice and dedication. "
2883,1,Gender politics in star wars,"Even without the blatant old white men are evil and young diverse females are the way forward scenes, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character is my favorite action character ever, which I woke up too, this too will be forgotten."
2884,10,Don't listen to the crybaby fanboys,I am one of the biggest Star Wars fans you'll ever meet. This movie is amazing. The acting the imagery and the scenery are outstanding. One of the more smarter films in the franchise. Character development is amazing and anyone stating it ruined or killed their childhood needs to grow up. The philosophy of the Jedi is being seen in all aspects of the stories and in the characters.
2885,4,"Beautiful, but disappointing.","The movie is visually exquisite. The special effects are spectacular! It has one of the best light saber fight scenes out of all the Star Wars movies. It has Star Wars characters but it doesn't have a Star Wars feel. If TLJ was a stand alone film or if you had never seen any Star Wars movies you'd probably like it. However to long time fans it was a slap in the face. Would Harry Potter fans enjoy watching Harry break his wand, turn his back on magic, and abandon his friends? Would Marvel fans enjoy watching Tony Stark scrap the Iron Man suit and quit the Avengers? Of course not. Fans would be wigging out. Imagine this kind of character betrayal except with Luke Skywalker."
2886,10,FANTASTIC!!!! Unpredictableand Amazing Movie!!!!THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE,Fantastic....so fantastic...... From the beginning until the end of movie is fantastic!!!! Ryan johnson is amazing!!!! I love the ending of movie... Luke skywalker the greatest ever character in star wars!!!! Fantastic...
2887,9,A breath of fresh air,"I must admit that this movie is on the top of my personal favorites, alongside 5 and 3. What I really liked about it was the brave new approach to the Star Wars universe that it's creators took."
2888,9,I saw it three times in theaters.,It felt true to the original universe. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley give incredible performances. It had a couple hick ups with pacing but I loved it and I want to watch it again and again.
2889,4,Has nothing to do with star wars,"This movie doesn't further the story whatsoever, and purposely goes out of its way to disappoint fans."
2890,10,Amazing!,First SW movie to really draw an emotional response from me and the entire audience in some great and unexepected plot twist moments!
2891,2,STAR WHIMPS: The Last Joke,Gave this creation 10/10 before actually watching it. Afterwards decrease it to 5/10 and this morning after sleeping on it decided to put an end to this with 2/10 with anger and sadness in my heart.
2892,,"Good intro, a middle a little boring, phenomenal ending.","A lot of people REALLY hate this movie, but honestly I really liked it. There were a few things a didn't like, but more things that I did like."
2893,9,Very Good Star Wars Movie,"The Last Jedi is a very good star wars movie. It may not be the best ever but it is much much better than ""Force Awakens"" and one of the best sequel movie after the original trilogy."
2894,8,Just enjoy it. It's fun.,"Just accept that star wars you know was past. stop searching for a high as those ones and be graceful for seeing Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher on the screen, have fun. Don't expect any deep philosophy, scientific accuracy or foundation shaking lore additions."
2895,9,Incredibly Deep and Moving Film - NO SPOILERS!!,"Well, like all fans of Star Wars, I have been anticipating this moment for some time now. I expected some good writing and character development. I was expecting something EPIC. Thankfully, the director must've read my mind! Oh how epic it is! I would have given it 10 stars, but I think they may have made this movie just a little too deep. Some people might get confused by how complex the plot is and how amazingly thought provoking the reveals were. "
2896,1,Too bad,"Was really wanting to like this- but can't. Not even worth a rewatch. Tone, character writing were way off. And the story....awful. Gave it a 1 for some nice visuals and sound design here and there. Actors did well with the cards they were dealt, and John Williams always on point."
2897,10,An amazing work of art!!!,"I love this film so much. It accomplished exactly what great art should. It is so brilliant that the film is about what so many who don't understand it don't like about it. One of the main themes is about attachment. Those who don't understand the film are attached to what they believe star wars is, was and is supposed to be, but everything in our world, including star wars, must change in order to make room for whats next. I've been a fan of the star wars universe since I was about nine years old. I grew up watching all of them, and I enjoy them all. I see them as an important American mythology, and am grateful that we're adding more amazing stories to the mythos. Those who go into the experience of this film with expectations and longing for an older story will not be pleased. That goes for any experience you go into with expectations. Metaphysically you are unable to accept whats in front of you because you want to see something else. This is an honest film about letting go of what no longer serves us. Things such as dogmas, nostalgia, toxic masculinity, selfishness, fear, dishonesty and past world views that stagnate what is being born in the present. Many thanks to all who put their heart and soul into this work of art. Looking forward to the future of this important and very human story!"
2898,2,Pretty Poor,"This was a pretty poor effort for a Star Wars film, probably the worst I have seen, bar the holiday special. It strayed too far from the original Star Wars formula, the things that made the films great, and as a result it just didn't fit in that universe for me."
2899,9,The force is still strong in star wars.,"I see many are bitter with disappointments. I believe the reason is because they don't like changing and want same thing and predictable but then they won't be happy just like The Force Awaken. Some Fans are never gonna be satisfied because of high expectations and overly analysts . So get your head out of the ass and think about the whole thing. Think you make it better? I believe Rian Johnson took the responsibility and did delivered. So he spent two years on it and then raging kids decided to take 2 hours and 40 mins to watch and take 3 sec to rate low with ""IT SUCKS"", cheap and lazy. "
2900,8,This is a good movie.,I have to disagree with most of these reviews here. If you give this movie a 1-3/10 you are not being objective. I suspect many people expected very specific things from this movie and their disappointment over not getting what they wanted influences their rating/review.
2901,8,"ESTÁ TERRIBLE WENA, LLORONES CULIAOS","PUROS LLORONES CULIAOS, AGUANTE LA PELI<br /><br />ESTÁ TODA WENA"
2902,1,Abysmal,"The only word which can sum up The Last Jedi is abysmal. There's nothing I can say which hasn't already been said but it really was the lowest point for Star Wars. Shame all the hard work put in by actors, effects team, designers etc was sunk by the most inept and selfish director, project lead and producers. Truely the last straw, Disney."
2903,10,Star Wars: The Ultimate Force Wielding Film,"This film is an instant epic, of classic proportions. The audience I was with was quite notably the most noisiest audience I have ever been to the cinema with, at least until the opening scroll started. Then silence, with the exceptions of the well timed and brilliantly executed funny moments in which I felt at one with all the strangers around me. They instantly became my family.<br /><br />(Oh not forgetting the gasps and the deafening silence which were more or less one after another.)"
2904,1,I just didn't understand it.,"I have been a Star Wars fan for a long time, I've written fan fictions, I've even developed Star Wars video games, I've done my research and know allot about the universe. But for the life of me, I did not understand the Last Jedi, I just didn't."
2905,8,Complete disregard of Star Wars tropes? Finally!!!,"So nothing changes in this movie from beginning to end, the plot is pretty pointless, nothing happens, and there's an evident intent to go over the usual schemes of mind persuasion, of hidden good sides, and schemes for attacks..."
2906,10,Best film ever!,"I wasn't fortunate enough to see TLJ during its original release in 2017, also I wasn't in the SW fandom at the time."
2907,10,EPIC,"This was an excellent film. Some minor flaws, but nothing really worthy of ruining the movie. There was one scene in particular that was probably the best in all of Star Wars."
2908,3,The Force Awakens was poor quality...,...So they decided to kill the franchise all together...
2909,9,I loved it and so did the people I went to see it with,"The theater gasped multiple times as I watched The Last Jedi. There are several moments that shock you. There are also lots of laughs and ""gee whiz why didn't I ever think of that"" scenes. The themes of the film are about power and aggression and when its right to use it. Kylo Ren inherited a great power and feels entitled to use it, where Luke has become disenchanted with his power having seen the side effects. Leia and the Resistance understand their greatest power comes with endurance and self-preservation. "
2910,2,WALT DISNEY IS RUINING THE STARWARS FRANCHISE,WALT DISNEY IS RUINING THE STARWARS FRANCHISE
2911,8,Just visiting with old friends,Last Jedi review
2912,10,My top Star Wars movie for sure...,Our generate has been pampered with super heroes to save all day but we should be aware that is not the case in Star Wars. For me the story aligns to the saga and it turns out it gives real in-depth meaning what really Jedi is.
2913,10,I LOVED THIS MOVIE,"Going in to this movie I have read Star Wars canon book. All of the comics. This was a great Star Wars movie. I think the main thing I loved about this movie is that I can't change any of it. There may have been some I didn't like, but that has always been Star Wars. There was way more great than bad. What was displayed made sense. Unanswered questions lead to imagination. If everything was told from the start we wouldn't have had 40 years of amazing speculation and lore as we continue this great story. Everything they did with the force built upon the groundwork laid by Yoda and Obi-Wan. I loved the choices they made and there were some of the coolest visual and impactful scenes of the whole saga. Great movie and I can't wait to watch it 50 more times. ""That's how we're going to win, not by fighting what we hate, but saving what we love."""
2914,1,And you thought Force Awakens was bad...,"Mum jokes??? <br /><br />If i'm cringing at a film in the first 5 minutes, then I have a very bad feeling about this. <br /><br />If i'm still cringing for 150mins then I should have left after 5 minutes."
2915,8,"Incredibly satisfying, exciting, and surprising",Is it a bit different sure. People would be pissed if it was more of the same. And in no way does it stretch to far from being a proper Star Wars movie. Minor issues but 100% incredibly satisfying.
2916,1,NO SPOILERS,"How bad is this movie? On opening night of STAR WARS multiple groups walked out of the theater. At the end of the movie, instead of applause, the audience booed."
2917,10,The best movie of the year.,"When I was young, I watched Star Wars in my home with my family, but I was the only who liked. Today, I've been teaching my nephews and my students to have a worship of this wonderful story. I still love this story and to watch The Last Jedi I had the confirmation of why I am so in love with Star Wars."
2918,10,So fresh and everything is headed in exciting directions,"This Star Wars did something, maybe something different than others. It felt so fresh and exciting by heading into unknown territory. It actually dove deep into so many themes that are so true to the core of what Star Wars is: sacrifice, balance, truth, death and rebirth, old and new etc. and propped these up by unbelievable tension through characters and plot line. "
2919,,Wanted so much to love this,So gutted to say that I really didn't. 
2920,8,You guys aren't just mean,This movie is actually very good with many relevant themes including one explicitly stated in the film. Let the past die. The only way to continue to make good Star Wars films is to make changes to the universe it takes place in. The change of pace was nice and refreshing. And I guarantee you all don't actually know the character of Luke Skywalkervlike you say you do.
2921,3,Trying to kill Star Wars?,"After reading a lot of the reviews, I feel that everything about this movie was already covered.<br /><br />I will just add this: I HAVE SEEN PORN MOVIES WITH BETTER PRODUCTION THAN THIS!!!"
2922,9,A Wonderfully Crafted Deconstruction of Everything we Know and Love,"Director Rian Johnson knows what Star Wars is - that much is obvious. At times, it even seems as though he understands Star Wars better than its original creator George Lucas. Johnson knows what makes it special, what fans want to see, and what makes a Star Wars film - well - a Star Wars film! So Johnson does what any good director of a Star Wars film does - he gives us fans exactly what we want to see!"
2923,3,Unbelievably awful,This movie wasted so much time on side plots that ultimately amounted to nothing tangible to the main plot. I can't believe this script was signed off by so many people. There are so many classic mistakes that first-time writers make. This should not have happened when you think about the massive budget for this movie. It looks like they spent all the money on visuals while completely ignoring the characters. This is especially bad considering that Star Wars is a character-driven story. At least it was.
2924,8,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is pretty good : D,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn't as bad as people say. I must recoginze there is some stuff that doesn't work, but it isn't strong enough to ruin the movie."
2925,10,My Favorite of Them All,"My wife and I are Star Wars purists. We were little kids when ""A New Hope"" was released, and, like many others, it changed and became a part of our lives. Loved ""Empire"" and really liked ""Return of the Jedi."" Personally, I never bothered seeing the prequels - I was so turned off by the look of the films from the commercials, I knew they would hurt my heart. (Many purists have since confirmed that I made the right decision.) My wife and I both loved ""The Force Awakens"" but still, nothing would ever replace ""A New Hope"" as the best of them all in our hearts. "
2926,9,Tour De Force *Spoiler Free*,"The Last Jedi is the first film that steps away from tradition. It's the first to dance to its own beat. The ""This is not going to go the way you think"" line from the trailers, is true for potentially everything that happens. Suddenly all the rumours you have heard or imagined equate to nothing. Aside from the fact that the difference between the new actors and the veterans is vast in terms of acting ability, the film's overall story, easter eggs, in particular the cinematography and soundtrack are now the gold standard for the series. Aside from one instance, the VFX from the series which started industrial light and magic are beautiful, with a great balance of practical and cgi working in perfect harmony. The film has some truly beautiful shots and one light sabre battle in particular was perhaps the best and the coolest there has ever been in Star Wars. Some wired story threads and a slightly dubious ending are not enough to ruin what is easily the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes back. More importantly, the film does what the Force Awakens couldnt..... Star Wars is reborn.<br /><br /> 9/10"
2927,1,Honestly A Travesty,Worst SW movie since Force Awakens. Truly horrible. Hate it. Would rather eat rusty nails and crushed glass before watching another film like this one.
2928,9,Unexpected but great,I really enjoyed this movie. As a Star Wars movie it felt familiar but fresh und often did not give into the twists you expect. All the mayor characters are allowed to move forward and grow. All the deaths are well earned and the ending is well set up during the course of the movie. It has great details and a great re-watchability factor. Were the middle chapter in a trilogy can be a bit weak this movie stands well on its own and at the same time leaves you excited about what is still to come.
2929,1,My condolences to hardcore fans,This movie is so unbelievably bad. It's like someone lost a bet to see how much they could try and ruin the franchise in one movie.
2930,10,Best Star Wars made yet.,"This is a movie for fans who understand the force and that most of Luke's actions were dark and that this was his saving grace to make up for all his attacks and killings in the past (ep6 on the barge), (attacking Vader 1st twice in two different movies, his hate and rage and dark side he used to disable Vader on the Death Star before his light side choice to sacrifice himself for his father and allow Anakin to actually defeat the Emperor as it was always said that he would and defeat the Dark Side. <br /><br /> I have never been a fan of Luke because when things got tough he left, after the battle of Hoth he ran away, during the battle of the DS shield on Endor he ran away to confront his father abandoning his friends to whatever fate awaited them so in direct disagreement with Mark Hamill I think this Luke did exactly what he would do when some as strong rose to oppose him and he couldn't deal with it. Run away and hide away and wait for someone to deal with it. <br /><br /> To be honest I wasn't expecting him to show up at the end to confront Kylo, I was expecting Wedge or Hoping maybe even Thrawn or someone else to come in and save the rebellion but it was Luke in a twist of fate and that wow he finally got up the courage to over come his fear of what he had created and took responsibility for his error in trying to murder a child. <br /><br /> For the rest of the movie, there hints of Zahn masterful writing of Thrawn's thought process in both Leia and her next in command and if you have questions about the force there are so many references to Karpyshyn's writing of Bane and the basis for the force were scattered throughout and if you have read them then they explained the force so elegantly and beautifully. <br /><br /> It is a movie about characters trying to find out who they are, where do they fit while being a relay with the older characters handing off the baton to the next group with the Death of Ackbar and the Rise of Poe and the lessons in subtly and bravery and surviving that he needs to learn in order to take the place as leader of the rebellion (my hope at least) and become the next General. Finn finding out that he is so much more than he thinks he is and his struggle to find out that he is brave, he can stand up to those stronger than him because he needs those around him and they make him strong. <br /><br /> The baton has been passed, Leia (we will miss her) doesn't need to make an appearance in the next segment as she isn't needed anymore, the old stories have fallen into legend and new legends, new heroes have risen for a galaxy under the reign of the First Order both Evil and Good and it was exciting. <br /><br /> The fight scenes were wonderful, it seems like they had a person who had actually been in a bar fight or dare I say it to war and fought to survive and know that an honest person to person battle lasts a minute maybe less and then you either move or something else intervenes. For a moment if you read the books you see hints of the Jason and Jaina that we all love in the duet battle on Snoke's chamber that makes anyone who read books to feel that twelve year old child giddy from their fights throughout the galaxy back to back against evil and then they spin it rather wonderfully in a way that you know things are going to change. <br /><br /> I actually can't give this movie credit enough especially since I went in reading reviews of how terrible it was and a let down but I came out cheering and thanking Disney that finally got a SW right and made a beautiful movie in the background and forefront and opened up the possibility of really good dare I say epic books to follow."
2931,9,Better than rouge one and the force awakens,"The movie felt more like the first 6 star wars movies, i personally enjoyed this more than the force awakens and rouge one."
2932,9,"It's a great one, I don't understand such bad reviews","In my opinon even better than Episode VII. A bit long, some parts of the plot could be shorter, but definitely a great episode. Even if some committed SW fans may dislike it, this movie doesn't definitely deserve those 1 or 2 stars."
2933,1,Garbage movie,"This movie is embarrassing all Star Wars Universe, not worth to watch. the first movie was super bad enough, and this.... this is just way more idiotic movie. Jedi is not God. all new nonsense power all new rules, new boundary and the character are just idiotic. A darth with too much emotion and such a crybaby. it disgust me."
2934,,Luke,Killing Luke was a mistake...Disney will LOSE money!!! That was WRONG!!!!
2935,8,"Unexpected, yet not contrived.","TLJ has some unexpected narrative twists and changes in character that will unnerve many. Fans seem to be complaining in particular in the changes in Luke's character, suggesting that this was not 'my Luke'. It is worth remembering that Luke always seemed capable of dark acts (for example when cutting off his father's hand) however we as an audience know that this is always with one purpose, to preserve the light. The same can be said of the brief moment in TLJ when Luke ignites his lightsaber on his nephew, Kylo Ren. <br /><br />The film is visually breathtaking. The planet 'Crait' could be one of the best ever created, and in general the special effects are the most impressive yet (see Holdo's sacrifice as a particularly spectacular scene).<br /><br />Although the film sometimes struggles to balance its tone in the same way as Empire Strikes Back, for example, its missteps are often its strengths. I advise the fans to accept TLJ's flaws, and instead admire its bravery."
2936,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever,"I just watched the TLJ blu ray last night. I've read many spoiler-free reviews from IMDB so my expectation was quite low. Gee, they were damn right! Today I spent another two and half hours to read more lengthy negative reviews and this is a far more satisfying than the movie itself! I won't repeat other reviewers' well-thought points. Just add a few lines that I really want to spill out:"
2937,8,This Movie is Better Than What the Reviews Here State,"Contrary to several reviews by others on The Last Jedi, I enjoyed this movie. I first left the theatre thinking I did not really like it. i thought that it was repetitive and that I had seen most of it before. I was annoyed about how the franchise continues to hold on to old characters or objects from different trilogies like Leia, the Falcon, C3P0 or R2D2.<br /><br /> However, I could not get the movie out of my mind. I kept thinking about it days after I first saw it. So I went and saw it again. After viewing it a second time, I realized how out of place my original opinion was. I enjoyed almost every aspect of this movie. <br /><br /> I think that the movie is crafted well and that the acting, particularly by both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver make this movie. Their performances are truly moving. Daisy is much more confident on-screen in The Last Jedi and it shows through her character as ""Rey"" has established herself as a force to be reckoned with. Daisy's performance is wonderful and I look forward to seeing how her character develops in Episode IX. On the other hand Adam Driver's performance, to me, is something else. Like Daisy Ridley, you can tell that he too is much more confident in his role as Kylo Ren. But beyond that, his delivery of lines is exactly how they should be delivered in my mind. For example, when on the planet Crait, when he tells the TIE fighters to ""Blow that peace of junk out of the sky!"" is truly a perfect delivery of such a line. Likewise when he demands ""More, More!"" when the First Order is firing on Luke Skywalker is again a moment in which he shines. It is a perfect delivery that fits perfectly with the development that has occurred throughout the movie in terms of his character. I think that not only Driver's delivery of lines and more confident on-screen performance are very good, but his performance is also stellar in terms of emotion. His ability to go from being the evil villain Kylo Ren to being the young Ben Solo, is remarkable in my opinion. He is able to emotionally effect the development of Rey as we know it. He is able, while under manipulation from Snoke, to make Rey feel his pain and feel his internal conflict. Adam Driver is able to portray a character that is conflicted internally and he does so very well. Whether it be through the anger in Kylo Ren or the sadness in Ben Solo. His use of emotional tones is very good. <br /><br /> Overall, I think that The Last Jedi is a good movie that has not received enough credit. Some performances are better than others but to me there are none that ruin the movie or make it bad. I think it's actually quite good.<br /><br />If anyone is unsure about the movie or feeling like they did not like it, I recommend seeing it a second time before you make your mind up. I've seen it more than twice and I like it a lot. I would recommend seeing it again if you are on the fence about it, it may change your mind."
2938,8,Next please.,"I love Star Wars so I would give it an 8. At times it felt like the movie was trying to be cute. And what's with the ""Godspeed"" line?"
2939,9,Way too much hate in this world,"I went to see it last night and all I'm seeing is so many people panning the film like it was the worst piece of work ever done under the Star Wars saga banner.<br /><br />There is no intention of spoiling the film for any potential viewers but all I can say is that you need to remind yourself why you wanted to see it in the first place. <br /><br />Now it's hard for me to objective about it because I was 7 years old when I went to see the original and have been an avid fan for the past 40 years but the whole purpose of a review IS to be subjective as it's solely your opinion on the film, nobody else should influence you into making a decision about what you expect from a movie. All I can say is that it met almost all the expectations I had and nothing will change that.<br /><br />When I fell in love with the Star Wars universe I was a child, it gave me an opportunity to escape from being a schoolboy on planet Earth and drift off into a place that triggered marvellous things in my imagination, made me want to want to be a part of it and experience it, I absorbed it and let it invoke emotions in me through the entire spectrum that it could possibly have done. I was never interested in how great the script was, or the political messages behind the film or how hammy an actor was. <br /><br />So 40 years go by and I don't expect anything else from a Star Wars movie other than going through a gamut of emotion and being awestruck by the special effects and John Williams' mastery in film score writing.<br /><br />It appears that people expect something that NONE of the other films were and will never be happy unless it becomes a serious story in it's own right. It was always meant to be a story for children ( the highest classification any of the movies ever had was PG-13) and to bring back the inner child for a few hours for the adults that go and watch it.<br /><br />So be a child again, bring your children if you have any and just turn the clock back, sit back and let it remind you of why you are sitting there in the first place"
2940,2,disrespectful to the fans/characters,"While at first i enjoyed the movie and it had some very good scenes, the characters were completely disrespected. the much loved Luke skywalker was portrayed as a depressed old man with barely any powers and who gave up on everything. this completely took everything people loved about luke and the jedi and tossed it in the bin. people hoped that we would find out snokes back story in this movie, how he became so powerful and who he really is, there were many fan theories that actually sounded good but no, they just made snoke some guy in a golden bathrobe who gets killed before we know anything about him. admiral ackbar was killed without even a mention which just broke my heart. captain phasma who was said to be a great character was wasted again with a short scene and nothing else but a comic book, the deleted scene of her final fight would have made it a little bit better. i personally was not happy with leia's role in the movie and i hated admiral holdo and how she didn't tell anyone her plan just so fin and rose could waste our time on a pointless political SJW scene. that does not belong in a star wars movie. rose didnt need to be a character, and it was really stupid how she stopped fin from saving the resistance. kylo ren was cool before but is now just a cry baby. it really annoyed me that we saw more of rose crying for her sister who we were just introduced it that of well known and loved luke skywalker crying over the death of han solo. luke should have shown more of his force powers and been the same luke we knew from the OT. i enjoyed most of the battle on crait and snokes throne room scene(appart from him dying) but the rest of it seemed like a disrespectful parody of star wars. i also did not appriciate the hate towards the fans from lucasfilm and how people were labelled as racist or sexist just because they didnt like the movie.some of it didnt make sense and luke should not have died. i like star wars and i enjoyed this the first time i watched it but it just disrespects everything about star wars. i also hate the kathleen kennedy the force is female thing, star wars is for everyone and is not the place to show your extreme political sjw views."
2941,9,Star Wars On The Track,What a great film. Like old days and two and half hour goes like nothing
2942,5,not a good movie,"First of all, i want to say that i am not a critic nor a person who knows much about film, but this movie is BAD, i mean REALLY BAD, now i also want to say that this movie's effects deserve some credit they are really good and the music is also kind of good, visually it is great, but that is what bothers me the most it looks expensive and has great effects but the story, pacing, tone, characters and reasons are dumb and badly written.<br /><br />First off, the chase is dumb, i do not understand how every single ship on the first order's fleet is the same speed (wait no there ARE ships that reaches them the tie fighters, but even when they send them they only send 3, so yeah) so this is were the pacing and tone fail, we see finn wake up in some kind of water suit and walk around while it's leaking (haha) then we see Kylo-ren debating to kill his mom and struggling with the choice but eventually she ends up shot and she just pulls herself back in and poe just opens the door to the vacuum of space and nobody goes flying out? (WHAT?)<br /><br />Plus that whole Canto Bight part was just padding.<br /><br />Also, i do not understand wth rose was, i mean first she is loyal to the rebellion and electrify Finn but then she literally dooms everybody and tries to save him, also that whole saving Finn thing is absolutely stupid, she turns back while finn is still going forwards full speed, they are already apart by like 15 meters the last time we see an overhead view and then suddenly out of nowhere like she was John cenna she crashes into finn and saves him.<br /><br />First off she would've first have to turn around and go to the right then somehow go faster than Finn, fast enough to get past him and make a 90 degree turn to smash into him, and by doing that she is killing everybody for no reason except ""love?"" (I don't think Finn was comfortable with that kiss)<br /><br />I also have a couple more problems with this scene ex; most of the rebel forces are outside the blast-proof gate and are fighting the tie fighters, even tough they do not need to since even after they break through the doors it's a man size hole they go trough and a small force could've just defended it while the others escape (Instead of most of them dying and (wait a second there's no bodies anywhere?) Why?)<br /><br />Plus the Holdo maneuver although amazing looking (i did mention visually it looks great) if you think about it it is just stupid, first off why hasn't anybody tried this before if it literally destroys so many ships?, Also HOW? it was already stablished that they kind off use a different dimension for hyper speed and that's why they never crash into anything, it's not just going super fast.<br /><br />My big problem with this is just that this movie had so much resources (around 250 million dollars) and it still sucked.<br /><br />there have been several other movies with much lower budgets that have done really well (mad max, evil dead, get out(i know it isn't as little but it's much better) ).<br /><br />That's why im giving it 2 stars"
2943,9,The TROLLS Strike Back,"I too watched this movie the first time and left the theatre with a resounding Huh?<br /><br />It felt like a series of moments strung together under the guise of a Star Wars film, I just couldn't Find the movie in it.<br /><br />My heart had started to sink at the Casino section, as most people's do, and it never recovered for the rest of that first viewing."
2944,9,Best Star Wars movie since the 80s,"The Movie: Johnson took the force into hyperdrive! He illustrates what Obi-Wan, Yoda, Windu, and Qui-Gon were teaching. It was amazing! I'm glad Johnson has enough understanding to depict it meaningfully, yet simply enough that most of an audience can grasp it. Hamill and Driver's performances stole the show too. Ridley was great, too! Loved how Johnson spent some extra time with the camera on the Princess, since we know that she's never coming back. I'm glad that the movies so far have given each OT character their due, and Johnson spends extra time on Fisher. Much of the different plots mirror Star Wars plots in the past, but Johnson goes into completely different directions, and it worked. Some humor, but it's a heavy movie. The middle portion of the movie with Finn is a good time to do a restroom break. I didn't like everything; however, everything was plausible and fun."
2945,8,wow,Reading all These negative reviews I thought OMG...I watched it anyway...I loved this movie. OK there were some parts that could have been left out or some parts that were missing. This movie just adds to the new Star Wars era that started with TFA. All of the trilogies so far had neg Reviews and they all went their own way. The only thing that really bothers me is that Rian will not direct and write IX.
2946,1,Wish they'd just make George's sequels.,"This isn't Star Wars, it's a well-financed imitation-an insult to the originals, to the prequels, to the expanded universe, and to lifelong fans."
2947,10,What the Heck? Why is everybody dissing this quality movie epic.,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a quality movie masterpiece. You don't get to experience pieces of quality art anything like this movie. I rated this movie 9/10 because of one scene. I won't explain it because it would be a spoiler, but it is ridiculous. Good thing it only lasts 20 seconds. Everything else about this movie is spectacular. The stunning battles and beautiful scenery add up to a complete and utterly mind-boggling movie that will keep you thinking until hours after you see it. I totally recommend this movie for everybody."
2948,1,AWFUL,Dont waste your time on this low life nerd standard film
2949,9,A pretty interesting movie,"*I really recommend watching the force awakens and The Last Jedi, back to back.*<br /><br />The movie started very interesting, the resistance had to evacuate their base after their attack on Starkiller base and are surprised with an attack from the Firstorder. Poe is trying to distract the Firstorders fleet so that the resistance could escape. "
2950,9,A more deep thinking one,"Remember when I first saw Starwars - A New Hope in around 1997. I actually found that Starwars wasn't (just) a SCI FI movie. (According to some description) It's a drama talking about human behaviour, psychology and maybe some elements you can think of. But I would love to watch every detail they made on the screen. The world that George created. <br /><br />But when it came to EP7, it turned to a 'Avengers' like style movie. Eventually its maybe better in competitions to other movies. But it seems not a long lasting Starwars.<br /><br />So I'm quite happy to see EP8 back to this track. There will be people who like it, and there will be not. The visual effects is still stunning.<br /><br />The only thing is it might have added some 'Disney' element like Porg stick onto the window of Falcon (never mind, just another JarJar). And the kid at the ending... (a new story?)...well.<br /><br />...As a Starwars fan of coz I would very much like to see George's original EP789."
2951,10,something truly special,"I laughed, I cried, I nodded my head, I digged my fingers in the chair, I was stunned by artistic imagery and composition, I was drawn by the originality of the storyline, I finally loved these charakters and understood their journey and in addition to that my jar dropped several times - this movie brought not only star wars back to life, it enhanced it, it is a gift, it blinked with an eye to me, it played with my expectations and overwelmed them. Rian Johnson did something from his heart, this movie will always be ""truly special"" to me. Wait, where´s my broomstick..."
2952,2,Pretentious Drivel,"Im not sure where to even begin with this film. Never was a massive star wars fan, but I could get some enjoyment out of Lucas' films. What he lacked in his own writing abilities, he would more than make up for it with his sheer creativity. His effort and love for what he made showed in his films and people could connect more with it. The old Star Wars' themes were always subtle, and treated its audience with respect for thier intelligence."
2953,9,"I loved it, and nothing will change my mind.",SPOILERS BELOW:
2954,4,I'm not paying to see any more Star wars movies,"Last Jedi is a disgrace for the saga. The movie feels like it's a totally different universe. More like Marvel. Jedis are more like X-Men now, they have all sorts of superpowers and tricks that they didn't have before. Now with the Force you can make videocalls and hologram yourself like Loki. Where there was evil and the dark side before, now you have a weird kid Vader-wannabe who throws tantrums like a 2 year old and can misteriously overpower the Emperor-wannabe as easy as pie (how??). Where there were efforts in training and developing Jedi skills and wisdom, now there is a couple of days of BS, a cave that doesn't scare anyone and lame lines. Where there was a brave Jedi who single handedly faced Vader and the Emperor and lived to tell, now there's a depressed lame character who exiled himself because a child seemed to have inclinations towards the dark side (WTF, Luke brought Vader back). I'm just going to erase this episode from my mind and pretend it didn't happen."
2955,8,"Everything you love and hate about Star Wars, and why you should not trust critics sometimes","Saw the premiere on Thursday and my expectations going into it were a bit tempered. With Disney flooding the market with everything, and given that I've grown very weary of the MCU, this would hopefully be a nice reprieve from the superhero genre. For better or worse, The Last Jedi is a good Star Wars experience for new and old. However, that does not mean the movie is without faults, and some are big enough to almost ruin the film."
2956,10,Everything I wanted and more! Awesome!!!,"I saw Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope in the theater back in 1977, so as a longtime fan, I'm thrilled to report that this film is everything I wanted and more!"
2957,8,"Doesn't deserve all the hate, but","I understand why hardcore fans didn't enjoy this movie. I'm myself a pretty huge fan of the series, and I didn't mind it as much. It seems like the people complaining about all the new stuff, is the same that complained about how The Force Awakens was too familiar to episode 4. The movie has it's issues, some weird scenes that didn't make that much sense, and some bad phasing with Finn's storyline. The movie is different from other Star Wars films, since the main story feels like one big scene, while the other storylines where there to fill out some gaps. Unlike episode 4 which feels like it had taken place over several weeks, if not months, this movie feels like it takes place in a couple of days. There where some great moments, the cinematography was excellent (I was scared there would be too much ""symbolism"" that would take over from the story from some of the trailers (I through the red smoke on the winter landscape was too visual, but it made sense in the movie), which wasn't a problem at all), and most of the characters where amazing. It doesn't feel as much as a Star Wars movie as some of the others, but it's certainly not the worst one ever, as people are saying, but it doesn't beat the originals, which is good. While the other people are saying that the entire saga now sucks, because of this one elemental that was added, is simply wrong. The Star Wars saga is still amazing, and even though this wasn't the episode everyone had hoped for, or was hyped about, it's till a good movie. The reason people dislike it so much, is because they're comparing it with the original trilogy, which is simply wrong to do."
2958,1,Complete drivel,Disney seem to think that they can't make any other type of film and with this latest Star Wars they achieved the ultimate sin in destroying Jedi.
2959,9,Let the Past Die!,"Fantastic, unexpected, and profound! This movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster throughout the film. This was a movie that is nothing like a Star Wars film we have seen before."
2960,1,Heartbreakingly bad,"My kid came flying out of the theater after 7, making blaster and lightsaber sounds .<br /><br />Asked to go home an hour plus into part 8<br /><br />You all should be ashamed of yourselves"
2961,8,Different and wonderful,"Too all those who say that Luke wasn't what they expected, try teaching someone who you expected to be amazing, but then turns on you and kills your dream. Tell me if you wouldn't hide your self away in shame and self pity. You would completely unrecognizable and not have hope for the future. And that is what has happened to Luke. Yes, he was amazing when he was a fresh faced kid, coming into his own as a Force user and Jedi. But after years of dealing with his failure in dealing with Ben Solo, you can't expect him to be the same, optimistic person."
2962,10,Ignore the 1 star whingers,"It is safe to assume, given that users rated Justice League 7.2, that they don't know what they are talking about and are just a bunch of butthurt nerds, complaining that somebody played with their toys."
2963,9,loved it. beautiful movie.,"I loved the movie, it has deep moments and is aesthetically beautifully made. Although is it's definitely not perfect. The pace doesn't last throughout the whole movie, some scenes seem a little pointless and I feel like there are few too many plot holes that we have to just take for granted. but other than that I really enjoyed it, so great Job Rian!"
2964,3,Couldn't even finish it,"I literally became sooo bored that after seeing I still had over an hour left of the film I simply switched it off with no remorse. The character casting of the Disney take over has been horrendous. If you want to do baby faced assassins, then take a leaf out of the Game Of Thrones casting teams book, who nailed it. "
2965,8,I don't get all this hate.,I don't get all this hate on this movie.
2966,3,My heart is broken,"If you're looking for a slapstick car crash with no heart, pathos or tension, The Last Jedi is the film for you."
2967,10,The Last Jedi is a great movie.,"The Last Jedi is a great movie, most people are just upset their fan theories didn't come true."
2968,9,ALL THE IMDB USER REVIEWERS ARE BEING HATERS,"This is a great movie, and probably the third best film in the franchise. It has all the moments you've been waiting for, and goes into some unfamiliar territory too."
2969,,The worst Star Wars film to date.,"Full of marvel humor, terrible writing, corny scenes, the movie was all over the place. The only thing that makes the movie even bearable was Rey & Kylo. I wasn't a big fan of The Force Awakens but I at least enjoyed that it felt like a true Star Wars film. Last Jedi was just weird and felt like some crappy fan fiction."
2970,10,Definitely a fun Star Wars chapter,"I went into the movie worried and expecting the the worst, having heard that the critics had rewarded it with good scores. I left the movie feeling exhilarated. The action sequences, the story line, the humor, all felt true to the spirit of Star Wars. Thank God for no more midichlorians. Than you for no Jar Jar. Can't wait for the next one."
2971,4,Bad beyond belief.,"The new star wars characters have no real charisma, personalities of brown cardboard boxes really, it kills any chance of a half decent film. If you're going to introduce new characters to replace the old guard then they really should have at least a small amount of charisma for a start. This has to be the worst, slowest, most boring star wars movie to date, with plot holes the size of a death star. And like someone else pointed out, it tries to be Harry Potter in space at times, that is, MAGICAL! "
2972,8,"The Future of the Franchise, But Uncomfortable for Fans.","The Last Jedi feels alien, out of place in the Star Wars universe we have come to love for a number of reasons. This perception is what is driving Star Wars fans to come out against the film and as a dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars fan myself, I found myself initially in agreement. The movie- as a fan- made me feel... uncomfortable. As I walked out of the theater, I was annoyed by the films total lack of resolution for some of the questions its predecessor asked, but even more irritated by the fact that some of those questions that we fans were puzzling over- making dozens of theories over- were seemingly tossed carelessly out the window. "
2973,1,Awful,"Going into this film, I had high hopes. TFA left a lot of questions unanswered. What was produced left me appalled. This is quite honestly the worst film I have ever seen. The film starts out with two characters exchanging mom jokes. Since when did that become a thing in Star Wars? Lea apparently is now Wonder Woman. Luke's character was absolutely destroyed. And to top it all off, the main light saber fight is uninteresting. The only good thing in this film is Kylo's character development. I honestly am not interested in what the last Star Wars coming out will be about. Rian Johnson killed Star Wars"
2974,9,Watch with an open mind and don't let the past control your expectations,"I can understand how some people do not like this movie, however, I really did. I was never a big Star Wars fan, but I grew up with it because of my brothers. This movie made me want to go home and watch all the movies and learn everything I could about the universe. <br /><br />I did that and then I watched this movie again. It was much better the second time and I still enjoyed it. <br /><br />This new trilogy is not done yet and I think many people are forgetting that, just because some questions weren't answered in the obvious ways they were in the past films. I think this movie is beautifully done and the acting is superb (Adam Drivers acting is amazing). <br /><br />Star Wars (In my opinion) is not about the Jedi Order only, it is about good and evil, the fall of a civilization and the fight for freedom. What I think many people don't see is how wrong the Jedi actually were, they focused so much on their own light and their own path to stay good that they did not see everything change around them. <br /><br />I think there are a lot of disappointed fans because this movie took a different direction than expected. But personally, I loved it. It was fresh and had such a deep level of emotions in it that captivated not just me, but many others. The characters from the old movies are not the heroes anymore and it is time to let the past go, kill it, if you have to. <br /><br />Luke Skywalker is the last Jedi because he is the last one to try and live by the ways of the Jedi, which ended in failure again. I really hope the fans who are sad about this movie will rethink their expectations, because did you really expect Luke to be the main character again? Save the day and have another surprising father?<br /><br />It is a new area, a new fight and if a new way of order is to rise, the old one has to fall. No more Jedi order and no more Sith. They have to go back to when everything was stable, to the grey area between light and dark. <br /><br />I think this movie points out these things in a beautiful way, the inner battle between light and dark, showing us one person can truly not be only one of them and there has to be a middle ground. <br /><br />Luke failed because he pushed himself so far away from the dark that he feared it when he saw it in someone else, but for a Jedi, fear is bad. So bad that Luke did not know what to do and was considering killing a young man who was conflicted and had no idea what to do. The Jedi created another villain by not embracing human errors and doubts. <br /><br />This is why I think this movie deserves 9/10, because if you watch it with an open mind and love the universe and the ideas in it, it will surprise you. Put away expectations and face reality, the Jedi are gone. "
2975,8,A solid film (with some weird moments),"I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was watching The Last Jedi. The flaws were more evident the second time I watched it, but my opinion of the movie still didn't change. There are many things to say about this movie, some good and some bad, but overall it was a good film. "
2976,9,Amazing New Direction For Star Wars,"Just because the movie didn't go how you wanted it to, doesn't mean it's ""the worst movie ever."" The film takes great risks, that for the most part pay off. Rey and Kylo are two of the greatest characters in Star Wars, and every moment they spend together on screen is amazing. Ridley, Driver, and Hamill were all great. The movie overall was an amazing joy ride."
2977,1,Awful,Is there no one at DISNEY that was involved in this mess that were Start Wars fans growing up?
2978,9,Best Star Wars Since The Empire Strikes Back,All nay-saying nerds are wrong. This movie is great. The end.
2979,1,Words cannot adequately express how utterly terrible this movie is,"Frankly I'm utterly amazed that this dumpster fire of a movie still has a rating of 7.1 , it deserves a one star rating and even that would be generous considering how bad it is. Even if I were to spend an entire century trying to describe how utterly stupid and disappointing the director and script truly are I would never be able to adequately express the full extent of their failure. This movie willfully and gleefully annihilates the magic of the original Star Wars trilogy. May Disney and Ryan Johnson burn in hell for all eternity for their vandalism of the Star Wars universe. The director is a measly, soulless turd with the imagination of a cockroach. My 1yo son could come up with a better Star Wars movie. Don't waste your time with this crap, even if you're extremely bored watching paint dry would be more entertaining."
2980,8,A Shocking Experience to an Old Franchise,"At first after reviewing pages of scattered and varying reviews I was initially skeptical if Star Wars: The Last Jedi would fair my own perilous judgement. After setting aside any previous notions of bias I set forth watching the eighth installment of the franchise with an open mind. As each minute passed I was shocked, awed, dazzled, and even at times a little annoyed at some trivial matters. Yet alas, as the film ended I was left, for the most part, satisfied with my experience."
2981,10,Best Star Wars movie in these last years,"I liked it a lot, they took risks and made something different from what I was expecting"
2982,9,All folks are entitled to their opinion,"I get why some did not like this movie. I disagree with them, as I think most of the criticism comes from discomfort with taking things in a new direction, which was my problem with TFA, that it was too much a rehash. I've been a star wars fan since 1977 and seeing A New Hope in the theater as a 4 year old and 500 times since then. Han shot first."
2983,4,I'm being generous with my score because of the CGI artists who worked hard,"I waited to see this movie. I'm older and didn't want to go alone, and there was no one who wanted to go with me. How old am I? Well, when I was 13, I rode my bike to Century City (California, in L.A. County) to see Episode 4: A New Hope the first day it came out. "
2984,10,AMAZING!,"Not only original but one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Don't listen to the haters, go out and absorb the delight this movie will bring you. Some people really get too hung up over ""Lore"". Times move on and this movie will remain on of the best for a long time to come. Seriously, sit all of the Star Wars movies side by side. take all of their memorable moments, action and story. This will by far stand out as the greatest."
2985,1,The be$te$t $tRa War$ EvuR!1!!!!111 RiAn JoHnsoHn iS a GeNiuS11!!1!!!,"Or maybe not, since this is the worst Star Wars movie since...uhm...no wait, it's the worst Star Wars movie EVER! The Rise of Skywalker doesn't count since it's not even a movie, a collection of moving pictures but not much else. The hate is strong for this one, and (for once) it's well deserved. Don't touch it, it will burn you alive."
2986,8,I enjoyed it,"Many people hated it, But I loved it. Every shot is Just perfect, the porgs were Cute. The story was mwah. It didnt make sense. Rian Didnt write the characters Well. In My opinion the actors act Well."
2987,10,Great Film well worth a watch,I cant believe the reviews what a bunch of moan old goats get a grip on life. The film is full of action just enjoy the journey its not 10 stars but a good 7 only rated it 10 to offset the idiots giving this film 1 and 2 stars that is simply not accurate.
2988,,IMDB 7.8 - Seriously?,"According to IMDB, The Last Jedi has an AVERAGE rating of 7.8, which arouse my curiosity and I decided to dig deeper"
2989,10,Some Fans don't get the Force,"I am glad I avoided reading the Reviews before watching ""The Last Jedi."" Wow there are a lot of negative reviews for those who saw it opening night. A lot of them I feel Don't get the Force. The Point is it is in and through everyone and everything. Ray didn't have to be from the lineage of a Jedi to become a Jedi, Hence the Title of the Last Movie. ""The Force Awakens"" The telepathic connection between Ray and Ben is interesting. I bet there will be more to come with that."
2990,2,"Worst Star Wars movie ever made, and that's putting it nicely","TLJ is not only the worst Star Wars movie ever but it's simply a bad film in general. I felt extremely disappointed as I walked out of the movie theater with a classic/epic facepalm. Geez, even Episode 1 was much more entertaining than this heap of trash. Anyone who praises ""The Last Jedi"" should really get their head examined, or at least watch it one more time and think a little more carefully before praising anything this horrible. Terrible plot, terrible character development, lame and unfunny jokes, and in no way at all did it feel like a genuine Star Wars movie. I only enjoyed the scenes where Luke Skywalker had screen-time along with Yoda, and a few very short random charming moments, but aside from that I want to pretend as if TLJ never happened or existed."
2991,10,absolutely love it.. beautifully done !,"As long as you keep an open mind, and have no pre conceived view of how a star wars movie should be like, this is a great piece of work. And it also got George Lucas's approval. i suspect many negative comments made here are by people who haven't actually watch the entire movie. the same negative reviews and comments appear in episode 7, and heck ep 1,2,3.."
2992,2,The Lost Jedi,This Star Wars movie will forever hold a special place in my heart. It was the movie that made me stop watching any future Star Wars made by Disney. This movie managed to disappointed me more that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - something that I didn't think was possible.
2993,10,"Watch it if you haven't already, and don't go in with any expectations","I don't understand why some people don't like this movie, I thought is was incredible! My dad has always been a huge Star Wars fan and I actually haven't watched many of the movies, or absolutely loved them like I did this one. I would say if you haven't seen it yet and you're debating about whether or not to go because of some of the reviews are bad, just go. <br /><br />Just don't go in with any strong expectations, it brings in themes of the old Star Wars as well as some new themes."
2994,10,Amazing new direction,"More conflict, depth of characters, emotion, and possibilities. Love it!"
2995,9,Luke is alive in spirit,It may sound naive or trite but the story ain't over yet. Being a Jedi means so much more than being alive.<br /><br />I thought this movie was spectacular.
2996,2,Worse with repeat viewings,"I've seen it three times. The more you watch it, the more painful it gets to try to watch. I still haven't met someone who genuinely likes this movie"
2997,9,A very good Star Wars movie,"First, sorry for any spelling or other mistakes, Im not a native speaker...<br /><br />I personaly like this movie. The story is not a copy-paste as the force awakening was. To me it looks like trying to connect the old characters and the new for the story. Like it has connections with old movies, but is a new story. It contained many unexpected spins and yet let the story open. A good middle part of the trilogy. There were some scenes that were strange, but understandable. <br /><br />The acting was perfect in my eyes, all the actors played their part well. The effect were also excellent. For example that kamikaze attack into snokes ship was amazing. I was like omg what just happened. The music was also good. <br /><br />Personally I thought that luke will do more but anyway, it was good. His final scene with Kylo was just fantastic. Also adding Yoda was a great moment.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie worth every cent I paid for it in the cinema. Waiting for the next part. <br /><br />May the Force be with You"
2998,2,Likely the last time I pay to watch a Star Wars movie,"In many ways visually stunning, but I cannot for my life believe the many raving reviews. They are simply not credible. "
2999,10,"Great Movie, Great Choices","I loved the movie. I agree that the casino scenes might not have been necessary, but I did love all the scenes with the two main characters, and all the choices they made. The reveal about the parents was amazing - no better choice could have possibly been made."
3000,10,An unexpected treat,"Unlike most of the reviewers on this site, who hated this movie, I love and deeply enjoyed this movie. Director Rian Johnson challenged and played off of all the ideas and expectations of star wars fans, and creates a unique story. The visuals of the movie are only matched by the emotional weight and character development. The only negative thing I would have to say about The Last Jedi is the too many comedy moments don't land. Some moments feel like a generic marvel movie. There is too much tongue in cheek humor, where it is not needed. Despite the comedic lows of this movies, the highs meet and exceed expectations. I highly recommend and would put it in my top 5 star wars movies of all time. I would also like to add one last thought... This movie is not perfect... and the original trilogy isn't perfect either... the idea behind all these movies is the experience we feel when we watch them. These movies are suppose to fun, enjoyable, and grand. I think you will find all these traits in this resent expansion on the star wars universe."
3001,10,One of my favorite movies of all time,"This movie is simply a masterpiece and I'm always saddened by the underserved hate it gets. This is by far my favorite Star Wars movie and one of my favorites of all time. Visually stunning, great plot and storytelling. That throne fight scene is to die for. I wish people stop hating on this movie because it does not deserve it. The score, cinematography and directing are top notch. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are espectacular on this film. So much chemistry and perfectly executed scenes. They definitely captured my attention and I was grateful that Rian decided to add more humanity and vulnerability to the character of Kylo Ren. 10/10."
3002,1,Dont waste your time,What a joke of a movie. Don't waste your time rather go play tetris or mario brothers you'll find more enjoyment out of that.
3003,8,"Despite the negativity, The last Jedi offers more than meets the eye","To make this brief and not give spoilers away, I had heard that people were displeased with this film and said it was terrible. Well, Episode 1-3 were a tragedy for me and this was multitudes better than any of those disasters. One of the biggest criticisms involved the acquisition of this series by Disney. Many said it was merely a ploy to generate more money, through memorabilia...toys, games, clothes etc. While I can not completely disagree as they are a business and profit is essential, I by no means think they have ruined the series with this film. The only gripes I have involve someone in space floating back to a ship, and the fact that the movies made way too much of a point to show the multitude of female pilots. Before people take that as a misogynistic comment please allow me to explain. I do not care who is piloting anything, but there were many times that long shots were shown for female characters that did not have a main or even a secondary role in the film, but it felt forced the way in which it was shown. Again, I mean no disrespect in any sort of sexist manner, it merely was the heavy handed nature in which the pilots were filmed which exacerbated the perceived need to close the gender gap. Aside from that, I thought it was a wonderful film. There is evolution and a deeper understand of each of the characters in the series. It may be subtle, but there are points throughout the film that you can understand almost everyone's position, good or evil, as well as being able to relate. Without spoiling specific transitions as well as evolution's in the character's roles, they all seemed to be genuine and not forced. The actors themselves aside from the characters also did a phenomenal job at creating the emotion which is then projected to the audience, which at many points allows you to forget you are watching the movie. I have seen the previous star wars films, so this is not my first film as I know many ""veterans of the series"" will despise anything created after the original trilogy. I think it is fantastic (though do have disdain for the second set), but feel that this final trilogy resembles the feel from the original trilogy. The way it was filmed, the dialogue, and story reminded me of the empire strikes back. A final parallel is that this reminds me of the transition of the Harry Potter series, where there is still evil at the beginning of the series but it is almost more childlike. Nearing the end it become much more mature, dark, and devastating, and those pieces combine to a enjoyable culmination for me."
3004,1,incredibly disappointed and will alienate a lot of star wars fans,"I wanted to like this movie. I saw the first super-excited reviews on twitter and thought it was going to be great...but it completely disappointed me and a lot of other star wars fans.<br /><br />Force Awakens had things in it that weren't great, but it was arguably better than the prequels and gave us some great characters, new faces, and visuals.<br /><br />The worst part is that so many characters act like completely different people than they did before; Rey, Poe, and Luke especially. It was needlessly grimdark and full of death. The first movie established Rey as the main character with Poe and Finn as the other mains, but this movie acted as if Kylo Ren were the main character and not the villain. it seemed like everything the first movie established, this movie changed with no reason why. I felt especially cheated because Rey felt sidelined in a movie where she is supposed to be the hero. Backstory about the Knights of Ren and Rey's past was different from that stated in Force Awakens. The jokes were awkward and in places where they often broke dramatic tension or paused in the middle of the story, rather than being worked in organically, making the movie seem like a parody of itself. So many of the lines gave me flashbacks to some of the truly awful nonsense dialogue in the prequels, especially with Hux, and some of Rey and Luke's lines were so strange I just found myself thinking, ""Did they really just say that?"" The scenes between Rey and Kylo Ren were inconsistent with each character's development in the first movie, awkward, and just made Kylo look like a creep. The whole Snoke narrative was completely wasted. I find it impossible to give this movie more than a 1 rating because although a few things made me smile, i was so confused by where the film was going and how inconsistent it was that the whole experience was like watching a really, really bad fan fiction. Carrie, Daisy, Oscar, John, Mark, and the fans deserved something so much better than whatever this was"
3005,10,Take the message of this movie to heart,"This is a far more complex and interesting Star Wars than previous films. I think the reason so many ""fan boys"" don't like it is because it simultaneously gives nods to previous films and fandoms while clearly saying that nostalgia can suck it. And the overarching theme of the film is that mansplaining and misogyny are only going to get you in trouble. The women and people of color are the true heroes here. And if you don't like the movie it's probably because you are the one being criticized here."
3006,9,"Great movie, surprised about bad reviews",MILD SPOILERS BELOW
3007,10,The best Episode?,"I can't believe, that there are so many bad Reviews for this masterpiece. "
3008,1,This movie's not diverse enough!,"I respect this film for having a black and a East Asian character in it. But I do not respect it for not having a character of each ethnicity in it. Where's the Arabic characters, where's the eskimo characters, where's the native American characters, where's the latina characters?! I'm also very disturbed that film film didn't have equal screen time distribution of both genders and although it had a black character and a East Asian character their screen time wasn't as much as the white characters overall. To of truly been a perfect film this must have had screen time that composed of 10% white person screen time, 10% black person screen time, 10% Latina person screen time, 10% East Asian person screen time, 10% Arab person screen time, 10% Pakistani person screen time, 10% Indian person screen time, 10% person native American screen time, 10% Greenlandic person screen time and 10% mixed race person screen time to truly bring equality to society and showcase that all ethnicities are equal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also this film deeply offended me as I can't do all the magic powers some of the characters can do in the film so that made me squeal like a little girl and gave me sleepless nights for two days after watching this truly disturbing film!"
3009,8,Great fun,"This film is great fun. It perfectly fits into the old trilogies tone. It has a light mystery touch, fantastic action, great pictures, wonderful actors. And it has that great sense of humor that also made the old trilogy special. I like it very much!"
3010,1,This was just the worst,"Feminism ruined another movie, just so stupid i hate litterly everything about this movie is just isnt star wars anymore..."
3011,8,Watched it a second time. This time I loved it.,"After the first watch in IMAX 3D I was in shock. Was this really Star Wars? The movie felt so unbalanced. Now about 7 months after the release I watched it again, in glorious 2D HD, and was amazed how powerful the movie is. The main story about Luke, Leia, Ben and Rey is nothing short of breathtaking. I watched the end-credits with that same special feeling as the end of The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi will age well over time."
3012,10,Moving Fantasy Epic,"Not since the original trilogy has a Star Wars movie moved me that much.<br /><br /> I loved the character arc for Luke, Rey and Kylo.<br /><br /> Rey had to learn to fight for herself and not to rely on heritage or teachers.<br /><br />Kylo managed to defeat his master and become the leader of the first order.<br /><br />Luke started as a broken man without hope and became the hero of the galaxy we always wanted him to be. <br /><br />All in all an excellent movie, well crafted, beautifully filmed, with minor flaws."
3013,8,Some thoughts on why I like Luke's development and the whole movie - Spoilers,"I am a devoted Star Wars fan. Luke Skywalker is my childhood hero. I have never ever commented on anything online, but after genuinely enjoying The Last Jedi I was so shocked to see all this hate that I felt like I had to do something. No-one has to love this movie, but such hatred? Let's spread some love...."
3014,2,This movie declaration of bankruptcy to the Star Wars world,"...but certainly not bankruptcy for Disney, seeing how they treat Star Wars only as a cash cow. <br /><br />I had big hopes for Star Wars when Disney had announced this triology including the participation of the reccuring cast. Similar to the Force Awakens, the story in Last Jedi is disappointing and weak (to be fair, compared to Force Awakens a bit less weak, due to some unexpected story-twists), the new characters are still not interesting but rather onedimensional and the old characters are used in a very unsatisfying way. There are many elements in these movies, which don't feel they belong in the Star Wars universe - including all those modern, misplaced jokes - which might fit in well with Marvel-movies."
3015,9,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"I want to say that I am acknowledging the fact that this movie has flaws. It is not perfect. But what movie really is? Yes, there are some slow points in the 2-and-a- half-hour long movie, and some parts that maybe weren't necessary, with some jokes that didn't need to be placed where they were (not that they weren't funny, just at the wrong times). Let's all remember that this is only the second part to the trilogy and things can be resolved and explained in episode 9. "
3016,1,The only reason this sis y the worst is because of Ep.9,"This movie is terrible, they waste Luke skywalkers character, break the laws of physics of their own universe, and make a pointless Gillian and keep trying to subvert fan expectations by doing the opposite of fan service."
3017,10,"Great movie, lots of unique fun scenes","Had an awesome time at the theatres watching it with my father and fiancee, would reccomend seeing the movie and not trusting the hate bandwagon going on right now."
3018,8,"If you want to live in a world where the protagonist never changes and is always 'good', dont watch this movie","This review is for the possible viewer who isnt a die hard star wars fan, its a freaking movie guys and gals. The Last Jedi (TLJ) is most comparable to recent marvel movies, the plot is another homage to the original trilogy that The Force Awakens was to A New Hope, and it is just fine. there is nothing about this movie that should honestly make your blood boil if you a casual fan of the series."
3019,8,Not perfect but still a good star wars movie,I don't get all the hate honestly. You let all the little things bug you. Its changing get over it. If you don't like it then don't even bother watching the next one. You will end up hating that one too. Either get with the times or don't even see it! I went in with knowing all the hate. Yet I still really enjoyed it! I am also a hardcore Star wars fan!
3020,4,What happened?,Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**
3021,9,This masterpiece changed Star Wars forever,"First of all I am deeply saddened to read all this negativity towards this movie. Although I understand, that Star Wars means different things to different people. I think if I ask the question ""What Star Wars means to you?"" I would get lots and lots of different answers. That is the very reason why it is so hard to please the fans, because they are not the same. Saying that I have to say The Last Jedi is one of my favorite SW movies ever made. I went to see it twice in 24 hours. When reviewing this film you should not forget the best Star Wars movie, The Empire Strikes Back was not all loved in its time. From now on I will include SPOLIERS. "
3022,1,"Jar Jar Binks is the low point for Star Wars. DISNEY, ""Hold my beer!'",A movie so horrifyingly bad not even a Flying Princess can save it. A root canal being done during a colonoscopy would be more enjoyable than watching The Last Jedi again.
3023,9,Don't believe the hate -- this is a great movie!,"This movie definitely does not conform to any of the fan theories that were rolling around in the galaxy before its release. I think that's a great thing, but it accounts for a lot of the vitriol being spit out online towards this film. The characters in this movie are the most real, human, fleshed-out characters there have ever been in the Star Wars franchise. There are some crazy awesome action scenes, incredible demonstrations of the force, amazing new locations and creatures; it's beautifully filmed, it's funny and touching."
3024,10,Loved it!,"Can't believe so many bad reviews. There's much more to the story that people don't see. Light and dark, yin and yang, good and evil. I never saw it or I guess paid attention to it till this episode. It's a movie but I see something more, a message of hope and love. Besides all that I loved it, it does something to me inside when I watch it. Maybe I'm just weird lol"
3025,10,Stop hating,Let go of your expectations 
3026,1,Star Wars: The Last White Guy,"Welcome to the only Star Wars written by National Public Radio, or perhaps the National Organization for Women, What a travesty of a great franchise. But isn't that what liberals do best, destroy tradition and replace it with politics? By the end of this movie there are almost no white males left, except of course for the bad guys. I think Walt Disney is turning over in his grave by now."
3027,8,Impressive and well made,Feel im back in the old epic battle between good and evil. But with an extra layer of doubt in the characters. Action blowing intense drama from minut one... Can't wait for the next
3028,1,Terrible,"Bad acting, a story that is as stupid as attacking someone with a rubber and stupid characters all add up to a dissatisfying sequel. We hope for more and it came out s***"
3029,9,Anyone who thinks this is a bad movie is seriously high,This was a rich and detailed movie that kept me involved throughout. A more than worthy addition to the Star Wars Universe!
3030,9,If you don't like it...,"I honestly think most people are just dumping on this movie because it is a trendy thing to do. It is a good film. It is not a great film. It is a fun film. If you are upset over the writer/director's vision, write your own script, pitch it to Disney, and make the film. I'm sure most people won't care because I enjoyed the film, and that makes me an ignorant, scumbag piece of excrement, that should just go kill myself because I can't tell a ""good"" movie from a ""bad"" one. There, now you don't even need to reply to my ""stupid"" post. I did your job for you. ""Do what you feel in your heart to be right, for you will be criticized anyway."" - Eleanor Roosevelt"
3031,10,creative plot,"The plot was great and so were the new lovable characters. It wasn't a predictable story, like the force awakens, it was so new and intriguing. The Last Jedi really let you know the characters well and caused you to understand their inner struggles. There were some hilarious one liners that cracked everyone up in the theater. I am definitely going to watch this again."
3032,1,An absolute disaster,"This movie is an absolute disaster compared to any other Star Wars movie. It doesn't fit well, it doesn't make much sense and it is overall garbage. I've watched this movie 8 times thinking that each time I watched it it would get better, but, it has just gotten worse."
3033,10,To dislike The Last Jedi is to deny the spirit of Star Wars,"To dislike this movie as a Star Wars film is to deny the spirit of Star Wars. This movie was perfectly adapted for the times, while maintaining the heart and soul of Star Wars. The added humor was appropriate and very in-character. The surprises, the rumored relationships we hoped for, the character development, the plot twists... all of it was everything the new trilogy needed and aspired to be. This movie was meaningful, compelling, and enthralling. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Thank you to everyone involved - for breathing new life into the world of cinema (and the world of Star Wars)."
3034,2,Propaganda,"Nothing less, than propaganda nothing more. The movie if it had taken out the political nature wouldn't be a 2, probably a 5 or 6 but this just ruins it."
3035,10,Star Wars as you've never felt it before,Amazing and the most mature movies of this franchise. This is exactly what Star Wars is all about. Meaning behind every did and not just lightsabers floating around.
3036,10,A new era for Star Wars!,"I'm a Star Wars fan and this movie is epic, fantastic, deep, suspenseful, rare but fun.<br /><br />The plot is filled with gaps that will surely be answered in the other film, leaving us with even more suspense.<br /><br />He's got a lot of memorable scenes, lots of fun ones. I recommend it, do not be fooled by critics who did not see the depth of this film, it is a new era for Star Wars."
3037,8,Ok but not great,As a scifi movie in general it's pretty good. But as a Starwars movie it sucks.<br /><br />I was worried about the Porgs but they weren't the problem. It all started lousy with the slapstick exchange between Poe and Hux. A rocky start for sure but a good indication of the tone of this movie. From here it was all a downward spiral. 
3038,1,Ryan Johnson has Destroyed Star Wars we need a new hope,"I saw Star Wars in 1977 as a kid and was taken to a Galaxy Far Far away and was captured in the adventure, the Mythology the Jedi the plot twists and turns that weaves all the movies together and binds the saga together."
3039,10,Do not buy into the negativity,"Please- see the movie and decide for yourself. Personally, I thought it was amazing. I think the loudest voices are often times the angriest. But if you look at the aggregate score of the film it's clear that many thought it was spectacular."
3040,2,Did Disney buy reviewers off? How does this stinkbomb have a 7.7 IMDB rating?,"Something seems off. If most hardcore fans hated this movie and were passionate about giving it a low score where are these high ratings coming from? It's not from the overworked moms and dads that are casual fans that's for sure. There is no way that these high reviews weren't planted by the studio. The fact that all of the professional critic reviews were also glowing smacks of industry bootlicking where critics lavish praise on a films so their news organizations aren't shut out of future Disney screenings. The Last Jedi shows what happens when a company builds up clout. This movie is an utter betrayal of the Star Wars fandom. Brought to you by an auteur director who seems more interested in splattering his weird ideas on screen with no rhyme, reason or research."
3041,,I wanted my money back ..,"This is the worst excuse for a Star Wars movie I have ever seen , what happened to the trilogy I loved so much growing up ? The prequels were not even close to this bad...there were just so many plot holes and loose ends not tied up ! <br /><br />And how the hell is Leia all the sudden able to use the force now ? I think it was all the cocanine she did in her younger years .."
3042,9,"Very Good, Yet Flawed Movie","This isn't that unique of a stance here, but overall, I TLJ was a great movie with a few moments of absolutely unnecessary garbage. The pacing was thrown off by entire plot lines that, had they not been in the movie, wouldn't have changed the outcome of the main story at all."
3043,9,"Get over your own ego, and enjoy this fantastic SW film","Fantastic and emotional. I rank it with Ep's IV and V. All the hate seems to be from those clinging to their own theories and ideas of how the series should have developed or what was presented in the EU. As many have observed, the theme of failure (of mentorship, communication, trust) is dominant in the film, without being a retelling of ESB (unlike the Ep VII's duplication of Ep IV). "
3044,8,My first Star Wars Movie,"This is the first Star Wars movie that I watched the whole way through and I really enjoyed it. Prior to seeing this film I had a little bit of an idea of the Star Wars history, but not a lot. I like the storylines and characters, there are some unanswered questions that will hopefully be answered in the movies to come, and I really like the new relationships and conflicts that were formed in this movie. <br /><br />My biggest critique is that it's SO long. Luckily it doesn't feel that long when you watch it. Most of all, it has sparked my interest to watch the other films!"
3045,4,In a weird way more disappointing than the Prequels,"After The Phantom Menace my expectations went down significantly for all things Star Wars - so whenever anything good happened in the 2 and 3 I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Now the opposite happened - after quite a good TFA and a pretty spot on Rogue One, I had high hopes.<br /><br />This movie was like watching TESB and a prequel mixed and played at double speed. It was super slow and boring in places yet the next moment it would jump in the plot - one minute escaping in transports then suddenly all set up in Crait waiting for the Hoth-like attack."
3046,10,Thank you Disney for this wonderful movie.,"I have loved Star wars since i was a child, this is what i have been waiting for. More new content, new storylines and great cast!"
3047,1,What did I just watch,"This film isn't awful, it's just not good. At all. "
3048,,Rian Johnson has written himself into a corner,"I can almost understand why TLJ was written and directed the way it was - it attempted to subvert the Hero's Journey by reversing the usual tropes, which is fine. However, if you're going to do that, whatever replaces it better be good. Several major characters die in this movie, and because they're dead, I don't really care to see Episode IX, because whoever survived doesn't resonate; none of them really learned from their respective failures, which is replete in this movie."
3049,8,I don't know why people are hating on this film.,"I guess you just can't please star wars fans.The film was a bit slow at times but had many great moments - awesome plot twists of Kylo Ren killing Snoke and Luke not actually being on that planet to fight Kylo, awesome visuals and effects in general and an amazing shot when the resistance cruiser crashes into the first order fleet at light speed. A few well placed funny moments here and there that don't interfere with the any important thematic moments in the film."
3050,10,So AMAZING!!!!,SPOILER ALERT!!!! 
3051,9,Watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi Full Movie HD 1080p,Watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi Full Movie HD 1080p
3052,1,Expensive tripe,The visuals made no sense.
3053,10,Real different than the orginal but still extraordinary,I really dont know why everybody is so negative about this movie because i thought it was really great. There are a lot of new characters this new triology and you see them evolve and thats really intersting to see. All the characters have battles inside of them about the dark and the light. People are angry because Luke is being so not Luke Skywalker but they forget he's much older and everybody is changing in the course of their life. The whole movie isn't about Luke. 
3054,1,Star Wars - No soup for you!,"Kathleen Kennedy,"
3055,,The Last Jedi Broke My Heart,"And, the hearts of my children. I was extremely skeptical when Disney first bought this precious empire but my heart was won by TFA and RO made me a believer. I went into TLJ on opening night full of trust and expectation. "
3056,8,"Like Rafiki said to Simba ""Look closer.""","If the next movie in a series is different from the others; you complain. If it is like the others; you complain. This one brings balance to the force and you missed the point. Known characters grow and change. New characters are introduced. Luke was the new hope and now the last jedi. Rey is now the new hope. The next film can go into a universe of directions. If you hated this movie please don't come to the next. That way, Star Wars will end for you. The rest of us, who ""look closer"", can enjoy the new galaxy in the near future and near to our hearts."
3057,9,Have you ever ridden a roller coaster?,"The Last Jedi was the film that really took a 180° turn process through the film and then took another 180° turn, towards the end of it. Resulting in a 360° turn, which is inline with a roller coaster, you start where you end. This film had plenty, and yes, I meant plenty of fanfare which I can safely say unexpected. This can be a nuisance at times but when you look at it right, it was necessary. Like I said, it was a roller coaster ride. Usually, in a standard plot process, there is a climax and I repeat a climax, but this film felt that there are several climaxes. It really depends how invested are you in the character(s) of the film, be it Leia, Rey, Kylo and of course, Luke (which I believe is the main climax of the film). Indeed, a roller coaster ride which goes up, goes down, and goes up again. "
3058,10,Long time Star Wars fan here.,My review does not have spoilers because is I would not ruin it for anyone. I really don't like all these people giving 1 or 2 stars and then giving spoilers in there review. 
3059,4,Just plain old bad,Rather than write a bad review I will point out plot-hole/continuity questions that should be in the FAQ...
3060,8,Not your classic Star Wars,"Okay, I might get a lot of hate from the hardcore fans but here it goes: I liked the last Jedi. A lot."
3061,1,Worst Star Wars Movie of All Time,"Nothing in this movie even makes sense. Not only is it a terrible Star Wars movie, it's just a bad movie over all. It has so many plot holes in it, if it was a ship it'd be at the bottom of the ocean. 80% of it's dialogue is just awful one liners. The entire plot makes no sense. The characters will say something like ""This giant door we just closed is the only way in or out of this base!"" then the next scene everyone runs or flies out of the base to fight the First Order. NO SENSE. That's just one of many examples. The movie itself is stupid as can be. While I may not have liked The Force Awakens either, at least it felt somewhat like a Star Wars movie. Speaking of which, Rian Johnson completely ignored the previous film. Everything JJ Abrams set up to further the plot was flat out ignored or deliberately dismantled. The biggest example of this is probably that Rey isn't a Skywalker. She is a nobody. In The Last Jedi, they explain her unnatural strength in the force for someone who has had zero training due to the fact that Snoke ""Force-connected"" her and Kylo Ren so that she has all of his abilities... come on. So DUMB. This movie is everything that Star Wars isn't. I hate you, Rian Johnson, and I hate you Disney."
3062,,A poor film.,"Good visuals, good acting unfortunately it a confused stumbling storyline, poorly structured, no character depth whatsoever. Do I need to explain the difference between being told something is emotional and actually feeling the emotion.? The former is what this film dishes out in bundles.. deliberately over sentimental scenes forced down your throat without you actually feeling a thing.. a poor attempt at copying moments that happened in other films but missing the point entirely. I'm actually too crestfallen to waste my time going on about the plot holes, cringeworthy comedy scenes, character assasinations and storylines that end nowhere with no interest of where they'll end up.. just a poor attempt that has done more damage than good. Wish I could say something positive... I liked seeing the kamikaze scene. But only because of the visuals."
3063,10,"Refreshing, Fun, and Emotional.","Ok, so many people will hit this movie with a 1 or a 10 with no real reasoning, so this is how I'm gonna back this 10. I will weigh the Pros, Cons, and patch up some complaints that others tend to have. To Begin, Cons:<br /><br />"
3064,8,charchter,Nice movie great stuff great topic every thing is good
3065,10,The best star wars movie ever!!!,"I watched it a few days ago and i'm stilI thinking about it, i was blown away!!! i don't understand how people could hate this movie, i've seen the other star wars movies many times and this movie is by far the best one! the story is on fleek and the special effects are absolutely stunning, there are no boring parts in the movie...and Carrie Fisher's performance is brilliant. Next week i'm gonna watch it again for sure:-P!"
3066,1,Star Wars is now Dead to me,"Having watched every Star Wars from the 2nd in cinema on the release days with huge anticipation, after the boring rehash that was the last one, I didn't bother even going to the cinema for this one. Having now watched on a long haul flight with nothing else to watch, I want my two hours back so I can sit there staring at nothing instead. Others have said it all - total garbage."
3067,9,Star Wars at it's finest,"I had low expectations on "" The last jedi"". First because of desappointment for ""The force awakens"" and second because of all the bad reviews. But they are totally unfair. What you got here is top notch Star Wars. A worthy episode. The plot is fantastic, full of twists, the acting is great, the space battles are amazing. the whole movie keeps you interested till the end. Don't mind the critics, wether you're a fan or a sci-fi lover, go for this one. You won't regret."
3068,4,Desperate attempt to make the Chinese look good,"Just as expected of any Disney film, to make money in China, it has added bunch of scenes by the Asian actors unnecessarily, showing them as heroic, clear headed and rationale compared to other actors. For example, the first bomber scene, she was Asian; then her sister is there; then in the casino, nice looking ladies are Asian."
3069,10,Fantastically funny,"Ignore the wild manipulation by the vast numbers of trolls who are running this film down. This is a hilarious space romp, right back at its roots of what Star Wars was really all about - having some fun. The tone of the film is set from the moment that Stars Wars fans have waited 40 years for: the utterance of the first words from Mark Hamill - the hand outstretched for the Light Sabre, only for him to toss it over his shoulder and walk away. I laughed my head off - it was a true comedy moment and I could feel the ire that moment would have drawn, which made me laugh even harder. Star Wars had finally stopped trying to be super-serious lost in boring stories and was about to deliver something truly entertaining..."
3070,,The worst movie I have seen in a long time!!!!!!,This movie had all the thrills of the low speed police chase of OJ Simpson and basically the same plot.
3071,10,Exciting and incredible,"Incredible, beautiful, and daring. I love it when they get me out of the comfort zone with such mastery. Star wars needed this episode. I hope more surprises and more Rian Johnson!"
3072,10,The best Star Wars movie so far!,"The Last Jedi is brilliant! Visually, emotionally, in terms of the depth of characters and their journey to firnd their place in a galaxy far far away, it brings the story one step ahead of the Cold War era black-white messages it used to carry! It is fresh, it adds a lot to the characters' arc stories! It delivers the best villain we ever got in this franchise because Kylo Ren is human, is complex and layered, he is a loose canon that turns unpredictable every moment! The Last Jedi gave us the most badass Luke Skywalker we ever got and it takes the whole story of this sequel trilogy one step further towards a very modern direction... The cinematography is just stunning, the soundtrack is great as always, and it feels really real! If you are expecting this movie to deal in absolutes and present brave flawless heroes, this is definetely not your film! But if you are looking forward to a modern touch, while still capturing the magic of the originals that we loved, then YES by all means! Go for it and don't listen to anyone! Just keep in mind that still, this is the second part, it's not the conclusion of the trilogy and there are plenty more, or even different, answers to your question from The Force Awakens! But for now, you will have to deal with the most unexpected and difficult answers that our protagonist could get... and it's tottaly worth the shock!!!"
3073,1,PATHETIC,"A disgrace of a movie, excruciatingly boring with no story whatsoever. Just endless plotkai and bumbling along, jj adams and kathleen kennedy should never make another movie and all star wars fans should boycott and attack to make sure any future movies they produce bomb."
3074,10,Love it,So much undeserved hate. Just watch it and have fun.
3075,5,Could the script get any more puerile?,"Could the script get any more puerile? It felt like it was written by a bunch of 12 year old Fan Boys, and this makes it a chore for the more mature movie goers. And it is far too long with a lot of very unnecessary scenes. Watched in a theater very obvious young Star War fans but no cheering, applauding or any other interaction from them at any point in the movie. Chatting with several outside after the movie finished the general comment was - disappointing!"
3076,8,Don't listen to the haters,"The film is pretty great, well acted, great action, and fight scenes, I think that this film pushes the boundaries of what a Star Wars movie can be. Canto Bight might not be the best scenes in the film but it allows a look into the grittier political side of Star Wars rarely if ever scene. <br /><br />I'd put it at the 3rd best of the episodics. "
3077,,"Thank-you, Kathleen Kennedy! You Came Though Again!","Make no mistake. This film Rocks! Kathleen you wunderkid, you did it again!"
3078,10,Best Star Wars movie,Best Star Wars movie period. I truly love the way Rian Johnson approached this franchise. It was fresh but it still felt like Star Wars. It's the direction Lucasfilm should go with in their future projects.
3079,8,I seem to have seen a different movie than most commenters.,"This movie was a lot of fun. Perfect? No.<br /><br />But it is easily better than the the prequels, but that is no feat."
3080,1,I was wondering if the last Pirates of the Caribbean was better!,Critics stop lying to us! you cant call this movie best star wars movie ever!<br /><br />I get it everyone have they own opinion!
3081,10,"No Jar Jar, No Ewoks, No Midichlorians? No Lucas????????????????","I would give this more stars for them forgetting about the midi-chlorians. A fun movie for all who don't live in their parents' basement( Ha I live on the top floor). They are definitely going in another direction. The last 2 films are setting us up for the future of Star Wars and I think they are doing a good job. Time to let the past die, I guess."
3082,3,My worse experience for a Star Wars ever,I just watched the movie about 3 hours ago and seeing so much good review I simply can't understand them. So let me give you my opinion on it.
3083,,"Not a bad movie, but not a great one","For all of those who feel betrayed, disappointed, and upset (I can relate) this movie is not a 1, 2, or 3 stars out of 10. No matter how you look at it the movie is not that bad. Please be honest/realistic when you rate instead of lashing out in anger."
3084,9,"My family and I loved this movie, and couldn't understand the hate","I went to see this with my parents, my older bothers, my sister-in-law and my niece. I am a 37 year-old lifelong Star Wars fan. We have all watched all the films and discussed them all. I kept waiting for this film to disappoint us, and to go home dispirited seeing the franchise ruined. I wanted my family to be with me if that happened. Instead, I found tears of joy in my eyes, and looking over at my father to see him also choking up, because of how beautiful it was. Even my mother and niece, who have been somewhat lukewarm about previous Star Wars films, loved this one, and are looking forward to seeing it again. We honestly went home scratching our heads at why anyone would dislike it. I recently went to see it again in IMAX 3D, and loved it all over again. This is the best Star Wars film I've seen in a long time. FYI, I found Rogue One to be the worse ""Star Wars"" film and gave that a scathing review. That left a bad taste in my mouth about the direction the franchise might be headed. My faith in Disney was restored with TLJ, and I trust that at least Rian Johnson has kept the vision alive of what makes Star Wars great. Was only saddened and perplexed to see so many people hate on this film."
3085,10,Risks like never before,The Last Jedi is fantastic! They take risks like never before this is not only a great star wars movie but it is a great film. The whole cast gives great performances especially Adam Driver and Daisy Ridely
3086,9,An interesting direction for a much-loved series.,"First and foremost: Critic reviews saying that this movie was awful have all got it wrong. This movie wasn't awful, it was just... unexpected. To explain:"
3087,1,If only we could go back in time and erase this atrocity from theatrical history...,"This 'movie' ruined Star Wars period. Nothing more to say. It's been hashed and re-hashed over how and why it ruined Star Wars, so I don't need to go into that. I'll just add my vote to the consensus. Sad. So Sad."
3088,8,I don't understand why it gets hate,"To put things simply, I really enjoyed The Last Jedi. I thought it was a very good Star Wars movie with great performances and great action sequences. There are two main issues that I have with this movie which does mean that I don't like it as much as The Force Awakens. All of the actors and actresses were amazing in this movie, especially Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley as Luke and Rey. Oscar Isaac once again proves to be a good addition to the Star Wars universe as Poe Dameron and Adam Driver was very good with Kylo in this movie. Seeing Carrie Fisher play General Organa once more was beautiful and I really loved the way she was. It honestly brought a tear to my eye. "
3089,1,Here Is A Poll,Which is the worst film in history:
3090,8,Star Wars at its weirdest,"Star Wars has never been more bizarre, and I love it"
3091,10,best star wars movie,"Maybe, the best movie ever. plot twists, character developments, great scenes in general. directors did a great job. The plot was unexpected in a good way (for those that say the plot was stupid let me remind you the plot of the prequels)"
3092,8,Balance in the Force Awakens,"Finally went to see this in theaters, and overall my gut feeling is positive. I understand how people are getting really negative vibes from this movie because of how different the style was from the original films. It had more of a rogue one feel (which I automatically like, this is star WARS) than the previous episode, an episode I didn't really much care for. Han died plus it was basically a direct remake of new hope, but Disney put the epic in star WARS with this one and did a pretty good job with passing on the Jedi torch so to speak. "
3093,3,Worst yet,"I have just returned from watching this overly long nonsense and am surprised at the rating it has been given thus far. I suppose the stars wars desperates are the most likely to respond early in the movies season and many of them click 10 as soon as the yellow test spools.<br /><br />There have been some ordinary uneccessarily convoluted Star Wars flicks over the years but this one is a whole new order of tedium, none of the characters came across in a way that inspired me to care two figs about what they did or whether they lived or died. Even worse I cannot thing of a single scene where the eventual outcome wasn't patently obvious from the get go.<br /><br />I won't induge the spoiler queens by being more specific if you watch this mess you will understand.."
3094,10,Best Star Wars Ever!,"I have been a Star Wars fan since a child. I have watched every Star Wars movie multiple times, except the The Force Awakens and Rogue One. With The Force Awakens I was expecting a relaunch, something new and fresh, instead it was just a remake of Episode 4. Rogue One was ok, but not the kind of movie I expected either."
3095,2,Razzie 2018,This is the Star Wars equilvalent to Star Trek Nemisis... a franchise killer. If you toss decades of lore out the window you get this. 
3096,8,The Last Jedi is one of the better Star Wars films,"Upon seeing Last Jedi I was excited to compare my thoughts with my friends to see if we all enjoyed. It was unanimous that we loved the film, so much that most of us saw it at least twice in theaters (which for a college student is more money than we really should have spent)."
3097,8,"Very Good Movie, But Fails Long-Time Fans of Star Wars Mythology","Two things seemingly the opposite are true here. This is an entertaining, well directed, thoughtful and essentially very good movie. At the same time, there are many problems including with the story itself and particularly with things apparently unanswered, never addressed or just left out. I will not address the good about this movie nearly as much as the bad, but here goes:"
3098,10,A movie for any Porg fan.,Porg wars: the last Porg is a porgtacular movie well worth a viewing with a Porg or two.<br /><br />I'd give it 60 portions.
3099,1,Star Wars- the last film I will ever see,"Where do I start? What a joke of a film this is Disney just cashing in on the original trilogy but in there way. The whole thing is a disaster how on earth are critics saying this is good they must be paid simple. To say the script was disjointed is a understatement it's awful, even Luke Skywalker was not the same character in any way. To even mention the villains would be a waste of time. To me Star Wars ended on Return of the Jedi."
3100,,"Deflating, slowly.","Startling sound design, visuals and fine performances from Hammill and Driver form a glossy wrapping which, once unpacked, reveal a sadly bland, stodgy, messy, uneven and ultimately futile storyline."
3101,9,alot of haters....,"....Everybody is aware that Star Wars is basically a space-opera western....right? Try not to take it so seriously, & enjoy the flick. I mean, character's in Star Wars are notorious for lying....all because Kylo said what he said...doesn't make it true."
3102,1,Horrible,How is this movie a 7. It was as boring as watching paint dry. Terrible.
3103,10,A GREAT MOVIE AND A BRAVE NEW DIRECTION FOR STAR WARS,"Don't pay attention to the hate reviews !! TLJ was trully a phenomenal movie which laid the foundations for the future of the saga, with respect to the past and with a bold new vision. Finally, it's not just about the Skywalkers anymore !! "
3104,10,Weird,"I understand Princess Leia was having an emotional moment, but did she have to say the n-word when she was talking to Chewbacca?"
3105,10,"This is a Great movie, say I and my Daughter. Screw the Wars Nerds","I'm not a Star Wars guy. I was 17 years old before I learned that Space Balls was a spoof of an actual movie. <br /><br />Two years ago when The Force Awakens was impending, I spent 6 Friday nights in a row with my daughter watching Phantom Menace through Return of the Jedi. It was Painful. Painful. The Last Jedi is an amazing Film and stands alone but does a spectacular job nodding to the previous stories and including the legends from a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. Jedi seems its happening in real time. The strife, fight, and charactesr are muscular and vibrant while keeping with the campy tradition of the previous films. Adam Driver is a panther as Ren. The conflict with he and Ridley as Rey is the stuff that would launch a franchise in any other . . . galaxy. Isaac and Gleeson continue to pay their dues for being extraordinary performers, just flat out nailing roles which are below their capabilities. I don't like Star Wars, but his movie was AWESOME. BCTB"
3106,3,DISAPPOINTED!,"Completely, and unequivocally disappointed! Story was utter trash. Lawrence Kasdan should've returned to write the story; why not Disney?! All that build up in TFA was for nothing! Luke's character was trashed! Then Leia turned into Mary Poppins in one of numerous dumb scenes?! And the poor treatment of General Ackbar! Not sure how Abrams will redeem the third installment."
3107,10,The best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back,"Rian Johnson made an espetacular job putting Star Wars in a new direction: ""We need to renew, but don't forget what the past teached us""."
3108,1,If you compare this to empire strikes back you have no brains!,This is nothing like one of the greatest sequels in movie history! The last jedi is absolute trash! The scene where kylo Ren and MaRey Sue fight the guards is the worse choreographed fight scene in cinematic history! Seriously go back watch it then watch in slow motion its just God awful and don't get me started on how roundhead Johnson completely disrespected Luke Skywalker! Kathleen Kennedy needed to be fired years ago for destroying the feast franchise in movie history! .
3109,,"Great movie and great evolution of the series, Star Wars fans are just impossible to please","First off, the movie was fantastic. I would say it rivals Episode V for the greatest Star Wars film of all time. Everything from the story, to the characters, to the visuals, soundtrack and especially acting performances was simply...amazing. I found myself captivated and shocked, however in a manner that is unlike many reviewing the movie here that refuse to allow the franchise to grow in a new and exciting direction. It was fun, unpredictable, and genuinely left me wanting more."
3110,9,"""The Last Jedi"": Flawed Greatness",First off: SPOILER ALERT!
3111,8,"Well Directed, a few surprises but",I had great expectations walking into the Theatre to see this movie. I thought I will end up watching another ''Empire Strikes Back''. Well this is for sure not the case here...
3112,9,Thanks god for John Williams,"Great movie, fantastic shoot, cut and with the right composer John Williams i pray to god that he survives until the next capter because Michael Giacchino's music has no soul though he composes for all new movies. Good but lame music lack soul. Every scene in this movie you feel the scene because of Williams score."
3113,1,Don't waste your time,"With recently overhyped movies, this is one of the worst. It's a disgrace to Star Wars franchise and to all the Star Wars lovers. Disney should have stopped and stick with its own childish movies.Everyone can be a Jedi? Blashphemy! Rey spend sometimes fooling around and then she becomes a Jedi master? Look, we have enough.<br /><br />Disney obviously paid for the ratings. 7.5/10 for this trash? Oh please, thought you people have some values."
3114,9,Every word of what you said was wrong...,"Whilst I fully accept and understand the disappointment of many fans writing reviews of The Last Jedi on here, I can only assume that much of the disappointment stems from their desire for the saga to keep on using the same old formula and see the plot twists and turns follow the same pattern as the original trilogy. The Force Awakens was good, but very much weakened by its close adherence to the originals (for example, nothing presented in TLJ is as bad a misstep as the dreadful repetitive muddle that was the Starkiller Base); TFA was enjoyable blockbuster filmmaking but fell short of greatness. Disney were quite right to let Rian Johnson take risks here, and it have really paid off with the most surprising and intelligent Star Wars film since TESB. "
3115,1,"If you haven't seen it, my advice is that you do not.","I've been a dedicated Star Wars fan my whole life. The first film I saw in theatres was Empire Strikes back. I've seen every single release on the big screen, including the special editions, multiple times - with the exception of The Last Jedi which I saw only once, and Solo which I didn't see at all. For those rare people who haven't yet seen or experienced Star Wars, do yourselves a favour and watch the original trilogy. It doesn't really matter which edition you watch, but personally I prefer the original formats. Each of the three were spectacular in their own right, and Empire Strikes back is considered by some to be one of the greatest films ever made. Not everyone would agree with me, but many would, that the Last Jedi is both the weakest of all 8 of the saga films (Episode 9 has not yet been released) and that it also does the most damage to both the lore of the Star Wars universe and to the most important legacy character. Many people who saw this film wish they had not. I am one of them."
3116,9,Let's be honest,"Okay, I am fundamentally fed up with the hurt feelings of so called ""fans"" whose whining is even less bearable than Anakin complaining about live being unfair. Everytime a new Star Wars movie comes out, there come the complainers because first there was Jar Jar (""GL just ruined my childhood""), then there was VII which was a remake of IV and not original enough and now comes a movie that dares to be different and goes another way and again I hear/read the whining: ""it is not the Star Wars of my childhood."" Guess what, it is not. If you want that, stay at home and watch you old VHS tapes where Han shoots first and don't bore me with your insufferable complaining."
3117,8,One of my favorite SW films,"This film has absolutely created a divide within the Star Wars fandom, and I definitely see why. I do think a lot of the vitriol towards it and Rian Johnson is kind of silly, though."
3118,9,"way better than Force Awakens,","No Spoilers!!!!<br /><br /> I dont understant the hate the movie is receiving, it's good, really good. felt like a complete movie, not just like a part of a series. TLJ had it star wars moments to make fans go crazy, i have never wrote a single review before, but seeing the ratio of negative comments, i owe this movie a good review. the movie is nothing ilke the negative reviews posted here. yeah the movie doesn't have an epic typical lightsaber duel and few other typical star wars stuff. do u want epic duel in every movie or good story and screenplay. this movie is way better than the force awakwens, yet this movie has rating lower than that. so ignore the negative review and watch the movie"
3119,1,Not My Star Wars!!!,This is not a Star Wars movie. This is an atrocity. An abomination that never should've been born. We must destroy this garbage at the source.
3120,10,enjoyed it.,"Quality film, good vis effects and interesting plot points."
3121,1,Just a bad movie,"Episode 7 was a good ""new"" episode, with a lot of references to the saga and with new characters to develop.<br /><br />Episode 8 is the opposite. No meaningful reference to the saga, the breaking of all the rules that they created in the previous 7/8 movies and absolute pathetic development of the characters.<br /><br />Finally, I cannot understand the IMDB rating of this movie. It is not a bad movie for a ""old saga fan"", it is just a bad movie. The casino sub-plot is completely useless. All the slow-chasing part is a waste of time. Rei and Kilo magically skyping (and he gets wet) is simply stupid. I didn't really care for a single character... I saw the movie yesterday and today I don't even remember how it ends...<br /><br />(still, I am looking forward to see episode 9!)"
3122,10,Worthy movie,"I cant understand all those 1 star rating at all, why so much hate toward an entertaining movie?! I agree that there were many plotholes and Luke Skywalker-doing-nothing. But overall its still a good one worthy to be in Starwars franchise. Beautiful screenplay especially the last battle, the dying of old generation and the beginning of the new one, more humours... all in all not perfect but well balanced.<br /><br />Common folks, if they made it too much similar to the old triology you will complaint and they made it with fresh ingredients you also will complaint?! Why not just relax and enjoy a good movie?! I personnaly think this one more suitable for a 7, but gave it a 10 to compensate for all the 1 star haters.<br /><br />From a big fan of Starwars since 1987."
3123,9,Ignore the mob of angry fanboys and take this movie for what it is - a great Star Wars film,"I know that the general audience doesn't always have to agree with critics, but in this case I am baffled by the divide between them. Critics praised this film for many reasons, while the mass of upset fans can't seem to agree on what it is that makes this film bad: it's too much like The Empire Strikes Back, it does so many things so wildly different from any other Star Wars movie that it can't be considered Star Wars anymore, they don't agree with how some characters have turned out, etc etc etc."
3124,10,"Revived, evolved, modernized","Yesterday with our IMAX tickets booked two months ago, we walked into a pleasant surprise. The last jedi is bold and new, pinning a thorough transaction into the generation Z, on the characters, the cast, and the audience."
3125,1,It's so derivative. Why would a mess like this be made?,It's hard to believe this was made. This killed off the Star Wars franchise. <br /><br />I know Marvel does better than this while this....is a pile of junk. <br /><br />It's a big insult for Star Wars fans and one thing from that movie is that a small bunch of malcontents cannot withstand superior firepower from a more powerful enemy. <br /><br />I don't know why some people keep spamming the love button so much. <br /><br />Humor is spreading everywhere. Plot holes galore. 
3126,8,The Last Jedi sets up for an epic finale of the trilogy!,"I really enjoyed what Rian Johnson did with the plot of The Last Jedi. He brought several new aspects to The Force that we have not yet seen in a Star Wars movie. He also created some really exciting fight scenes with very good graphics. However, I thought the subplot was weak because of Rose's character. I was not the actresses fault, it was the script that was wrote of her, and she brought an unnecessary element to the movie."
3127,1,Terrible Movie,No franchise in history has as much good will as the Star Wars franchise and they just blew it here. This is a boring movie with lots of boring stuff in it. The action sequences are nothing special nothing really cool happens.
3128,,Your were the chosen one ! And Rian Johnson destroyed the franchise,"Destroyed Luke Skywalker character , first order can't even destroy 3 ships. What happened to fighters/bombers, did Rian Johnson watch previous Star Wars films. Please someone crowd fund a remake."
3129,10,2017 Best Movie,"Yes, for me it was the best movie of 2017. <br /><br />No more comments, just go see the movie. If its too late, go buy the Blu-ray disk, I will buy it as well."
3130,8,It's time for all the whining and bellyaching...to end.,"For the life of me, i have never seen so much aspersion cast on a movie that didn't deserve it at all. And it's shameful, because Rian Johnson delivered a challenging, complex, original, interesting, and bold entry into the star wars franchise. But. As always, the moutbreathers who watch these movies ruin any attempt at genuine innovation because it's ""too different"" for the brainless rabble to handle. "
3131,9,This is not going to go the way you think...,"From the crawl to the ending, this movie has shattered all my expectations while also setting an even higher bar for the upcoming movies in the franchise. The revolutionary directing by Rian Johnson is by far the best part of this movie, incredible scenes, amazing battles and a plot that not only fits perfectly in the SW universe but also sets the stage for the last installment in the trilogy."
3132,1,Worst Wars Yet!,"What a massive floating leftist piece of propaganda!<br /><br />First off - <br /><br />Lucas rule #1 - George wanted a ""used"" look in this epic tale because sci fi films always had new pristine ships etc. They threw in old fighters at the end that did absolutely nothing!<br /><br />#2 - (which describes the whole movie) The main plot of the movie is a slow motion escape from the bad guys. <br /><br />Really??<br /><br />This was like watching the OJ Simpson chase but having to pay to watch it. <br /><br />So the bad guys can't catch them but they also can't travel light speed to get ahead of them and wait for them? Or call other ships to intersect them? <br /><br />#3 - ""HATE THE RICH"" theme invades Star Wars. ""The worst people in the universe"" are the rich people in ""Monte Carlo!""<br /><br />Really? <br /><br />The SAME character later says ""We will win by protecting what we love not destroying what we hate."" This is AFTER she trashes the casino with runaway animals. <br /><br />Anyone else see the liberal double standard?<br /><br />She also just stopped FN from SAVING the people he cares about!!<br /><br />Makes NO sense. <br /><br />#4 - It's okay to eat fish but not chicken. Luke eats fish but fanged carnivore Chewbacca won't eat chicken because he feels bad and becomes friends with his food! This is the best friend of a well know ""scoundrel"" and has no place in a Star Wars movie where animals used to eat other animals like the snow monster and Jabba. <br /><br />Those little birds are everywhere and infesting the Millenium Falcon (which has a NEW cockpit update - see Lucas rule #1)<br /><br />Luke also shows us where green milk comes from (nod to the BLUE milk in ep. 4)<br /><br />#5 - Gravity in space??<br /><br />Who drops gravity bombs in zero G? Not to mention ships that fall and lose speed when they run out of gas. How much gas has Voyager used getting out of our solar system?<br /><br />The problem with liberals is as soon as they hear the term UFO they suddenly think they are L. Ron Hubbard!!<br /><br />This was the worst Star Wars film yet and the first one I have NO desire to watch again let alone many times. <br /><br />There was nothing new, creative or exciting in this film just PC propaganda and an example of ""do nothing and lead from behind"". There is NO reason Laura Dern has to keep the plan a secret. It was funny to see her say ""Pew"" when she shot the gun but that belongs in a spoof not the franchise. <br /><br />Just total idiocy through the whole film with absolutely NO redeeming plots, characters or scenes. Two Jedi staring at each other for 10 minutes in an empty green screen room ""fighting"" is worse than all the mind control torture on the old Star Trek shows. <br /><br />George Lucas is laughing all the way to the bank since his Billion dollar sell out of the franchise. Kinda like the guy who sold MySpace."
3133,9,"So, so good","It is really weird reading all the negative reviews about this movie when it contains absolutely everything we need for blockbusters nowadays: new ideas, risky decisions, respect for what came before but still looking forward. I applaud Rian Johnson for being ballsy enough to completely ignore fan theories and create something fresh and unique while still being truthful to what was created before. I loved this movie so much and will be seeing it again this week. For the first time a Star Wars movie made me feel excited and giddy since the first time I saw the original trilogy. Rian Johnson, you're my new hero."
3134,1,Disgrace to the Star Wars universe,"I see that everything that I feel about this movie has been already said, so I'll just say this: I want all copies of this movie burned and Geroge Lucas to film a proper remake where Luke is a brave hero rather than grumpy old whimp."
3135,,An alright viewing but lacks originality!,Essentially episode 5 and 6 rolled into one and another example of the epidemic of lazy writing and a lack of imagination. Saying that the first hour or so is an enjoyable watch when leading to the climax - the last 30 mins or so is what lets it down. There was a lot of anticipation for the face off between Luke/Rey/Snoke/Kylo Ren and that was deflated faster than a balloon. 
3136,10,The refresh that Star Wars needed,"As Ep. I,II,III were about Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padmé, and IV,V,VI, Luke, Han and Leia, we now have three new heroes: Rey, Finn and Poe."
3137,9,Extraordinario regreso a una galaxia muy lejana,"Reading all the reviews on this page, i realizes that the worst enemies of star wars are the fans themselves, and more those who got stuck in the first episodes and never accept a renewal or ideas that come out of their supposed nonexistent canon. The Last Jedi is great entertainment, fun, excitement, great performances from Hamill and Driver, the truth is that it is a different star wars but not bad, on the contrary it is to see those little ones who play with laser swords, girls dressed like Rey in the street, is to feel again what you felt when you stepped into the movie theater to get fully into that galaxy far, far away. Hurts for those who come in to see what is wrong with everything and who end up putting together a hate campaign against something they deeply love. Do not believe in criticism, go and see it and decide for yourselves."
3138,9,A film ahead of it's time.,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a challenging, bold, and different movie than many expected. While critical response has been extremely positive, it seems general audiences are having more divisive views on the film. Some applaud it as the best entry in the series since the release of Empire Strikes Back, while there are others who claim it is the worst entry in the entire series. For me personally, I believe in the years to come Last Jedi will be looked back upon as one of the greatest Star Wars films, and one of the greatest sequels, ever made. It's been interesting to see the audience response since many who feel disappointed seem to forget, or were just never aware, that this kind of reception is the exact one received by Empire Strikes Back when it was first released. People were divided on that as well. It wasn't until the original trilogy ended that fans looked back on it so fondly, as do I (Empire is not only my favorite Star Wars film but also my favorite film period.) So like everyone who went to see Last Jedi opening night I did indeed have high expectations. Force Awakens was the film that brought Star Wars back to it's former glory, and Last Jedi elevated it even further. It is gracefully written and directed by Rian Johnson, giving us some of the best visuals we've ever had in a Star Wars film, as well as a gut retching story about self discovery, loss, coping, dealing with hate and revenge, and inner demons. This a movie not afraid to make you think and, more importantly, feel. You will have emotional reactions to this film and that exactly what the filmmaker wanted, whether you like those reactions or not. It's redundant to talk about what a stellar cast the movie has. From Daisy Ridley's Rey to Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, they all do a phenomenal job here, including Oscar Issac, who was sorely underused in Awakens, as Poe Dameron. His arc is one of the more interesting ones, whose resolution goes against normal ""hotshot pilot"" cliche's. The weakest, but by no means is a weak performance, of the cast would be John Boyega's Finn and the newly introduced Kelly Marie Tran's Rose. Their plot meanders as they're sent on a side quest of sorts, but the resolution leading to the climax helps save this subplot. As most have agreed, the stand outs are the late Carrie Fisher in her final performance, which was beautifully poetic and wonderfully performed, and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, who gives the greatest performance of his career thus far. Luke is not the same wide eyed boy from the original trilogy hoping for a greater purpose. He is a broken man who has had tragedy strike his life. Much like Empire, this is a darker entry in the series, but still has a feeling of hope throughout it. It may not be easy for some to accept yet, but in time I feel The Last Jedi will indeed be recognized as a great film that holds up to the lofty standards of it's predecessors, just as I see it today."
3139,2,The only thing missing is the laugh track.,5 Minutes into this movie it was all clear. I was looking at Star Wars - The comedy. Disney's desperate attempt of trying to please fans of all ages ends up in a chaotic storyline where nothing interesting really happens.
3140,8,Calm down guys it's just a movie,"I really enjoyed this movie i had a little complain after coming out the cinema that it wasn't the movie I expected but if it was how boring would that be. After reading the really negative reviews on here I felt I should also add my in depth thoughts ....... it was smashing. Watch it, make your own mind up and If you don't enjoy it don't go and see the next one. simples"
3141,2,This is in no way a true Star Wars film.. Just random marvel film with SW charc,"Being a movie lover and a writer, you go in a cinema with higher expectations and a different view then your average movie goer. so when i got the chance to see this film on its opening weekend, I was so excited! But unfortunately for me and a lot of Star Wars, and genuine movie fans we were let down. This 8th film in the franchise feels and views nothing like its predecessors. The film lacks in every aspect. It continuously changes its genre from being a drama, action, comedy... Its<br /><br />flow always get broken up, and is always all over the place.<br /><br />Then there is the whole scenes and unnecessary plot adjustments that dont make sense. The characters are becoming so ridiculous and pointless at the same time. Finn has no character progression what so ever. Ray literally had no training in the Jedi ways, as she never even had her 3rd lesson with skywalker, but took on the red guards and Kylo Ren. "
3142,,Not bad,"I just saw it. Not bad - not as bad as most of the other reviews here say it is. Will I see it again at the theater? NO! There were a couple scenes that were moving - when R2 projects Leia's original Help Me Obi-Wan message, when Yoda appears, when Luke dies. There were also a couple really good SPFX too. My biggest problem with these new films thought, and I speak for everything from TPM -TLJ is that they are too vast in scope. Too many characters, too many plot lines. The originals were small films filmed on claustrophobic sets; victims of budget restraints and SPFX limits - but that's what endeared them to us as well.<br /><br />In summary, this movie is not bad at all, but it's no original trilogy either. Will you run back to the theater 35 times to see it again and again- no. Will you rent it and watch at least one more time-yes. Will you buy the DVD-probably."
3143,8,Are we all watching the same movie?,"First off, I am a HUGE Star Wars Fan (almost as big as they come). For what it is worth, I am also a pretty tough rater on IMDb. And I LIKED this movie!"
3144,9,"Great Sequel, Don't Listen to the Fan Boys","Fanboys are hating on this movie because it didn't follow fan service. This movie was entertaining, beautifully filmed, and well acted. It doesn't play it safe and takes characters out of the comfort zone fans would expect. This is one of the rare times that I say I agree with professional critics."
3145,9,Among the best of the series...,"This is brilliant! Unlike most genre films, it has real heart. It's not really about lightsaber and spaceships, but more about relationships and the nature of war. Mark Hammill gets to have a proper Jedi send off, saving the day with his powers and passing the torch to the next generation. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver steal the show and set up a great finale by killing off the MacGuffin, Snoke...."
3146,1,The Last Jedi... Are you kidding me 😳,What the hell Disney was doing to this Lucas Baby?!?<br /><br />The last Jedi was just a drunk man living with gay creatures. 'drink a strange thing probably an engine oil. He was scared and hiding on a island. Yet a Ray Su came from the super women planet who knows everything in the world. Because she is a female super powerful skills is granted.<br /><br />This is nothing to do with star wars ideology about hardworking and keeping fighting for yourself.
3147,9,New,"Beautifully made, new and unexpected. Despite the long 2 1/2 hours long film, The Last Jedi redeems alot of the cultural values and resets another foundation to remind us how much is there to identify in this film."
3148,1,There is no hope,"And thank god. Let this be the end of that entire universe. I'm Star Wars born and bred (and I worship ep IV and) but this episode has destroyed it all! Combine the matrix, Harry Potter and Mary Poppings (what was that last scene !) and U get the idea. Let the force die with this one !"
3149,,Star Girls Rebranded,Disney paid George Lucas 4 billion for the rights to Princess Leia and the right to re-brand Star Wars specifically for girls. I can't think of any other famous movie princess Disney did not already own prior to the Star Wars acquisition.
3150,8,A Star Wars film built around its own,The Last Jedi is one of many astonishing entries of the Star Wars saga.
3151,9,Amazing!,"I thought ""The Last Jedi"" was something new and exciting. I get why a lot of people were upset but that's because people were used to planet killers and other things from the other movies. I thought Luke Skywalker in this movie was perfect. The way he projected himself onto the planet Crait was the true version of the Jedi. He used knowledge and strategy instead of attack and power. This is my next favorite Star Wars next to the original trilogy."
3152,9,"Great Action, Great Visuals, A pretty original story that serves up for the hardcore fans!","A good story that lacks a bit sometimes. And amazing visuals, gosh! Though I felt that the cheesy Disney humor shined through too much."
3153,1,Oh dear....,"Just complete and utter nonsense. As if no one involved in making this awful, convoluted mash of a film knew anything about Star Wars at all and got all their information on the subject from a drunk madman. It's boring, badly acted, poorly cast and has huge plot holes but the worst part is the writing. Star Wars is dead and nitwits Johnson and Kennedy, backed by Dismalney are to blame. Avoid if you can. That's it for me, no more SW now it's been hi jacked!"
3154,9,A great experience for a 'Star Wars' fan like me .....,"When I saw the complaints about this movie I read the following:<br /><br />To much comedy? Really, are you really fu&^&^ 'Star Wars' fan because all 'Star Wars' movies have comedy on them. Tell me how many jokes you counted on 'The last jedi' and I can count the jokes in every one of the old movies.<br /><br />Do you guys remember C3PO and R2D2? Yoda trolling Luke?<br /><br />The way they portrait Luke? I may agree on this one but besides some moments he was kind afraid of Ray's force, he really kicked ass on this one and even without getting out of the island. Could give me a light saber fight? Maybe but Mark Hamil's performance was great. <br /><br />Snoke's dead could be play a little better but the scene was a better version of the emperor's death. <br /><br />Poe was great, Leia was great. <br /><br />Finn and Rose story was more filling and was probacly my only big complaint about the movie, the scene felt more like a 'Battlestar Galactica' than a 'Star Wars' scene but I guess movies these days can't avoid the romance.<br /><br />General Holdo's scene was spectacular but overall was a maybe unnecessary character but maybe because Carrie Fisher's death they used her the way they did. <br /><br />Benicio del Toro? Why he is even in this movie? <br /><br />The cinematography was spectacular.<br /><br />The special effects amazing.<br /><br />The music? Awesome.<br /><br />The acting? Very good. <br /><br />As a movie is great maybe as a 'Star wars' movie took some changes a little to far for some but for me the movie was just great."
3155,1,An Insult to longtime fans and those who worked hard for the revival!!!!!! (Spoilers),WTF just WTF i went in to see Star Wars and went out around 3 hours later from something else!
3156,10,One of the best,This Star Wars movie is one of the best. It's up there in my top 3 favorite movies. The twists are worthwhile and still leaves room for many answers in the next episode.
3157,9,"So, we did not like ep7 being a reboot, now we dont like ep8 being something unexpected...","I believe, everyone will need some time to start to like this movie for that, what it meant to be. The Saga is evolving and we can not expect to get always the same schematic stories. Ep7 was well enough for that. Rogue One was start to a new direction, ep8 continues. Well, to be honest I have to see it again and I might change my mind... :)"
3158,8,Wonderful Character Work....Slightly Less Wonderful Script,"This movie has wonderful character work. All the characters are taken in interesting new directions that feel right for their characters. Yes, EVEN Luke Skywalker. (I'll get to that in a second.) "
3159,4,"Fans In 2002: ""Attack of the Clones"" is the worst thing in the Star Wars saga!"" Rian Johnson in 2017: ""Hold my beer""","At least if simply viewed as a mindless spectacle, TLJ has some impressive visuals and battle sequences. Its also good to at least see Mark Hamill return to his most iconic character. Unfortunately, you'll eventually have to think about what those action scenes were in service of and what they ended up doing with the character of Luke Skywalker."
3160,8,Time for fanboys to relax,"Let me make something clear: I hated the Force Awakens. I thought it was massively unoriginal and played too much off of nostalgia. Leaving The Last Jedi, I found myself ecstatic. No, it was not perfect. Some lines of dialogue were cringe worthy. But this movie went in unexpected directions and I find it to be an excellent movie."
3161,2,Meh,Would rather watch jar jar binks than this... And that says a lot.
3162,8,This movie doesn't deserve the hate it is getting,"As a long time Star Wars fan myself. I saw the original trilogy as a kid in the 80's, and have loved the franchise ever since. But, the hyper criticism this movie is receiving as is often the case on the internet is way over blown. This film isn't perfect, many films aren't, and even the original trilogy had issues. I had a few problems with this movie. But, I consider them minor problems. Not on the level where I feel that Star Wars is ruined forever!! Biggest issue being I felt the reveal of who Rey's parent's were was a disappointment as of now at least. Also the Lukes role in this movie wasn't quite what I was expecting. But, over all it's a very enjoyable Star Wars movie. If you want to talk truly bad, go watch Attack of The Clones. This is far better movie than a lot of the over reacting super fans are saying, and I feel over time. This movie will become more appreciated even by them. Especially once episode 9 is out."
3163,8,"Lived up to the hype, and in some places, beyond.","The visual aspects of the film are stunning, the use of colour, beautiful landscapes, and gorgeous lighting, for me, the best looking Star Wars film to date, really adding to the spectacle, I cannot stress enough that you must watch this on the big screen. It fills you with nostalgia and immerses you into the universe again"
3164,8,"Surprisingly and fortunately, I was wrong in my expectations","I've read the commentaries and had gone full of conviction that Disney had ruined it, so I was ready to see the disaster and went yesterday to the movies; surprisingly and fortunately, I was wrong in my expectations as this movie gave me profound feelings and connection to the other ones, and now I think that most people who abhorred it just haven't catched the big picture. What is most grand about Star Wars is its philosophy: this movie has brought up again the Force cosmology, with concepts from Buddhist, Hinduist, Judeochristian and Taoist traditions. I wasn't expecting a part where Luke would teach lessons, and I got surprised in such synthetic way that the Force was managed to be presented and explained as a cosmic regulator that balances the natural laws and the antagonisms and consequences of the beings' free wills, and thus the movie adds more to it and helps to give understanding that it brings harmony by intervening according to each one choices to the dark or light side. Harmony where it is apparently chaos, balance in opposites, recurrence of life, death, freedom, limitations - learning and enlightenment events until sentient beings arise by means of providential opportunities and serve to give other opportunities to new fellow beings. Luke said it all, the Force isn't just about lightsabers, fights and floating things (and maybe those are the things that some fans gave more importance to and felt for their lack in the movie), it exists by itself and manifests through those who can bring harmony at the moment; and Luke wasn't a coward or deserter, just as he told his mistake was done in a moment of pure instinct, of fear of losing what he created and loved, so he made a choice in an instant, and although he regretted it right after and couldn't have imagined what would happen, he was trained and taught according to the Jedi lessons to know that one shall not give way to bad emotions and by them commit decisions to destroy others, since this perpetuates the dark side. So why wasn't he able to control himself? He got grieved about the way he had learned and his power weren't enough to avoid it, so in pure torment he exiled himself to order things up with himself, like an internal fight with reformulation of old concepts, he saw he had to find other ways than those he was trying, and die like this in oblivion if unsuccessful, but he haven't lost connection to the Force since he advanced a deeper understanding of it and Yoda was accompanying him. That can be a moral lesson to our lives and shows deeply the human potential, that no matter how trained we think we are there are moments when although we sight what brings bad consequences we still haven't reasoned enough to change ourselves, master the instincts and then we fall, but yet there is a teleological order that makes bad turn out to become good, since it is what can make even ""failure the greatest teacher"". It has happened during other moments in the saga with other Jedi, showing that masters can fail that at any stage in their Jedi discipline, but it seems like some fans negate this emotional aspect and want to see them as if they were flawless machines that had already controlled all of their human nature by negation and not by conducting them to an optimal point, or who think it is easy to keep with the Force once one reached it, instead of being a lifetime process of challenges (look at Yoda, he is good humored even as a Force ghost, that shows how he achieved the integrality of his nature, emotions and individuality, without self-annihilation, just self-improvement along his 800 years). Luke died with all his potential, spending all of his energies in a Force projection that kept not only his legend but the way of the Force going on, in a more powerful way than would be a lightsaber clash (like when Ben Kenobi simply went calm with Vader, knowing it would be better that way and that his spirit would continue one with the Force, acting as part of it, knowing how it works, guiding people and appearing in decisive moments). About the location map, it can be explained as something Luke created before going hermit.<br /><br />The other controversy is Rey, who appears to frolic effortlessly with Force abilities, and that seems like the same backlash Anakin had in the prequel trilogy, when he was born with a spontaneous load of midichlorians. Also, people didn't like the explanation about her parents, which seemed to have given it a sudden end. Regarding these questions, people have forgotten one theory, in which just like Anakin and the Chosen One prophecy, she may have been Force-conceived, without parents (Force parthenogenesis?), like the part where she encounters herself in the mirror can suggest, when she asks who her parents were. The midichlorians were an interesting addition to the Star Wars universe and are at first incomprehensible because they don't seem to link with the soul and the natural omnipresent Force: that is because we tend to ignore the spiritual realm of Star Wars, ""death, yet the Force""; who knows about it? People are born with a capacity of Force sensitivity that is normally directly proportional to the quantity of midichlorians and can be estimated by it, but the confusion comes when considering them to be the cause of it while we cannot affirm that. Instead, it enrichens beautifully the Star Wars cosmos by pointing to the existence of patterns which are derived along the many forms amidst the Force and that make their interconnection, turning out to be a correspondence between matter and spirit granting the soul to manifest its inner capacity of sensing and channeling this natural energy while one is within the body, in a way that it can be developed with more or less intensity, according to the needs, natural selection or whatever. Now we can deduct philosophically by that some directions that this new movie can head to, like the previous effort of one's progress with the Force through the pre-existence of the soul, as can be suggested by Yoda opinion of Rey, and that can lead to other developments - reincarnation for instance - concepts from Hinduism, Buddhism and some Judaism interpretations. It would be like a preparation of the body for the soul (explaining then the Chosen One prophecies and a Force mechanism of harmonization) in the material world and a physiological ressonance manifestating through the midichlorians would allow the body to support one's power and to produce organic correlates when one uses the Force, thus its potential and resistance could be scientifically measured (as was done by Qui-Gon), and like a wave-receiving instrument such as radio or TV people with midichlorians can synch more easily or hardly, and can be trained or not, but while they may be limitating factors midichlorians are not the only condition nor warranty for the person to be powerful, Force sensitivity would then be a personal acquired skill (during life or before it). It is just like macro and microcosm, and it holds analogy in our world in explanation for phenomena like mediumship (like some researchers and studies hint at, Peres and Newberg (2013) ""Neuroimaging and mediumship: a promising research line"" and Peres et al. (2012) ""Neuroimaging during Trance State: A Contribution to the Study of Dissociation"")."
3165,1,This destroyed Star Wars,"The trailers set me up for something awesome, but this movie was just a horrible mess with large plot holes."
3166,10,"Funny, diverse casting and a great story","Don't get all the hate on here but this was a great movie. Refreshing to see a diverse cast with women and POC at the forefront of the story. Stuck to the original star wars humor. Interestly, it wove in current day themes of dissolving of power-structures and old world hierarchies. Wasn't overly CGI but enough to be visually enticing. Some holes in the storyline but overall I enjoyed the dialogue and general storyline."
3167,2,An absolute disaster that improves to a huge mess,"The first 80 minutes of this film are shockingly bad. It's like you've walked into the middle of 40 films at once, nothing is explained, no logic, no reason for things. Who's this guy? What's happened? Why is Luke assaulting some big aardvark thing and drinking it's milk with such relish? Why is he fishing for giant rubber fish with a 50 foot long stick?"
3168,9,Gripping from start to finish,Way to go for it Rian. Feels bad seeing all these sour 1 and 2 start reviews trying to make a point.
3169,,WTF! OVER 8 STARS?! NEVER,"This film destroyed the characters of the original trilogy, I don't want to spoil it so I won't say how. This is no longer Star Wars. There is too much to complain about; the plot was pointless yet aggravating, the side plots were boring. Disney and Rian Johnson have found a way to cripple the saga and leave it completely irrecoverable."
3170,8,"Instant classic ,","Better then episode 4 ,but less then episode 5.<br /><br />It has slower paste but it all pays off . Don't know why all the hate guys , just remember episodes 1 and 2 . Be grateful for what we got.<br /><br />Can't wait for 2019. !!!!!!"
3171,9,This movie is a great successor!,This was a very good movie. I am not sure if this is the best Star Wars movie ever made but is it is definitely the best successor of all new the 5 movies so far.
3172,3,It's craptacular.,"Let's not kid ourselves. The Last Jedi was made for a particular audience. It just wasn't for the right one. To say the filmmakers tried to carry out an artistic vision without regard to outside opinions is complete bogus. It's obvious the filmmakers made this film for a specific audience. Which audience? Who knows. But one thing's for certain, it wasn't for the audience that loved the original Star Wars films."
3173,9,First Star Wars movie that felt genuinely original,"I kinda came in knowing people hated it and wanted to see why. I get it. It didn't feel like a star wars movie. It dragged in most parts. However, I personally liked it. A lot. "
3174,1,Worst movie ever!,I have seen better film on pudding. 
3175,10,Amazing and refreshing,I am a huge Star Wars fan. What can I say: Beautifully made and well paced movie. Great action scenes and amazing character development. So many surprises. Really like the direction this is going. The most satisfying entry since the original trilogy.. Had a blast watching this. Will definitely go watch it again. 
3176,9,Fantastic ride!,"The Last Jedi is a fantastic ride from start to finish! Johnson takes the story in very unexpected directions which only add depth to the franchise. Without going into detail, while the movie may have crushed a number of closely held fan speculations, it is an intense ride from start to finish and introduces themes yet to be fully explored in the Skywalker saga. These mainly enhance the tale and others leave questions still unanswered but hopefully will be in the final chapter. Some unhappy with the movie may be disappointed with their theories going unfulfilled and for some others, attention to progressive issues in the film may be clouding their assessment of the movie. Whatever their reasons, while there are many new directions taken in the movie, it remains a fantastic addition to the saga that keeps you going with thrills laughs and surprises to the very end."
3177,9,"""This is not going to go the way you think""","After two years of waiting, finally I got the chance to see it, every theories and fan fictions was worth a wait.<br /><br />There was some part of the movie as a fan I didn't like because we expected something more, but there was some part which was absolutely epic and I loved it.<br /><br />Overall this is not the best star wars movie but also not the worst. They could have done it better but it delivers the epicness of the skywalker saga brilliantly.The Director really made some bold decisions about certain characters which i didn't like but i think there is some reason behind it and i hope everything will be explained in episode 9.<br /><br />9/10 for me."
3178,1,First time I didnt go to theaters,"I was born way out of the original trilogy but grew up as the prequels were released. Not knowing what they were I of course watched the original trilogy. Despite many flaws I still enjoyed them and saw many redeemable qualities in them as well as masterful performances by many actors.<br /><br />The same can not be said of the new movies, TLJ in particular. Rian went into this film thinking ""how can I tie off everything and do what I want to."" I was not a fan of TFA, I literally facepalmed less than 20 minutes in and hated the rest of my time in the theater. TLJ makes TFA look the godfather. If there was anything you liked in TFA, prepare to have the most disappointing answer possible be brushed over in 20 second scenes so we can get back to pushing the agenda of women are better because women.<br /><br />I dont have a problem with strong female characters, quite the opposite, but none exist in these films. Rey is a nobody who is magically force jesus because they need her, Leia is somehow more powerful than Luke despite not having 10 minutes of training, and Rose exists solely because a black guy wasn't a small enough minority.<br /><br />The one female character they had that could've done something, was wasted in both movies. Brienne of Tarth-star was entirely ignored outside of a couple lines of dialogue that led no where and was involved in a whole 5 second fight scene.<br /><br />Any scene with Kylo and rey talking through the force is just dumb, talking is fine but they get borderline physical when the force is specifically the metaphysical effecting the physical.<br /><br />Nobody has been trained to use lightsabers but I'll be damned if they're not 10th degree black belt sword chop ninjas.<br /><br />Rose is an awful addition who does nothing for anyone and there is no argument against it.<br /><br />The few returners are treated like throwaways and garbage and the new actors dont have the talent or the names to carry a new franchise.<br /><br />Snoke never needed to exist since he literally did nothing.<br /><br />There is one fight scene (actual fight scene, not talk on a spaceship, talk about being trained, or talk with lightsabers in hand) that is an hour and forty-five minutes in and choreography is awful. Theres an old gif of the prequels of anakin and obiwan spinning their blades in circles, watch that for 20 minutes on repeat and it's still a better scene.<br /><br />I've tried to watch this movie more than once, I've tried to look past the flaws. The only problem is when I got past the flaws there wasnt anything left."
3179,8,Is it still Star Wars?,"The Last Jedi is a great action-adventure movie. A real thrill ride of a movie. But is it Star Wars? My answer is emphatically no. TLJ pays homage to Star Wars and even parodies the saga. But is not the Star Wars I grew up with. It is meta-Star Wars. It is the cast of Star Wars appearing on the Muppet Show and playing themselves and also versions of their movie characters. But none of this took me out of the moment. Not even Luke actually referring to his lightsaber as a ""laser sword"" or Leia's first words to her brother. ""I changed my hair"". And the two big reveal scenes actually had me laughing. What does Luke do with the lightsaber after Rey hands it to him? He chucks it over his shoulder like it's a piece of garbage. And Rey is nobody. Her parents were nobody. And the director himself has confirmed that Kylo wasn't lying. So get over it, fan boys. There won't be a ""I am your father (brother, uncle)"" moment in Episode 9 and you no longer need training or a Jedi master to become a full Jedi. Decades of SW mythology flushed down the crapper and a million fan boys (and girls) crying in their parents basements and hugging their Chewbacca plushies. And none of this bothered me because the cast is completely solid and the story is so well paced and mostly exciting. Some people disliked the jokes and the casual 2000'ish banter that carried over from TFA but I would rather hear that than a bunch of ""space talk"" delivered with as much nuance and subtlety as you would find in a high school play. No, TLJ isn't your daddy's Star Wars but it's a very good movie that is worth seeing with your entire family. Do it."
3180,3,Very disapponted,"I did not feel like watching star wars, was nit even as good as the series. I felt more like in a very Disney show. The script is as disapointing as the movie."
3181,9,Loved it,"I watched this movie on Imax, and am glad for the added investment required to do so.<br /><br />It was visually stunning, with plenty of twists and sub plots. There are some plot holes, but hey this is fantasy, not a historical documentary. "
3182,8,it's a good movie guys.... just stop it,"No spoilers.<br /><br />This star wars movie is 10 times better than the last one. Kylo Ren is finally a decent villain, luke is freaking amazing. The story is original. The only regret a have is the lack of stress and land action. Some moments are just too ""Disney"" and are boring. This movie destroyed every theories of fans. The movie got better and better with time."
3183,9,Fantastic! Cannot believe some reviews....,"Come on! I read reviews, which I respect but fully disagree. 3, 2, even 1 score is just absurd! How can you put a 1 on a movie like this, whether you like it or not. Somebody even said he cried during the film. What! Man, I ""cried"" through almost the entire Episode 1, 2, 3 saga. Remember the Phantom Menace? And if you remember, the script of the previous Star Wars, The Force Awakens was almost a rip off of the Episode 4. And come on, Star Wars was never about the complicated story....but about how that story is written and told. And this episode does it very well.<br /><br />This movie is fantastic. Well paced. Simple story but greatly told. I don't care about MH's opinion about Luke. I think the writing was fantastic. The story on the island took enough time to build. That was a high point on the movie. Maybe too much comedy, but I don't mind to laugh once in a while. <br /><br />And the cinemathography was superb. I won't go into details about effects. That would be easy. Just talking about photography, about images, colours used, takes, stunning, really a masterpiece. <br /><br />So many bargage movies, thousands, and you put a 1 to this movie? Joke.<br /><br />Had a great time...go and watch it."
3184,3,"This is Disney trash, not Star Wars","This movie was, like the Abrams movie, horrible. We need a rebellion against Disney nonsense: these are movies presumably made by a politically correct HR committee. Bland. Man-shaming, whites-hating propaganda.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker was reduced to a coward. And they also have the bad guy be a coward, all this man-shaming means that there is no tension. Even the guy who saves everyone is shamed by snotty female characters. Where's the Star Wars magic. I actually enjoyed the prequals. But here, none of the ""hero"" characters were engaging, in fact they were just anoying. And the script was dire. Terrible plot. Terrible lines. ""You can do this"", ""We've got to finish this""... Avoid this movie unless you like some SFX eye candy, but, casino scene aside, even that wasn't great."
3185,9,ACE MOVIE,TOO MANY HATERS THIS IS COOL AS BETTER THAN OWT GEORGE COULD OF DONE like episode 1.2.3 
3186,1,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!","I've seen every Star Wars film as a theatrical release since 1977 and whilst they have varied in quality (and reception), none bar ""The Last Jedi"" have failed to deliver to some degree. I can honestly say this film isn't worthy of belonging in the Star Wars canon. It has taken 40 years of fully immersive story-telling and in one bitingly ironic swoop flattened it into a 2-D hologram. Help us Obi-Wan!"
3187,8,This was not a Star Wars Movie.,"Disappointed to the maximum.. Breaks my heart to rate a star wars movie with 2 stars.. It was like whatever the first movie had built up and made us excited for the things to come and count the days until next episode , all of it was a big lie.. I didn't like any continuation of any arc .. really sad.. it was like you put 2 completely different teams in a school to write the episodes and the second group ( the last jedi ) seemed to hate the first team that wrote a good script and wanted to ruin their work to get a bad score. Idk..."
3188,9,May the force be with you or not!,"First off, I watched it at the cinema in full 3D, so my experience is quite different than someone who watched an online copy or whatever. Second, I'm a Star Wars fanboy. And lastly. it was my birthday movie so I was hyped anyway to watch it, nevertheless:"
3189,9,What a great time to be a star wars fan!,"I must admit... I had a great time with the last jedi. Being really excited about the movie leaving the theater for the first time, the first thing I wanted to do when I got back home was to share my experience of the movie with other people that had seen it. This eventually left me really down and depressed. Being met with outrageous claims that ""Star wars is dead"" and all those 1000 other outbursts currently dividing the fanbase. And here I am feeling that here is this really great film that I really liked, but which I am told I have no business liking at all. I have my own gripes about the movie, who doesn't? All I'm saying is that we can't all be directors in the star wars universe."
3190,1,They Ruined Star Wars,Don't get me wrong. The effects were great. Sets were decent.
3191,9,"STAR WARS at its best, yet like never before","This is STAR WARS at its best, and STAR WARS as you've never experienced it before. It reconciles the 5-year old with the XX-year old in you. Indie, visionary, even cerebral and art-house film making, with pure blockbuster fun and thrilling sequences. 9 stars not because it's perfect, but because it's a captivating, brave, thought-provoking, satisfying film, that makes you think everything is possible again. Go see it, and support it in any way you can!"
3192,1,DISNEY RUINED STAR WARS!,"I cant name all the things wrong with this film, trying too hard to be original with the stupid costumes and lightsabers changing what was already original and making it overdone and ridiculous and stupid! george lucas definitely made a HUGE mistake selling star wars to disney, i knew they would wreck it and so they have with their happily ever after fairy tale romance crap! they know NOTHING about star wars, and princess leah floating in space in that one part what is THAT supposed to be all about??? Absolutely ridiculous and stupid! nice job disney, for ruining star wars, and making pre sequels like the story about han solo which was nowhere near accuracy and using the girl from game of thrones, SO pathetic! just another way for them to weasel money out of people as if these a.holes aren't rich enough!"
3193,9,Why All The Whining?,I am befuddled and confused. Why all the whining? Or is that just the natural internet-ty-type thing to do? 
3194,9,Far better than Episode 7,"Some poeple don't like how their favorite characters have developed. This is not a good reason to dislike the movie. No SW film will ever be as good as the original trilogy. Things change, grow up. There are important lessons to be learned from Episode 8."
3195,,A fun sci-fi film.,"Ok let me start by saying, yes, this film is flawed, I acknowledge that, but I greatly enjoyed it, and it was full of surprises. It was well shot, the music was good, the acting was fine, and the effects were great. I find that people complained that The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope, and now they are complaining about The Last Jedi being too different. We can't always be fed the same thing over and over again. I myself enjoyed the use of Snoke as a plot device for Kylo to overthrow, because even if Snoke revealed who he was to Rey, that would not have changed anything, and Snoke would still have been killed two minutes later. As for Rey, I like that she does not come from special heritage. I know a lot of crying fanboy theorists hated this, but I am a huge fan of stories where a hero comes from nothing. Overall, I really enjoyed this film, and for me, there was more to enjoy than hate."
3196,9,One of the best in the franchise,There's a reason critics generally praise this film and around half of audience members do not. 
3197,2,"Move along, move along.....","What's awful about this film is it's trying to be edgy, not through casting but by plot, and it comes across as cheap gimics. Killing a character off halfway through the film just because is poor writing. You have the OJ Simpson car chase in space. Like the LAPD they put up no road blocks. I think he drove faster actually. And you have a whole thread of the film on a casino planet that's pointless."
3198,8,Let the past die.....,"I have read a lot of reviews on here, both good and bad. Let's not forget that the original Star Wars was a film for children. Those children are now all grown up and are comparing new with old."
3199,1,$tar War$ - The La$t Di$ney $hit,"The Last Jedi is a cinematic garbage. It felt like I was watching a Star Wars parody and not a legitimate episode in the saga. There are stupid and misplaced jokes in almost every scene. Even the quiet scenes are mocking everything. Luke is milking an Elephant seal and then squirts blue milk into his mouth. Chewie is roasting a Porg while other Porgs watch in sadness (Supposed to be funny in Disney's view). This film felt like some weird acid trip. There is no story to follow, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes of pure nonsense. They ridiculed every aspect of Star Wars that we love. The Force now works like a galactic Skype to make calls between Rey and Kylo Ren. The elevator scene where Kylo Ren takes Rey to the Snoke's throne room is pure shameless ROTJ ripoff ! She is handcuffed, Snoke removes those with The Force and shows her a space battle outside the window and tells her how rebel friends will die etc. I mean it was beyond ridiculous. Like if a little kid grabbed some Star Wars toys and started playing with them. The action was pointless, way too frequent and boring like hell, just trash flying on screen and things blowing up. There is no character development, no emotional resonance that would actually make you care about the characters. There is no back story, nothing is explained, the characters are as shallow as you can imagine. The Star Wars feeling is not there at all. If a film does not take itself seriously, then how can the audience do it ? It really was like Robot Chicken Star Wars spoof or some weird Star Wars Holiday Special. At Disney they mocked everything about The Force, about Jedi philosophy and Jedi training. Suddenly everyone can use The Force because in Disney's view it's just some crap to move things around, lift people in the air or make a free intergalactic call. George Lucas put The Force into the movie to awaken some sense of spirituality in young people. Jedi knights are like samurai or daoist or buddhist monks. It takes a lifetime of discipline, hard training, acquired wisdom and the deepest commitment to become a Jedi and to use The Force. It takes Rey about one short meditation session to become a Jedi. What they decided about Luke Skywalker is a blasphemy ! It goes against all his moral values and beliefs of a true Jedi Master. "
3200,9,"INSANE, REFRESHING, BOLD - A very different but fitting Star Wars film","This movie...<br /><br />If you are a diehard fan, hear me out. I am a huge fan of Star Wars, and in my opinion this film offered all of the right twists. It was not perfect, but there were so many things that they got right with this movie.<br /><br />Firstly, Luke Skywalker. A lot of people were very angry about how his character was handled. However, it makes logical sense when you follow the events of what happened before TFA. And it also made sense from a plot point of view in terms of things with Rey (if you go see the film you will understand what I mean). <br /><br />Secondly, the storyline with Rose and Finn. I would agree that one or two elements of this storyline did drag, however it was in no way unnecessary, it made a really powerful statement about how these wars between the First Order and the Resistance works in terms of galactic economy which is not really mentioned a lot in Star Wars. Rose is not necessarily a character everyone will fall in love with, some of the parts between her and Finn were cringe-worthy but that was deliberate. She is nevertheless important still as a character.<br /><br />Finally, the last criticism which I noticed a lot of people had was ""plotholes"" in the actual main storyline that connected everything together. While I agree it could have been handled better, it actually was very suspenseful and had a great build-up. "
3201,,How things (really ) should be done,"Hardcore fan, played out all of the games.<br /><br />Watched the trilogy hundreds of times."
3202,8,The best one yet.,"I know many have criticized it for having to many plots and trying to hard to be a new Empire Strikes Back, but I loved it and would have given it a 10, if I had not gone away from IMAX with too many questions unanswered. "
3203,10,The Last Jedi explore new horizons,This is not your typical star wars film.
3204,4,"For All Adults, It Really Is Time To Stop Supporting This Crap","I left the movie screening last night feeling empty. I get what they were trying to do which is set up for the future, but I felt like they lost the appeal of what makes this franchise great. I'm done. If we can be all honest with each other, there really hasn't been a good Stars Wars film since the original 3. From Episode 1, 2, 3 crap....then 7, now 8 just left you feeling empty. <br /><br />Bottom line, if you never see another Star Wars movie, you will not be missing out on anything."
3205,9,"Except Finn and Rose's story, this movie is excellent to me.","The last Jedi is second best movie of Star wars to me. Empire strikes back is the best, there is no argument that."
3206,2,I used to like Star Wars :(,I cannot believe Disney allowed this to happen.
3207,9,Love it. Ignore the haters,One of the best Star Wars movies ever made. Beautifully shot and the writing is great. I love this movie. Don't listen to the haters.
3208,8,Star Wars movie with Naruto's plot?,"***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />If I haven't be such a nerd and watched way too many anime, this movie will be a 10/10 for me. The plot and the actors are definitely astonishing. "
3209,8,it is a great starwars movie,"I watched it on imax and it was awesome. top 3 best movie of the year (with guardian of the galaxy and dunkirk). the visual and the sound is fantastic. and as for the story; there are some funny scene, unexpected twist, a fresh indie-esque touch, and amazing, i mean AMAZING galactic war scenes. <br /><br />its a beautiful story about finding identity, dealing with failure, and three-dimensional characters battling their demons- or should i say ""their dark side"". <br /><br />alot of philosophical message. and i really love the pace of this movie.<br /><br />Everybody act amazingly well, and the chemistry in some of the scenes is out of this world- im curious about where it will go in the next episode. please disney; explore this further. <br /><br />this episode is filled with strong female characters, and i found it to be so inspiring. its about time, i'd say 2017 is the year of women for sure, hopefully it'll continue.<br /><br />the light-saber battle was FANTASTIC! one of my favorite scene."
3210,1,Mary Sues vs. Darth Emo in diversity-land (in space),"Where to begin? This is what happens when you let 2 virtue signalling idiots take over one of the world's greatest film series. A number two of galactic proportions is squeezed into the toilet bowl of cinema. Rian ""Shut up fan-boys! Wait until you see the scene in IX where Luke Skybuck fights the Cylons! Dark Vader and Mr Spock can't save him this time!"" Johnson and Kathleen ""We're taking Stars Treks, or whatever it's called, into the 21st century. YOU GO, GIRL!!"" Kennedy have a lot to answer for. Avoid episode VIII. Boycott IX completely. They clearly have such contempt for the existing fan base of Star Wars that they shouldn't be surprised when that contempt is reflected right back at them. What next? Hannah Solo?"
3211,9,Don't believe everything you read,"I don't know where all the negative reviews are coming from and I have no idea what these people are talking about. It was an excellent movie and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Don't believe the naysayers, go see the movie in the theaters and make your own judgement . And Don't believe all of the spoilers either ... They are not telling you everything. There were several big surprises that none of the negative reviews at bothered to mention, and the movie ended in a way that I wouldn't have expected. I can only concede the following to those that didn't care for the movie: there were a couple of times when the humor slightly annoyed me. However, there were two times that I teared up, and one time that I almost completely lost it."
3212,1,What a pile of garbage leftist narrative nonsense,Horrible movie with leftist narrative nonsense scattered all over it. Will forever forget this dumb movie was ever made.
3213,8,Fresh and different. DIFFERENT IS GOOD!,"As marketed by the trailers, ""This will not go the way you think!"" This movie takes everything you believe and spins it upside down, but in a good way. The movie is challenging. I would rather have it be challenging than boring and predictable. This was thankfully not Empire Strikes Back part II.<br /><br />The mindset of Luke Skywalker is believable. I encourage people to explore the other points of view on the handling of the character of Luke Skywalker, it is totally believable. "
3214,9,Just one disappointment,"I feel like everyone is disappointed with this movie because it didn't service the fan's desires and it went on a different path, one that will expand the Star Wars universe and hopefully even give us more insight to the previous movies and how everything comes together. <br /><br />The acting in the movie was phenomenal, so were the effects, cinematography, and music. "
3215,8,"Give it a chance, experiance it yourself and don't listen to the reviews.","I'll try and wrap up this review very quickly. This is a movie you need to experience yourself. Rating it by comparing it to the other Star Wars movies is something you perhaps shouldn't do, but if you do it then it is perfectly fine. Why you may ask? Because it is different. It promised to be different and it is different. This is not your every Star Wars movie and this is truly something new and a utterly new take. "
3216,1,Waste of time!,I watched it yesterday and i just created an IMDB account to review it!!!! it was boring! the plot goes nowhere and the script is sooo bad. That man is not Luke Skywalker and Mark Hamill knew that!
3217,,I FIGURED IT OUT......,"In Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back ....at the end Luke is injured and picked up by Landau and Leia.....and we know when Luke laid there injured he called out to Leia, and she told Landau we need to go back and pick up Luke."
3218,8,It was awesome,"Unlike the most of the people who reviewed the movie as completely garbage I am pretty impressed by it .First of all,the acting was superb.The way Kylo Ren developed from confused boy to a powerful and unwavering sith lord was one of the best things in the plot.He fullfilled his destiny as a sith(killed his Master) and has the ability to force choke-just like his grandfather which is pretty neat-o.Compared to episode 7, he was a freaking master.And he is not even realised his full potential yet.Can't wait to see him in the next movie."
3219,1,Perhaps the worst among all the Star Wars movies that came before it...,"Took me a long time to put something down here which I thought would be a review, but I think I should not...others have put in their points succinctly which I agree with most if not all of them."
3220,9,"Not perfect, but thought-provoking and lovingly crafted","If you think Mad Max: Fury Road has no plot, you might want to sit this one out."
3221,8,"Oooh, a Star Wars movie that takes risk, oh no, we can't have that","The only thing that made me want to see this film was Rian Johnson at the helm. His other films Looper, Brick, Brothers Bloom have all been excellent, and his episodes of Breaking Bad: ""The Fly"", ""Fifty-One"", and ""Ozymandias"", are examples of the best that show has to offer. <br /><br />After seeing the Force Awakens, I had realized what I hate about JJ Abrams' style of directing: 1. Everything is a puzzle, 2. Recycle any material for nostalgia, and 3. Emphasize plot, not characters. TFA was not a good movie, it was a bad movie. That'll piss off fanboys but it's true. TFA did nothing that wasn't predictable, rehashing A New Hope for a new generation, and failing at it. Only a few scenes in that film stand out. What Rian Johnson did was take the ending of TFA, throw out any stupid, superfluous puzzle boxes that Abrams left in, and actually sculpted chacacters that were not only believable, but likable. TLJ was the Star Wars film I desperately needed to see, one that i enjoyed, took a plot that in-universe took place over twelve or so hours, and used a lot of runtime to fix problems left by Abrams, and follow a lot of points through to their natural conclusion. What we're left with is the modern equivalent of Empire Strikes Back, a film that so many recognize as the best in the series, but so few really appreciate. <br /><br />Don't listen to any negative reviews until you've seen it for yourself. Go in with the expectation that it ISN'T the same as any previous SW movie, and you'll probably like it. If not, that is okay."
3222,9,One of my favourite Star Wars movies,"This review will contain spoilers, if you do not want spoilers, then do not read. I will attempt to keep this short"
3223,2,"According to Disney, the Force is political correctness","After watching Star Wars VII, The Force Awakens (TFA), I actually had a new hope (pun intended) for the Star Wars franchise. It was fun and exciting, it generally respected the original characters, it introduced new characters, and yes, the old characters was certainly gracefully giving way to the new characters. I thought it was a great way to start the next trilogy. So I was hoping that Star Wars VIII, The Last Jedi (TLJ), would now cement a new set of long-lasting, memorable characters in the guise of Kylo, Rey, Finn, Poe and even the new ""Emperor"" Snoke. Great scott, I was so wrong. What in the world was that mess all about? The Last Jedi was so crammed with politically correct ideology (all men are stupid and degenerate, all women are clever and enlightened). Characters like Poe that showed so much hope in TFA, even Snokes showed some weight at the beginning of TLJ, and even Luke Skywalker himself, but they ALL completely degenerated into nobodies in TLJ. And oh my goodness, the whole claptrap ideology about women being the enlightened and evolved ones and men being the old patriarchy and degenerating into dumb monkeys is so obvious it made me nauseous. By the end of The Last Jedi, I was dying to re-watch Transformesr 1-5 all over again - at least Michael Bay didn't PRETEND there was a story (nor politically correct ideology) and the effects were good!"
3224,10,"Culture changes, and so should movies","I'm shocked to see the litany of poor reviews here. This movie was outstanding. It is the best of the Star Wars movies, without question. There is depth, plot consistency, complex characters and an extremely inclusive casting. Heroes are deep, nuanced and real. There's a moving story told and it reflects the changing of our culture - the parts that are changing for the better, at least. Sure, it's not the ""same"" as all the others, but it shouldn't be. We shouldn't stay mired in the past or we'd still be watching ""7 Brides for 7 Brothers"" and thinking it's funny and cute to kidnap women with bags over their heads. We've moved beyond Princess Leia in a bikini chained to a fat slug, and what a fitting tribute to Carrie Fisher, an advocate for inclusivity, that this was her final role. If any of the people who worked on this film read this, which I doubt you will (but hope you do), ignore the poor reviews. They're just disgruntled people who feel small when they realize (shock of all shocks) that heroes aren't just white and male - and when they are white and male, they're just as imperfect and accountable as the rest of us."
3225,2,The Last Jedi: A Star Wars Parody,"With 'The Last Jedi' Star Wars has ultimately become a parody - a mocking imitation - of itself. Although traces of this were already visible in 'The Force Awakens' this movie takes parody to another level which almost already borders on ridicule. There are two elements in the movie which turn the once epic space opera saga into a parody of itself - the ""twistmania"" and the almost Marvel-like attempt to cram as much humor in this movie as possible."
3226,9,Wonderful story telling,"That's it in a nutshell. I was never bored, never felt like ""yet another superhero movie"", great story telling. I'll just say agree with all the positive reviews and IMO this is one of the best in the series."
3227,,I'm so ticked off,I never walked away from a Star Wars film more upset than I did for TLJ. 
3228,8,Great Movie,The movie was good but I agree that there was some unnecessary scenes in the movie. There was some scenes in this movie that were the best I've ever seen in a Star Wars movie. The director and art directors did a superb job bringing the movie to life.
3229,9,Good. Movie.,"The reason why so many fans don't like or even hate this movie is because of the tremendous change of Luke's character. Personally, I don't mind this change and for me people have to accept that Ryan Johnson took a big risk by making a so, so, so unexpected film and I think it was worth it, and the change in Luke's character was worth it, because in reality people change and that's the case with Luke as well. Because it would've been easy to write a script in which Luke was the same person that we saw 40 years ago and at the end of which the good guys won and the bad ones lost and everything was perfect. But if that happened people would've said that it was too much like the originals, that there wasn't any changes at all and that Ryan Johnson wasn't creative enough to make a good movie. That happened with Force Awakens and people said that it's the same as A New Hope and that was probably one of the reasons why they decided to make The Last Jedi so different. So, what do we understand at the end? Well, the ones who hate TLJ probably like The Force Awakens more than The Last Jedi, but no one can deny that episode 8 is a better movie than 7. The only problem the fans have is that it doesn't give them what they expect to see and it doesn't satisfy their need to see Luke as the kid who experienced the walk into this much bigger universe along with us."
3230,1,"How so many good reviews? Not possible, did you even see the movie?",My suggestion if you want to enjoy the movie: go to the cinema with low or no expectation and hope for a surprise. The more i think about the move the more things i think were done bad and i have to say something about a lot of stuff i read in other reviews:<br /><br />
3231,8,The legacy continues....,"Moulding an ordinary to an extraordinary is the leitmotif of Rian Johnson's movie. <br /><br />Ray came from a drug addict-junk selling parents, and she became a Jedi. Now comes the story of an ordinary little boy with an austere and very little known background. Ordinary but possibility to become extraordinary and eyes full of dream."
3232,1,What is this?,Girl survives alone on desert planet for years.check! Woman knows how to fly starship immediately. Check! Knows how to repair ship immediately. Check! Knows how to use lightsaber. Check! Wins fights no training. Check! No backstory. Check! Fly xwings no training. Check! Welcome to far left feminisms. Check.
3233,,A dated franchise which they keep on selling past expiry date.,The Star Wars franchise is getting really boring. How many times would we rehash same plots and subplots. Rebel bases on white planets attacked by walkers. two sword bearing gentlemen squaring off in a throne room. Rebel fleet escaping a cordon. Smugglers and thieves being found in a casino or a bar. A reluctant teacher and pupil. Not a single new thing emerges from this movie worth remembering.
3234,9,Most Polarising Star Wars Ever,"The Last Jedi will either be your favorite episode or your most hated. It will either be the Star Wars that you have been waiting for, or its the one you've been dreading. "
3235,8,Do not believe user ratings!,"I have never written a review before so felt inclinded to do so after reading all these negative reviews and shed some light on my opinion and not what's wrong with the movie but more so the audience. Warning I may have spoilers but I'll try to keep the movie a mystery as much as possible. The movie it's self was a fine piece of work and felt like Star Wars but of course I did have a few issues but I'll touch on that later. First I wanted to say I am sick of people being disappointed and giving this movie bad reviews simple because they did not get what they wanted (which in my opinion still wouldn't have been enough if they did.). People seemed to be left in confusion. Which is also a feeling the directors may have intended. Sometimes you leave a movie theater feeling different emotions.. happy , sad etc and confused is one of them. Let me give some examples, the entire mystery of Snoke and how people must know this mans origins story in the first 5 seconds of meeting him. The Audience is so impatient they must know everything about a character the moment they meet them. Which would ruin a movie cause it'd be 4 hours long going into background story's. Can't forget this is a movie and not everything will have been answered or it just becomes ridiculous. Also this is a Saga and more answers may be coming our way. I looked ahead at episode 9 and Snoke is still in the cast which means we may be getting more answers as to who he is and why Kylo went to him. Let's think back to previous episodes. Say the Emperor for example no one knew his origin story or how Darth Vader and the Emperor came to be till Lucus made those CGI awfulness in the early 2000's (episodes 1,2,3). Were people up in arms about not knowing enough about the Emeror? Maybe... but they didn't have social media back in the 70s so clowns weren't freaking out, who is this? Why that and why this? Just wait watch and find out. And yes unfortunately we do not really figure out who Rey's parents are yet but that still may be coming. Rey is told from a one sided point of view who they may be. Which means they could be anyone.. Now say they did tell us Rey's parents, people would have been freaking out saying OMG this was just like the empire strikes back luke finds out Darth his is papa. So really could the directors give people what they want. I don't think so, people will never be satisfied. Also let's give these directors and writers a break about making it similar to episodes 4, 5, 6. Im sure they are huge Star Wars fans or they wouldn't be involved and I imagine they feel some what influence by the movies they may have grown up with. So call me crazy but I can't blame them for following a kind of guide line and making it similar. I'm just saying when they made another star destroyer in the force awakens people were pissed but what other kind of super weapon would you create in a lightspeed traveling univierse? Some toxic gas we'll shoot at your planet or we will unleash our super weapon which does what? They want to create a weapon of urgency, a massive laser that will blow you up in a blink of an eye can't really top that..."
3236,8,"Not my #1 Star Wars film, but definitely in the Top 5!","I have seen EVERY SINGLE RELEASE of EVERY STAR WARS FILM in the theatre since the first, & The Last Jedi was an excellent ride - I can't wait to rewatch it several more times & dig deeper! "
3237,1,Something like this should not exist,"Ill close my eyes , and this movie will go away..."
3238,9,Great entertainment for the whole family.,How could you give this movie 1/10? What were your expecting?? Time to go back to your jedi cave that you built in your backyard. 
3239,4,"Objectively bad film, objectively bad Star Wars film.","This film has no redeeming qualities. Literally zero, it's got bad writing, bad plot (no plot), nobody is excited for the next film. Ryan Johnson just threw JJ's ideas in the bin. Changing director in the middle of a trilogy is a hilariously bad idea. Hahaha this is what I think of the last Jedi.<br /><br />Oh and I forgot about Rose Tico....Urgh"
3240,,I'm a Happy Dad at least not a happy fan,"Took my wife and daughter to see this movie because rest of family,her cousins and such we're going. Already knew most plot and after watching it all I have to say is HaHaHa! I gave it a star because it worked with it's target audience my tween daughter and her tween cousins. I think they made me laugh more than the movie and their beaming faces and claps really made me happy. Reminded me when Star Wars first came out when I was a little kid( Yes I am an old fart)a lot like grumpy old Luke in this movie. Did I like it? Heck no! But if I wanted to know what Spaceballs 2 would be like on the big screen I have my answer. At the very least I know that my life turned out way better than my two childhood heroes, Han and Luke."
3241,10,Outstanding - Star Wars has been reborn.,"The Last Jedi takes big risks by tearing down a lot of old mythology and re-imagining the Star Wars universe for a new audience, for a new future. I don't get the hate this movie is getting because this is exactly what the saga needed. Rian Johnson has done an incredibly brave thing by taking the individual stories to totally unexpected places. It's a movie with genuine twists, just the right amount of humour, and beautiful set pieces. It is so much better than The Force Awakens and the 3rd best Star Wars movie after Empire and Return of the Jedi."
3242,8,Perfect For A Star Wars Movie!,Do not listen to all of the bad reviews. This movie deserves to be called part of the series. <br /><br />This review DOES NOT contain spoilers.
3243,9,Back to the Best of Star Wars,I can't decide whether the negative reviews on this movie show collective ignorance of the viewing public or are an organised campaign of disinformation.
3244,2,The first Star Wars that isn't Star Wars,"The film is a mess from start to finish, if you thought Jar Jar Binks was bad wait till you see this. It's so bad that I don't even know where to begin. "
3245,8,A mixed feeling,"I love and hate this film with 2 different perspectives. The lore side of me absolutely hate this movie, but the spirit of star wars side of me love this film."
3246,1,Where do I begin?,"Besides the fact that The Force Awakens storyline was unoriginal, it was still a decent movie."
3247,,"A great movie. Unfortunately, it is the worst Star Wars Movie of all time.","Let's start with this: what would you say if I told you that one of the main movies (not anthology) lacked a lightsaber fight? I enjoyed it until the moment that Leia was sucked into the vacuum of space, after an explosion of her ship. She then proceeded to USE THE FORCE TO FLOAT BACK TO HER SHIP!!! Come on, even for Star Wars that is outrageous. It had a boring subplot of Rose and Finn. It had a boring main plot of the resistance escaping the dreadnought. The scenes with Luke were quite good, but at the same time, they didn't feel like Star Wars, they felt like a psychedelic exploration of the soul. Snoke was a disappointment, not to mention that he looked awful. Finn vs Phasma, maybe the most anticipated part of the movie, based on the trailer, was an utter disappointment. <br /><br />The movie explored interesting concepts of leadership, sacrifice, morality, and death, yet these themes were muddled by horrid plot.<br /><br />If I had watched this movie, having never seen Star Wars before, I would have loved it. But as of now, I cannot imagine a Star Wars movie (including Attack of the Clones) that I would dread seeing again more."
3248,8,A beautiful movie with a few flaws,"Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. There were some things that didn't work for me like the whole Canto Bight/Rose/Finn arc but aside from issues like that, I thought it was amazing. I think its cool that we're opening up the Star Wars universe with this movie so that they can tell more stories that don't involve a connection to a legacy character or anything like that. I understand that there are people who didn't like this movie and that's ok. I get it. I felt the same way about the prequels. Star Wars is a lot of things to a lot of different people but overall, I think this movie was a step in the right direction in order to expand the universe and allow more room for future characters and stories to be told."
3249,9,"Yeah, don't listen to the butthurt fans","I'm not really gonna tell you much about why I think the movie is great, because you either already know it, or you're never going to (or you haven't seen the movie, which in this case, why are you reading this?). Instead, I'm gonna tell you why everyone giving this a poor review is wrong."
3250,9,Absolutely loved it!,"What is wrong with these sourpuss ""fans?"" "
3251,4,A Great Disappointment,"I loved the original films and the prequels were enjoyable, with some silly stuff thrown in."
3252,8,Favorite Star Wars yet.,I don't understand why everyone has been hating on this movie. It's my favorite Star Wars along with Empire and Revenge of the Sith. I thought it was very original and did the unexpected. I loved the risk it took and how nearly all of the popular theories/ questions were answered. It has it's flaws and there are moments that don't have the star wars feel but it is very well made and I think better than the force awakens. It's lukes best role yet and demonstrates a new side of the force we have never seen.
3253,1,Disney has Ruined Star Wars with this Movie,"James Cameron sums it up best with his review of The Force Awakens when he said "" George's group of six films had more innovative visual imagination"""
3254,,Propaganda disguised as entertainment,We are living in Orwellian times. The critics have been bought and paid for by faceless corporations to sell an agenda to a public looking for entertainment. Nostalgia weaponized to lure the masses to watch subvert anti white propaganda. Hear me out. 
3255,8,I can't understand the mass one stars....,I watched the movie yesterday and I agree that I don't necessarily like some of the choices that were made. 
3256,8,"A Long Rebuttal Because I Am, If Nothing Else, Verbose","It is a truth, universally acknowledged, that no one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans (the same can be said of Trekkies with their fandom so I see a trend). "
3257,8,The Iron Man 3 of Star Wars (Spoilers),"""Let the past die"" is a frequently spoken line in the movie, and might as well be the film's real sub-title. Most major plot point reinforced by the original trilogy and the Force Awakens, the sacred cows that kept the franchise incredibly rote, but still resonant, are debased in an open challenge to change the SW universe going forward. In fact, the very last scene of the movie is a meta-commentary on the universe itself, and how the time has come to pass the torch to new generations, new styles and new stories."
3258,1,An unfortunate continuation that disregards its predecessors,"Rian Johnson decided that it would be best to disregard the history and lore of Star Wars and make up his own rules to the universe. Plus, the whole story feels like an encapsulation of one space battle with the side heroes galavanting around while the rebels are dying."
3259,8,"A really solid and enjoyable movie, if you're not a hardcore Star Wars die-hard fan that wanted every bit of your imaginative fanfiction added in the movie.",**Spoliers ahead**.
3260,2,Thus ends the Star Wars franchise,"What a colossal mess. Plot and logic holes big enough to fly a star destroyer through, characters killed off pointlessly, characters doing nothing, filler storyline (casino planet) that results in nothing, cringe-inducing comedy, an unceasing parade of twists and expectation subversions, and SJW ideology rammed right through the middle of it all. A movie that took 2.5h to tell a story that could have been told in 90 minutes, and in the process bored us to death, infuriated a large portion of the fans, and dug a grave for episode IX. The Force Awakens introduced genuinely interesting characters and set the stage for them grow in the Star Wars universe, promising what truly could have been a wonderful followup story. Instead, we got the unquestionably worst chapter in the 40+ year history of Star Wars. So for me, it's adios Star Wars. I won't bother in December of 2019 - it's obvious there never really was a plan for an overarching story in place, and I don't feel like watching the sorry spectacle that episode IX will be, having to address the cinematic bog that TLJ created."
3261,,It hurts to see fan reviews,"I will start off by saying that The Last Jedi is not perfect, not perfect at all. This does not mean it isn't a bad movie, this is a very good movie and a different take on the Star Wars universe. It is filled with many twists, great action, and superb visuals. Like I said before it has flaws, the tone is a bit all over the place and there are a couple questionable scenes, but this does not make it bad! This is a very good movie and I left the theater very satisfied. Something that makes me laugh is that people are complaining that this movie is different and doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie, there are times that this is true, but when Force Awakens came out the same people were complaining it wasn't different and how it was just like a New Hope. That part makes me laugh and makes me think people will always complain and can never be pleased when it comes to movies. To end this review off I will say if you are a Star Wars fan don't listen to the negative reviews, go to the theater and enjoy a hell of a good time. The Last Jedi has problems but it is offset by the positives. Definitely worth a watch!! "
3262,9,Fantastic,This movie was a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe.
3263,8,Apparently it's trendy to hate this movie?,"I'm super confused about all the criticism this movie is taking. I've noticed that much of the disdain comes from fanboys about how TLJ handles established ""canon"". Usually pointing to many of the things setup by EU/Legacy."
3264,8,A Bold Direction,"The Last Jedi is a bold exercise on character-driven storytelling and subverting audience expectations. It's not a perfect movie, but it quite literally subverts the 'mystery box' set-up in The Force Awakens, which is both refreshing and shocking."
3265,2,What a waste of potential,"Not only a whole lot of wasted opportunity, but far too much stupidity mixed in. Some good visuals (I like the modified AT-ATs) and a few good moments, but they're lost in the overall morass of mediocrity."
3266,8,We are to blame for the fails of the last jedi,"It was a decent Star Wars film, Great action sequences combined with a touch of humor.it expanded the mithology of the force. it wasen t perfect i admit. an un necesary casino subplot and some cartoonish visual desitions.thant can be confusing the first time you see it."
3267,1,"If you liked this, you never understood Star Wars as a story",This film was utter crap. Not one redeeming feature. Hideous in every respect.
3268,,Great Action Movie.... Terrible Star Wars Movie,"While I must give credit to Rian Johnson for this high-octane film which was enjoyable throughout, the film as a Star Wars film leaves more questions unanswered. Character development is extremely poor with the newer actors not developed in their significanct respective roles and pretty much the same since Force Awakens. Rey and Kylo Ren, despite their telepathic connections have been disappointing. Rey is somehow the galaxys last Jedi hope yet she was not even trained by a true Jedi (something which should've happening in lat Jedi!) and Kylo is not the sinister villain for the final film but still a temperamental teenager. Characters who were set to have a prominent role and develop in the film such as Snoke and Phasma were killed off without explanation of their previous roles which should've been important to the film. Overall, too many plot holes and the original characters such as Luke, were destroyed (this was a guy who would not turn on his evil father yet would kill his nephew because he 'hinted' at the dark side and had not turned yet)."
3269,8,Conflict and balance,"It's about conflict and balance. That's what the whole of the Star Wars saga has been about. Luke and Snoke are at opposite ends of the Force spectrum and both meet their ends in this film. Dealing with internal conflict over which side to choose, Kylo kills his master after deciding to save the life of a person he clearly has connection with. Sounds similar to how Vader betrays the Emperor doesn't it? Luke exiles himself on a remote planet after seeing himself as having failed the Jedi order, which parallels Yoda's journey between episodes 3 and 4. Having turned his back on the Force, he continues with his struggle to find his position. Why retreat to an ancient Jedi island if you're through with the religion? He decides to burn the Jedi texts before changing his mind, even trying to rush in an rescue them once Yoda makes the decision for him. His words and actions contradict one another until he finally re-embraces the Force, provides a distraction for the beleaguered Resistance and finds redemption by sacrificing himself to save the day. Again, his arc mirrors that of both his father and his first master, Obi Wan.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In this film we see more than in TFA that Kylo and Rey are different sides of the same coin. Their hostility carries through from TFA until Rey senses good within Kylo during their Force chats and allows herself to be cuffed and taken into custody, just as Luke did in RotJ. The light within Kylo seems to win through as they work together to defeat Snoke's guards. They have the same goal - the end to the war - but chose different paths to get there, and, after realising this difference, are at odds again. It's worth noting that Kylo offers Rey the opportunity to rule alongside him, just as Vader did to Luke, and Anakin did to Padme.<br /><br /> <br /><br />I understand the grievances about the storyline and the character arcs but look at the message and themes of the film and how it ties into the saga as a whole. We often hear about balance in the Force but, for me, in TLJ, it's the first time we see signs of it. It's this symmetry which brings together the prequels and original trilogy, that really makes the film stand out."
3270,9,Everything it needed to be!,"Great film! About time Star Wars was taken in a new direction! Doesn't deserve all the criticism it has had, was a bold film and a great watch!"
3271,8,Take it easy geez!,"So apparently I'm supposed to hate this movie, seeing as I'm a long time Star Wars fan but honestly I don't understand why everyone is so mad! I've have been watching these movies since I was really little, my father had the original VHS tapes and I watched them religiously! And I was lockstep with the rest of the fandom in tearing down the prequels, but nope no this movie. It's not perfect but nothing is perfect and I really appreciate that we weren't given what we expected. I feel like the film does a great job of distancing itself from previous films and still holding on to the charm of the Star Wars Universe that we all know and love. I personally believe the fandom is up it's own ass on this one, but that's my opinion. Feel free to tell me I'm not a real Star Wars fan but I have nothing to prove to you. I love Star Wars and I know seeing this movie made me feel like I was a kid again, I was giddy and excited while watching it and left the theater feeling a sense of wonder in the world. "
3272,4,Little disappointing,"As a entertaining film, was ok. But as a story to a massive franchise, nothing really happened. A chase and three sub story's that go nowhere. And a boring and disappointing end to a famous character. Also why is this rated 7.4 and has mostly 1/2/3 and tomb raider is rated 6.9 and has lots of 7/8/9 scores.?????"
3273,9,"You're probably sad, because this wasn't ""The Empire Strikes Back"" Revisited.","I honestly enjoyed this film. People were annoyed because ""The Force Awakens"" seemed too much like ""New Hope""...and now they're mad because ""The Last Jedi"" wasn't ""Empire Strikes Back"" revisited. Make up your mind people..."
3274,2,"Yes, every bad thing you've heard is true.",2 stars for good sfx.
3275,,Disappointed Star Wars fan,"I do like the new characters introduced in tfa and tlj but I do not like the direction that Disney has decided to take. I can't see how one can separate the main entry into the Star Wars saga and the Skywalker family, which is ultimately what Johnson is trying to do. Yes, there are stories of other characters in this universe, but the one family we care most about is now nothing more than a ghost."
3276,9,Floored by the negativity of users,"I cannot imagine why folks feel this movie was a 1/10. Have they seen truly bad movies before? This movie had a few spots where I felt characters should not have survived, but it had genuine surprises, humor, good character interaction. This movie was way better than Force Awakens which seemed to be a pandering to make the movie friendly to folks who wanted to see the original movies as they remember them but the payment for that was the movie had no real substance. "
3277,8,A great continuation of the saga...,"Another step towards the new wave of stars to carry on the legacy of this saga. Lots of fun and plenty of surprising twists, done with good humour. Some of the sentimentality is a bit forced, but this seems to be done to appease some of the old school fans. Very much loved it, I did!"
3278,8,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI REVIEW BY DAVID DE GROOT,"Rian Johnson finally had the guts to divert from the standard Star Wars formula, something that lacked in The Force Awakens. This is very much Rian Johnson's version of Star Wars, playing with comic relief, being creative with audio to build tension and surprising us with the plot over and over. My viewing party laughed, cried and celebrated.<br /><br />All of this however, needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The movie admittingly had its fair share of excellent moments, however some were amply abysmal."
3279,1,Awful just awful,"If your an emotional SJW you'll enjoy the themes of the movie, otherwise avoid this an all future attempts by Disney. Accept the death, grieve and move on..."
3280,8,"By his choice, The Last Jedi renews the Star Wars myth",It contains the ingredients that made the success of the saga but especially a true renewal of the genre after all 8 even films in the universe of the Force.
3281,1,Not Star Wars,"This is absolutly not a Star Wars saga episode. Disney is continuing to collapse the saga with this chaotic mix. Just as in the last episode, the writers, the actors, the director made a terrible wok. Marc Hamill was great but they made Luke's character as joke. Disney made their usual culture destroing work, i just waited when the characters will start to dancing and singing... This movie is bad joke what looks like Star Wars but its just another scifi. After you left the cinema you feel nothing special as you should, youl feel just nothing...<br /><br />I give 5/10 as a movie and 1/10 as Star Wars!"
3282,,"If yout expect Jedi lore or Sith mysteries, prepare to be dissappointed!","First of all, I'm a Star Wars fan since I was old enough to watch the movies, roughly since the mid-90s. I've read a lot of books (mostly pre-Palpatine-era) and watched most SW movies 50+ times and more and enjoyed games like the Jedi Knight series or KoTOR series, too."
3283,8,You need to think about it...,"You know, once you get Rian Johnsons concept of legacy and mythmaking, The Last Jedi turns into a decent film. It suffers from inconsistantcy, such as having a dreadnought with no shields get utterly destroyed, while a little Rebel cruiser can potter along getting blasted and suffer no damage until its ""fuel"" runs out. Yes, Finn and Rose add nothing to the movie, and yes there was pacing issues in general...."
3284,8,Am I the only hope?,"Frankly, this movie made me feel good. Yes, there were new ""force-rules"" introduced that didn't make a lot of sense for the Star Wars lineage. Yes, Rose's character was unnecessary. Yes, the casino scene was useless. However...it made me feel nostalgic and overall made me feel good! I laughed, I smiled, I felt a connection with some of the characters... what more can I want?"
3285,9,Impressive. Most impressive.,"It's unbelievable to read the bile and hatred spat on this film. I've seen it three times now and it definitely gets better with each viewing, unlike the prequels which make the facepalms deeper with repeats. I can tell why people react the way they did, no one expected this jarring of a shock to an episode for Star Wars, of which fans had already complained on the last episode that it mimicked A New Hope. We get a new, exciting vision of the universe that's still grounded in what makes it so great and fun, and people lose their minds. This has always been a space opera paying homage to classic sci fi serials and it delivers on that front. It's a Star Wars film and a damn good one even if it wasn't called Star Wars. I feel that with a few years time it will be revered for the awesome episode that it was. (Yes Leia Poppins looked stupid, but everything else looks so slick, well shot and thought out that it can be overlooked.) Great job Johnson, can't wait to see what else you come up with for the new trilogy."
3286,1,"Disney Star Wars Episode 2, A New BS","Episode 1 was ""Episode VII"". As another review tile, Disney strikes back, what a piece of crap, horribly done, this is a kids movie for 8+ years up to 12, everything is made of inflammable fragile exploding material, laws of Physics are different on that Galaxy, maybe because it's far far away? Someone said Mediocre, please, don't insult mediocrity, I'd give it 0/10 if I could. I probably won't see Episode IX, I can say with confidence that the Saga is dead as it was intended by the first trilogy that was made, for a young adult audience."
3287,8,Trolls. Reminder of why one might void social media.,"Wow. Has anyone seen Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or Harry Potter? They're also movies with some plot faults, suspension of disbelief, and believe it or not... cheesy production values. This one was pretty smart and pretty fun. Definitely fun to watch ( battle of the red room, Luke being totally badass on a salt planet, yoda being silly). <br /><br />Proud to add it as another notch in a cinematic universe I've had the pleasure of viewing in its original release theatrically. That's right, I'm bragging that I've seen every Star Wars movie upon its original release. I'm old..."
3288,1,Was this a comedy?,"I don't know, but it wasn't a sequel and it didn't make sense."
3289,3,Unbelievably awful yet unbelievably forgettable,"When I saw this movie I originally gave it a 6 star review because at least it was pretty but I heard people talking about it just now and it jogged my memory about all of these things I forgot so I had to hop back on here just to give it a lower rating for the things I forgot. That's pretty the whole movie in a nutshell and I never want to watch another Star Wars movie because of it, thanks Disney."
3290,1,"""It's time for the (last) Jedi to end!""","I love Star Wars. I was born six days before the release of the original; the Saga has been part of my life. I love the characters, the story, and the imagery. I love the behind the scenes history, influence on filmmaking, and cultural impact of the films. I grew up playing with the action figures, collecting the Topps cards (with dusty, razor-sharp shards of ""gum""), eating C-3POs cereal, listening to the ""You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear Artoo-Detoo beep like this"" records, playing the Nintendo games, wearing the shirts, reading the Expanded Universe, riding Star Tours, experiencing the Renaissance of the mid '90s. Star Wars was something that defined me. <br /><br />And then I saw ""The Last Jedi"".<br /><br />This movie is insulting to a loyal and invested fan base. It is blatant arrogance to proclaim ""Let the past die"" when so many like me have been dedicated supporters of a franchise that permeated so many aspects of our lives. Star Wars is inextricably part of our past. To ""let it die"" trivializes the foundation of what has allowed these films to still be made 40 years later. Further, the filmmakers defend the poor reviews by blaming the fans for not embracing the desecration of our collective past.<br /><br />""The Last Jedi"" is a fever dream version of Star Wars. It negates everything that came before it, including it's immediate predecessor. While ""The Force Awakens"" was a pale imitator of the original, ""The Last Jedi"" is so unlike any other Star Wars movie. Yes, there are superficial similarities: character names, weapons, ships. Gone is the grand, overarching story with historical and mythological undertones. Gone are the universally applicable lessons of overcoming selfishness and anger through maturity and sacrifice. Instead, we are given contradictory messages that only suit the plot (arms dealers are bad, but they supply the good guys; Admiral Holdo can sacrifice herself to save the Resistance, but Finn can't because of some line about not fighting the ones we hate, but saving the ones we love).<br /><br />Like ""The Force Awakens"", character arcs are destroyed - characters are unrecognizable. Luke Skywalker, beloved hero of millions, is reduced to a pathetic coward just to justify Kylo Ren. Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio are reduced to props. <br /><br />I imagine that fans like myself get movies. We understand how fickle we are; we want something new, yet love our nostalgia. We get that the older characters should make way for new ones. But not like this. This tells us to jettison everything we love without offering anything better in its place. It's the same silly hubris that Disney pulled with the old Expanded Universe (the Legends); they proclaimed it all ""non-canon"", then gave us garbage like ""Aftermath"" as replacements. Yes, most of the video games, comic books, and novels were pretty bad - but they all had their fans! Star Wars really doesn't belong to any of us! We all played with our action figures differently as we created our own adventures and interpretations of the characters.<br /><br />But Rian Johnson comes along like the rich kid who has all the toys and immediately tells us what Star Wars is or isn't? <br /><br />I know this is a long, meandering review. But I hate this movie because I love Star Wars. And I refuse to let Kathleen Kennedy tell me how to play with my action figures!"
3291,1,As a die hard Star Wars fan it pains me to write this review....,"""The Last Jedi"" was by far the worst Star Wars movie that has entered the series. The actors themselves are great, but it is the story that has completely ruined the direction of the Star Wars franchise. There may be some spoilers ahead so if you have yet to see the movie please do not read further."
3292,3,Had some Potential but fumbles it in the end.,"The Last Jedi is one of the most polarising films ever made. The crowd is split on this one: One side loves the risks it takes and the other thought it didn't really work. After re-watching it, I can DEFINITELY see why it was hated so much, and honestly, I have to agree with them."
3293,2,"One of the dumbest, worst movies ever made","A cringeworthy 2-hour long string of dumb cliches and scenes so predictable that would make a baby yawn. It's filled with so much laughable pathos that it makes it look like a North Korean or early Soviet propaganda film. The choices the characters make and the sudden ""genius"" solutions or realizations they come to, sometimes obvious even to children or jut plain moronic, make them look like halfwits. I'm so glad I didn't pay a dime to waste 2 hours of my life to be tortured by this thing. When the end credits started rolling I went to the bathroom and flushed the toilet to serve as my opinion on this - it's so bad it's comical, like something Ed Wood could have made. I gave it 2 stars out of respect to all those people who worked hard under the false impression they were taking part in something grand. Disney already paid George Lucas to destroy his franchise, otherwise he should be suing them now."
3294,3,Ben swolo,One of the worst Star wars movies to exist very much.<br /><br />I'll admit my Tfa review was wasted potential and this review will probably just repeat the same point as countless of others but i don't really care.
3295,1,Nope,"I want to kick this movie in its politically correct , diversity filled force balls."
3296,1,This movie is terrible,"Please don't watch this, it's incredibly bad, if you want to watch Star Wars just pick up a movie made by George Lucas."
3297,1,One of the worst films ive ever watched,"Congrats! you ruined not only the trilogy, but destroyed the originals as well! You very well may have damaged further trilogies with BS about fuel and the such.<br /><br />WTF were you thinking???"
3298,1,How to ruin a good movie franchise and reputation of actors,"1. Add some kind of minions <br /><br />2. Don't explain characters backgrounds and origins and dispose that mystery built up in the process. Suchs as Phasma and Snoke<br /><br />3. Add a Mary Poppins scene in space where she uses the force <br /><br />4. Create a side story, like a SW Rebels cartoon, that doesn't affect the movie plot at all and only adds time to the movie<br /><br />5. Create plot holes that are unredeemable. Such as Luke leaving a map in order to be found in case of need but then trashing that plot by making him saying otherwise<br /><br />6. Mix it all together and make it last 2 hrs and 40 mins."
3299,1,Imdb is a liar,"This horrible, poorly edited, poorly acted, SHOCKINGLY badly written and directed movie has thousands upon thousands of 1 star reviews. That is because this is literally the second worst film I have ever seen in my life. Not only is it a venomous, deliberate act of hatred against fans of the original trilogy, it is a heinously incompetent film by its own merits. Only the genius (as always) visual effects work of Industrial Light and Magic lend any form of quality to this cinematic abomination.<br /><br />And of course, IMDB is falsely rating the user score as 7.3<br /><br />Thats a lie. If you average the scores, its below a 4. Likely below a 3/10.<br /><br />Everyone hates this movie except only the blindly loyal, and those with no standards at all. I thoroughly hate this loathesome, unfunny, badly paced pile of stinking garbage film. And you should to. Do not see it."
3300,5,Yo Momma fat,"Literally turns Star Wars into a joke, I don't have an issue with you turning Luke into a different character but Luke was the symbol of hope and the inner conflict of a person but coming to do the right thing in the end. This movie as I'm sure you've heard millions of times before turns Luke into a grumpy old man. It's just disrespectful to Luke and his legacy. Let's not forget the yo momma joke as well which should speak for it self. The choreography is really bad as well, at one point they just delete a knife in the throne room fight scene I'm sure you know what I'm talking about so I won't go further. They pretty much destroy any logic that remains with lightsabers. Ben is seen turning a lightsaber on and off in less then a second. Previous installments of Star Wars have had lightsaber take several seconds to turn on and off again unless the lightsaber is malfunctioning like Kenobi's did in the clone wars when his kyber crystal had been damaged. Ben is just an annoying man child who can't do anything which is pretty pitiful for a villain. Also the force projecting thing that Luke does doesn't make any sense. Luke somehow knows that they need to stall for time and projects himself across the universe. Leia who isn't that force sensitive somehow contacts him across the universe and Luke is able to get the message? It just is using the force as a plot device and not a tool like it is. Also the floating thing? Oh come on if Jedi could float in battle this could be a major advantage so why don't they? This movie breaks so many level of canon. I say anything 15 A. B. Y and after isn't canon to me in order to keep the canon making sense. If you don't like this review then go cry and pee your pants because I'm right and nothing you can say will make it wrong."
3301,1,"Boring, pointless and non eventfull",Firstly I hated the force awakens. I thought it was a shoddy rewrite of return of the Jedi which was badly scripted and fanboy esque. 
3302,1,How to ruin a franchise and divide a fanbase,"This movie is a complete dumpster fire. The tone is set from the very beginning when we see General Hux, who was a threatening villain in The Force Awakens, reduced to a bumbling clown. Remember the high note The Force Awakens ended on when Rey handed Luke his father's light saber? I can't say I like what happened when he took the light saber, but wow were my expectations subverted! So I guess that makes it brilliant?"
3303,1,This is a terrible movie,"If you read the original Star Wars novel in 1977 more than two times and loved it, you will very much hate this movie. I was in the third grade and read it at least a few dozen times. The original movie wasn't disappointing because it was made before the book was released and pictures from the movie were in the book. That was back when people would read things. There is no way The Last Jedi would make anyone yearn for the movie's release."
3304,1,Worst Star Wars ever,"Hugely disappointing overly-long rehash of what was once a decent series from George £uca$. Easily the worst of the franchise (cash cow) this is my last $tar War$ movie. Enough is enough, no more the fool. No new ideas, thankfully only a little heavy humour, even dug up old stars - allow Princess Leia to rest in peace, not turn in her grave. Same for $olo and $kywalker, though they're still alive, allegedly. How did this junk score any points?"
3305,1,What was that?,"We already knew that Star Wars hated the evil Nazi's, but now it seems we're supposed to believe that Luke and co were communists all along, and not the freedom fighting westerners on the other side of WW2. The evils of capitalism are on full display here, and all this without the rouge smuggler solo to give us a sense that making a dollar is OK."
3306,5,"Please, please, please...","Stop destroying a Real Cult of Movie Culture!!! STOP!!! We can't, who went in 70ies to watch S.W. Saga in cinemas, keep on tolerate this pieces of junk, made for teenagers, with no plot logic, no real pathos, something between Indipendence Days and B-Movies. PLEASE, STOP!!!!! May the Force be with US ALL, and We need it, watching this boom-boom-action S.W. clones :-("
3307,1,Oh my...,"Seven minutes into this movie and my first thoughts are ""is this supposed to be a spoof?"" And it's not getting any better. In most respects, it looks like a high school av/drama club effort. I'm going to have to go back and watch the original trio to cleanse my mind after this mess."
3308,1,LET IT GO PLEASE!,They strike again milking an already tired franchise.. just like the terminator. alien. predator films.<br /><br />Time they got some imagination and stopped flogging a dead horse.
3309,1,"Sad, pathetic ending for a childhood hero",I can't imagine any hero being treated as badly as Luke Skywalker has been treated by Disney. Disney and Lucasfilm seem anxious to wipe out all existence of the Skywalkers and all past history of the Jedi.
3310,4,A perfect example of illogical subversion,"This film has acquired a great amount of criticism over the past 2 years. And just about all of the main points can be summarized into one category: Illogical Subversion. Every big twist in this film, from Luke's lack of ambition for the Jedi, to Snoke's abrupt death, to the revealing of Rey's unimportant parents succeeds at surprising the audience.<br /><br />Luke is a loyal Jedi master who would never throw away his identity just because of one mistake he made. But I bet you weren't expecting that.<br /><br />Snoke is built up to be an all powerful being that will have a great impact on the entire trilogy. They wouldn't just kill him off for no reason in the second film of the trilogy. But I bet you weren't expecting that.<br /><br />Rey has the powers of the force which means the force must be in her bloodline. It wouldn't make sense for her parents to be absolute nobodies. BUT I BET YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT!<br /><br />The entire film succeeds at surprising us at the expense of the logic of the Star Wars Universe, and the plot of the film. I'm sure we all would have rather accepted a predictable yet logical film than what we got.<br /><br />However out of all the problems in this film, the one that makes me mad the most is Finn's death (or lack there of) at the end. Finn started in the Force Awakens killing for the first order, however in an epiphany moment decided to leave and join the resistance. He is now at the point where he is instead trying to save the resistance by fighting the First Order. It would have been a poetic and monumental death in the sequel trilogy. However, Rose just HAD to save him at the last second. Her logic for saving Finn is that ""we shouldn't fight for what we hate, but instead save what we love."" Ironically, this is EXACTLY what Finn was doing. He was saving the small amount of remaining Resistance members in the cave, but I guess Rose and Finn just needed to have a romantic endeavor even though it wasn't built up anywhere in the film. In fact Finn and Rey had romantic tension remaining from the Force Awakens, but Rian Johnson just forgot. I guess.<br /><br />However there was some good in this film, but none of it overpowers the high amount of criticism contained in it.<br /><br />Let's just hope JJ Abrams fixes everything with Rise of Skywalker. It's our only hope."
3311,1,I must chime in also!,I was so disappointed in this movie and with IMDB for lying about the ratings. I do not trust IMDB anymore and will no longer check the ratings on movies on this site. It appears that ratings here can be bought for the right price.
3312,1,A travesty for the Star Wars saga .....,"It is so sad to see that in order for people to enjoy and accept a movie these days they NEED to see characters who share their views regarding what is politically correct, skin colour, sexual preferences, gender sensitivities, eating habits etc etc etc. This was by far the WORSE Star Wars movie ever made. Weak and badly written story full of plot holes that puts a colander to shame, MARVEL humor totally out of place for the SW universe, mistreatment and abuse of the main characters because they needed them to carry 2 movies but toss them away in the most disrespectful of ways just because Disney needs to make more movies in the future and sell BS merchandise, leaving us with new heroes that, due to the poor story writing, simply do NOT have the weight to carry the saga from now on. <br /><br />Being a fan of the original trilogy, i never expected the iconic characters i grew up with to live forever, after all Obi Wan and Yoda are gone but they completed their circle (in a physical form at least) and no one got angry then. So the main problem isn't change and moving forward, but the WAY that this will be handled.<br /><br /> As far as i am concerned i do not see me paying to see another Star Wars movie from Disney in the future, at least not one regarding the main line of the saga."
3313,2,So Disappointed!,"This is my first review submitted to IMDb, so be gentle. "
3314,2,How to Ruin the Future of an Iconic Franchise,"Almost everyone has heard of the classic franchise Star Wars. The first movie of the franchise, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, scored $786,598,007 in the box offices worldwide in 1977 (The Numbers). Even though it was the first time the world have ever seen the franchise, the fantastic characters and intriguing story brought in viewers from all over the world. The main characters of the original movies are still well known today, such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia. These characters were a large part of many people's childhoods. Today, however, the name of the Star Wars franchise was tarnished in the newest installment of the main star wars storyline: Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. This movie is a disgusting addition to the original movies. Star Wars Ep. VIII: The Last Jedi soils the future of the Star Wars franchise by ruining Luke Skywalker's character, wasting the chance to use Supreme Leader Snoke as a powerful antagonist, and throwing away any chances of logically explaining Rey's sudden power.<br /><br />A Grumpy Old Man<br /><br />Throughout the original Star Wars trilogy, Luke Skywalker was the main protagonist and hero of the story. He often served as a role model for children of that era. However, in The Last Jedi, his reputation was decimated. For example, the film portrays Skywalker as a grumpy old man who does not want to be bothered by the trouble of helping the resistance. When Rey asks him for help, Luke repeatedly denies her, choosing to die alone on the island instead (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). In the past, Luke Skywalker was a protagonist whose never ending devotion and determination to the light amplified his good character and kindness. Until the end of the movie, Skywalker is rude and seemingly unintelligent in his actions and words. Even though Skywalker becomes more like his true self at the end of the movie, that is where the worst atrocity is committed.<br /><br />An Unjust End<br /><br />Near the end of the movie, Luke Skywalker dies from exhaustion after using the force to create a hologram to distract the first order in order to give the resistance come time to escape (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). Why is this so awful? Well, it makes him die in a almost cowardly way. He was not actually on the battlefield while he was fighting, so it seems like he was too scared to actually fight or he did not have enough power. A protagonist like him needs a proper send-off in a film, and this certainly did not meet the requirements. Skywalker should have gone to the battlefield, in person, and put up an honorable final stand against an overwhelming first order army that he could not fend off in his old age.<br /><br />""He's Not My Luke Skywalker""<br /><br />The way this film depicts Luke is truly outlandish. Even the actor who plays Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill, stated ""He's not my Luke Skywalker. But I had to do what Rian wanted me to do because it serves the story well"" (Acuna). If the actor, himself, believes the script does not accurately display the character, then it is clear that the writers made a mistake. The way they portray Skywalker in this film is practically spitting in the faces of anyone who admired the character he once was.<br /><br />Another Character Ruined<br /><br />In the previous film, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, Supreme Leader Snoke is set up to be a ruthless, all-powerful leader of the dark side and the First Order. It seemed like he would be like the Emperor from the original Star Wars trilogy. Fans of the series were wild with excitement. Who is this villain? How powerful could he truly be? However, the writers once again spat in the faces of the fans.<br /><br />An Embarrassing and Unsatisfactory Defeat<br /><br />In the first movie where viewers actually get to see Snoke in action, The Last Jedi, he is killed in a pathetic way. While Snoke trusts Kylo Ren to execute Rey and is sitting still with his eyes closed, Kylo blatantly shifts a lightsaber on a nearby table to face Snoke. After Kylo aims it at snoke, he activates the light saber using the force and cuts Snoke in half, who was completely taken by surprise (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). Despite being portrayed as an extremely powerful villain who can make insights into the force, he is killed by surprise in this foolish way. It is a horrible and unbelievable attempt at comedy as it was meant to shock fans and blow their minds. In reality, all the writers did was waste a fantastic antagonist and make fans angry because of how illogical his death was. Yet again, the writers erase an interesting possibility for the future of Star Wars.<br /><br />How Does Rey Become So Powerful So Quickly?<br /><br />Not only does The Last Jedi waste these two characters, but it also removes the logic of Rey's character. Rey was introduced in The Force Awakens as a sudden Jedi talent who went from being a junker to being a match for one of the most powerful force users of all time, Kylo Ren. There was no explanation as to how she was able to obtain her power so quickly. To become that powerful, one must train for years in order to harness the force like she does. The only logical solution to this problem was that Rey was a daughter of a powerful jedi from the past because the identity of her parents was shrouded in mystery. However, The Last Jedi threw that possibility away by revealing that her parents were actually just poor junkers who abandoned her as a child (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). Even though this reveal was meant to be seen as the theme ""anyone can be great,"" it does not fit within the boundaries of the Star Wars story. Instead, this just leaves devoted fans without any logical answer to how she suddenly became one of the strongest Jedi simply from finding a lightsaber and swinging it.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />With that said, Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi was the most disappointing films in the history of Star wars. It obliterates the future of the series by ruining Luke Skywalker's character, wasting the chance to use Supreme Leader Snoke as a powerful antagonist, and throwing away any chances of logically explaining Rey's sudden power. At this point, devoted fans should be outraged by this defacing of the once beautiful Star Wars franchise. It would truly take a miracle to somehow bring the franchise back from this disgrace."
3315,3,Why?! Fundamentally destroys the heroes we love. Goes absolutely nowhere!,Disney and Rian Johnson have taken Star Wars back to a level of quality I havnt seen since Attack of the clones or The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Every positive aspect and mystery of the force awakens simply disregarded and swept away with nothing satisying any expectation AT ALL. Superficial and soulless. Destroying the legacy of every character we love and have grown up with. A kids movie with a bombardment of flat jokes and humour and moments that should be heartwarming and emotionally powerful played off as cheesy poorly executed fan service. This movie was like a terrible fan fiction written by a prequel fan. 3 hours watching a film where there is no progression in the overarching story of the franchise since 7 and works to negate anything interesting set up 2 years ago now. So disappointing that JJ didnt stay on to continue the same light but serious and mysterious tone of 7. Instead handed to a man who has no understanding of subtlety. Jumping the shark over and over again until those blue credits you have come to love so much roll and you are left relieved it is all over.<br /><br />It feels like with the abundance of fantastic and genuinely surprising stories from the Expanded universe Brian Johnson and Disney thought looking for something so ridiculous and insulting to true star wars lovers would be the only way to create something edgy and original. WRONG!<br /><br />There was so much potential here for this story and characters and now someone who has been a huge consumer and absolute fanatic from the first time he watched Star wars as a small child. I wont be interested in future installments. Frankly because there is nothing left to care about anymore besides a few boring super capable young people and a villain who probably isnt a villain for much longer.<br /><br />Oh well. Thank god I had Bladerunner 2049 this year.
3316,2,Not your typical fanboy,"So far, Disney has only shown that they wish to keep fanboys happy rather than further expand the Star Wars Universe. "
3317,1,Bad movie dont watch it,Disney dont know how to make a great star wars movie and pls dont let rian Johnsson make a star wars movie ever again and Disney pls Fire the femenist kathleen Kennedy she truly destroys star wars and i Will not be surprise if episode 9 is bad to
3318,2,Just ... plain ... stupid,"We finally watched this for ""free"" on TNT, and I was extremely glad I didn't waste money on tickets at the theater. The plotting was absolutely inane. Jr. High School students picked at random and shown the original trilogy could have done better."
3319,2,A huge misfire and such a Waste!,"I've been a life long star wars fan. I've eaten up everything from the franchise, while the same time not being blind to any weakness it may have. I'm not into 'creating my own star wars storylines in my head' only for a new film to let those exceptions down. My not a big fat fanboy and yes, I have a life. "
3320,2,Utterly Pointless,"Cringey humor: Pointless<br /><br />Adding hundreds of women for the sake of diversity: Pointless<br /><br />The new female lead (Rose) that buddies-up with Finn: Why should we care about her?! Pointless.<br /><br />Snoke being so evil and bad he just sits in a chair like an old age pensioner and then dies: Pointless.<br /><br />Bringing back Luke Skywalker without giving him an epic lightsaber fight: Pointless (and wasted opportunity).<br /><br />Leia using the force to magically fly through space back to safety: Pointless.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker drinking green milk from the breast of a creature on the island: Pointless.<br /><br />Robots ironing uniforms: Pointless.<br /><br />Making the evil empire or whatever they are called these days into something so stupid that it defies logic: Pointless.<br /><br />Awful writing and dialog: Pointless.<br /><br />Multiple storylines leading to nowhere or nothing of importance: Pointless.<br /><br />Making out that Rey's parents are a major plot and then it leads to nothing: Pointless.<br /><br />Laura Dern's purple-haired character: Pointless.<br /><br />Kylo Ren taking off his shirt: Pointless.<br /><br />Captain Phasma's moribund departure: Pointless<br /><br />The casino scene: Popintless<br /><br />Adding cute characters just to sell merchandise: Pointless.<br /><br />Having a main story line about spaceships not being able to move for the entire movie: Pointless.<br /><br />Killing off Luke: Pointless.<br /><br />""Oh, by the way, Admiral Ackbar died also"": Pointless<br /><br />Multiple anticlimatic storylines: Pointless <br /><br />Rian Johnson: Pointless.<br /><br />Disney: Pointless."
3321,3,Just a Jedi Mind Trick,"Hey Disney! It is not too late to save the franchise... Just use the opening crawl in Star Wars 9 to tell everyone that ""A long long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..."" Leia just had a bad dream. "
3322,1,Terrible terrible terrible,"Where do i start..<br /><br />First up, I get the need to have movies with strong female leads. But this is ridiculous. A Mary Sue who can do absolutely EVERYTHING??? COME ON!!! the Rey character is an expert pilot without any training, an expert aircraft technician without any training, a jedi master able to defeat trained soldiers without ANY training.. and did she actually beat luke skywalker to the ground with just a few moves on acchto?? Why do we need any of the other characters????"
3323,1,How to destroy a well established franchise,"Rian Johnson not only made a VERY bad movie (plot holes as huge as our galaxy, childish humor, unrecognizable characters and i could go on and on), no, he sucked also the magic out of the saga and let Yoda, Luke, Leia and almost everybody and everything in his movie AND ALL THE STAR WARS MOVIES BEFORE look like travesty. That is his legacy! By the way: I liked The Force Awakens, it was a fine start for the new trilogy. Not perfect but GOLD in comparison to TLJ. Tragic, everything is ruined now!"
3324,3,subversions that didn't age well,What could've been...
3325,1,Worse than Phantom Menace,"How is it this movie has a 7.2 rating with 4 out of 5 reviews being 1 to 4? Plot holes, disrespect for the characters that were this universe, and a lack of any sort of unified vision for the trilogy make this not only the worst Star Wars movie, it quite possible the one that killed or at least iced the franchise putting an unnecessary ceiling in what could have been unparalleled success for Disney."
3326,3,How Disney Killed the Golden Goose,"Not a bad movie but a terrible ""Star Wars"" movie that seems to actually have contempt for the original films, all its characters, and the audience that loved them both. "
3327,5,Corny,Too many one liners. Opening scene destroyed the whole movie. How did Leia survive space? Ridiculous.
3328,1,Why was this even made?,"I'm still shellshocked after watching this in the cinema one year ago. What was the purpose of it? The story was barely existing, and that which did exist was outright horrible. By the end of this movie, the storyline has barely advanced at all, but instead made it all even more confusing. How will they ever patch this up in Rise of Skywalker? And don't get me started on the forced politics. This is something that absolutely shouldn't belong in a fantasy/sci-fi franchise."
3329,1,Worse than the prequels...,I've never been so dissapointed by a movie in my life...
3330,1,The worst Star Wars movie,The Defamation of Luke Skywalker:<br /><br />A Jedi who saw the good in a serial child murdering leader of a tyrannical empire has his judgement skewed by a nightmare. Pathetic.
3331,3,A lot more bad than good,"I thought TFA was an OK movie with problems, but Rian Johnson takes everything good out of that movie and other previous Star Wars films and throws it in the trash."
3332,1,Who is rating this movie!,How has this movie got a score of 7.2<br /><br />Brown envelopes must be getting passed on.<br /><br />Awful movie.
3333,1,Ruined the movie story line.,"This movie is a lesson that just because you throw a lot of money and opinions at the story and special effects, doesn't mean it's going to be good. The performance was average and the story was not good. The only good characters were made into a mockery and I still wonder what the point of Rose's character is. I just hope that The Mandalorian will save the franchise because I'm done with the new movies. I hope one day Disney admits that the final three movies were a joke."
3334,1,The new trilogy has no soul!,"For me movies are about the (believable) characters and their development, the story, the pacing, the world i am sucked in, most importantly the athmosphere, overall the movie having a soul. The new trilogy has none of those redeeming qualities. In tfa, i feel like the movie has no art of it´s own, is never alive of art-enabling import, is perverting certain concepts. Tlj was just bad. As long as the art of making movies was magical, the movie-makers trying to be original, bringing new stuff, e.g. George Lucas and others creating Star Wars, the movie world seemed alright to me. Even in a established universe or world, it is possible to bring new stories, heck there is fandom which is quite interesting. Nowadays it´s hard to find a movie made with love and with a soul. You can just feel when a movie is made by automatons, with near perfect execution but no life in it, no passion, maybe even love."
3335,1,More Disney garbage!!!,"This is bad comedy, I had such high hopes and it just takes their marvel formula and blends it with Star Wars. It's overdone and really just made for families with young kids in mind. Atrocious..."
3336,2,Luke and Leia deserve better.,"There are so many good insightful negative reviews of this film that expose it's numerous flaws at length; I've decided to keep this much too long, wrong spirited second installment of the current series brief."
3337,1,Just Di$ney ca$hing in again... Money MONEY Money $$$$,"Don't wast any time or money for this movie.<br /><br />it's a big fat disgrace to it's original ones (the Real Start Wars).<br /><br />it's no better than ""Episode VII - The Force Awakens"", honestly it felt worse."
3338,1,Don't waste your time,This movie was the downfall of Star Wars all magic that was George Lucas is gone and instead they tried to do some bubbly avengers type movie. I'll never forgive you disney
3339,1,The end of the Star Wars saga,"First of all , nobody wants to hate a star wars movie .All of us more or less enjoy and love every single of the movies regardless if the are some parts tha are flawed ...''The Last Jedi'' was the most anticipated movie of the year with high expectations.The movie is enjoyable and not boring ,with many space battles ,great special effects , good acting ,BUT NOT FOR A REAL STAR WARS FAN. "
3340,4,Very bad,The death of Star Wars has came.....this movie ain't something for watch.. that's all
3341,1,Hard to justify...,"As a Star Wars fan born into the prequel era, I am used to being the one defending the movie. However, this entire movie is filled with moments that seem to represent a giant middle finger to the Star Wars fanbase. It does have its moments, mostly in its cinematography. However, the writing was abysmal and the plot was generally stale. Characters like Rey, Kylo Ren and Supreme Leader Snoke received little to no exposition on their stories and history. Rian Johnson clearly set out to make a film to divide audiences purposely and that's what he did."
3342,3,Completely trashed final trilogy,"After watching the force awakens at least 3 times in the cinema I came into this movie with great expectations. Shattered. The movie had no plot, stupid side quests that resulted in nothing and completely ruined the characters set up in the previous movie. After watching The Rise of Skywalker it is clear abrams was eager to remove any trace this movie existed. It does not need to be seen at all to understand the last movie. Any time I watch this trilogy I'll be watching 2 movies and this one will stay in the shelf."
3343,2,Ugh...,"A couple of years ago, it appeared that a 14yo girl saw the original Star Wars trilogy and decided to re-write the original 1977 film as a fanfic with herself as an über-powered Mary Sue who instinctively had the powers of a Jedi and more of Han Solo's piloting skills than he had in his own ship. Not only that, but she had perfect skin, teeth, and hair despite living on a desert planet, orphaned at a young age and scraping by on scrap metal sales. She had no scars, body marks, burns or anything else--she was a flawless little princess in an extremely hostile (yes, I deployed to the Middle East in the early 1990s) environment. The rest of the story we know, because that fanfic was turned into a movie, The Force Awakens."
3344,1,Just sad,I don't even feel like writing a long review on this crap... just horrible..
3345,1,Even worse than the prequels.,Just don't. I was so disappointing and even angered by this movie. It seems like they thought only children were going to see it so they just said screw it.
3346,2,Trash,"Aweful, terrible, boring trash. The CGI was ok but the story and acting was trash. This is another example of using social justice and ""pc"" torture to ruin any epic adventure of mindlessness injected into 150minutes of wasted life."
3347,1,A complete disgrace,"This is a blueprint of how to waste a legend. So much potential thrown out of the window. When Disney dumped the expanded universe, i thought they had the greatest idea of renewing the saga post RotJ. I was so wrong. They had ZERO idea at all. Only identity politics and half baked ideologies pushed to the highest level. It's beyond me how could they do this for the most beloved modern mithos of our times. It's so sad, but it's true: Star Wars is over. It is finished off by no talent, no imagination hacks. And they are laughing with all the money they got for this crime against modern culture.<br /><br />Don't watch It if you want to remember the beloved characters in their original grace. Just pretend It has never been made. As It shouldn't have at all."
3348,1,What a big pile of crap,This movie shouldn't be included as canon... Even a fanfiction can be way better than this pile
3349,1,Trash,What? Why????? What happened to star wars?? Darh vader would instantly kill everyone who worked on thi movie
3350,5,Very Disappointing,"My biggest problem with The Last Jedi are the unanswered questions. I've heard that some people were upset by the revelation of Rey's parents, but I didn't mind that at all. I was infuriated, however, by the lack of explanation of who the hell Snoke is. Hell, I barely understand what the First Order is! I wish Snoke had been given more attention and development rather than the movie spending what felt like several hours in the terrible ""kid-friendly"" casino subplot."
3351,4,New Star Wars trilogy seems completely lost,"I love 'Looper' - had very high expectations that weren't met. The film is centred on an endless chase scene that has zero sense of speed or danger. There is little meaningful continuation from the previous film - character arcs are abruptly halted, or sped up to suit the demands of where they need to be for the sequel. Big mistakes with the tone - Domhnall Gleeson is reduced to cutaway jokes. The comedy as a whole is juvenile and distracting - very reminiscent of the prequel trilogy."
3352,1,Poor film,"Visually pretty at times however, What happened to story telling, character development, world building? The editing inconsistent, fight choreography appalling, cringe fest moments throughout, dialogue and weak jokes eyerlingly bad, a very bad film. But money buys reviews and acclaim."
3353,3,It was okay but like TFA feels a bit by the numbers,I got the chance to see it last night at the European premiere.
3354,1,I didn't go back for the 3rd installment,"Wow this was bad. I waited for this one to come out on TV after being disappointed in the 1st movie, but after this one I'm done with the series and haven't bothered to see the 3rd one."
3355,2,The Rubbish Continues,And they still find people to pay them to watch their franchise sequel schlock.
3356,1,Star Wars: Hoping This Will Be The Last Flop,"Some things that bothered me (a lot):<br /><br />Too many nonsense.<br /><br />What is Snoke?<br /><br />A little bit too extreme as a Luke reaction. And just an old message makes him change his idea? Please<br /><br />In the original saga have they never talked about fuel for jumping in light speed? I don't think so. And it takes hours to charge? Please.<br /><br />The force is also useful to defrost yourself. Lol<br /><br />New Instant Messaging application thanks to the force (while in the original only if they where nearby they could feel each other).<br /><br />All these new space ships, just... why keeps doing it? And there are new, more evil, AT-AT. I have no word, really.<br /><br />All this new weapons. They have no sense at all. Or usefulness.<br /><br />There are some things that I really can't understand.<br /><br />The force can also project yourself, instead of using a simple hologram... Oki."
3357,2,Not Star Wars,"This didn't feel like Star Wars at all. It was full of cliches, predictable moments and lots of ""seriously?""'s. Why JJ Abrams didn't direct this, I'll never know. Not authentic to the series at all."
3358,1,Director did not seem familiar with star wars,"This movie ultimately seemed pointless without adding much to the over all story. It seemed like Rian Johnson wasn't familiar with the franchise at all. I'm not sure why he directed the movie. The story got way ahead of itself, and ignored many interesting side plots. It's a shame because there were some cool dynamics like the Rey and Kylo scenes, and a few other cool story arcs that ultimately led to nothing.. there wasn't anything this film could do to make up for the injustice that was done to Luke Skywalker. It almost seemed like Rian directed this film with a personal hatred to Mark Hamill and his legacy as Skywalker."
3359,1,"yes, really that bad","Real person here, not a Russian bot. I am normally way too lazy to bother with reviews etc, but here I am more than a year after watching this film. It still makes me angry how bad this film is. I dont need to repeat all the reasons - many others have written these already better than I would. I just wanted to confirm them again in my opinion. Yes it is that bad."
3360,2,Kathleen Kennedy,"Has ruined this franchise. I assume she must have dirt on pretty much everyone in Hollywood.<br /><br />Her name is attached to half of Spielberg's work and apparently she is getting all the credit for his brilliance, because I can't see how she has contributed anything to warrant her high priestess standing within Disney & Dreamworks"
3361,1,Ironic. Main theme was failure and the movie failed abysmally** Some Spoilers,"Complete and utter disappointment from this movie in the context of a Star Wars movie. As a stand alone I'd probably give it a 7/10, but I am a huge SW fan and went to see a SW movie. I entirely blame Rian Johnson for this fiasco. The man came into a saga that has been around for more than 40 years and ignored everything and everyone the fans loved and did his own thing. You just don't do that, disrespect fans like that. I've seen some ppl defending this saying it doesn't matter who Rey's parents are, or who Snoke is, anybody can do anything... Normally I would agree, but TFA has set this points up, so when the answer we get is: ""It doesn't matter"" it's normal to get p*ssed off. Instead of answers we were looking for we get a tone of new concept mostly centred around fuel. Anyone remember fuel being mentioned before in any of the 8 movies from the past 40 years? No? Neither do I... Only saving grace I can see is that this movie's failure was so complete, that the impact to the saga is minimal, nothing worth remembering really happened... Just really sorry I supported this garbage with the money I payed for the ticket"
3362,4,Butchered by Disney and Johnson,"It has taken me a week of mulling things over for me to finally come to conclusion that TLJ is about as good as Revenge of the Sith. What was Rian Johnson thinking? The plot is all over the place with no cohesion to it. While TFA was criticized for being derivative of A New Hope, it felt like a Star Wars movie and JJ Abrams paid homage to the OT. I didn't like Rogue One at first but it grew on me as a stand alone feature in the Star Wars universe and it is way better than TLJ."
3363,2,Destroys the mythology,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think Lucas had made a better job with the sequels. Well at least he knows the mythology - this pretty much destroys it."
3364,1,I LOST THE FORCE,Please erase this movie from my memory. I have watched it until Finn and the mechanical girl went to the Casino and then I watched myself watching myself losing the force.
3365,1,The weakest of the star wars movies,"Im a big fan of SW, some were really good some were just okay. But I never felt the hate i feel for this one. It has completely destroyed the new trilogy for me. No amount of fixing will make it enjoyable for me, so Im not even going to watch ep.IX. Which makes me feel bad for JJ, because although his movie wasnt without problems, it was exactly what we needed for a new trilogy."
3366,3,Episode 8: The Last Movie ... has fulfilled its destiny,"With this movie I say farewell to my beloved franchise. I have followed the saga and its Universe since I was born. Like many of you, blood runs deep through me when it comes to Star Wars; but Disney has gone to far with Episode 8 (I wanted to leave at times or vomit). TFA was a crappy reboot movie of a somewhat questioned franchise (all thanks to old fanboys of the originals hating the prequels just because they had to see new stuff&CGI; which I prefer if they enhance my experience). Yet Rogue One brought some great intense depth to very important events around the time the original trilogy takes place. "
3367,2,I Am Not Sure What This Is,"But It Is Not Star Wars. Melissa Mccarthy (the woman from SNL) falls in love with a black guy who is a coward. Then she showers him with love and crowds him so badly. The dude decides to hurtle towards suicide at full speed only to hear a knock on his door (by Melissa) ""oh no, you don't.... honey?"""
3368,1,Don't waste your time!,This is the first Star Wars Movie I saw once and I don't want to see ever again! And won't waste my time on the next one too.
3369,1,so disappointing,I personally was very disappointed as a star wars fan. It made no sense..
3370,2,Rian Johnson Has Just Killed the Star Wars Franchise,"I remember the day Star Wars came out in the cinema. This was the film that introduced me to great Science Fiction and captivated me to the genre for life. In 2 & half hours, Rian Johnson destroyed FORTY YEARS of fond memories i had for the Star Wars franchise.<br /><br />My top Issues:<br /><br />1. This film turns Leia into Superman - i honestly burst out laughing in the cinema when it happened, because it was so unbelievable!<br /><br />2. Luke is totally out of character - how can he possibly doubt Kylo Ren, when he never lost faith in Darth Vader, and Vader was a million times more evil than Kylo Ren<br /><br />3. The male-hating Vice Admiral Holdo - the most annoying and cringe worthy character ever in a Star Wars film, makes Jar Jar Binks look loveable<br /><br />4. The entire Casino storyline, which ultimately was completely irrelevant to the main plot, and seems like just a ploy to make more toy merchandise<br /><br />5. The complete anti-climax of Snoke, who was portrayed as this huge villain and ended up just an easy pushover<br /><br />6. And best for last - the absolutely ludicrous ""Holdo maneuver"". If this really was a thing, why didn't the rebels use it to destroy the Death Star in Star Wars? Hyperspace ramming should have been the rebels' top weapon from day one!"
3371,1,"Like the dark side, this movie leads to suffering","Painful to get through. It took me 3-4 attempts to watch it through. My first attempt resulted in a walkout before the first scene ended. Poor writing, lack of compelling story, and even suspending logic barely allows some parts of the plot make sense. I had low expectations and was truly surprised by how low I should have set them."
3372,3,3 stars is kind. TLJ still is a pile of ...,My soul was crushed by the awful writing and nonsensical storyline including plot. Luke Skywalker dies. Smoke is killed like that. Who cares about that Rose character and the person making too much doe because of this monstrosity?
3373,3,"No, just....no","What were you trying to accomplish with this? An entire dreadnaught worth of flak cannon taken out by one fighter? Those slow bombers, what happened to Y wings?"
3374,2,They get my money but not my heart!!,"Whatching this just made TFA feel a little less of a horrible disaster of a movie to me. As a ""cinema session"" it´s OK, and plot-wise I found a good thing they had the courage to subvert the order of things and start to leave the old SW universe behind. Yes this is perhaps the only true, real merit of TLJ: to propose the destruction/death/retirement of the old, beloved and well-developed characters and truths of the SW saga."
3375,1,Why so many jokes?,"For a Star Wars film, there was waay too much joking. No emotional depth to the film. They could have explored more about the Force and the connection between Ren and Kylo, but nope. Or explored Snoke or Ren's background. Nope. Nobody really died except Luke and it was more like half-assed see ya around kid???"
3376,1,Disney continues to destroy everything we hold dear,"This movie is terrible in every way, except the visuals. It is badly written, poorly paced, too long and boring. It obliterates the character of Luke Skywalker! It doesn't offer any new remarkable characters, and it leads with Rey who is the ultimate Mary Sue. Basically, this is a hate letter to all the Star Wars fans."
3377,4,THIS MOVIE COMPLETELY RUINED CHARACTER OF LUKE SKYWALKER!,"Unlike ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" there are no enjoyable scenes, this film had even more 'overhype' but it didn't worth any of our time, talking about duels, no lie, it get even worse, at least ""Force awakens"" got some good duels but ""The Last Jedi"" have nothing at duels. No enjoyability, no good plot, no good duels just character ruin and overhype. Worst SW film."
3378,1,What a dumpster fire,From stupid space Leia to a wholly forgettable movie that was a total waste of time.
3379,1,Terribly Disappointing,What a sad time to be a Star Wars fan. This movie was the worst in the series of films and I find it insulting that the rating on this site shows it at 7.5.
3380,1,Not just from a fanboy perspective,"I feel TLJ negative reviews often get marginalized because they are from a ""fanboy perspective"" that cannot deal with ""subverting expectations"". But in my opinion that does not make a lot of sense; TLJ is, after all, part 8 of an ennealogy (yeah, I had to look that up). 7 films before it established what can and cannot take place in the universe."
3381,1,Just god awful,I made an account just to rate this 1/10. It's probably the worst film I've ever seen
3382,1,Just pathetic,"These movies used to make you excited! Now, this one especially, just leaves you feeling empty and duped. It's become one big commercial, untillegible, boring and full of false ""wisdom"". Yeah right. Couldn't even finish it."
3383,4,Possibly the worst Starwars made,"This movie rivals the clone wars on how boring it is. I loved the force awakens even if it was sort of repeat concept, the new planets and characters made it interesting as well as witty dialogue. This is not the case in the last Jedi. The dialogue in TLJ is horrible and cringe. I liked the stuff with Luke but that's about it. Very disappointed that they didn't bring Abrams back for this installment."
3384,1,I feel insulted as a fan of star wars,"This film destroyed the characters of the original trilogy, I don't want to spoil it so I won't say how. This is no longer Star Wars. There is too much to complain about; the plot was pointless yet aggravating, the side plots were boring. Disney and Rian Johnson have found a way to cripple the saga and leave it completely irrecoverable."
3385,1,I Wish I Could Give This Movie Zero Stars,"I was looking forward to watching this movie for such a long time, but it turned out to be a disappointment. Luke Skywalker old, scared, and a coward while drinking green milk out of an alien's utters? Really?! I wish this movie was good but it simply wasn't. At times I even caught myself falling asleep. This is not, what I believe, Star Wars fans wanted in to see in a Star Wars film and the return of Luke Skywalker."
3386,1,Garbage,I watch it when it's on for a few decent scenes and cringe at all the rest. They had great FA characters to work with and still blew it. I almost want it to be remade just to get this trash out of the canon. Everyone that made and approved this should be embarrassed.
3387,3,SW franchise just lost a generational fan,"The Last Jedi lost me as a generational fan (someone who has been there since opening night of New Hope). I won't do any spoilers, but I will say that I left the theater completely, thoroughly disappointed with TLJ. I'm not sure who Rian Johnson was trying to reach with his screen treatment, but it wasn't me or anyone else in the theater, which was packed, and stone silence from beginning to end."
3388,1,I wanted to like it...,I actually liked this movie the first time I watched it but have since changed my mind. The pointless dialog that takes up most of the movie the ridiculously bad lightsaber training and fight scene. Also lasers don't ark in space!!! And why are all the space ships so slow!!! This is a star wars movie not a world war 2 movie. Kylo is a terrible villain and his master was interesting but that got put to an end. Hopefully the next movie will be better but I will probably wait until it comes out on Blu Ray and just rent it. I've lost all hope in Disney's ability to make good Star Wars movies!
3389,1,An insult to the Star Wars saga,"Any kind of expectation I could have had for this movie was just destroyed. I'm sitting here two days after watching it, and still can't find the right words to describe it. Here is, divided in paragraphs relevant to different parts of the movie, what I think about it."
3390,5,A kid playing with toys.,That's what this movie amounted to.
3391,4,Not that great,"A lot of corny humor..Really Luke throws the lightsaber? Lol<br /><br />Whole middle of movie was pretty bad<br /><br />Could have been so much more but wasnt<br /><br />I remember after watching this movie the first time i was actually like kind of sad lol, felt like Star Wars was being ruined by Disney"
3392,1,Would have given it zero out of ten if I could.,"Horrible movie. The Force Awakens was promising, but very flawed. This was an abomination. This cant even be considered a sequel because it doesnt really move you to the next part of the story. The Force Awakens opened doors and The Last Jedi found a toilet to go through."
3393,1,a fart,"Recently got to see this movie, i'm not going to go in-depth there are way better reviews than mine on here, just look for the 1 stars and don't trust the praise."
3394,2,"The Last Jedi, or the end of ""Star Wars""?","Basically, Disney wants to get the attention from the old fans by recruiting most of the old cast into the team and that is totally fine before they are all wasted by the writer.<br /><br />Oh, so that's for the development of new characters? Let's make the checklist:<br /><br />1. The First Order.<br /><br />Snoke: An unexplained mystery character died of mystery/stupid reasons, stay unexplained.<br /><br />Kylo Ren: An angry brat throwing a tantrum.<br /><br />Phasma: Useless as always.<br /><br />Armitage Hux: another angry brat, but much powerless.<br /><br />2. The Resistance.<br /><br />The storyline of Finn: what the heck is this kindergarten-level cliche?<br /><br />The storyline of Rey: A few details about the truth of Kylo Ren were revealed. Nothing more about the true origin of Rey was foreshadowed, nor the connection between Rey and Kylo Ren."
3395,2,Intense Competition,"It is neck and neck, who will gain momentum, who will gain velocity... who will gain speed?????"
3396,1,Worst. Episode. Ever,It was terrible. I feel that it was the worst Disney ruined Star Wars
3397,1,Star Wars is dead,"They killed off and character assassinated Luke so they killed off Star Wars, plain and simple. Seriously...did the people making this movie have any idea what Star Wars was in the first place?..."
3398,1,bummer,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017, Rian Johnson)"
3399,2,"Well, I finally forced myself to watch it, cushion ready to hide my face...","Well, I finally forced myself to see it. A friend was throwing out some blu-rays, he pulled this one out, blaming his wife for buying it for him because he kept his AT- AT since he was a kid 35 years ago.<br /><br />I said, ""I dunno man. You know I like Star Wars and Empire...""<br /><br />He said, ""Don't worry, it's not quite convincing enough to penetrate your in-universe view"".<br /><br />""Well"", I thought, "" 'screw' it. I wanna see Hamill do his thing"" - with what he was given that I've heard and read about, lol. I like Mark Hamill.<br /><br />After watching the other movies, I put it on, sat down and realised I was frowning before pressing play. I was not looking forward to it, but I decided to wait and see..."
3400,1,Not as bad as I expected,"I dislike the director. I've seen his other films. I don't like them. He doesn't respect his characters. He doesn't respect the story. Anything can happen. And unhappen. Did that really happen? Oh, no. How funny. It didn't. Oh, no. How sad. It did. Wait. Oh, no. ... By and to anyone. For example, in one film, Mark Ruffalo seems to be dying, but then jumps up and does somersaults. But then maybe he really is dying. Because nearly dead people can jump up and do somersaults just to fool other people into thinking that they're really fine. So, maybe he isn't dying. We never really know. Although we see other characters and then (I think) we're supposed to think that maybe we do know. But we really don't. I mean, it's a movie after all. He really didn't die. He really wasn't near death. So, he really could do somersaults. Although it might have been a stunt double. ..."
3401,3,There must be bots rating this garbage,It's not a 1 only bc it spends more time on kylo and the action scenes near the end and at the end are visually appealing.
3402,1,"If only I could put one star........and this is why (briefly, I could have gone on)","As a film, judging separatly fromthe Star Wars saga it is horrific. The chase through space makes not a lick of sense. Half the film being irrelevant And leaders hiding plans for no apparent reason. So as a film by its self, this should just be film put on bbc at 2am just to fill a slot of air time, and even then I would change channel. "
3403,1,I've never left a review and created an account just for this.,"I would give this negative stars if I could. Everything about this sucks. None of the plot makes sense, the lines are soooo cheesy and Rian Johnson just made a movie however he wanted regardless of any history in the Star Wars universe. The writing even if it weren't a Star Wars movie is so bad that I would still give this one star. I love Star Wars so much and now I will not see Episode 9 in the theaters. I will not give anymore money for Disney to ruin one of the best movie franchises ever. Oh and the cool it with the SJW stuff. It's annoying af."
3404,1,Woman chauvinistic movie??,"The reason for it is:<br /><br />That all men are either evil, triggerhappy, greedy or total stupid.<br /><br />Whatever the men does, it ends up being the wrong one.<br /><br />Even Luke Skywalker's legacy, Rian Johnson succeeds to Ruin."
3405,2,Heartbroken.,"Let us all be brutally honest,"
3406,2,I left with a bad feeling..,"Part IV, V and VI all gave my the feeling, ""It'll be OK"". It was about Hope and the Return of the Jedi. Even The Empire strikes back ends with a sense of that ""It'll be OK""."
3407,1,jarjar binks is looking pritty good right about now,Episode 1-3 and jar jar binks is looking pritty good right about now. i would give it a solid 0 if i could. way to piss on everything disney
3408,1,Where's Jar Jar?,"This movie is so bad, you'll actually WANT Jar Jar Binks to show up."
3409,1,One of the worst movies of all time.,"The issue with this film is that the people behind every creative aspect of this movie obviously have no knowledge of Star Wars, and the lore that's been built up over the past few decades, It's not only an insult to the entire franchise, but an insult to film making, other than the amazing special effects, this movie falls short in pretty much everything it does, and it's not the actors fault, they did their best with the they were handed, the writing and narrative structure for this film is absolutely awful, it doesn't even build upon anything that was introduced in the force awakens, everything established in that film isn't progressed at all, you're reminded and made aware that stuff was established and set up for them to do something with, but then... nothing actually comes from it, yet some people are incredibly confused and have it in their heads that this film is some sort of masterpiece, how this film is being debated as either the worst or best Star Wars film is insane, I cannot think of one redeeming moment of this movie, from start to end it's a mess."
3410,1,I thought I was in the wrong movie,"Or at least I had hoped that I was watching the wrong movie, or it was a weird dream/nightmare."
3411,1,If I could rate a ZERO I would!,"As one of the Biggest "" Star Wars "" Fans on the Planet, I am Angry!!! I thought "" Force Awakens "" was a Disaster!!! After watching "" Last Jedi "", I truly wanted to Punch a Wall!!!<br /><br />Where do I start? First off, what's with the One Liners throughout? Not even funny. To Luke not using his force!!!! <br /><br />Gimme a Break! I wish they left it after Return of the Jedi. At least, then we can imagine how we want to about where the story continues. "
3412,3,"The SW universe is dead. At least, for those who care.","It is now written in stone. Star Wars is over. A vastly red herring movie cements the fact that the old Star Wars is over. Along with it over is the need for a structure, for a theme, for a point for the heroes to exist. "
3413,2,It's almost Star Trek Discovery bad!,The Phantom Menace = Star Wars film;<br /><br />Attack Of The Clones = Star Wars film;<br /><br />Revenge Of The Sith = Star Wars film;<br /><br />Rouge One = Star Wars film;<br /><br />A New Hope = Star Wars film;<br /><br />The Empire Strikes Back = Star Wars film;<br /><br />Return Of The Jedi = Star Wars film;<br /><br />The Force Awakens = Star Wars film;<br /><br />The Last Jedi = WTF?<br /><br />Tommy Wiseau would have made a better Star wars movie than this steming pile of horse dung!<br /><br />Old characters are unrecognizable by their actions and new characters are either bumbling fools or nowhere near a heroes quest. The magic is gone. Thanks Di$ney!<br /><br />This movie ends up being a middle finger to what star wars has been and what the fans wanted.<br /><br />When Luke threw his father's lightsaber over his shoulder I didn't know he was also throwing away every plot point from TFA over his shoulder also. Two years of waiting and Disney couldn't even answer the plot questions they created. As a life long fan this will be the last SW I watch in theaters.
3414,1,Disgrace,"This movie is a disgrace! That's it, game over! RIP SWU!"
3415,1,Exceptionally disappointing,"I never thought I'd wish for George Lucas to come back after his latter trilogy, but at least he had a clear vision on what he wanted to accomplish. Yes, mistakes were made, particularly in the Phantom Menace, but this is actually worse in a lot of ways."
3416,1,Dreadful,Terrible nonsensical movie filled with anti male themes. Ruins star wars
3417,1,"Even more than TFA, TLJ is rife with symptoms of a rotten, corrupt state project","It's biggest problems are extremely bad writing and bad acting.<br /><br />As for the writing the problems are:<br /><br />1. Insufferably bad humor<br /><br />2. Mind-numbing lack of any sense within the universe<br /><br />3. Bad use of screen time<br /><br />4. Addressing NONE of the story's mysteries<br /><br />5. Daily political messages<br /><br />6. Taking open sucking up to the ""boss"", Katelyn Kennedy into the story<br /><br />7. Shaking up the Star Wars universe with new concepts<br /><br />8. Fan service"
3418,3,Poor directing and writing,"Every thing comes down to the bad writing with pointless plots and overall pointlessly making a middle of a triology that does nothing to advance the plot of the series, what started as a new series with pep and life, fizzed and went nowhere. Add the terrible humor trying too hard to be like marvel made for a Star Wars lifer to cringe far to often. Now I wanted to love this movie and it wasn't as bad second viewing but it could have been so much more in the hands of a competent director"
3419,1,Stupid Stupid Stupid,After watching Episode VIII I can only conclude that the sole purpose of the film was to kill off all of the original characters in the most pointless ways possible.
3420,1,I feel ashamed for those who call it Star Wars,"I just wanted to get out of the cinema about half of the movie. Full of fails, like sometimes there is no gravity in the space, a whole First Order is incapable of destroying one X-wing, the story is... throws everything into trash that has been built up before. Rian Johnson, i don't want to hear this name in the future. Never ever."
3421,3,Another dismal failure!,"The only thing good in this film.........can""t think of anything. Did someone invent a Bot to give this movie a high rating?"
3422,1,Preposterous,"This is it. The movie I compare all other movies to. As in, man that movie was bad, not like as bad as the Last Jedi, but still really bad."
3423,2,A cinematic order 66,"I dont know where to start. Nearly 2 years have passed since I watched the last jedi. I still could not forget that horrible atmosphere and what haf happened that night. It was basicly a purposeful attempt to destroy what we love about star wars. It is an cinematic order 66 to one of the most beloved movie franchaise of all time. I think the writers of the script never watched any of the star wars movies unfortunately. A kid with anger issues, a pupper master without strings, a girl that beats a trained sith (or whatever) with the first time she takes a lightsaber in her hands. Meaningless jokes, rose, finn, poe... I was expecting way much more. An example of bad writing and poor acting. I am so sorry for my star wars."
3424,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever made.,Can't understand how this movie has a 7.2 star with so many negative reviews. I can't stand watching 5 minutes of this movie.
3425,2,This is not a Star Wars movie,"First of all, I applaud Disney for taking risks for once, but not with a saga episode and not taking it to this extreme. What happened to Kathleen Kennedy's promise to George Lucas? If this movie feels like it captures the soul of Star Wars, then you've slept through most of the original trilogy. I get what Rian Johnson was trying to do here, but not to the expense of previously well known and established characters like Luke and Leia. Underwhelming, disappointing and useless sequel to The Force Awakens. There, a new storyline was built and by the end of this movie we're in the same situation, minus some characters. The plot didn't advance; it's like the director made his solo take in the Star Wars universe in the middle of a trilogy. Daisy Ridley acts better here, compared to TFA, Carrie Fisher gives her second best performance in this universe, after The Empire Strikes Back, and Hamill brings his A game for this one. But in a story that doesn't understand its lore and previously established movies, nothing matters in the end. SW became SJW, with little care to a rich history and apparently only interested to please Di$$-ney and Kathleen's needs for diversity. This is not a Star Wars movie, doesn't have the heart (but it has more forced humor, thanks Disney) and doesn't capture what made this franchise a Force to be reckoned with. Truly ashamed as a fan."
3426,1,Pure dirt,Insult to mankind!
3427,1,Disappointed.,"This was not Luke, why would they change everything about him?"
3428,1,Terrible in every way.,"This movie isn't just bad, but it goes so far as to actively insult me that it exists. (and make note, I don't like the original Star Wars movies that much, so I'm not just an upset fanboy.)"
3429,1,"Too long, Too boring.","Too long, too boring. Where is the fun and excitement gone that was Star Wars? Completely understand that they want to take it in a different direction, but at least try and keep it interesting."
3430,2,Robot Chicken Star Wars,There were times in this movie where I honestly believed the scene in question would serve better as a skit in Robot Chicken Star Wars. There were other times when the movie became Harry Potter... new force spells galore.
3431,4,BORING!,I've never seen such a boring movie. Nothing happened. Unnecessary movie. Dont watch.
3432,2,They brought Star Wars back. Only to spit on its name.,"(Originally posted day after the movie's premiere, but removed by IMDB without reasoning or notification.)"
3433,4,last jedi,This film really split fans and i end up on dissapointed side last jedi has some really dumb scenes and unncecesery characters but it give me at leats some enterteinmant
3434,2,Such a huge waste!,"While I will not go into nitpicking the plot (and holes there-in) or spoiling the movie, as this has been done to death in other review (and rightly so)."
3435,1,"A SJW dream, snowflakes soy boys and lesbians will love it.","My heart is broke its like Kathleen Kennedy is trying to destroy my childhood with this crap! Utter rubbish, Luke is some old man loser, Princess Leia is flying though space oh how Carrie Fisher would be rolling in her grave to be remembered for this. They also drop bombs in space as in falling (Can somebody tell Rian Johnson their is no gravity in space objects cant fall you complete idiots!!! And of course them feminist hero proves the man wrong and feminism wins I can't believe Bob Igur ok'd this movie what the hell was he thinking. Everybody that contributed to this movie should be sacked for trying to destroy Star Wars. I will never go see another Star Wars movie EVER again unless George Lucas does it. And anybody that gives it a good rating has been bought off or doesn't understand the first thing about Star Wars or its legcy. Han Solo has flopped and all the next Star Wars movies will flop how can a company like Disney be happy losing money? STAY AWAY THIS IS NOT STAR WARS."
3436,3,Worse than Ghostbusters 2016,"Poe Dameron is by far the most irritating character in Star Wars lore. Force Awakens is good, in no small part because Poe is barely in it. Also, to fill out the character requirement, the Finn/Rose story went absolutely nowhere."
3437,1,It's bad,"The lightsaber fights alone make this movie bad, Rey never trains, it's just not a good movie<br /><br />There are very poorly written characters and they directors say that its because of the ""Man babies"", just because they don't want to own up to their mistakes<br /><br />Over all DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ITS NOT GOOD"
3438,1,Why?!,Why? Why? Why? What did we do to deserve this? This is just a up yours to the fans... Do not see this movie unless you like plot holes and disappointment
3439,1,My milkshake brings all the girls to the island.,"Firstly Luke...<br /><br />What an annoying whiney old wind bag, completely useless, void of any appeal, the great Luke Skywalker hero to many children was basically an empty vessel with nothing to add, no wisdom to impart, just empty filler to link the story, it was made very clear luke was not important and felt very much like they were sweeping the character under the carpet. "
3440,1,the worst star wars movie ever,"This is the worst star wars movie since the phantom menace,<br /><br />the storyline is boring and sluggish, finn and rose's story is just boring, the gambling planet is worse than jar jar, luke is a horrible character and rey's motivations seem so misplaced. The only good thing was that adam driver, playing kylo ren, is the best character in the movie, and the only fully flushed-out character in the entire movie. And they just wasted his chracter. Waste of time, dont watch, 1/10, and it doesnt even deserve that rating."
3441,1,absolute nonsense & lazy writing.,Contains spoilers
3442,1,What have you done George?,"Lets get this right straight off the bat, being a massive Star Wars fan right from childhood and still having all my original toys in the loft I was excited by Disney buying Star Wars as it would mean I steady supply of new star wars movies which hopefully built on the solid foundations of what George lucas did."
3443,1,Disney should stick to making cartoons...,"Star Wars isn't what it once was. It now feels more like a cartoon movie made for kids. <br /><br />There are elements in this movie which is clearly here to provide humor. The problem is that unless you're 4-5 years old, you won't find it funny. <br /><br />The plot is full of holes, and after watching this I'm left with the feeling that they had the chance to make a good star wars movie, but instead ruined it so much that for the first time I feel that perhaps it would be best if they don't make any more movies after this..."
3444,2,Worst Star Wars yet,"Let me put it this way. if u give me a choice between rewatching the last jedi or shoving a freakin lego X-wing down my peehole, i d be peeing legos for the next week straight"
3445,1,Troll and troll,RJ and KK are trolling the SW universe. Sad for the original story... SW it's over for me.
3446,3,just a below average with bad plot - (I'm a fan),"I am a big fan of Star Wars, just as reference I really enjoyed the force awakens, but this one if just not good<br /><br />Where the movie fails?<br /><br />* repeating lines from other Star Wars episodes but not at the right time, even making the moment feel in between awkward and silly<br /><br />* not preparing tension or building characters<br /><br />* it leaves the door open for a saga of unlimited episodes where it will repeat all over again<br /><br />* Luke Skywalker is not convincing, sorry, big fan but the acting there was not up to anything, maybe the plot was just lame?<br /><br />* porgs? these little creatures are a weird mix of puss in boots big eyes and chicken/rabbit but they can fly the falcon millennium! it´s cute and fun for little kids though, so if that was the intent ...<br /><br />* the plot or the story is boring, plain, it has some moments but that's it<br /><br />* couple really non sense scenes that won't spoil here<br /><br />Can someone write a good plot and save it?<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film, it was entertaining but not really good, overall the movie feels like a mix of couple episodes but bad mix and just leaving the doors open to do more of the same and to make more money - not cool"
3447,1,A truly awful film,"JJ Abrams' Episode VII lazily imitated the tropes of the original Star Wars trilogy while ignoring the conclusion of Return of the Jedi. Rian Johnson's Episode VIII goes one step further, actively violating and destroying the character of Luke Skywalker clearly depicted in the original trilogy. It is a smug, cynical, disrespectful, amoral, proudly ahistorical and assertively ignorant film."
3448,2,Fundamentally Different ...,"While production design was okay, do not let Disney fool you - Star Wars is no longer Lucas' fairy tale. It's Disney's cow. The story was choppy, leaving unfulfilled expectations from Force Awakens. Even when some story lines were tied, the result leaves a bad taste in your mouth, as in when Luke is reunited with his iconic light saber. As writer, Rian takes you on his ride (not Lucas') to new worlds, where the Rebellion is hopelessly outmatched. Yet, with very little Jedi training, Rey comes to their rescue, and defeats the odds. While the main title says Star Wars, and a few (very few) parts of the movie looks like Star Wars, it is not...Star Wars. Just like Disney wanted, Rian Johnson is an extreme director. His goal, to have half his audience liking his movies while the other half, despising it, and thus with TLJ, he has succeeded. Star Wars fandom is now split. Could this be Disney's calculating move to make room for their new SW universe? With messages in the movie like, ""let the past die...kill it if you have to,"" and, ""The Jedi are over,"" the writing is on the wall. Ironic: is not Disney in the business of making fairy tales? Or, now in the business of business decisions?"
3449,1,By far the worst Star Wars episode yet,"I was pretty disappointed with episode VII (too much fan service, rehash of episode IV and a universe that simply lacked depth and detail), but the latest installment is much, much worse. Not only are we given zero explanation to the tons of unanswered questions episode VII left us with (who is Snoke? Where did he come from and how did he affect Ben Solo? What is the Knights of Ren, WHERE are the friggin Knights of Ren??), but the movie is such a bore, filled with pointless new characters. Rose, DJ, Holdo (what's up with that purple hair?), ridicolous scenes with a casino, some giant space horses, repeated telepathic chats between Ren and Rey and a space chase that last the entirety of the movie. There is close to no plot, and the stuff about Luke - and what he has done - is highly unbelievable. The main characters Rey and especially Finn are such bores this time around, they have close to no personality. I really don't understand what Rian Johnson was trying to do - what an unbelievable mess!"
3450,5,Promise unrealised,"'The Last Jedi' received arguably the worst reviews of any 'Star Wars' movie, and I could start with a list of gripes: that in some of the early scenes, director Rian Johnson copies from the over-busy visual style that George Lucas adopted in the prequel films; that Rey is very uninteresting character (although Rose is more promising); that for much of the movie, the pace (which was perfectly judged in the original) is about 20% faster than it should be; or that star destroyers no longer glide menacingly across the screen but suddenly appear as if from a continuity error. On the other hand, Leia does glide, moving through space like a ghostly Superman while half-dead, the single dumbest thing I've seen in eight movies. Yet to list gripes is to miss the point, and not just because there are some good scenes as well (for example, the return of the AT-ACs may be fan service, but the aesthetics are undoubtedly good). The real thing of interest of this movie is that it sometimes feels that Lucas had one idea for a script and the franchise has been mining it out ever since, cumulating in film seven which was more entertaining than Lucas's last efforts, but so devoid of originality it felt like little more than a pale copy of 'A New Hope'. 'The Last Jedi', by contrast, contains enough ideas for a franchise by itself; but they're variously confused, rushed, or under-developed, as the film pushes them all on us at once. Introduced with more discretion and control, what we see could have sustained the future of the series; but nothing is treated with sufficient weight to ever feel that it is going to be asked to carry the thrust of future films. As we now know, Disney switched director for the next film, played that one in a more traditional direction, and killed the franchise. I still love the first movie best. But 'The Last Jedi' hints at where the sequels could have gone, even if it doesn't ultimately deliver on its own ambitions."
3451,1,"A disgrace, a shame, a regret, an offence to the fans","It's so painful to see now that any Disney-hired idiot will write a mediocre script just stupid enough to take people to the theaters and boost the box office and unfortunately justify a big budget to the detriment of viewers who really care about the Star Wars universe. This movie is a shame, an utter and absolute disregard for what the fans think or have learned to appreciate ever since the first movie came out. I feel so disappointed that I will never watch a new Star Wars movie again. It's a sad reality, movies have no substance, no meaning anymore, so why bother? There is no hope, the same is happening to Star Trek. I wish there could be something for us to do beyond a full boycot to Disney crap but that's it. I just signed up here to make sure I manifest my discontent here on IMDB but I can see this 7.5 stars are absolutely artificial. It's a disgrace guys, given the box office on this truckload of crap movie there will be sequels. Expect more of the worst."
3452,3,Could have been decent,So i finally saw this movie and it is very uneven. There are plenty of nice scenes and set pieces but it just can't escape that the script is embarrassingly bad.
3453,1,in my opinion it is totally expendable.,"There were people who liked it, but in my opinion it's just another cliché, typical disney movie, with a poor and appealing storyline, not to mention the heroic couple with no chemistry or nexus. i left the movie sorry for not having spent the money on the movie with a snack."
3454,5,"The Last Jedi: nothing new, nothing improved","Once again the powerful but generally incompetent First Order threatens galactic peace. A couple of super-weapons are trotted out (an excellent ""Dreadnaught"" class starship and a death-star-based battering ram), which either don't manage to fire in time or are somewhat uneventful when they do fire. Legendary Jedi Luke Skywalker is found and sincere attempts are made to recruit him to rejoin the rebellion against the First Order (as personified by Darth Vader wannabee Kylo Ren (nee Ben Solo; Adam Driver)). After many heroic adventures and 'surprise twists', the rebellion lives on for another sequel. Weakly plotted and poorly written, The Last Jedi is an insipid entry into the third generation of the Star Wars franchise. Writer/director Rian Johnson succumbs to the lazy trick of allowing the ""Force"" to do whatever would be convenient for the plot (surprise!: Force-endowed people are able survive (and fly around in) the cold vacuum of space without any protection), or indiscriminately tossing in new technologies (e.g. Rebel cruisers conveniently have shields that seem to be lacking in the Imperial fleet (or any other ship in the Star Wars universe to date)). The latter example is particularly egregious as it allows for the tedious, O.J.-like slow-chase of Leia's ship while uninteresting secondary characters take a side trip to a casino planet (a ridiculous and unnecessary sub-plot, even by Jar Jar Binks standards). <br /><br />""The Last Jedi"" contains no shortage of plot holes and silly cartoon physics that IMDB reviewers (many especially unkind) have pointed out but to me the most glaring is the pointless death of gruff-but-lovable purple haired Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). She heroically elects to stay on the doomed cruiser as, she maintains, someone needs to fly the thing to fool their pursuers. Flying a star cruiser seems to mostly involve looking out the window, mostly, and when flying is unexpectedly required, the trailing First Order captain assumes that the ship is under computer control anyway. The scene that follows is spectacular to watch but only goes to prove that the training the First Order Space Navy is as lacking as was that of the old Imperial Storm Troopers. <br /><br />In addition to the weak story, most of the new generation of characters are simple, predictable 2D cut-outs that I (and others I suspect) care not as to whether they live or die (truth be told, I was quite disappointed to see Rose in the infirmary, having really hoped that she'd given her life for the rebellion). <br /><br />In summary: similar to a lot of recent CGI-based blockbusters, ""The Last Jedi"" is a slackly-plotted spectacular: a second-rate movie encased in first-rate visuals. Whether the current crop of Disney Star Wars films will squander the legacy of the now 40-year old original or transfer the magic to a new generation is yet to be seen. I'd bet on the former, but as my generation of fans is an aging breed who (I assume) no longer buy a lot of SW branded stuff, I doubt that the imperial 'House of the Mouse' much cares what I think."
3455,1,I can't believe this was released.,"Rogue One had the grittiness, darker tones, and suitable humor you would expect in Star Wars. TFA was well paced and did the job to set the stage for new characters and a new trilogy. The OT lore that has survived for decades is all of a sudden a bunch of jokes."
3456,1,A movie that written and directed by Jar Jar,A wonderful world Rian Johnson killed it with one move and I have no Idea how they left him to do that in a world that gives me a dreamy beautiful peacful world I lived with it since I was 6 years old.<br /><br />and again I have no Idea how this still rated 7.. I guess disney took the money that payed for Johnson to pay for people to sit down infront of screens to write and rate good reviews.
3457,2,Waste of a great story - Thanks Disney,Its just sad to see the greatest story on Big Screen ripped apart by Disney and Co.
3458,3,Gutted,"Had real hopes going into this film but what a mess. The tone of the film is set out in the first five minutes where you're led to believe you are watching Spaceballs II and comedy is forcibly fed into every scene. A storyline that makes no sense added to some average acting and at points some really poor looking CGI left me jaw dropped for all the wrong reasons. I've no idea where they will go from here but frankly at the moment, I couldn't care less."
3459,1,DNF!! (Did not finish),"Wth! Had to end this torture after 30min. Do over and do it right! But maybe change the script, director and everyone else except actors since you cant change them..though perhaps shorten Mark's parts to a one-line part."
3460,1,Awfull,"Its bad from the first 10 min the credits<br /><br />Seems like a film for a 10 year old stupid yokes,stupid story"
3461,1,unfaithful,"Lucas founded this. and designed the buildings, outfit, chracters, storyline in necessary and flawless detail. which are known to the world for decades.<br /><br />yet still as if there are no books, movies, interviews Disney tkaes the tile ""Star Wars"" and does completely different movie.<br /><br />Star Wars by definition is a Sci-Fi Fantasy<br /><br />Now;<br /><br />Sci-fi means that forces the limits of knowledge<br /><br />Fantasy means that forces the limits of senses<br /><br />For Disney;<br /><br />fantasy means rubbish and sci-fi means fantasy<br /><br />This movie breaks the hearts of billions, who loyally beared Star Wars through decades and supported the merchandise"
3462,1,Unique film,"I have seen many films in my life. Some are boring (so I start to doze off in the cinema). Some are predictable but still perfectly good fun to watch. Some movies turned out to beyond my highest expectations.<br /><br />The first time I went to a cinema was when my dad took me and my nine year old brother to see a re-run of star wars and empire strikes back (double bill). I had never been so excited after seeing these films. Everything about theses films just blew my ten year old mind. The story, the music, the special effects, I was totally wrapped up on the whole Star Wars universe it was one of the truly magical magical memories I have from my childhood. I remember that day well because it had such a big impact on me.<br /><br />Fast forward 35 years the the latest Star Wars installmet 'Last Jedi' is the closest I've come to walking out of a cinema in my life. There have seen many bad films including just about all of the Lucas prequel trilogy, the phantom menace and what not. Those films were not good but they were watchable. The force awakens was not bad at all and it purported to set up this trilogy nicely. The problem is the last Jedi was not only boring, full of plot holes with a rubbish script, and (lets be honest) mostly rubbish acting. All theses things are manageable and even forgivable. What made this movie so bad was that I found it offensive. I am not asking for the film maker to make me feel ten years old again, I only want an honest attempt at the next episode.<br /><br />It felt like Disney, Rian Johnson, Abrams, and everyone else involved was having a joke at my expense. I felt humiliated. I'm can accept being bored or watching a flawed movie if its an honest attempt. The Lucas prequels were poor but they were his attempt to tell a story. The last Jedi felt like it was dishonest from the start: I felt like I had paid money to see not just a bad attempt but the deliberate destruction of a beloved franchise I have followed most of my life.<br /><br />I won't watch start wars again. The original Star Wars trilogy is good enough for me, I'll settle for that."
3463,1,It was epicly bad in the most spectacular way!,"I loved this movie! Bad movies bring me great joy and this one beat all other bad movies I have ever seen. I didn't understand the point or plot, but that is ok. My favorite charactor is ""saved for dinner later"" (the little chichen rat the Chewbacca brought along near the end. He was great."
3464,1,This movie is trash,Rian Johnson ruined star wars. Nothing gets me more heated than this garbage fire. I hate this film. No who wrote this knows what star wars even is.
3465,2,Meh!,"All the bad reviews were creepy, so I checked a bunch and to my disbelief so many came from users registered only recently and only reviewing this one film. That made me believe it's a smear campaign. But smear was it not!"
3466,1,Its so Bad I literally Vomitted.,This movie exists that means there is no HOPE.
3467,1,Episode I is a masterpiece next to this,"Well, let's get this over with. Here's the plot:"
3468,2,"Burn the past, it's time for this trilogy to end...","Plot twists turned to plot anarchy. Ryan Johnson effectively throws out Chekov's gun principle in favor of the much more dictatorial ""all that matters is what the writer thinks matters in this exact instant; it might be forgotten or brushed off 20 minutes from now""."
3469,1,GARBAGE,Garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage
3470,4,Movie that confuses poking you in the eye with a stick with being clever.,"Competent, yet having serious pacing issues. Contradicting setting it takes place in and adding tons of plot holes. Seems to be written by someone who doesn't care about the source material. Extremely edgy tone.<br /><br />Main issue is how pointless all of the story seems, how tone deaf the movie constantly behaves and that it can't fit into the Saga it is trying to be a part of - seems like a pretentious alternative take on the universe, written by a drunk."
3471,2,Oh dear,"I'm not a star wars fan, they're ok, just not something that I go mad for. However, I have total sympathy for the crazy fans out there. Embarrassing."
3472,1,Star Wars is dead,"If I could have rated this abomination with 0 star, I would have! This ""movie"" is a disgrace. An insult to the saga and to the fans. Rian Johnson directed it like a spoiled brat, with no respect whatsoever to the source material. The movie destroys everything that has been accomplished so far, even in the movie 7! "
3473,1,I cried at the the end of this sorry excuse for a movie...,"Let me start by saying I'm not all that into the Star Wars universe. However, I absolutely adore the original trilogy. Not for its space battles. Not for its sword fights. But for its wonderfully painted intra- and interpersonal stories..."
3474,4,If only Lucas could return,"I don't feel like writing an essay on all of this movie's shortcomings, but the only thing I can say wholeheartedly is that whoever was at the helm of this project didn't understand Star Wars at the fundamental level. Disney simply can't make a decent STAR WARS movie to save their lives (Gareth Edward's spin off Rogue One aside), the main characters are almost all devoid of conviction."
3475,3,Possibly second worst ever SW film,"Only a little better than Attack of the clones.<br /><br />I'm So disappointed so far on this new trilogy, I hope they could work on a good sendoff for Episode 9."
3476,3,They ruined this movie sadly,Pros<br /><br />Awesome music<br /><br />Splendid environments that looks beautiful<br /><br />Very good effects<br /><br />Kylo is a better villain than in the TFA with much more development
3477,1,Absolute Rubbish,"Rian Johnson should never be let near a Star Wars film again. 40 years of escapism, dreams and dedication flushed away in two hours of the most banal, cut and paste, pc drivel ever committed to film."
3478,3,I'm just adding a comment to get it off my chest.,"I'm not even a die hard Star Wars fan, but as many others have already pointed out - this film is badly flawed in many, many ways. I'll just mention the beginning of the film:"
3479,3,Star Wars almost mistic atmosphere is done.,"This girl felt off a tree and raised as a jedi. For a true star wars fan this is a spit in the face. Even Darth Vader one of the most powerful force sensitives needed years of training. This chik just took a force pill right after she's birth control medication and here she goes. Mr. Disney sir, if you are drunk, please go home. We had enough. As bad as the other character, Kylo Ren, who's acting like a 12 years old with psychotic episodes."
3480,1,This movie is the worst SW ever made by far,"I just watched Rise of Skywalker. It is clear that they couldn't salvage, in episode 9, the absolutely awful decisions made in this movie."
3481,3,hateful feminist propoganda,"While i went in the theater without any background info, and expecting to have a fun time, i got annoyed probably first minutes allready: totally ridiculous scene with some attempt to humor, after some special effects but nothing that can really capture the feeling of ""magic fairytale (in space)"" that the first movies had."
3482,5,What a waste :(,"It's unfortunate, but we had high hopes for this movie and just truly failed. No storyline no depth of character no plot of any kind. It doesn't resemble any Star Wars that anyone was expecting. Please, please, please allow the last want to have some kind of character and plot we can all sink teeth into!"
3483,1,Garbage,"I don't have enough time in my day to go over everything wrong with this movie. The biggest issue was clearly that the writers picked characters at random and said:<br /><br />""Guess what? This character can do this now!""<br /><br />""But they couldn't do that in the 7 movies that came before this one...""<br /><br />""Well f**k it! They can do it now!"""
3484,1,Twilight Wars: Subverting Expectations,"I was keeping a running tally of the number of cringeworthy moments in this film, but I lost count at 12. There was still an hour of film left."
3485,1,Deleting reviews to keep this above 7,"They are deleting reviews, because this movie is only a political statement and nothing more it's garbage and unwatchable."
3486,1,Disappointed,"I get the tight rope anyone embarking on rekindling and continuing a franchise must endure. Too much of the same, and people call it lazy. Too different and people call it out of place.<br /><br />As a movie, I was disappointed that Rian tried to do both...change everything while trying to make everything the same. He failed at doing either well, somehow pandering and veering from the path that had been set for years.<br /><br />Yes, had he tried to redo Empire or Return of the Jedi, it would have been to obvious but man, changing things just to tell the loyalist 'ha, fooled you, the plot lines you thought you knew I've made into parody"" seem more cruel than original. <br /><br />Twists are exciting when built up or around a central, undefinable theme, but to dislodge from the linneae course of characters, subplots and themes because he thought it would be funny (many examples of this throughout the movie) wasn't innovative or creative, just misplaced and awkward.<br /><br />I was excited to share this new Star Wars saga with my kids, and now, it's lost it's luster. <br /><br />Hopefully, Hollywood will see the great potential the storyline could've had and redo this soon and try to stop the titanic from sinking, although, at this point, Disney is focused on $ and nothing else, so no one would have the strength to say, ""nope, that's not what anyone wants, let's fix this."" Maybe George Lucas could come in and buy the franchise back, or at least the original plot and give it to someone else that doesn't want to spat in the face of the fans that have been following the franchise for a while, but further their love for it by making it whole again.<br /><br />Wishful thinking, I know. All these movies and characters simply washed away in 3 hours...just a real shame."
3487,1,My Childhood Died today,"Confused, devastated, sick inside. What happened? Loved TFA, and Rogue! How did Rian get this so so so wrong???? My childhood died with Luke. While Mark Hamill played the part he was asked to play so masterfully, how Luke was written in this movie, was a total let down to his legacy. Shame on you Rian! You can claim to be an old school fan all you want! But you just proved to be a very bad film maker! And Disney, selling us down the river for Merchandise and profits? You need to take a long hard look in the Mirror Kathleen Kennedy and never do this to the fans again! NEVER!"
3488,1,I'd Call it Garbage but....,".....That would be a horrible insult to trash. Offensive on so many levels that I don't even know where to begin. I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan but I can see why everyone is so outraged at this movie. Luke didn't seem at all like Luke. What a depressing way to end his character. The ""jokes"" if you can even call them that, start right out of the gates and are beyond cringe-worthy. The cinematography is good and there are some cool scenes but they don't even come close to saving the horrendous story-line. Nothing could have. Can't understand how this ever got green lit. And with Rian Johnson who doesn't exactly have an extensive back catalog to prop up his terrible ideas on. What on earth were they thinking with this??? And the way they responded to criticism was so childish and disgusting that I will NEVER buy another ticket to a Star Wars flick. #boycottepisode9"
3489,2,Worst SW fiction made,"From Poe's humor to the Mary poppins in space to drinking alien walrus milk to the most heroic never quit do-whatever-it-takes character quitting because ""feelings"" this is a farce<br /><br />The MFTV ""Caravan of courage"" and ""Battle for Endor"" not to mention Holiday special are better Star Wars than this. Honestly I'd rather watch Superman IV quest for peace, Batman and Robin, garbage pale kids and Howard the Duck back to back everyday for a year than watch this trash of a Star Wars movie one more time"
3490,1,Wow...,What do you get with hundreds of millions of dollars and a no-talent director? This movie.
3491,2,Star Trek V used to be the biggest heartache....until now.,"When I came out of the theater, it was as if I were in one of those nightmares....you know the ones, when you see a horrible version of Star Wars concocted by your sub-conscience in deep REM sleep....The ones filled with Ewok Puppets and smurfs....that cause you to wake up screaming in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat. You know what I'm talking about. Well, this pile of dung was not far from that. I feel as if someone sucker-punched me in the gut, and I am still reeling. Mr. Rian, What happened? No really...I don't get it...Did you just write this as you were filming? Was there a cohesive plot in mind before you began filming? Why did Luke want the Jedi to End? Why was Yoda complicit in his despondent attitude? There seems to be a story with allegory centered around FAILURE. Well, congratulations, The theme of failure has culminated in a film that is most certainly a failure. "
3492,4,It's a mess,"I think this film has a lot of good stuff in it and in terms of character development it's good, especially for the main character Rey who I found very dull in the last movie, they really flesh her out here and especially her relationship with Kylo Ren. However overall the movie is really messy. The plots all over the place, Rose and Finn's storyline is just trash, Poe and Hillary Clinton's also took me out of the film a lot with just some really poor writing (Poe should have been court martialed and executed), and the last 30 minutes of this film are terrible. One of the most annoying parts of this film however is how many times it subverts your expectation's and promises to go in an interesting direction but does absolutely nothing interesting with it and the result is a film where it really feels like nothing much has happened and the rebellion ends at pretty much the same point it started. And this film in not a leftist film or a piece of mainstream anti-capitalism stop saying that you sound like an idiot."
3493,2,Terrible. Absolutely terrible.,"Saw it opening weekend going in with zero expectations and walking out of theater at that time I would have given it a 5 out of 10. Rewatching it on Netflix over the weekend made me realize how deeply flawed it is and made me reevaluate my rating. The humor is misplaced and hacky. The whole vibe is wrong for most of the movie. Just when you think it feels like a Star Wars movie, the movie derails and goes off in a different horrible direction. Aside from a few examples, most of the characters are awful and you don't care what happens to them. Kelly Marie Tran is simply awful. She can't act. She has terrible dialogue. Her character is annoying. Her story arc is pointless. What they did to Luke is unforgivable. I totally agree with Mark Hamill's anger at the direction Rian Johnson took with Luke. He would never abandon the force. He wouldn't just toss a lightsaber over his shoulder. He would act like such an immense pr*ck. What were they thinking when they made this garbage!?"
3494,1,Trashed old characters for no reasons,"Luke barely got any screen time, and the screen time he got was used to depict him as a complete coward and idiot baby man. He was reportedly to ""train"" Rey in this, but barely even does that. Rey gets no development, either, but still manages to become more powerful than any Jedi we've seen yet. For children!"
3495,3,Star Wars - In space nobody can hear you fly,They didn't even try this time.
3496,1,"Overcomplicated twaddle, its why the 'critics'love it.","1. I was 13 when I saw the first Star Wars film (it was called Star Wars).<br /><br />2. I have watched all of them, latterly with my 3 sons, and have always looked forward to the next as there was something for all of us.<br /><br />3. I struggled with this one, it seemed too contrived and intent on putting up a fence between the old and new audience. And I just didn't get the middle bit at the casino.<br /><br />4. The new wave of characters need to get over themselves. I find them all grating in varying degrees.<br /><br />5. I couldn't care less if there is another one and will look forward to the spinoffs of Han Solo and Obi Wan."
3497,1,Easily the worst Star Wars film since the dreaded prequels!,"While many Star Wars films enjoyed The Force Awakens, and thought it was a proper course correction, The Last Jedi is a serious step backwards for the saga ever since it has been taken over by the greedy bosses of Disney."
3498,2,Why,"Again, why? Was this movie really necessary? Was this trilogy even worth it?"
3499,1,Worst start war movie ever,"Yes, its way worst than the clone wars."
3500,1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Nothing more to say, it's just all wrong with this movie... the plot, the acting, even the battles sequences are boring as hell. I want my time back (actually I want the old Star Wars style)"
3501,5,Make them better,"With such an amazing universe to work with, I wish they'd get these movies correct."
3502,2,Adults Need To Stop Watching This Nonsense,"My issue with this film is not that the girl is fat or that there is an interracial romance in it. This is 2019 and those things are fine and indeed have always been fine. The director may be a hardcore Christian, a belief system that to me is hateful and dated, but it is not for me to tell him what he should or should not do.<br /><br />The reviews objecting to those elements are shameful."
3503,1,"Dull Movie !, Boring, Lame Fight Scene",This is by far the worst star wars movie. Dont waste your time and money
3504,1,A haters view,"Soundtrack, Graphics are awesome. Plot is kinda alright. Character deployment and how things turn out in the end is bad. Some things destory the whole Star Wars logic. This movie is after all 1/10 to me. I'm not a hater but things are clear. If you destory a whole franchise with bad logic you get the reward. I've watched 7... I've watched 8.. I will nkt watch 9<br /><br />Star Wars is DEAD. Don't buy anything from them make them feel. Don't support it. You destroied a childhood!"
3505,1,:(,I tried to watch this again but its just rubbish. I remember sitting in the movies thinking wtf to myself thought id watch again see if was just that day or if could watch again look at from a different perspective..... just cant do it to myself.... and i dont even like myself
3506,3,It's the worst of the bunch,I'm a fan but this is trash. I loved almost all of the recent ones and I couldn't care less about this one. I can't remember any of it and don't even care. I just left the theater and don't remember how it ended. Don't expect anything from this so you won't be disappointed. It's just lame af.
3507,2,Star Wars: The Sitcom,"What exactly was the aim of this movie? I will never know. It seemed like a fan-made (quite expensively I might add) attempt to make a humorous Star Wars film, uploaded to YouTube on a Monday. I actually started to appreciate it, looking at it from that perspective."
3508,1,Will never pay for another Star Wars movie,Enough is enough.<br /><br />Will never buy anything from Disney too.
3509,2,This film is to Star Wars what Airplane! was to disaster movies,"Quite simply put...it is a spoof, a parody."
3510,1,So many needless deaths and defeats,"I thought this film was shockingly executed. Whilst I appreciated the diverse characters, I was truly appalled that Rose was killed as she was my favourite character and I thought she had so much potential. Why can't all films not just be happy and cheerful and not have so many tragic deaths that cause people to cry and have heart attacks? That was the problem with this film it had so many tragic deaths in it and when Rose died I burst into tears at the cinema and nearly had a heart attack. The special effects for this film is brilliant but I was crying when the best special effects was on so I couldn't appreciate it. The lack of tolerance and the enthusiasm for war that all the characters displayed disgusted me and made me sick. I was also disgusted that Rey lost to Kylo Ren, especially in front of all the children and women at the cinema and watching the film elsewhere. My other major criticism was that Holdo, Rose and Rey should've got far more screentime and I think Luke and Han Solo had too much screentime."
3511,2,Terrible experience,"In the middle of the movie, I was seriously contemplating to leave the cinema."
3512,2,2 stars for sound and vision,This franchise is dead. 2 stars for sound and vision.
3513,1,A Minute of Silence for All Those Disney Interns...,...who had to create numerous accounts to upvote this piece of garbage.
3514,1,Disappointing,"Other than the paid critics, who liked this movie? So disappointing and a complete waste of my time and money. Rian Johnson should be fired from Disney. Well done Rian, I didn't think it was possible but you made a film worse than Star Wars Episode 1."
3515,1,"A spit in your face, by Rian Johnson","The last jedi is a movie which in no ways resembles the masterpieces that came before it. J.J. Abrams attempted to create a whole lot of mystery, story and character development with the film prior to The last jedi but Rian Johnson decided to throw away everything J.J had built, blatantly rip off, shot for shot, other movies and call it ""subverting expectations."" Rian disregards all fact and lore that might enrichen the plot and just makes up rubish as he goes. We the fans should take a page from Rian's book and disregard the film as a Star Wars movie all together."
3516,1,Shame,"Shame on Rian Johnson, who still thinks Star Wars is now his own little art project. It's not. And if you want to create something new, something bold in a 40 year old franchise, than respect how the universe works and why the franchise is loved by millions. Don't try to change everything in order to make your weak plot work. Shame on you Sir, you should face that you ruined the amazing chance of making Star Wars great again. Didn't even try. You should give that huge opportunity of making another trilogy to someone who's capable of good storytelling and loves Star Wars."
3517,3,How did it even get good review's?,Its obvious critics are getting paid for their reviews and how could this win awards without someone getting paid off? This movie was absolute trash and they ruined star wars.
3518,1,This next Star Wars installment should be a The Last Jedi reboot.,"I've loved this franchise nearly my entire life. I am 43 and saw A New Hope in the theater at 3 years old and freaked. I saw the prequels as a young adult and although my reception of them at the time was average, I've eventually grown fond of them. I took my teenage son to The Force Awakens midnight release screening, loved it and of course have been looking forward to this film continuing that journey."
3519,3,Is this a comedy?,"I had high hopes for The Last Jedi but they were short lived.....Just like The Force Awakens this shares many things with The Empire Strikes Back......Unfortunately unlike The Empire Strikes Back this is more of a Comedy than an action flick.....I am still trying to ""explain"" the first 20 minutes of the movie in my head.....Where to start, from the X-Wing going against the Dreadnought alone (when there are obviously more fighters in the fleet) and the entire ""joke"" on the Admiral or the one X-Wing against like 20 T-Fighters and canons on the dreadnought and that none of the other Star Destroyers provided cover against the incoming bombers? And don't let me get started on the hole ""kicking"" the rail so the trigger device drops and suddently from facing upwards that girl conveniently faces downwards so that she can grab it? And lets not forget Luke throwing away his light saber like if it was a rock.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is not much better either. I guess Disney aims to make Star Wars for 10 year olds but that means they are losing us fans in the process which is sad to say the least."
3520,1,I tried to like it...,"So I saw this in the cinema and felt really weird afterwards. Saw all the hate that people were giving out and thought OK there is something really wrong with this film, and not my current mood."
3521,1,So sad ...,"To see such a brilliant and glorious legacy that changed the world suck with such sad plots and poor directing. JJ did a great job with Trek and a very poor one with SW. Everything is great except the plot that is sad, copied, and wasted the presence of the original actors. Shame on Mrs Kennedy that allowed something like this to happen"
3522,1,Edgy Script,"Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is mired with script 101 mistakes. The director screams avant garde, but the film falls flat with fans and dissipates with a sizzle."
3523,4,Glad I Didn't Spend Money in a Theatre,"I'm being generous with 4 Stars and that's pretty much for the scenery in Ireland, special effects, and soundtrack. Acting was bad. Story was disjointed. Glad I waited to see it as a rental. Worth the $3 Blu-ray rental but wouldn't have been worth a $10+ Theatre ticket cost."
3524,2,This is not going to go like you think,"This movie didn't answer any questions from The Force Awakens. The Force Awakens ends with a literal cliffhanger and this movie throws out what could of been a good movie and just does everything the opposite. Some of the scenery and special effects were good, which is why I gave it two stars. Everything else was just pure nonsense and doesn't even lead to an exciting next movie."
3525,3,Not a 'toxic fanboy' bUT..,What a mess... Rian Johnson took a whopping huge shet right here.
3526,5,Disney you need to try harder!,"I read some reviews on internet, and some experts reviews too. I disagree with them at some points.<br /><br />I know the director want to break an old wall from all the Star Wars movies stories, but this is too much.<br /><br />I hate how they killed Snoke so poorly and not interesting. The movie needs a true villain. Snoke is the only true villain in the movie until he was killed by his disciple. He's not so stupid that he did not pay attention to the light saber moving right beside him.<br /><br />I hate how they destroy the Power of the Force by showing the ""magic"" in front of everyone in the theatre. The Force is so meaningful to Star Wars. It's powerful but not weird like that. I'm telling about Princess Leia scene. :(<br /><br />And more weird scenes I can't say details here, like when Rey and Kylo contact to each other. Those scenes are weird somehow.<br /><br />Some ""funny"" scenes are not funny at all.<br /><br />Anyway, I still give my respect to all the people who making the movie. They spended a lot of time and money for making this. Sadly, it's not a perfect movie to me. Sorry.<br /><br />My favourite character in the movie is Rose. Her acting is quitely good."
3527,1,What if they made a bad starwars film?

3528,3,so much political correctness,"I didnt expect much of this movie, but I was already alarmed because of the feminism in the last movie. After about 20 minutes of watching it I was already sure, feminismus is continuing here. The biggest joke was the vice admiral on the ship of the rebels. When Admiral Leia (we re noticing, a woman is a general, haha) passed, and they introduced the successor, I was already laughing and saying to myself, it has to be a woman. But there came a surprise to me...even more feminism by presenting a very ugly woman with short and violett hair and of course no spirit, nothing, just boring "" I get his job, because I am a woman"". There were more examples of it, but I dont want to loose my life time because if this."
3529,2,Heartbroken,"Ever since I was a small child, I was fascinated with Star Wars. I vividly remember the first time I saw the movies in the cinema when they got a rerun in 1997. I was and still am in love with Star Wars. I grew up with it, watched everything, read the books, played the games and collected the toys. To me, Star Wars is more than just a movie it is my Childhood and still a very important part of my life.<br /><br />When I first heard the announcement that Disney bought the rights to Star Wars and more movies were on the way, I was excited for new possibilities. The Force Awakens, despite its flaws and similarities felt like a Star Wars movie and played homage to the older movies. J.J. Abrams managed to create a successful entry point to a new trilogy with likeable and complex characters, charm and wit. It was the start of something great, the necessary similarities set the boundaries for a successful continuation. <br /><br />The first part in the trilogy left me wondering what would happen next, who are Rey's parents, how could Supreme Leader Snoke seize power. I was excited for the future. Fast forward to the current day, I have seen the movie twice now and I am heartbroken and confused as to how it could go so wrong. <br /><br />The movie starts with a dire situation for the Resistance their ships have been found and are faced with superior numbers from the First Order. The foolish but likeable character Poe Dameron faces off with a Dreadnought to gain enough time for the Resistance to escape. This already starts off one of my major gripes about this movie. The dialogues and the forced slapstick humor just does not fit the grandeur of this movie. The conversation between General Hux and Poe is laughable, but not in a good way. The joke at the expense of Hux discounts the seriousness of the situation and this slapstick runs like a common thread throughout the movie. The Last Jedi resembles other Disney projects such as the Marvel Franchise in this regard; every action has to be commentated with a joke, because of fear that the viewers could lose interest in the subpar storylines. <br /><br />While the battle is developing, the Resistance manages to attack the Dreadnought with their Bomber Squadron and destroying it in the process. Unfortunately, nobody told Director Rian Johnson, that Bombs should be floating in space, but gravity is ignored in this instance.<br /><br />In the subsequent battle, Kylo Ren and two Tie-Fighters destroy the bridge of the main Battleship of the Resistance. The whole leadership of the Resistance, including Admiral Ackbar, is wiped out, except for Leia that is hovering in through space in zero gravity. Leia then escapes death by using the force to fly through space with her best Mary Poppins imitation to get back to the Battleship, in what can only be described as the most unreasonable and unrealistic moment of the whole franchise. While she has shown that she is force sensitive in the past, this felt like a cheap and unnecessary way to advance the plot. It also doesn't have any influence on the advancement of the overall plot whether she lives or dies, but would have been a good opportunity to send of the late Carrie Fisher.<br /><br />In a plan to escape from the grasp of the First Order, Finn and Rose Tico, a crewmember of the Resistance, set forth on a journey to the planet Canto Bight in order to search for a code cracker that will insure the Resistance a safe escape. The whole scene felt more like it descended from the Harry Potter franchise than Star Wars, gone are familiar alien races and they get replaced by money loving caricatures of society. The whole Plot felt like it tried to lecture the audience and Finn and Rose had no on screen chemistry. This part could have been cut from the movie and would have made it a stronger movie overall.<br /><br />At the same time, Rey finally meets Luke Skywalker on the Island, where the first Jedi once lived. We get to know more about the reasons why Luke decided to live on this desolate island. This storyline overall felt authentic, but has one glaring issue that goes against everything the Star Wars franchise stands for, the creation of Kylo Ren at the hands of Luke Skywalker. Fearing the imminent turn to the dark side of Ben Solo, Luke raises his Lightsaber to strike down a sleeping Kylo Ren. Luke Skywalker, the most powerful Jedi that brought balance to the force, gives up hope to kill the Son of his best friend Han Solo and Leia Organa, his own sister, despite infringing on the very principle that defines a Jedi. This is an unreasonable character trait that does not fit the Luke Skywalker that everyone grew to love from the original trilogy. This part of the story had the same weaknesses that plagued the rest of the movie; important scenes were ruined with slapstick humor that was not fitting the tone of the situation. <br /><br />Later on, Rey confronts Snoke and Kylo Ren on their main Ship and ensuing scenes are very well orchestrated. Still, Supreme Leader Snoke feels like a missed opportunity. We do not get to know how Snoke obtained his position or even who he really is. He is depicted as an almost almighty deity that feels untouchable, but his hubris is ultimately his downfall. The Choreography and visual effects are top notch and the movie starts to drastically pick up from the moment Rey steps food on the First Order Ship.<br /><br />Finn and Roses plan to save the Resistance fails, but BB8, that seems like an unstoppable killing machine in this movie, safes them once more whilst controlling an AT-ST, after single handedly beating multiple guards back on Canto Bight. The mutiny subplot between General Holdo and Poe is going on at the same time and their performances and believable character traits make this one of the highlights of the movie. While I liked this subplot, the whole problem could have been entirely eradicated, if Poe and Holdo talked about their plans. The scene ends with Holdo sacrificing herself in order to save the last surviving escape pods, by ramming the Resistance Ship into the First Order Ship, but only doing so, after basically killing of the vast majority of the Resistance Ships. The magnitude of the exploding First Order Ship gets reduced again by slapstick humor and dialogue that feels completely out of place. Captain Phasma, an intriguing character from the Force Awakens, that did not see nearly enough screen time, does not get used to the full potential and finds death without ever achieving anything meaningful.<br /><br />The final battle happens on the salt planet Crait, the Resistance surrounded by the First Order and Finn and the others go on the offense with some speeder like ships. Finn is ready to sacrifice himself in order for the success of the Resistance, but gets stopped at the last second by Rose, that selfishly decided she was more important than the chance of overall survival, despite highlighting over the movie, that solidarity and believe in the Resistance is crucial.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker appears as an Illusion, unknowingly to Kylo Ren and manages to buy enough time to get the Resistance to safety. He finally manages to find peace and balance with the force and dies in the process. <br /><br />Overall, the Soundtrack, the Sound effects and the Visual effects are stunning. The action is great and if this is enough for the average viewer to be entertained, this movie can be ideal. The problems start with the implausible and the shoddy dialogue and leave much to be desired. Some characters get fleshed out, while others seem to be forgotten. The chemistry between Finn and Rose is simply not there and the movie would have been better without the whole love story in it. I can´t imagine that hardcore fans of Star Wars can be happy with what was achieved by Rian Johnson, he does not seem to be the right guy to lead the next trilogy. Unfortunately the positive aspects do not manage to redeem the glaring issues of this long awaited second part in the sequel trilogy. I left the cinema feeling disappointed and I am now less enthusiastic about Star Wars future movies."
3530,4,This is not the Star Wars film that you are looking for.,"If you are wanting a Star Wars film that has an interesting and exciting plot that keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat and lets you escape real life problems for a while, a film that is respectful and true to its characters and develops them further, has an interesting protagonist and a well written, complex villian, or a solid Star Wars film that leaves you on a high, wanting more and excited to see what your favourite characters will get up to in the final installment of this latest trilogy... then what can I say? This is not the Star Wars film that you are looking for."
3531,1,Pointless,"I knew I was not going to like this movie, just because Episode VII was terrible in my opinion. But, this is even worse. I didn't want to watch it, however it started on TV and I decided, that I owe that much to the story, I was in love with, when I was a kid. But the catch is, this has nothing to do with it. It just uses the same names for things, however they are now some shallow and useless words - the Force, Jedi Knight, Rebels, Empire (First Order) and so on - even space jump doesn't work the same. Just an example - we have Kylo Ren - the powerful apprentice of the mysterious Dark Force lord (mysterious because we never get to know who he is, what he did to become Lord of the First Order and why is he actually this powerful - or actually not powerful). So we can only compare Kylo to Vader, but guess what - he barely manages to kick the asses of some non-force users with semi-light-saber stupid weapons. Can you imagine non-force user stand more than 2 seconds against Darth Vader? There are scenes that are frustrating, there are scenes, that are simply stupid, characters have no depth, nobody knows what a character will do, which Disney seem to think is interesting. However you still have to make sure that characters make some sense - and they never do. This is not simply shame to the Star Wars saga - it is an insult to generations of film makers and movie fans."
3532,1,When a movie expresses your personal pathology,"I am astonished that this movie was done the way it is. It´s not really a movie, the dialoges are terrible, the story is ridiculous, gosh, from every perspective there ist just nothing there. I really believe it is some kind of a reflection of some pathological ideology come to life, in form of some movie, where female omnipotance and males that are nothing but tyrannical monsters constitute the world. Who needs complexity, anyways. The movie makes this pathology come to life. And that´s how more or less bizarre it semms to the average sane person."
3533,3,Disappointed,"I didn't want to give this a 1 star just because I can't bring myself to do it, it's like saying you hate your child when you actually don't but are very mad at that child. Well, I'm very mad right now. I don't want to go on a rant and say all the things I hated about it, I'll just say that I was very disappointed. The Force Awaken is definitely much better. Now I worry about how in the hell are they going to end this trilogy the right way when this particular film was such a mess. The story was all over the place. It felt like they couldn't make up their mind about what story they wanted to tell."
3534,1,Death of a Franchise,"This was a Star Wars movie?! It was hoakie, disjointed and far tooo easy to pause. It's sad that this was Carrie Fisher's last movie. If I could have given this movie a half star., that's all it's worth."
3535,5,a big disappointment,"I gave it a 5/10 cause the movie wasn't bad. It was just bad compared to what one would expect from such a million dollar project. I liked the ending and some things in between, the locations and visuals were great. BUT it is NOT a good movie, the writing leaves much to be said about it. The buildup from the previous movie was for naught, there were so many things thrown in at random without getting explained what it actually was. People showing up at random at the exact perfect spot for them to be in. Others giving the spotlight for about one minute or less before getting blasted to pieces. The major 'moves' the movie made were unrealistic and predictable even for a science fiction movie. And so on... "
3536,1,The worst big budget movie I have ever seen.,"Without the incredible, shiny special effects, the actual writing underneath is utterly dire. Completely ruining legacy characters and building up paper thin hero's and villains. No Star Wars fan could have been involved in the creative process of this movie. Compare Vader to Ben. Compare Hux to Tarkin and compare Rey to Luke and you see just how awful this was. The force awakens set up a potentially good series. This movie killed Star Wars as we knew it and desecrated it's corpse."
3537,1,A disgrace to the saga's legacy,"I am beyond shocked that Disney and Lucasfilm allowed this atrocious script to be finalized as the next chapter of this saga. Their misleading campaigning behind this episode leaves a bitter taste in my mouth as I got to finally watch the finishing product. Claiming that Luke & Rey are the beating heart of this film when it turns out nothing of interest happens between these two character. Rey, a character that young girls of this generation could finally look up too is taken a back seat in her own story and her character development goes nowhere. Luke a character i wish i could write from his compassion for others, his bravery, is turned into a shadow of what is bad in this episode that Rian Johnson cooked up. "
3538,1,The worst Star Wars Film so far,"I seriously wish I could give this film zero stars. Just name a few problems with this film: handles characters poorly, awful writing, no Star Wars logic, too many plot twists, no planning for the film, unpredictable in a very bad way, the attempt to take feminism into Star Wars fails, bits of plot amour, extremely cringed comedy and overall poor story telling. I never thought I would see a Star Wars film and hate it as much as the prequels until I saw The Last Jedi, to me it is now the one I hate the most in the franchise. Then followed up by Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace."
3539,1,Cringe,"The acting, forced diversity, good god are they going to stop making these?"
3540,1,What happened?,I have never seen a movie look so great but written so bad. It is visually great and the story is incoherent. There are whole subplots that make no sense in context of the movie. The movie also connects with The Force Awakens very poorly. It is like Rian Johnson took the middle finger to JJ Abram's film.
3541,2,It's more than a film,Why is this film so many negative reviews. Why care about a film so much?
3542,3,Don't let your kids watch this,This is Star Wars? This is Star Wars?? .... you are kidding!
3543,2,And then the Black Riding Hood ...,"If it were not for Adam Driver and Benicio Del Toro, as only true actor here, giving their best even for the lost cause, this would be just a correctly directed pile of trash. But not just any trash: it would be (and is) Disney trash (same as usual but pays more). In my opinion, the downfall of Disney started with incredibly stupid Lion King. After that there are no more disappointments, since you can object to anything, except for the consistency. Disney is truly dedicated to audiovisual pollution of the media space and they will continue to do crap no matter what. It is a dirty job, but someone's got to do it. Two stars for hiring above mentioned actors and their effort. No soup for anybody else involved. Run away from this and don't look back."
3544,1,Pathetic,It is a pedantic pathetic movie with nothing new to offer.
3545,1,my first review ...,I just made an account and wrote this first review to warn everyone about this movie. This is crap. Unlogical. Stupid.
3546,1,Disney should stick to making animated movies about fairy tale princesses,"The biggest disappointment - to me, at least - of the entire Star Wars series. It even had me thinking fondly of Jar Jar Binks."
3547,3,Visually pleasing.,That's about everything positive except the music.
3548,1,Easily the worst Star Wars!,"Bad writing, off humour, lack of a proper saber duel, no character development with Rey, weird usage of Yoda, injustice done to Lukes character. The whole film just felt void of life. As such an avid star wars fan it's difficult to sit back and watch as my favourite franchise gets butchered. I just hope we see some improvement with Solo and Episode 9, I don't want to see sw go to ruin.<br /><br />Please get more competent people to work on future episodes and bring the quality of star wars closer to something like the avengers infinity war or guardians of the galaxy."
3549,3,Very underwhelming,"I'm fully aware of the negative reaction this film has caused, and I'm saying this from a place of non-bias and a lack of prior star wars knowledge - this film is a mess.<br /><br />Because I don't follow star wars as closely as others, I can't comment on how this 'ruins the force' or 'ruins Luke Skywalker' as I've seen others note. However, I found this 2h and 35 minute film rather painful, whether it be the way comedy is rammed into what I assume was originally a darker story about failure and mistakes, or how supposedly 'good-guy' characters are awfully unlikeable. One noteworthy example I found was the rebel general (Holdo) for much of the film. Her insistence on hiding information from her crew was thoroughly unlikeable, and I can't say I shed a tear for her death. Other characters such as Finn and Rose either served no purpose in the story or actively prevented each other from serving purpose."
3550,1,Awful Movie,"The director and staff did no research on the universe of star wars. Lots of awful plots to this movie. Cringeworthy really. Leia flying through space..... Luke throwing his father's lightsaber away after receiving it, his father's lightsaber in which he respected... Just a few examples. Would not reccomend."
3551,2,Mum says hate is a path to the dark side..,"Only movie I have ever truly hated. I felt like the movie had been written specifically to alienate me. On the bright side it has saved me a fortune on star wars merchandise, I won't be needing a hobo Luke, or one of the other bland characters (can't remember there names).."
3552,1,A movie made for kids and people with a mental age under 12.,I made my account just to give it a 1 star and so should you.
3553,1,A nightmare created by someone who hates Star Wars: A Star Wars movie that doesn't want to be a Star Wars movie and succeeds.,he movie basically wants to ruin everything that is Star Wars. 
3554,2,"Disney Star Wars, a sad wasted opportunity.","I always like to compare the great work of Cobra Kai with the terrible work of Disney's SW sequels; for me, there is a clear difference: In Cobra Kai they took all the old characters of Karate Kid and they did a new story for them, the old characters are still a very crucial and important part of the story, and they introduced new characters that are interacting with the old generation, so people will get to love also the new characters. So in Cobra Kai both generations are EQUALLY important. <br /><br />In contrast in SW, the old characters are practically irrelevant to the story, they used the old characters in little roles, something like longer cameos, the didn't create a new story for the old characters, they forced the focus only in the new actors, and even worst: they had the awful idea of tell the same old story with the new characters, using in the way, the old characters as steps on a ladder. So only the new generation is important."
3555,5,Not the Luke Skywalker you're looking for,This film disappointed me. I feel like Luke's legacy is destroyed in this movie. It doesn't feel like it's Luke Skywalker and even Mark Hamill has commented to this as well.
3556,1,Utter mess. I hope this kills the franchise.,"I loathed TFA, full disclosure. Beat for beat rehash of ANH, blah, blah, blah, usual complaints. But it was still better than this crapola. "
3557,1,How to butcher a legendary franchise 101,"Any good reviews you see for this movie are either paid or from people in denial or from people who are entertained way too easily. Disney destroyed a beloved franchise and its painful. Disney knows they can milk money with just the ""star wars"" name without putting in any effort and they did just that. The movie has no substance, ruined beloved characters, introduced annoying characters that makes jar jar binks less annoying, Killed off the only interesting villain like it was nothing. A stupid plot like it was written by a 11 year old. Honestly the prequels are much much better than this pile of garbage."
3558,1,"Bad script, bad directing","Bad script, bad directing. Liked VII, but this was sooo bad."
3559,1,How to ruin a franchise 101:,"Honestly thought I was actually watching a sequel to ""Space Balls"". The goofy characters, the ridiculous uniforms (what's up with the jumbo pens replacing the rank/ribbons?), the bad acting, the horrible plot...a truely horrendious film. If only Disney had gone with the Expanded Univers timeline, that has lots of great plots and characters (esp. the Thrawn series). We can only hope Disney hasn't forever ruined the franchise. Maybe they are already gearing up for a ""reboot"" since they have lowered our expectations so much with the last 2 pieces of dreck."
3560,1,travesty,"Slow speed space chase, no progression of characters, heavy reliance on subversion of expectations to the point of completely unraveling episode 7 and the total annihilation of the character of luke skywalker. that's the true travesty here. what they did to luke is unbelievable. they have him attmept to kill his nephew because he senses the evil in him. luke would never do that. then he runs off to die on an island shutting himself off from his sister, his friends and the force. luke would never do this. and then he when called on to help his sister in her darkest hour, he refused the call. luke would never do this. this movie is an abomination."
3561,1,Has Rian Johnson ever seen a Star Wars movie?,After watching this movie I concluded that the director has either A) never seen a Star Wars movie before or B) is a crying man baby that went on a power trip to annoy the fans.
3562,5,Weakest Entry in the Series. Mediocre Adventure Story,WARNING! HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD!
3563,1,Bewilderment and Disappointment,"What makes this movie so bewildering is that it's driven by contempt for Star Wars. Rian Johnson and Disney go out of their way to mock, belittle, dismiss and undo the magic, the mystery, the richness and the wonder of Star Wars. And, the really weird part is that they sacrificed plot, character development, drama, intrigue, tension and basic narrative structure to do that. I just don't get it. This movie is a cynical and self-congratulatory act of sabotage. "
3564,1,Not funny any more,"From the opening scene of the bombers and the terrible script and acting I knew I was going to hate this. It's bad, and a poor retred of the original films. The acting is obysmal, and the story just doesn't make sense. Suddenly Rey is the most powerful person on the planet, with no training or guidance. Luke has become a bitter booster, who is scared of everything. Kyro is bad, good, bad, good. Leah can jump from ship to ship in space. Seriously it's bad, what would my child self would of thought of this, knowing a great film trilogy has gone down so badly"
3565,4,Patchy at best - Have not been as disappointed since Jaja Binks stole some of my life that I will never get back,"Somewhat disjointed. There are some good parts, but it was a bit ""try hard"" on how many items/characters they could interject from the earlier movies that mostly seemed out of place. Most of the humour was lame. Have not been this disappointed in a Star Wars movie since Jaja Binks took some of my life that I will never get back."
3566,1,The biggest waste of 2.5 hrs ever,So my girlfriend needs to watch The Last Jedi in order to go Rise of Skywalker so here I am rewatching this movie and I think I hate it even more rewatching it again for the 3rd time. It is just so pointless and a waste of time. In my opinion the last Jedi doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. It feels completely out of place. If you read this post and disagree with me just go rewatch A New Hope as if you have no idea what it is. Disney completely ruined the Star Wars franchise with The Force awakens and now the Last Jedi.
3567,1,The Last Jedi Way Off Course,"I'm 48 years old and have been a major fan of Star Wars since the beginning. JJ Abrams started it off with ""The Force Awakens"" and even though I thought it was a partial rip-off of the original films, I liked it. The Last Jedi is not just a bad Star Wars film, it's just a bad film altogether. The slap-stick comedy throughout the movie didn't fit with SW tradition, putting a halt on any type of momentum you may have had. The CGI was the worse of all the films, especially the cockpit scenes. 1978's ""Battlestar Galactica"" was more believable. IMO Rogue One was the best film of the entire series due to it's grit and serious story line. Everything felt REAL and the little humor it had, was very subtle and fit seamlessly. I will give credit to all the actors, which did a wonderful job. It's too bad they had this script to work with. :("
3568,1,Another lackluster entry in the Star Wars saga.,"While visually impressive it does little to save the uneven pacing, lackluster story and downright confounding character development (or lack thereof). "
3569,1,Horrible and unreal!,Everything in this movie was wrong with the original triology. Bad fight scene and also who the hell is Rose Tigo??? Why do we have to know about her when she is not a Jedi.
3570,3,Deconstructing the franchise,"For all its impressive special effects, not a fun movie to watch. As if the writers were insecure about audience reaction to the new heroes presented in this trilogy, we get to watch the old heroes get their legacy completely trashed in this movie."
3571,3,Missing George Lucas,"George Lucas had silly creatures and crazy CGI in the prequels, this movie has all that. But what is missing in this film is the lore, mythology, dialogue and long term character arcs. The Force Awakens was an enjoyable greatest hits of Star wars with two mysteries that were genuinely enthralling - Who is Rey and what is her connection to Skywalker / Kylo? And who is the mysterious Snoke?"
3572,1,"Everyone's already said this, but awful.",I'm not going to rehash what everyone had already said. But this movie just missed on almost every opportunity to be watchable. It's diluted politically correct trash that should NOT be allowed to carry the Star Wars mantle. Everyone involved should be embarrassed.
3573,1,This is NOT the Star Wars I loved,"Horrible and utter garbage! Hell even the Star Wars prequel had a better story line and was well written. The visuals might be more realistic and less CGI but the story is total garbage and when they bring back favorite characters they ruin them, this isn't Star Wars. They should just scrap this all together, all garbage."
3574,1,Awful,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan ever since I was young, but the recent ones have awful casting, the script is bad, the Star Wars films died when Yoda did."
3575,1,This is not Star Wars,I think it has now been enough time that I can look back at this movie and judge properly.
3576,1,Awful,"Worst film ever, from the Star Wars franchise.<br /><br />Never thought that I'd say there was a lower point than Jar Jar, but then this rubbish came along. Well done Johnson, you ruined Star Wars."
3577,2,The end of Star Wars (Movie making has become a lost art in Hollywood),"I cannot add much to what others have said. Dumb movie. Disjointed. Just flash and boom, no depth. No story, made no sense. Crappy writing. No emotional attachment to any characters. Empty. You walk out wondering what you just watched and why. I felt nothing and was bored watching it."
3578,1,Character assassination at its best,Congratulations to Disney for destroying the greatest movie and book character of all time.
3579,1,Lazy writing,"As a gatekeeper of a franchise that spawns decades you have a big responsibility to keep a 'rule book' of what is allowed to happen to keep stories believable. I can be convinced of a time travelling DeLorean after 30 seconds screen-time, as long as there are certain limitations the characters have to deal with, weaknesses or rules that cannot be broken, whether they are explicitly mentioned in the film or not.<br /><br />If these rules suddenly shift or are thrown out of the window, it ruins the believability and disrespects its viewers. This is why the Matrix 2 and 3 for example were absolutely atrocious sequels to an excellent original.<br /><br />Having rules that limit what can or should happen forces writers to think of smart ways to propel the story forward, avoid 'cop outs' and as a result keep people invested in all the characters and the world(s) they inhabit."
3580,1,Who could wright a story this bad?,If you are a massive Star Wars fan you must see The Last Jedi... As it will only play on your mind in till you do! but get ready as this will give you a very bad day week year.... life!!
3581,1,So many things wrong.. feels like a money maker.,"If you want to understand why life long Star Wars fans dislike the new Star Wars movies, go watch some of Alex Becker's rants on You Tube. They did not listen to what fans want when making this movie."
3582,2,The Last Jedi is the last Star Wars movie I'll watch,"I'd heard plenty of grumbles from dedicated Star Wars aficionados about Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. I'm not an obsessive SW series fan, but I was one of those kids (age 8 at the time) who sat in a suburban movie theater in the summer of 1977, enthralled by the original ""Star Wars."" The magical universe full of exotic, as well as very human, characters, an epic battle of good against evil, thrilling space battle scenes, etc. ""The Force Awakens"" rekindled my interest, mainly because of the new, young characters: Rey, Kyle, Finn and Poe. However, the ""The Last Jedi"" was poorly written from start to finish. The characters and conflicts are predictable, repetitive, flat. It's the same storyline over and over again. Star cameos and corny jokes don't make up for good writing. There were also too many obvious deus ex machina plot twists, like a very wooden Princess Leia floating through space to be miraculously saved (and unscarred) after an explosion. If the First Order/Empire (is there any real distinction?) is going to kill Leia, then let them do it, and let it be realistic. Even Yoda's crotchety ghost appearing seemed like a boring cliche. "
3583,1,Everything has been said. Worst Star Wars Movie ever. Bad movie overall.,Everything has been said before in these reviews son I'm just adding mine to rate this movie as the garbage it is.
3584,1,"Okay, now it's personal","A complete sabotage to the original trilogy and even The Force Awakens. This movie was written and directed by folks that do not understand Star Wars and seem to go out of their way to be disrespectful to long time Star Wars fans. I wish I was joking. Star Wars concepts, characters new and old, and plot potential were all shamelessly destroyed in this utter troll of a movie. Such a shame because it had all the ingredients (great cast, legendary original characters and what-could-have-been-great new characters, it's freaking Star Wars!) to do something amazing. I guess all good things come to die, and this movie truly ruined Star Wars for me. Disney, you butchered a childhood story I've always held close and I take it personally. I will never support you by watching your future movies, period."
3585,1,Terrible movie and IMDB censors,"This is a technically awful movie. I like to think I wrote an eloquent review to that<br /><br />effect, also being very critical of the ratings here, the opinion of professional 'critics' and how the makers of this movie went out to lambast those who didn't like their film. This was a review without swearing or profanity of any kind - and it was never put up. "
3586,1,Star Wars: Episode 8: The Last Straw,Luke is dead. Carrie Fisher is dead. Star Wars is dead.
3587,1,Really rather silly,Stupid. Silly. Boring. Dull. Nonsensical...have I said stupid?
3588,1,Worst Star wars movie ever.,"Visually Amazing, Acting was very good. Terrible in every other conceivable way."
3589,1,Plenty of CGI but no story or soul,I went into the movie theatre expecting something great but ddin't get antthing worth the time.
3590,4,The star wars cow has been hung on the milking machine!,I don't even know where to start with this last installment. There are so many plot holes that go unanswered.
3591,1,Only wish I could rate lower,... watch the mandalorian if you want to know true Star Wars
3592,1,Garbage,Sooooo bad. Reading the reviews was more entertaining than watching the movie. And IMDB saying this is 7.4 stars is a joke.
3593,1,Propaganda,"I have let this fit settle in, by about two weeks so this is no knee-jerk reaction, in fact my enmity towards the picture has increased with rumination. However, it is not without some merits hence the 4 stars."
3594,1,Not what I expected.....,Stop reading now if you don't want spoilers......
3595,1,I can't look past the plot holes,"As a movie enthusiast, i welcome a fresh take on established stories, another director's vision, toying with themes and so on. But what i would expect in return is a captivating story, which is intellectually challenging or philosophically interesting, not just eye candy. If the latter is enough for you, you might be able to forgive deviations from the SW universe, overlook the huge plot holes and the lack of character development. Unfortunately, I can't and I should have followed my impulse to leave the theatre as this wasn't worth my time and it shouldn't anybody else's. Bottom line: this is the worst SW movie so far and anything but promising for Disney's future with this franchise."
3596,5,A parody of a Star Wars film.,Mediocre story. Mediocre acting. Mediocre action. Just all around mediocrity. And throwing away all of the intriguing questions raised by The Force Awakens and not asking any new ones doesn't bode well for IX.
3597,1,Surprisingly bad,Kennedy allowed ruian and jj to tank the franchise.
3598,3,Take a moment and ask yourself: What's missing?,"What is missing from the Disney 'Star Wars' films? They have the same props, sets, costumes. Even the same actors wearing the same costumes and holding the same props. So, what doesn't click? <br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />Because it's soulless. It lacks originality, care, true thoughts and feelings or spirituality. Because the people who have creative control over these films (Bob Iger / Kathy Kennedy) worship money, and not something greater than themselves. They make the films for their own benefit, for their own aggrandizement. Not for the benefit of others. <br /><br />Is there a way forward for cinema? The answer is YES."
3599,4,Very Boring,"I tried to get into this movie, but it just seems so unwatchable to me. I know this movie was directed by someone else who has their own idea of a Star Wars movie and not focus on what J.J Abrams was visioning on, which pretty much ended everything before it was even set up for the 3rd movie which was the biggest flaw of this film. To me, I couldn't barely watch it because it was simply boring."
3600,3,The clone stormtrooper,Looks nothing like his original progenitor.
3601,1,project kill starwars last jedi,"Luke runs of of will to live in a made up kids story of what went down in a galaxy far far away.<br /><br />Thats right rian wrote this story as a child and now we all have to blame his parents for saying well done great story rian. <br /><br />han solo <br /><br /> "" thats not how the force works"".<br /><br />obi wan<br /><br />""I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced""."
3602,2,Bad movie.. really bad,"As a Star wars fan who saw every single movie in the theter since The Phantom Menace, TLJ made me angry.<br /><br />Im not going to pay to see any Star Wars movie until the head of Lucas Film is gone.<br /><br />Also ""Ruin"" Johnson is evil and destroyed my once beloved movies, i will defenetly not see his trilogy.<br /><br />Solo? dont care!<br /><br />Episode 9? dont care"
3603,1,Total Rubbish!!!,"After George Lucas's movies of Luke Skywalker, building up a story line of young Luke, a farm boy who wanted to see adventure, join the resistance, saviour of the Jedi's, this movie turns him into a grumpy old frumpy!!.<br /><br />A cowerd who has gone into hiding after having made a small mistake? Really?<br /><br />Disney should be ashamed for coming up with a Rubbish story!!<br /><br />They took a well established franchise and turned it into stew 😡.<br /><br />There's a lot I would like to say, but this movie is Awful.<br /><br />I wish I could give it no stars."
3604,1,The worst star wars movie ever,"Seriously there was nothing that I liked in this movie and that's because it kept dragging that joke of episode 7, the new wannabe Darth Vader. Apart from that Luke Skywalker was out of character. A total failure this movie from every aspect"
3605,2,"Bad, terrible bad.",The damage this movie have made to the franchise is worse than anyone could have imagine when released.
3606,1,Star Wars: The Last Hope,"I made an account to write this. I'm a 30 something year old and grew up watching the originals. I didn't fully appreciate the story until I was older, and the prequels came out. I thoroughly indulged in the lore and loved Revenge of the Sith. (Seeing the emotions that Anakin goes through!) TFA was decent for me, I was genuinely interested in Snoke, and Luke's new Jedi training for a new set of Jedis also sparked my interest. I hoped I wasn't grasping at air, but I slowly started speculating about what TLJ would be about. I was certain that Snoke's origins or even perhaps a flashback showing how he seduced Kylo. I figured TLJ would show the resistance in a dire state, and Luke having to confront Snoke while Rey would confront Kylo; A dualism if you may, similar to when Order 66 is executed, and you see Padme's emotional release along with Anakin's. I was hopeful to see how Maz Kenata (definitely spelled wrong) obtained Luke's light saber, since it was directly mentioned. If any of this sounds like anything you might've hoped for, I'm sorry to tell you that you couldn't have been farther from the actual plot. Every logical prediction I made was so far off base, that despite watching every movie prior (including TFA) several times, I NEVER want to watch TLJ again."
3607,1,The movie that buried the Star Wars universe in mediocrity and ridicule,"Literally the worst opus of the saga star wars. Zero scenario, flat actors, meaningless action. A bad parody of a star wars. How could Disney push this universe so low? The direction and production team should never be allowed to touch a movie ever again. You have destroyed the childhood memories of millions of people."
3608,1,Big money makes worst movie ever,"This movie is bad, forget how you may feel about Star Wars, this was just a bad movie compared to every movie ever made. Sitting through this movie was like watching a never ending commercial, so very painful, but hoping if you endure you will get rewarded with things getting better only to see things get worse. Big money is trying to squeeze every penny out of this brand and does so in a very brazen display. Even all the critics seem to be on the pay roll as all there reviews are good and all the reviews from real people are bad, so sad. I hope the back lash to this affront serves as a example of what to never do when making a movie. This is a sad day for Star Wars fans. At this point all we can do is warn our friends and families to stay away."
3609,1,More than just a great disturbance in the Force.,This movie is to Star Wars what the Death Star was to Alderaan in the original trilogy. Millions of voices cried out in sudden terror and were suddenly silenced. Something terrible has happened.
3610,1,Star Wars: A Feminist Story,"That's what the movie should have been called. It makes the ""prequel"" movies look great. You already know all the dumb things about this movie...save yourself and skip this and the 3rd installment."
3611,1,This is NOT Star Wars,It is painfully obvious that Ruin Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy hate George Lucas and Star Wars. Children have written better fan-fiction that this heaping pile of Bantha poodoo. Has Ruin Johnson ever seen Star Wars??? The first scene with the battle in space was one of the worst scenes ever filmed and the movie continued to spiral downward from there. It hit rock bottom and then proceeded to dig. The infamous Christmas Special has more continuity than this movie. Johnson and Kennedy should be barred from touching any franchise from here on out.
3612,1,oh i'm afraid the emperor will not be operational instead Oz the Great and Powerful,The wizard of is luke and hologram fight kylo-hologram snoke-hologram emperior.<br /><br />luke send them on bogus quest to get dagga to kill empirororsomething only for the powerful oz to reveal himself.
3613,1,IMBD SCORE IS RIGGED,"I'm sorry but how on Earth can this movie have a 7.4 Rating when the majority of reviews I've seen (scrolled for a long long time) are 1s and 2s out of 10. Begs the question as to whether somebody is doing Disney a huge favour on the sly. Appalling. Out of respect for my love of Stars I will go and see episode IX in the HOPE that the ever growing number of questions and plot holes are answered. But seriously after that just bury the franchise, it's dead and hanging dry so please just give it a respectful send off"
3614,4,I am not a Russian Bot. I love Star Wars.,"I truly love Star Wars from my heart of hearts. I really do. I have rated all of the other films a solid 10 stars including SOLO because I still submit that when we grade a movie there is ""Good"" and then there is ""star wars"" and so it has to be rated on its own scale. I truly believe of the Star Wars films this one was lacking. Compared to like, the incredible hulk or X-men Origins this movie is incredible but to put the name Star Wars on this... that just feels wrong. I will still go to every premiere and I hope they keep making these movies for years to come because my favorite memory as a child is being taken by my dad to go see Phantom Menace and I mean yeah that movie has its issues but it was my first time seeing Star Wars on the big screen and everyone was in costume. They gave me a lightsaber! It was and still is better to me than all other holidays. Star Wars is like a deluxe Christmas/4th of July/Halloween and has twice the magic. I hope that everyone involved in these movies takes the time to see they should be spaced further apart and given twice the attention. And for goodness sakes do not be so secretive. Someone is always going to spoil it but I would rather you have a production that is an open book so there are people who can say ""that will be bad do not do that."" As for the recent news of the hate towards this film being mostly from Russian bots... Russian bots did not decide ""I wont go see solo either"" and Russian bots do not make up the majority of the people who I have spoken to about this movie. It honestly lacked the magic. It felt manufactured and man made and the rest of the films are like a wonder of the world. I hope the magic returns."
3615,1,Star Wars is Dead. RIP. (But it's worse than that),"""If you see the Buddha, kill him."" The Last Jedi (not really) <br /><br />Star Wars is Dead. RIP (But it's worse than that)<br /><br />William Metzger<br /><br />Warning: One big spoiler.<br /><br /> If you have loved Star Wars since its inception and haven't seen the Last Jedi don't go. Don't watch any more Star Wars sequels. Stop buying Star Wars merchandise. Disney has inverted everything Star Wars once was in order to subject a captivated audience to their politically correct, post-modernist, cultural-Marxist agenda. It has converted a story about brave Truth seekers relentlessly fighting evil into one of confused weaklings who preach ""everything's relative dude."" Star Wars has become the biggest bait and switch scam in history. You've been punked.<br /><br /> Although the original Stars Wars was rich in political intrigue, great epic battles, wonderful human interest, colorful new species and amazing cultures, the heart and soul of Star Wars, the one thing that gave it lasting meaning, was Jedi mysticism. ""Luminescent you are, not this g matter"" said Master Yoda to the young disciple Luke Skywalker. At the core of Star Wars was a sacred and pure search for Truth, a rigorous discipline requiring total, lifelong, absolute faith and commitment, even celibacy. At the core was a relentless, single-minded dedication to overcoming the delusion of matter and ego-consciousness, to unifying one's soul to the omnipresent, invisible Light, to the omnipotent Energy, and to the omniscient, eternal Consciousness that envelopes and binds the universe: the Force. Such knowledge is rare, and those capable of the receptivity and discipline to attain it very few indeed. Therefore, a small priesthood, the Jedi, kept the knowledge alive and pure. For the freedom fighters of the Republic it was enough to keep the faith. ""May the Force be with you"" was their battle slogan.<br /><br /> Opposed to the Jedi were the Sith. The Sith practiced classic Luciferian doctrine as explained by Darth Sidius in episode III, Revenge of the Sith. The Jedi, according to Sidius, were limited in their powers and were preventing mankind from achieving its full potential by denying it access to the powers of the Dark Side. To access those powers, one must take the exact opposite path of the Jedi. Whereas the Jedi dissolved ego, the Sith immersed themselves in it. Whereas the Jedi operated within a moral framework and were motivated by love for all that is, the Sith found their powers by escaping moral boundaries and tapping into pure hate.<br /><br /> In the first Star Wars trilogy we found the young adept, Luke Skywalker, and his young band of merry freedom fighters, battling the diabolical tyranny of Sith Lord Darth Vader and the Evil Empire, controlled by the enslaving power of the Dark Side. Throughout the trilogy we saw young Luke grow from a brave and talented, yet impetuous, egotistical, overconfident novice into a full Jedi under the strict training of Master Yoda. <br /><br /> Before his maturation as a Jedi, Luke studied for years and suffered many setbacks. In his first confrontation with Darth Vader, despite his undaunted courage, he was overpowered by Vader both physically and psychologically, losing his hand in battle, and reduced to trembling in fear in the face of the dark, frightening and much more powerful figure. And yet when the triumphant Vader mercifully offered the helplessly defeated Luke joint rulership of the galaxy in the name of peace, Luke's Jedi heart and soul screamed out with no hesitation, ""I will never join you."" Good and evil cannot mix."
3616,1,Can't help but root for the dark side.,"This script is so nonsensical it's not funny. In the end I just wish that the rebel force can just be eliminated once and for all so that however lame the follow up is, at least it can start afresh."
3617,5,Disappointing but at least it has good action. (Spoiler-free review),"I am giving this movie 7.4 out of 10 stars but I kind of want to give it 6 out of 10 stars. The film looks great, and OMG the space battles are freaking awesome and.. that is about it. This is a spoiler free review so I'm going to try my best here. The acting is a mixed bag. Some of the actors are brilliant and others are sort of just there; but I'm not sure it is the actor's fault or if the fault belongs to the fact the story doesn't make you care or connect with some of the characters. It is hard to explain without spoiling things. The movie starts out great however the middle drags like a mother thanks to a subplot which is just meh. There are major things that happen, major things that are discovered and I am almost tempted to watch the film again just to see if eliminating the shock factors deflates the film even more when it comes to plot. Here is the thing, I am just going to come out and say it; I think the current trilogy (and extended SW universe) has no direction at all and each film they put out changes based on fan reaction. Say what you want about the prequels, at least they had a strong core story (Episode 1 is weak, Episode 2 is one of the worst films ever made; just so you know I am not a prequel fanboy). These new films feel like they have conveniently gelatinous core elements holding them together which are expendable based on viewer reaction. For example, if fans go completely insane and demand Episode 9 be a romantic French comedy shot in black and white - we are going to get just that. There is no backbone. Story wise this film is a bit of a jellyfish."
3618,2,Insulting,I created an IMDb account specifically to add my 2 cents on here.
3619,1,A movie of two halves,"Just returned from viewing this movie in Imax and don't yet know what to make of it. Firstly, it's long. Far, far too long. The movie, and the viewers appreciation of it, would've been greatly improved had it been cut by 45minutes - the first 45minutes. At no time could I truthfully say that I had a clue as to what was going on: the plot is such a mess. Not helped by the Rose character's speech being totally incomprehensible, a common problem with Asian Americans (try making sense of Lucy Liu in the otherwise excellent Elementary). Chewbacca (this passes the spellchecker!) is supposed to be incomprehensible, but then, he's a Wooky, not a human. And all those pointless cute little critters that'll scare most children, what's all that about? Aimed at pre-adolescents, there are sufficiently numerous explosions to keep most interested at least during the performance but don't expect this cash cow to become a classic. A generous 5/10 as the music, coffee and nachos were very good."
3620,1,Please remove this from star wars cannon,"Just that, this movie was a wreck. Please do not let anyone responsible for this movie ever touch a star wars production ever again."
3621,2,You Thought The Force Awakens Is The Bottom Of The Barrel..,... It is
3622,1,Epitaph,"I would say it's the last nail in SW franchise coffin, but we all know there's more to come. Way more... And, unfortunately, every new movie promises the next one to be even worse."
3623,1,Worst movie ever made in eternity,"The last Jedi is the worst movie I've ever seen. I absolutely love Star Wars and I grew up with stuff like the clone wars and the prequels. It's one of my favorite series's ever but when I watched this movie I almost threw up. It's terrible in every way possible. JJ Abrams should just quit. The acting, the script, the choreography, the fighting, it was all just terrible!! Theres barely any action and even when their is it's either ray fighting a rock or kylo ren fighting a wall. The only actual action scene is the throne room scene and it was just god awful I turned the movie off half way through because it was just so bad. If you ever do a complete run through do yourself a favor and don't even think about clicking on this movie. Actually... DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS MOVIE AT ALL! JUST PUT IT IN THE FREAKING BACK OF YOUR MIND AND TRY TO FORGET IT!! ITS TERRIBLE!! JJ, you really gon messed up with this one. Just stop, scrap Rey, scrap kylo, scrap everything. Just bring my childhood back and do stuff like the prequels or the tv shows. Thank you even though I know nobody from Disney is gonna look at this. The fact that the script even made it through Disney executives make me mind boggling mad."
3624,1,"Just when you thought the Force Awakens was bad, Wait until you see this trash!","I have to say I was not a fan of the Force Awakens, The storyline was just a rehash of EP4 but told in a poor way with forgettable characters, Kylo Ren who was a weak villain and was just plain boring. The Last Jedi got a lot of hate from the fans and even those who did enjoy the Force Awakens gave this movie a lot of hate too. My friend who is a hardcore fan of Star Wars was watching the film with me and telling me all the problems the film had. The story in the film made no sense, loads of plot holes, and how Luke was completely out of character. I have to agree with him 100% and I was uninterested in the film from start to finish. I actually had more fun listening to him trashing the film if anything! They built up this bad guy called snoke from the previous film and then kill him off! The characters are uninteresting and stupid, the music is lacking expect for the main theme at the start of film, This film is full of problems and is overall a waste of time."
3625,1,Another franchise falls victim to Disney's woke agenda,"Several modern movie studios have shown repeatedly that they will sacrifice good movie-making in an effort to appease the internet wokescolds. This movie isn't concerned with having a coherent story, believable dialogue or even any consistency with the previous Star Wars films; the priority of ""The Last Jedi"" is to break ground as the most progressive, diverse sci-fi movie to date. Not to mention this movie is full of offensively cliche scenes that remind the viewer that Disney definitely has creative control. This movie gets 3 stars for its striking visuals and special effects, which are its only redemptive quality."
3626,2,"The Original Star Wars Concept Needs To Pass With Carrie, Mark and Harrison","Don't get me wrong - I love Rey, Fin and Po, but the incredibly tacky bar scenes, smarmy stuffed animals, overall bad writing and endless repetitious plot elements need to be blasted by the nearest Death Star as soon as it is charged and ready. The franchise is now officially in a zombie mode that sucks the soul out of every new Star Wars film before the opening crawl has faded. We need to demand the franchise be allowed to mature and become leaner hopefully strangling as much of the Lucasonian kitsch as possible. I personally think it's time for a darker Star Wars that still holds to the light even if that requires walking a tightrope between what was and what could be - the same tightrope they fell from when making Blade Runner 2049. It's now time to let the kids run with it."
3627,1,What went so wrong?,I was so disappointed when I left the movie earlier tonight. This is my first review here. I almost feel like Star Wars has been ruined. I wanted to love it but can't. I feel like Star Wars is over. I wanted to ask for a refund on my way out. The 8.1 rating it has at this moment has to be fake.
3628,1,Only you can stop this legacy slaughter,Did imdb give a 8 stars by default to this movie or what happened here?
3629,1,Apotheosis of stupidity and vulgarity,"""...and the title ""Worst Director of All Time"" passes from Edward Wood, Jr to Rian Johnson""<br /><br />Pathetic and nasty work."
3630,2,Difficult to watch,"I find this episode difficult to watch. As a childhood fan of Star Wars who has viewed each preceding episode countless times, I've watched Episode VIII three complete times: twice in the theater, once on Netflix. It is my opinion that the producers should have closed out the Skywalker Saga in the same style and manner as its predecessors, then twisted the force into a Marvel Universe megamess in a future series."
3631,1,Where are all the heroes now?,First of all I came out of the screening having watched a sometimes funny and entertaining sci fi film. This is not enough for a Star Wars film. 
3632,1,Not my Luke. Thank God to Filoni and Mando Season 2,As Hamil said it's like a new character Jake Skywalker you have to think of. I won't show my kids this garbage.
3633,1,Good looks are the only thing this did right.,"Nonsensical plotlines, randomly shoving main characters to comic relief, destroying any and all plotlines going forward, all but ensuring that its sequel and the end of this trilogy will be a trainwreck."
3634,1,That's that then.,"So I've been a Star Wars fan all my life, it's by far the movies that has shaped my childhood and my life beyond any other piece of fiction."
3635,3,"Ryan Johnson is laughing at you, Star Wars fans.","Snoke is dead, and Luke is dead. Oh yeah, Star Wars is dead too."
3636,1,You know why it has so many horrible reviews?,"Because is just a bad movie. Not a bad star wars movie, but bad in all aspects."
3637,3,Good Bye Star Wars SPOILER alert,"Good bye Star Wars. I grew up with you in the original trilogy of 77, 80 and 83 and loved you then. I cherish memories of that original trilogy. I suffered through every Star Wars film after that in the hopes that someone could 'capture the essence' of the original trilogy which was excellent story-telling and dangerous and heroic adventure among unlikely friends. In the Force Awakens. Rey, Poe, and Finn have chemistry but these characters need a worthy story-line. "
3638,1,Unforgiving liberties.,Johnson's depiction of Luke Skywalker totally ruined this film for me. To take such liberties with the backbone of the franchise shows his lack of understanding the character or his total disregard for the fan base. Totally unforgivable and a costly mistake for the powers who chose him to direct.
3639,1,Some of the worst writing I have ever seen on screen.,"I was shocked by how poorly made this film was. The writing, acting, and total disregard of any substantial story elements crippled what was supposed to be a total game changer. For all the hype Disney was putting into the marketing of this film, absolutely nothing changes! The good guys are still good, bad guys bad, and more classic characters and favorites are pushed to the background to make way for some of the most bland, annoying, and logicless new cast members ever! I was thoroughly disappointed. I really don't see myself going to another Star Wars film after this."
3640,2,Absolute and utter garbage,Rate it a 2 because apparently IMDB throws out 1s. No wonder it's rated so much high than it should be.
3641,1,BORing movie and a disgrace,This movie is a disgrace and boring if you are a Star Wars fan read legacy of the force or the new Jedi order and don't spend your money. Don't buy. Read legacy of the force and fate of the Jedi instead
3642,4,Raw,"Even before ""Episode 8"" was released, there was reason to suspect it would basically copy big elements from episodes 5 and 6, and upon release, proof arrived. And while the plot received a lot of well-deserved criticism, everybody seemed to be happy with the visuals of ""The Last Jedi"". On the one hand, the combination of computer generated images and the real thing is beautiful. This isn't ""Attack of the Clones"", of course. On the other hand, there is a big problem, one that is becoming common of big budget movies in the twenty-first century. As far as the ""Star Wars"" franchise goes, some symptoms of that problem can be found in ""Revenge of the Sith"" and every movie made under Disney. But where that problem reaches an unforgivable level is ""The Last Jedi"", and this cannot be explained without an example, even though it literally stares at you."
3643,2,Flawed on every level,"I went in blank and came out confused. <br /><br />Ive watched it again, it became worse. <br /><br />Ive given it another chance, I was still confused."
3644,5,Not a Star Wars movie worth,"I came back somewhat disappointed from the movie. <br /><br />The story itself is quite OK, but there are really scene's where I was thinking ""WTF?""<br /><br />Thinking about the scene were Leia ""floats"" in space to go back to her spaceship (or when she ""welds"" the door open during the mutiny).<br /><br />The part where the rebel ship ""cuts"" the spaceship from Snoke (that is like 10 times bigger?) in two, and 99,99% of the stormtroopers dies except captain Phasma, Finn & his Chinese buddy. Even if I have to say this scene was pretty ""wow"", having no sound for about 5 seconds and afterwards a huge bang.<br /><br />Also these stupid jokes should not be included in a Star Wars movie imho, I don't know if this is due to the Disney influence but doesn't fit for me.<br /><br />Also these little ""pinguins / birds"" like are at the end with Chewbacca in the Falcon is probably a nice marketing character that will sell as hell in a plush doll.<br /><br />Special FX are of course stunning, the location of the last fight scene is also very nice, same with the one of the battle with Rey & Kylo Ren with the burning cloth falling down in pieces.<br /><br />I won't say it's a bad movie, but it's just not ""epic"" enough I think to be a Star Wars movie, I preferred Rogue One for instance to this one."
3645,4,So uncivilized,"This is where the fun begins, as the young Anakin Skywalker once said. This is what I've told myself before watching the movie in the theater. I enjoyed The Force Awakens quite a bit, even though it was just a microwaved original trilogy condensed into one movie. I enjoyed Rogue One a lot, it's nice to watch right before the originals. Then the movie started and I couldn't wait to leave the theater. If you're ever hired as a writer to murder a beloved franchise, take notes. You can tell that you succeeded when even the actors speak out against it in public. Good job, Disney."
3646,1,The saga continues? More like the saga is destroyed,Most of these reviews are spot on and express the disappointment perfectly. <br /><br />So I'll keep this short......<br /><br />The star wars franchise has been completely ruined and I do not see a way back from this abomination.<br /><br />Thank you Disney for ruining my life long love for star wars.<br /><br />Never been so disappointed at a film in my life!!! <br /><br />Would prefer jar jar Bink's being a Jedi master!!
3647,1,Disney has destroyed Star Wars!,"This movie should have been named ""The Last Star Wars."" I want my money back!"
3648,1,WWII in space for the Wokest generation,"As a kid in the 1980s I liked Star Wars but the prequels and sloppy seconds? Thirds? Fifths?... they're delivering now bear no resemblance to those first movies. In those first ones, we had to suspend disbelief to some extent regarding all the rules of physics that were broken left and right, but at least in those first films they kind of stay true to the bent rules they created. In this garbage pile of a film, they don't even keep their own rules! In one ridiculous scene space bombers lumber through the vacuum of space like heavy laden WWII bombers on a bombing run over Germany, as fighter escorts are shot out of the sky? Space? And fall down to the ground? Ship? - onto which they crash and burn. ""Bomb bay doors"" open and drop bombs which fall down onto the ship, as though there's gravity? People wearing basically the exact WWII bomber crew outfits (as if technology and battle strategy remains the same as it did in the 1940s) don't get sucked out of their ships when they open the bomb bay doors...yet moments later, Leia gets sucked out of her command ship as though there's some maniacal 2 year old flipping a physics switch on and off repeatedly just to mess with everybody. Which is it??? Is there gravity in space? Yes or no? Is space a vacuum? Yes or no? Pick something and stay with it at least! Anyways, I laughed at this trash for 30 minutes then turned it off."
3649,2,A film that is shockingly disrespectful of the original trilogy,Great kids action movie if you don't know anything about Wtar Wars.... Blasphemous rubbish if you do. A lot of easy choices made for shock value at the expense of the originals. Poor writing for easy payoffs. An absolute disgrace and disappointment in my opinion.
3650,1,Why Does Rian Johnson Despise Star Wars?,"I grew up with Star Wars. My dad sat me down on our family couch when I was 5 and showed me the original trilogy. It's been something I have shared with him for over 2 decades. His love for the universe spans back to when the originals came out and he watched them in the theaters. I have watched every Star Wars film that came out with him in theaters beyond the original trilogy. I remember being overjoyed when my father picked up Star Wars books for me, and toys. If you share memories like this, then this film...this film..is an abomination."
3651,1,Not just a bad Star Wars movie,"Where do you start, OK past, present and future.<br /><br />Past, The original trilogy was fantastic, not because of state of the art special effects but the story was built around characters and their interactions and friendships/romance that drew you in and made you invest emotionally in them.<br /><br />R2D2 and C3PO Han and Luke, Luke and Ben/Yoda Leia and Han Chewie and Han.<br /><br />Small thing when the Jawas capture R2D2 in the first film and he/she falls over every single person in the audience went ahhhhh no massive special effects dialogue or space battles just good music and writing the scene.<br /><br />The interplay between characters and humour made you believe they actually liked each other.<br /><br />Present, Mary Sue Rey who can fly a spaceship with no training, swim when she lives on a desert planet, can hold her own after just picking up a LS, she did not earn or learn anything.<br /><br />The interactions between characters is so awkward, I don't know how the movie was shot but you would think perhaps they were jumping from scene to scene or it may have been the editing as there seems to be no flow to it just one level, flat.<br /><br />I wont go into the plot and stupid side plot as a 10 year old could have written better on a cornflakes box so many holes and inconsistencies and everyone behaving out of character, I wouldn't let these generals run a tap let alone a resistance.<br /><br />Future, For Star Wars I can't see Solo doing that well or the next full blown Star Wars as I think they have disenfranchised a high proportion of their fan base.<br /><br />I certainly wont be investing any time or money watching them or buying the DVD for this one.<br /><br />These are my personal thoughts on the matter, yours may differ but hey that's fine film is art and you like what you like."
3652,1,I am just dissapointed!,Can't belive they killed all of the old heroes and not enough by that they made Luke a grumpy old man living on an island and milking some weird alien cow.
3653,3,It's too bad...,"Disney ruined Star Wars, This movie doesn't feel apart of Star Wars!"
3654,1,Worst Star Wars film ever,I pray JJ can save it. Rian Johnson butchered it. I wish LucasFilms would smarten up
3655,1,A shame,There is not much to be said apart from the fact that this movie is an utter and shameful disaster.
3656,1,New Powers Out of Nowhere,"When did any Jedi or Sith lord had the power to fly in space, survive the vacuum of space and breath in space after their spaceship blows up? And the answer to that question is never until somehow Leia gets this magical power out of nowhere. Only 1 good scene in the movie and the rest of it is just trash. Not going to waste my time or money on the last movie."
3657,2,"A sad, sad day for the Star Wars universe.","As a life long fan of STAR WARS, this movie was just devastating. "
3658,2,WTF Happened??,"While The Force Awakens wasn't perfect, I still thought it was pretty good. I also loved Rogue One, to the point I saw it 5 times in the box office. The Last Jedi though? I don't plan to see it again. What happened to the serious aspects that JJ Abrahams gave us? The serious movie that Rogue One gave us. Why did TLJ revert back to George Lucas-style campy humor???? FFS, this movie was just a step away from giving us Ewoks and/or Jar Jar comedic effects. "
3659,1,Only Jar Jar can top this....,"I love Star Wars. I'm a huge fan. And i really loved Star Wars VII. But man, this was the most boring Star Wars movie. Almost no character development, boring action scenes and lame, forced comedy. It had some great shots and scenes, but overall it's a very dissapointing movie. I never imagined i could give a Star Wars movie such bad rating."
3660,3,A one sentence review,"*** Sweeping the hand through the air *** ""This is not the episode you are looking for."""
3661,1,An unmitigated disaster,"Congratulations to Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, and Bob Iger. You have all dumped gasoline on one of the most beloved saga's in the history of film and set it ablaze. Here are some thoughts and questions from 150 of the longest minutes of my life:"
3662,5,Dissapointing movie,"This is a dissapointment because it had a great marketing and included LUKE SKYWALKER but turned out to be a boring dissapointment with Rey pretty much the whole movie asking for Luke to help, and sometimes seeing Finn and Zoe scenes that are a bit entertaining. Luke in this movie does pretty much nothing and it was just very dissapointed because i was excited to see Luke in this movie but not like this."
3663,3,I was ANGRY 1/3 through the movie,"Be prepared to let out angry gaffaws and make friends with any Star Wars fans sitting next to you, bonding over your mutual disgust. This movie is utter garbage. Rian Johnson should just retire in shame after this. "
3664,3,Makes you lose interest in Star Wars universe,"Some years ago, I purchased a DVD box of the first Star Wars trilogy (episodes 4, 5 and 6). Hadn't seen the movies for quite a while, I planned to watch them over a few evenings to make the pleasure last. I ended up watching all three movies in a row, probably for around 9 hours straight...as the movies were just so good and I could not resist watching one after another."
3665,3,"I look forward to the 3rd film, hopefully it will be a 9 hour long musical exploring intersectionality.","This disgraceful piece of excrement has been so effectively savaged since its release, I don't have much useful to add. My testicles retracted back into my stomach with the hilarious yo' mama joke and just kept on retracting for the rest of the 'film'. They're still not quite right. At least I only wasted time watching this installment."
3666,2,massive let down,What a horribly written film. Disney should remove it from canon and remake it. But they won't or listen to fans. The way these Hollywood execs are today. All about their egos and not about the fans who make them the money.
3667,1,How did this get approved for release,"Long, slow and predictable. They could easily shave off 30 mins by removing the really bad attempt at humour and trying to be like Marvel. Leia surviving in space? Have they really ran out of ideas? Its just like Empire Strikes Back. I know full well how episode 9 will go now, will save my money and watch Return of the Jedi instead. Another cash cow franchise with no originality."
3668,2,Funny comedy,It is the story of an emotionally scarred boy who throws temper tantrums when chicks don't respond to him and a stalker girl who keeps crashing the dude with video messages. To the writer and director: come on. Stop the gag. Tell the guy he can adjust his privacy setting to 'ask first....'.<br /><br />I also think it proves to me yet again that the folk behind Star Wars are cool and have a sense of humour. They let Yoda's character appear in this film and take the piss out of it. Cool.
3669,3,Boring Movie,"Realy bad characters, the scrip is boring, nothin realy importan happe, you will you forget quik wath happen in this movie..."
3670,1,A compilation of reviews on The Last Jedi,What did i just watch?
3671,1,The Last Star Wars movie I'll pay to see,"I've been a Star Wars fan since seeing the very first one in the theater in the 1970's. I have passed down my love of Star Wars to my children and grandson.<br /><br />The Last Jedi is where the love affair ended. After the perfect set up of Force Awakens, I was vested in how the story would progress.<br /><br />Sadly (and angrily) Rian Johnson had ZERO grasp of the Star Wars universe. I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a sequel since the Indiana Jones Crystal Skull debacle.<br /><br />This goes beyond disappointment because the story and characters have been completely ruined. So sadly, that will be the Last Star Wars movie I will pay to see."
3672,2,I Am An Asian Girl,"And unlike the reviews I don't see myself in this film. I mean I didn't need to see myself in the first place but when the reviewers write that I can see myself because they added an Asian girl I have to say this girl was curvier than most Asian girls so not really a typical Asian girl so what is the point?<br /><br />Anyway, the events are disconnected and too many coincidences happen. They know where a key maker is and they land right next to him.. so on and so forth..."
3673,1,**** Rian Johnson,Rian Johnson should never be anywhere near star wars again. He is a lore destryer
3674,1,Absolutely terrible,"I love star wars.There was nothing good about this film Johnston has ruined the franchise. Luke using the force too much kills him, enough said."
3675,1,I'm ~50 years old. This movie deliberately tried to ruin my childhood,"I'm declaring TLJ the worst episodic movies I've ever created. Even worse than the horribleness called ""Batman vs Superman""."
3676,3,"Missed opportunity and useless Charakters, just a big disappointment","The movie had some great potential but it was just wasted. So many new characters were established in episode VII but they all were just killed or there storyline was just wasted.<br /><br />And what about the Knights of Ren they weren't mentioned once and who the hell is Snoke he was just killed without any explanation. And why is Rey so powerfull it took her just a few days to learn all the stuff, other Jedi needed years to get to this level of power. <br /><br />I won't even talk about the silly jokes and some of the weird stuff Luke was doing at his Island.<br /><br />Probaly the worst Star Wars movie.<br /><br />You have to say the camerawork and effects were really good."
3677,1,Over three years after seeing in theaters,"This is still the worst movie of all time. I'm still mad about it. After all this time, I doubt I'll ever get over it. I plan to go through all of my ratings on IMDB and change every other rating to a minimum of 2, because this movie reached a new low."
3678,1,a movie for people who hate Star Wars,"This is essentially a parody movie, where the purpose is to ridicule the fans and the plot of a popular story."
3679,1,Luciferian Hollywood Elites are now attacking our childhoods. PROTEST Ep.9!!! *no spoilers*,"Truly the worst film ever made. 'Caravan of Courage' is a vastly superior film, I'm not kidding. If J.J. Abrams thinks this is about sexism than he's just as much of a tool as Rian Johnson. I have never been more sickened by a film in my entire life. Within ten minutes I wanted to walk out of the theatre but I stayed because I didn't want to ruin it for my naive friend who didn't understand the tragedy we would endure for the next 2 hours. A despicable and blatantly disrespectful kick to the chops of SW fans everywhere. Now that George doesn't own SW, the hollywood/disney luciferian elites have clearly been toiling day and night to piss us off and crush our childhoods with this abomination of a film. I'm speechless at how bad the story was, the writing, the needless comic relief from EVERY character. The purple haired lady from jurassic park is obviously a coke head and blew her way into the movie. Fire Kathleen Kennedy!!! PROTEST EP9 at your local theatre. Rise up against this hollywood cult that is intentionally making Star Wars a mindless/soulless parody. And as far as the 7.4 stars that IMDB claims this film is rated...it's obviously rigged with bots and multiple account using brown nosing pieces of garbage. STAR WARS IS DEAD. good riddance"
3680,2,A complete mess,"Most reviewers have adequately captured why this movie is a train wreck. From awkward and poorly timed humor, to gaping plot holes, to gut wrenching moments which will be remembered for all the wrong reasons (eg Leia Poppins, Canto sequence), to destroying prior canon, to two laughably incompetent military factions, etc. I'd like to focus on a few problems I have with this movie aside from the above:"
3681,1,Absolute Garbage,It is a shame that this is called Star Wars. This should be banned. I want to scratch out my eyes. Nobody should be able to watch this. Even Sharknado is better!
3682,1,No More Star Wars for me......,"This was it. I am not paying my money for another Star Wars movie ever again. Fell for it twice! Not anymore. Discovered disney is just in it for the money, and not for the franchise or artistic value. People who made Rogue One had heart and made it with passion and respect for the franchise. Do you think we audiences are fools and can be cheated this way!? You must have known it's going to end somewhere, sometime. If you think you can stretch this into enternity then think again, its over and right now. The storyline of Force Awakens and Last Jedi makes even the Star Wars prequels look good! And that is not a compliment, in case you wondered...."
3683,1,ewwww just ewwww,"This sucks and I wish it didn't exist, this is a disgrace to the franchise, get this off the franchise. Now! Looking at it just makes sick EWW JUST GET OFF DAMNIT, ITS A BAD MOVIE BOOOOO"
3684,1,Worst Film & Director of the Saga,"Everyone has already said everything there is to say about how bad this piece of trash movie is, So I will just say that I myself am one of the thousands who were insulted and let down by how Rian Johnson has dismantled characters and story lines that fans from around the world have loved all their lives, and in their stead, replaced them with sad, disjointed and pathetic versions of themselves, all in the name of ""going in a new, fresh directions that hasnt been done before in the SW universe""."
3685,1,A Disney-fied INSULT to Star Wars fans,"The Last Jedi. With a title like that, it's no surprise that Star Wars Episode VIII was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The implications and perceived darkness of the title and trailers gave mega-fans like me more hype than we could handle, especially coming off the nostalgic and satisfying Force Awakens, which was a grand-slam commercially, critically, and most importantly: with the fans. I bought my tickets at first release, wore my favorite Star Wars shirt, and arrived at the theater expecting great things and to be blown away again.. but I can't believe I'm saying this: I left The Last Jedi disappointed & feeling like I got insulted by an old friend."
3686,1,How can a movie be so bad???,"I am a big fan of the series, having watched all episodes many, many times. This movie is more like a failed SPACEBALLS attempt than anything worth of the Star Wars brand and producers should be ashamed of the final result. I do wonder if IDMB system has been hacked by bots or paid reviewers as all comments look quite negative and, despite of this, the overall grade of the good looks good. Can somebody explain this to me?"
3687,1,A disgrace,If you thought this movie was good please do not have children
3688,1,The greatest jedi dies,"Everyone has been waiting for to se Luke skywalker in action for a very long time!!<br /><br />But they just kill him in his first movie.... its SUCKS! And thats why the movie is bad to, they distroyed the whole star wars feeling for me and for many more people!!"
3689,3,So wrong,"The way this treats Luke is so wrong. This is not the Luke Skywalker of the previous movies and this is not how a Jedi, especially Luke, would behave. And honestly I don't find the new characters interesting or inspiring in anyway, so I just don't care what happens to them. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it has made me look into the legends and expanded universe which I previously skipped. I just finished watching StarWars TheCloneWars animated series which was amazing and true to the StarWars core. I've just started watching Rebels and also started reading from the books (finished Ahsoka Tano and now started Shatterpoint). The ""new canon"" StarWars story line is dead to me now, and I seriously doubt they can fix it for me with episode IX unless it starts with Han waking Luke, Han: ""hey kid, having a bad dream"", Luke: ""Han you wouldn't believe it if told you"", Han: ""try me"". ""canon"" ended at ReturnOfTheJedi for me, and I don't care where they go with these new characters and story. The only true StarWars remaining is ""legends""."
3690,1,Terrible - hard to watch,"It was a suffering to watch. The story is non sense. There wasn't a single decent character. What the hell is this Adam Driver, is he an actor? I dont think that George Lucas saw this piece, otherwise he wouldn't had approved it."
3691,1,So disappointing,"Chewie being deprived of dinner would have ended up in the deleted scenes with real editing - but in this case they put propaganda (eating meat, weapons dealers, racing animals and more) - so much awful logic - she was trained during the sort time their energy was being depleted and they were being attacked) - taking away the saving crippling sacrifice and more...<br /><br />Blown up and floating in space but then wake up and pulls herself in?<br /><br />So many logic fails! So many attempts to make something appear cool but threw logic out the window...awful awful awful.<br /><br />I enjoy shutting my brain off, but too many times they crossed the lines from fantasy into stupidity.<br /><br />I can see why people hated it and are demanding it be forgotten."
3692,1,Trash-ruined forever,I don't know where to even begin so I will keep this short and sweet. Disney ruined star wars forever.
3693,1,Shame,I wasn't expecting a good film before watching but you have no right to do this to the real Star Wars fans.
3694,4,Be Honest With Yourself,"Be honest with yourself, were you entertained? Did you actually have this feeling like, ""Wow, I'm having a great time and enjoying this story and characters."" If you did, I think you're lying to yourself. It does not have the magic of Eps 4-6. Overall, just another Star Wars film that ""exists"". Hey Disney, don't make movies that just exist, make them special."
3695,1,Worst Star Wars Movie EVER MADE!,If u think this movie good o should see a doctor.How the **** they did this trash...
3696,2,How does this film have a rating so high when all the user reviews are so abyssmal?,"This film showcases truly terrible writing, to the point that you will spend more time trying to figure out what is going on than you spend waiting for it to be over. For an extensive take down, see MauLer on youtube. He takes time to fully explore just how impotent the writing is for this film. 2 stars because some of the CGI was top notch."
3697,1,This is NOT Star Wars,"This movie is not Star Wars, it tries to be Star Wars, but it is not. It is as if the director decided to change the fundamental core, spiritual and foundation of Star Wars and don't give a Damm!!!"
3698,4,We were pretty disappointed...,"My friends and I went to see this. We're all Star Wars fans and have seen all of the other movies. I loved the original series, the prequels and The Force Awakens. We were all really excited to see the next thing the Star Wars universe had in store. "
3699,1,Why?,"Just got through watching this after The Force Awakens.<br /><br />I am new to star wars and thought I would catch up on the most recent ones.<br /><br />The first one was ok, This one just made no sense.<br /><br />Maybe they rushed it?"
3700,5,huge letdown,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Rogue One and The Force Awakens, I had high hopes for this movie."
3701,3,Not a very good sequel,"Terrible follow up to force awakens. If your expecting answers and an epic return of luke you are not going to get it. They changed director which was a bad move an I understand how people feel times change so movies need to change but when you have such huge success with force awakens you should follow on from that an not change the tone an ignore all questions asked from the previous film. Visually it's great, acting they did the job they were told but story an creative wise is just awful. Rise of sky walker followed trying to correct this films mistakes but this film did more damage than good. Go back an watch the originals or even the prequels as you won't feel as let down as this movie will leave you feeling."
3702,2,Forgettable and bland,"I loved the previous movie but this mess of a film was just absolutely horrible. It's not even so bad that it's funny, in fact it's just forgettable. The special effects were cool though."
3703,2,The Disneyfication of Star Wars... (a few spoilers),"It saddens me to write this, but as much as I was looking forward to this movie I found it to be generally disappointing. I'll keep it brief-"
3704,1,My very first rating on IMDB,"I just need to add my personal impression to this movie, because Star Wars was (not ""is"" anymore) an epic fantasy saga with a lot of humanity and focused on characters.<br /><br />Now it is just some forgettable Marvelish Avengerish useless movie.<br /><br />Wait, some of those movies are actually good, but overall they are not at all close to any Star Wars movie, but this.<br /><br />Plot is very, very bad. <br /><br />Everything ""good"" in the movie is just a predictable copy-paste from the first trilogy. The new things are just horrible and make no sense.<br /><br />I could go deeper into details, but I feel it would be wasted time for this garbage.<br /><br />I had fun watching this, because I was with friends and we were actually enjoying laughing at every crap proposed. But then I slept over this and woken up just angry.<br /><br />Dislaimer: I am not at all an hater of any sort. I just like good things. This movie wasn't AND ruined the saga."
3705,2,Milk-force is strong in this one,"I would have rated this movie 1/10, but I have to give motion to the argument that Luke milking an enormous sea cow was funny and not sad. Not sad at all."
3706,1,The last remake? Hopefully,"The Last Jedi has a lot of problems, mainly, in my opinion, it's single greatest problem is that the man chosen to make this film doesn't understand, or like, or sympathize in any way with the necessary subject matter of his film."
3707,1,what did they do to star wars??,"With this movie they destroyed the franchise, maybe they are looking for a different audience, because if you grew up in the 80's then you won't find it as good as the original movies. Bad guys men. Men in Power bad, (supreme leader, kylo, hux) women in power good, Leya, Rey, holdo) Even poe was made out to be incompetent. I don't know where they are taking the franchise, but its not a continuation of the original. Its a rewritten narrative to pander to the views of todays audience. "
3708,1,It is the worst Star Wars movie ever made,It is the worst Star Wars movie ever made.<br /><br />I still cry when I think about it. If this was a Transformers movie I would like it more.
3709,3,Disappointing,"The story is very short and direct. Not much there. The visual effects are good though. It got a boost from the title ""Star Wars"". It was just empty as a story. Rebels found, run, get caught and defend themselves. That's it. The ending is bad as well. I would not have purchased it if I had known."
3710,3,Luke Skywalker Deserved Better.,"After J.J. Abrams had written drafts for both Episode 8 & 9, Rian Johnson opposes this and decides to ruin any character or story development created by 'The Force Awakens.' I attempted to watch this again just recently after watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' in the hope that memory didn't serve me well. But alas, it was as equally as frustrating to view as my initial cinema viewing."
3711,1,Force Dump,"Disney and Rian Johnson took a massive force dump with 'TLJ'. Having seen this at the cinema, I was bored for the vast majority of it. The comic relief was more akin to a Marvel movie, and didn't work. The film has clearly been imbued with a feministic ideology with Rey, who seemingly can do no wrong. Princess Leia was a perfect example of a strong woman on the originals, because she could often best the brash, roguish cockiness and egotism of Hans Solo. It creates genuine character chemistry, and they were a believable couples because they were equals. The character of Rey not only is capable of best a trained pupil of the force in 'TFA', in Kylo Ten/Ben Solo, but unbelievably gets the better of Grandmaster Luke Skywalker - who isn't anything like Luke Skywalker now, purely out of character subversion, and for no other demonstrable reason - despite having zero training or even prior knowledge of Jedi, Sith, or the force in general until sometime part way through 'TFA'. In the originals, Luke Skywalker was the underdog, and that uphill struggle, the odds clearly been stacked against him, made him vulnerable, raised the stakes, and ramped up the tension. Many would still argue that Luke Skywalker was always a bit of a naff Jedi, but understandably and believably so, due to varying reasons. When a character is so perfect as Rey, there's no risk, and therefore no tangible sense of danger or tension that arises from such danger. That's only part of what is wrong with both 'TFA', and to a greater extent, 'TLJ'. At least 'TFA', despite sharing similar shortcomings, remembered to entertain. Maybe not as much as it could and should have, but a lot more than 'TLJ'."
3712,1,Go and watch Spaceballs (1987),"Since both Spaceballs and The last jedi are a parody of Star wars i recomend that you watch Spaceballs and see where Rian got his ideas, and because Spaceballs is actually funny."
3713,2,Kill the Past,"Good parts: <br /><br />(1) Porgs <br /><br />(2) Some Luke Skywalker scenes, although his character was virtually unrecognisable from the original trilogy <br /><br />(3) Very good space battles <br /><br />(4) Luke's reunion with Artoo <br /><br />(5) I felt Finn and Poe were more likeable in this movie compared to Force Awakens <br /><br />(6) Most Princess Leia scenes, except where she flies through space <br /><br />(7) Mark Hamill was exceptional. I never wanted him off screen. "
3714,1,Star Wars is dead. Disney killed it.,"First of all, if you haven't seen the movie and are trying to figure out whether this movie is worth watching, then do yourself a favor and watch something else. I beg you, don't waste 3 hours of your life on this rubbish! You will thank me later."
3715,5,lots of plot holes,Things i don't understand:
3716,3,No inventinveness whatsoever,"I'm not a 'Comic book store guy' fan Star Wars. I simply liked the first few movies. The original movies were good because they were inventive. The Last Jedi simply has no inventiveness. They are supposed to be creating a Galaxy far away, but we get the tired old Naziesque 'Axis' Empire and obviously 'Allied' resistance rebels. That was adequate in the 1980's but now we need more depth of thought, intelligence and spirituality."
3717,3,Went waaay off course.,Movie has action drama and all that stuff but there were many times I wondered if I was even watching a starwars movie. When even Mark Hamil didn't even like the movie himself that says a lot. I get they are trying new thing for the new generation but come on bro stay within the rules of the game. No spoilers here.
3718,1,First Stars Wars movie that I didn't see multiple times in the Theater,I can't believe I am saying this but this movie made the prequels look like Shakespeare.
3719,1,Very poor. They just turned Star Wars into a sunday afternoon movie,"""Well done"" for turning such an epic sequel into a casual sunday afternoon tv movie...<br /><br />Plot was very weak, shallow and full of cliché corny ""jokes"" that were completely off the spirit of the film. <br /><br />Too bad to believe. Please don't make any more Star Wars movies. Let's preserve the excellency of the old films. This is just to disrespectful and embarrassing."
3720,4,Awful,After watching force awakens I was so hyped I thought this would be the best Star Wars movie ever but what me and others fans got was a piece of garbage the movie doesn't make any sense the mission of Finn and rose makes no sense there was even no point in including that mission if you were going to make them fail and they ruined one of my favorite characters Luke skywalk and the Holdo maneuver doesn't even make any sense this whole movie doesn't even make any sense watch this movie of you want to watch the worst movie ever.
3721,1,"Stunning visuel movie, HORRIBLE Star Wars movie",The movie itself is well created. It´s beautiful visuels great space battles and so on. But thats about it.
3722,3,Let The Last Jedi Die,"Like many of the other reviewers, the main problems I had with this movie are:"
3723,1,BOYCOTT episode 9,Seriously what is this?
3724,1,Saddening,"Absolutely positively worst Star Wars movie ever . Probably good to your casual movie goer and children , but no thanks for me . I can't beleive I am not looking forward to the next movie and I don't see how the the franchise can come back from that ."
3725,1,abomination,"The movie was an abomination to all Star Wars fans. It was so bad it killed the fan in me and my family. Where to start? How about with some of the lessons we learn in the film, Rey taught us that family is irrelevant, the purple haired Admiral Holdo taught us never to question authority, especially female authority, from Rose we learn that capitalism is evil (these are communist manifesto themes), and also animals have rights too, and men are disposable. Ryan Johnson the director hates the star wars fans so much, he humiliated the hero Luke Skywalker and made him a grumpy old pessimist. He killed star wars lore with using light speed as the ultimate weapon (now all you have to do is make some drone ships equipped with light speed to easily take down any Empire fleet or Death Star). I can go on and on and on and on....The one light in the movie was the battle with Snoke. I hope Disney fires Ryan Johnson and starts listening to fans, otherwise they will implode"
3726,1,An Abomination of a film Terrible story and directing with a disregard for the franchise,"This film was bad on so many levels i love the Star Wars Franchise including TFA so i have no bias,this was just bad the story was terrible filled with plot holes and politics and a total disregard to the Story,<br /><br />So sad Disney should be ashamed."
3727,1,Its all a Jar Jar dream? it's the only explanation,"Or its a Justin Bieber video with Benicio del toro improving him dialogues when they say: ""action!<br /><br />Please someone try to explain me what this movie it's about...<br /><br />No.... seriously. We all are guilty for fell in a nostalgic rape of our menories, and go and see this awful garbage. When episode VII was the beginnin' of the end.<br /><br />YOU GOT THE LESSON?<br /><br />Buy ""Spaceballs"" DVD... go and buy some flowers to your grandma, trow your money for your window, go and see last Julia Roberts comedy."
3728,1,Worst Star Wars Movie ever,"This movie had more plot holes and bad acting than Showgirls.. I could not wait for it to end. Everyone in the theater pretty much felt the same way.. Laura Dern was so stiff that I thought she was a mannequin. Without spoiling too much, the first ridiculous plothole was the whole bombing run. I guess they forgot that there is NO gravity in space....so dropping bombs on a moving space ship is pretty much impossible (as they would not fall) and why were the bombers so close together that when the first one blew up it would wipe out the whole squadron???? It was all downhill after that."
3729,1,Could be the worst film in the franchise,"I reckon once the dust settles on this film the backlash will begin, and you will see film critics doing a massive U turn on this film soon. Right now they are caught up in the hype and are too afraid to give it a bad review for fear of being ridiculed, particularly as the film did lots of nice PC correctness box-ticking and going against type, which critics usually love. The more I think about it, the more disappointed I get now with this film. There is so much wrong with it, its easier to focus on what actually works in the movie, and the answer is very little. Too many storylines, the whole prequel-type CGI casino scenes with Finn and Rose was not needed at all, too many unnecessary twists were the film was trying too hard to be clever, but most unforgivably - destroying Luke Skywalker's character. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters by the end of the movie. It was trying too hard to be too box-ticking PC correct too - vegetarian is good, being rich is bad, religion is bad, everyone is equal, you don't need to be a Skywalker to be a Jedi, anyone can be a Jedi, etc. Terrible film, and may actually be the worst film in the entire franchise (how is that even remotely possible after all the hard work achieved with Force Awakens and Rogue One?)"
3730,1,"Wow, he Johnson'd That","Thanks Rian Johnson, you've done the impossible and destroyed the single most important entertainment franchise in history. Thanks."
3731,1,I still want my ticket money back!,In all my years of movie watching this has to be not just the worst Star Wars movie of all time but the worst movie I've ever seen! This movie took a dump on everything JJ Abraham's set up and was nothing more than a political vomit of a movie!! This movie put me off Star Wars forever! If you can avoid watching this dumpster fire I'd recommend it.
3732,5,"Big gaps in the story, bad jokes and overlength",The last Jedi ist the worst star wars experience i've ever had. After the force awakens there were alot of open questions and i had a lot of hope for the next movie. But Star Wars 8 was a big disappointment. The good storylines created in Part 7 got ignored in the last jedi.<br /><br />Alot of really unfunny jokes like the Iron in the Base of the First Order... wtf guys?! The little crappy animals which are only good for merchandising or the your mother - joke ...<br /><br />Earlier Star Wars did not try to make bad jokes ... the jokes were more decent... they came in the situtions and the dialogues.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker.... maybe The Last Jedi was the best performance from Mark Hamill... but he really can not change a bad story. Luke Skywalker... the man who did NEVER lost the hope in his father Darth Vader ... want to kill his nephew while he is sleeping????? Because there COULD BE darknes in his soul? Please guys...<br /><br />Another thing... the bombers right after the movie started... this slow and completely useles ~things~ need to fly over the enemy to DROP (not possible in space?!) the bombs??? Some Years ago the were some Y-Wings... maybe the should take some inspiration from George ..
3733,2,Disappointing on so many levels,"First of all, how can this movie be rated 7+ stars on IMDB? There must be some strange hacking-magic at work on this website, in order to save Disney's reputation. I've been a fan of Star Wars since I watched ""The Last Hope"" (at the drive-in) way back in 1977, and have loved it ever since then. While the prequels were mediocre at best, they still ""felt"" like Star Wars films, and I only criticized Episode I for its obvious flaws. However, Episode VII was the beginning of the end for the Star Wars franchise, and Episode VIII sent the franchise into a horrible oblivion. I left the theater feeling empty, extremely disappointed, and feeling as if my admiration and loyalty to the franchise had been completely stripped away after a 2+ hour viewing of this nonsense. Having said all of this, I did very much enjoy ""Rogue One"" and although it had some flaws, it was highly entertaining and ""felt"" like a Star Wars film, unlike episodes VII and VIII. ""The Last Jedi"" was a gigantic pile of trash, and anyone who defends it with a review (score) of anything higher than 5 should seriously stop watching movies for a while, or at least stop posting their reviews about them. In the meantime, I'll pretend that I never watched this, and the world will (again) become a better place."
3734,1,THe definition of Sad,I was not a fan of the previous installment and hoped that it would get better from there however this was just garbage and it is sad to think they are going to make a trilogy with this director.. oh well for as bad a George Lucas is at writing a movie at least his stories make sense. This was pure and utter nonsense that made me think Jar Jar was a good idea.
3735,1,The movie that could have been.,This movie is bad for many reasons. I'll list the things I find the most distressing about the movie.
3736,1,Id rarther cut myself,The fact that this sits still at 7.5 is suspicious as hell! In what has honestly been the worst year for star wars ever following from EA's Greedy saga this film is at the bottom of the pit!! Rogue one was incredible how did this come next!!!?
3737,1,Our investment betrayed.,"How is 7.4 rating possible?<br /><br />Imdb?hello?<br /><br />Plot holes, character assassination, subversion and politics all due to arrogance and disconnectedness."
3738,1,Is there anything to say that hasn't been said,No faithful lore or love in this movie. Slowest chase scene ever
3739,1,People can like whatever they want,"However... if you do like this movie AND consider yourself to be a Star Wars fan, honestly, I question your intelligence. This movie took a MASSIVE DUMP on all Lucas-era Star Wars stories, and it did it on purpose! I don't understand how Rian Johnson can call himself a fan of Star Wars when he gets to direct a mainstream Star Wars installment and go out of his way to destroy everything that comes before it. Rian Johnson is an idiot in isolation with this movie (he's actually made some good stuff in the past) and he is just so proud of it. I'm proud when I drop a clean deuce but I don't go around telling people about it. This movie (and the entire trilogy really) sucks so hard I will never watch them again."
3740,1,Pure crap,Disney turned star wars into a teenager series.<br /><br />Utter crap!
3741,1,"How dare you, Rian Johnson!",This is definitely the worst Star Wars movie EVER created. The whole plot is garbage.
3742,1,Beyond Words,"I've never written a review on here before.... but as a lifelong Star Wars fan, I felt compelled to do something when I saw that this movie was sitting at 8.0. "
3743,1,WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TO STAR WARS,"I wish there were negative stars or at least a ""0"". Ok, first off I don't live in my parents basement drinking Red Bull and playing with an X-box. I'm a blue collar worker who saw a New Hope when I was 8 years old. This movie was such an complete frustrating disappointing waste of time and money. I could not believe what I was seeing or having to listen too. Of course my kids laughed at the stupid jokes as I just shook my head in disbelief. I'm so pissed off at what has happened to Star Wars. Yes, this is just a movie and there are more important things happening in the world, but damn, come on!! Maybe George will come back, get rid of Kathleen and pull a ""Dallas"" dream season remake of this movie and make it like it should have been."
3744,5,Waste of time,"First of all, these are my own opinions.I watched whole saga more than six times except rogue one and the force awakens.If I disappoint you I'm truly sorry."
3745,5,Never before has Star Wars been so hollow,"There's no complaint here about the visual effects, and music (John Williams can do no wrong in my opinion), and by and large the cinematography on this film was great."
3746,1,What?,This film is a mess of a screenplay! So many plot holes it's ridiculous. And at 2-1/2 hrs it is painful. There is about 30-40 minutes where they are on the casino planet Canto Bight that could be removed and nothing would change! Very disappointed and if Disney is taking Star Wars in this direction than I am done! Disney needs to right the ship!
3747,2,"Bad, bad, bad","If it was a standalone movie like Rogue One or Solo, I could just let it be. After all, let them shoot what they want, I will pick what I like. But to throw THIS in the middle of a Star Wars trilogy? All characters totally out of their roles. New characters are so bad that the whole movie I expected some sudden twist that will show what dark secret they have, that forces them to behave so strangely. There is none; what they do is portrayed as normal."
3748,1,"""This is NOT the movie you're looking for""","I hope this is all just a Jedi mind trick, and that the ""real"" movie will be revealed tomorrow!"
3749,2,Rian Johnson? Who? RIP Star Wars :(,"First of all, who is Rian Johnson, is he really qualified to direct possibly the biggest movie franchise of all time? I checked his history... I think no."
3750,1,Real Fans will hate this,"If you're just looking for a good time, The Last Jedi is an excellent movie. Its extremely entertaining and well made as a film. As a huge star wars fan though(who bought tickets months before its release) its the worst in the franchise. The story just ruins every character, everything that happened was just a complete disappointment / anti-climactic. It is very poorly written in relation to the saga of 8 films it just followed. There is now nothing for JJ to work with for Episode 9."
3751,1,This is NOT Star Wars!,I have re-written this review so many times... there is just no way to express the frustration I feel for what Disney did with this franchise. The characters that we once knew are all destroyed by the Joke that was this screenplay. AHHHH! I give up.
3752,3,"Read this review, not others. (NO SPOILERS)","This isn't going to be what you expected, but to be honest, who did?"
3753,1,Disney Stop Deleting Negative Reviews,Disney ruined Star Wars.
3754,4,Why disney,Disney are the worst movie compeny in the world they took my favorite movies that i grew up with and threw them in a trahscan
3755,1,"Comedy gold, but not a SW movie.","Went into the TLJ fresh of mind without having read any reviews or articles, slightly hopeful after TFA which I thought was a respectable attempt at a SW movie even if it lacked (or tried to rip off) the magic from the original trilogy. Seated in the theater for TLJ, I got a bad feeling early on during the Poe/Hux scene and from that point nothing surprised me in terms of how bad the movie would get. Apparently Rian Johnson had been dying since he was a kid to make a sequel to Spaceballs and finally got his chance, good for him. The only other rationale is he is a very sorry excuse for a filmmaker and has zero understanding of the source material. Poor script, direction, characters, plot, costumes, sets, effects. Had the SW name not been attached to this film it would have been the biggest flop of the year. There are so many scenes in the film that could be parodied, it's a comedy goldmine of bad filmmaking. It's not only the worst SW installment to date--and I am not a fan of eps 1 -3--but truly one of the worst sci-fi movies I've seen, and I've seen 'em all. Yes, the pro critics love this film apparently, go figure. But in the real world it seems to be nearly universally despised by anyone with a love for SW or even a love for a good movie. I would question the judgment or honesty of any adult lavishing praise on this film. They are out of touch (i.e. insane) or flat out lying. I've been an IMDB member for nearly 20 years and this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review...er, rant. Disney *is* the First Order!"
3756,1,Better to never watch,Forget the last three movies happened they have really uninteresting characters and ruin our loved characters in the star wars franchise. Really bad writing.
3757,1,Bleh,"This was just a sad and pathetic entry on an overall great and beloved franchise.. Letting an egocentric, arrogant and unexperienced director to make the next CHAPTER (maybe a spinoff would have been ""ok"") of one of the greastest stories ever told was simply a huge mistake."
3758,1,Total Disappointment,"After TFA I think I can speak for everyone in saying that the hype was real & everyone wanted this movie to be great. Unfortunately the move falls flat on its face. Rian Johnson made a film as is the previous 7 Star Wars films weren't made. The Last Jedi has so many problems, it feels forced, at times rushed & not cohesive to the prior movie. This movie completely let me down & killed Star Wars."
3759,2,The Wal-Mart of movies,This is pure crap. Lowest of the low. Bottom of the barrel. 
3760,1,The Great Disappointment,How did 40 years of fandom riding the crest of the pop culture wave land us here?
3761,1,Worst star wars film ever,"After the destruction of the franchise by Disney in ep. 7 there was a tiny light of hope to recover from the stupid plot, the senseless carachters and the total LACK of Force elements... this light has faded... Shame on you Lucas, you should have never sold your precious toy"
3762,1,A sham,Me after TFA : This one is garbage
3763,4,Barely even canon at this point,"Visually astonishing, the score is fantastic, and the acting is amazing. Outside of that there's hardly anything good to say about this movie. A solid 50% of the movie is retconned in Rise of Skywalker."
3764,1,"Just awful, what were they thinking ?",I have never been a star wars fan but decided to watch them all in order after loving the mandolorian. I have now got to this film after enjoying in the old classics. I don't even know what I am watching.. it doesn't even feel like stars wars!
3765,3,"I Grew up on Star Wars, its soundtrack and toys","They were fun, mythical and provided me years of hour after hour of amusement and imagination."
3766,2,Style over Substance,"I will try to keep this as brief as possible, but I will provide a TL;DR version here in the beginning."
3767,4,The Emperor has no clothes ...,"I can't quite believe the hype this movie is getting from professional critics. It almost feels like people have agreed that any technically well-made film with the Star Wars name on it has got to be a great film. Well, let me be the party-pooper by pointing out the fact that, to me at least, the emperor is strolling around town butt naked."
3768,1,The worst film I have ever seen,"This is the worst film I have ever seen. The storyline, writing, CGI and acting are awful and some of the scenes (for example Leia in space, Luke with green milk....) are genuinely embarrassing. It is hard to watch."
3769,1,Good movie? Why?,I read some praising rewievers and they say:
3770,1,Star wars fans: Don't waste your time,Just don't waste your time.<br /><br />Go and watch the originals instead
3771,3,Pre-requisite to directing a Star Wars movie - WATCH a Star Wars movie,"*Wasted opportunity to have Leia die in an impactful way.<br /><br />*Dumb plot to have the movie industries slowest car chase. Reminds me of when Austin Powers ran over that guard with the steamroller.<br /><br />*Unnecessary side plot in the casino where they go find the guy with laziest name - The Code Breaker.<br /><br />*Star Wars had humor but it was chuckle humor so as not to take away from the immediate greater threat of the empire. Way too many attempts at bust-a-gut humor which fell flat.<br /><br />*Admiral Holdo is an idiot. (Watch the movie Recount, you will see Laura Dern play almost the same character, a raving idiot). As ex-military combat arms even a private knows the basic plan. <br /><br />*Hux is an idiot too. ""Hey those ships are flying towards that planet"". ""Naw they aint going there""<br /><br />*Giving Luke the greatest moment in star wars history showing him to be the ultimate badass we all knew he was, then ruining it by having him be a force illusion, then ruining it more by having him die by doing it. <br /><br />There are probably more but I have other things to do. Please Disney, listen to the petition, send this movie to where you keep the holiday special, and re-do it."
3772,1,Wow. Extremely Disappointing,"Force Awakens was by far and away the worst Star War movie............UNTIL The Last Jedi came out. It managed to make Force Awakens look even worse. Look at the VILLAINS in the 6 previous STAR WAR EPISODES. I'm talking Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Vader pre and post, Boba Fett, Rancor, Wampa, Sarlaac, COUNT DOOKU and Darth Maul, EMPEROR Palpatine, General GREVIOUS, JABBAH..........What do we get in this entire TRILOGY? We get Snoke who was a hologram only and then gets killed that quickly with no background about him given plus we get Kylo who 1) got beat by a young girl who never even knew she had the force let alone being trained in it and 2) We have no clue if he's good or bad. He is like Sandman from Spider-Man 3. Like WTF. So Episode 9 were talking more jobbling back n forth between Rey and Kylo with no other VILLAINS. General freakin HUX. He is the Sith apprentice of this Trilogy basically.<br /><br />AND WHO IS REYS PARENTS????????? nobodys really"
3773,2,crap,Crap movie - minimum word count so that I can submit this review.
3774,2,Still the worst one,"Looking back at this movie, it's still the worst Star Wars movie up to this date."
3775,1,Very poor star wars movie,"I tried so hard to like this, I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. As a big fan of star wars I was very disappointed by this movie, so many storylines that went nowhere, boring annoying characters, terrible treatment e'd legacy characters. Just give it a skip"
3776,1,Awful,"I created an account just to say how horrible this is. After the prequels, I would have thought it impossible to make Star Wars worse. Kathleen Kennedy and crew found a way."
3777,1,What you need to know about star wars and Disney spoliers!!,"First off everyone is wondering how this movie tile got 7.7 out of 10 stars now down to 7.4 stars which is still way to many stars for this title and how all the critics seem to say this is one of the best star wars created yet. Well it all comes down to money Disney paid 2 billion dollars to get this franchise there is no way they are going to lose money on this or break even that is not a profitable business. Also Disney needs to keep making money on this title after it gets old an by it having a very low rating or getting negative reviews by all the critics a new comer to the franchise might be discourage and not want to waste the time to watch it or buy it. This is disappointing me that IMDB a trusted site of mine would sell out a long with the critics but sometimes that is what you got to do to stay in the business. Now the problem is that star wars was a great fantasy world with a very interesting story and something new in each episode created (even star wars episodes 1-3 in my opinion deserve 8 stars as well). This series has flopped because Disney is as stated above in the business to make money an they do that very well but normally the mvoies they make are cartoon movies geared at the younger generation with the intent to sell toys or family orientated like Mary Popins that parents can take their kids to. This is why Disney making the new star wars was a bad idea star wars was not made to sell a bunch of junk to little kids or band wagon fanboys it was a movie for adults who liked the fantasy world and others getting into the fantasy world. Even though Disney has trashed star wars they are genius for making JJ. Abrams who is one of the worst writers and directors of our time to headline this movie because that is exactly what he does sells junk to people who do not understand good movies. An if you don't think JJ. Abrams had a hand in The Last Jedi you would be wrong this movie stinks of him watch some of his other movies if you can sit through them and than re watch this movie again if you can sit through it. Although JJ. Abrams was not mentioned in this title I bet he was pulling most of the strings, but if you want to put all the blame on Rian Johnson that is up to you. Also if you look at Rian Johnson's other works most of those titles are actually good so why wouldn't he try an take another chance at making another great film. Lastly if you watch the side movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story that is a much better movie than the main one because it has no affiliation with JJ. Abrams (still not as good as star wars episodes 1-6 but a mediocre movie if you want something to watch)."
3778,3,SJW conquers the galaxy.,"There's an astounding thin line that divide magic from ridiculous. The Lucas saga was able to turn on the magic but the Disney saga fails. <br /><br />The force, the jedi power, the empire's technology are magic stuffs that works. The princess leila flying into the space with an evening dress is only ridicolous.<br /><br />This movie have some good parts: finally an original plot, gorgeous space battles, and some character was improved.<br /><br />But all the subtle sjw propaganda that poisons the most of the film are irritating.<br /><br />We have a black guy, a woman and an asian that are ""the good"" fighting againsts stupid,awkward and hysterical militaries, we have learned that if you're rich you're surely a piece of s**t, there is a moment for a message about the animal rights, and fulsome situations with poors and slaved childs but strongs thanks to their own faith on rebellion against the fascism.<br /><br />I've no prejudices against black, asian, gay or left wing. But i wanted to see a fiction story, not yet another iteration of the movie ""V for Vendetta"""
3779,2,So this is how Star Wars dies...,"With thunderous laughter, and disappointment."
3780,1,This Movie Sucks Bantha Ass!,"So eager were we to see the return of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: The Last Jedi that we went to a 12:30am screening at a local cinema. From the outset, we couldn't believe what we were seeing. The story was terrible, the acting was terrible (save Mark Hamill) and the direction was terrible - even some of the special effects were suspect! And things went downhill from there. Following on from the brilliant Episode VII and the excellent Rogue One, Episode VIII is a poor, shameful and disappointing successor. Our main issues are:"
3781,3,Disney and the Dark Side,This was my greatest fear when Disney bought the franchise: that Star Wars would loose it's soul.
3782,1,Like a balloon; Fun but pointless and empty,"No big spoilers in this review...Because there were no big reveals in the movie to answer questions from The Force Awakens, which most of us can say was great but the next installment was going to have to answer a lot of questions, which it didn't. I feel like I just watched a movie that Rain Johnson payed Michael Bay to help with. Okay, maybe it wasn't that bad but it wasn't GREAT, and I think that's what we were all expecting after The Force Awakens."
3783,1,No clear direction for the series,"This film tries way to hard to adhere to the general Disney movie payout, and appeal to the ""general audience"". Garbage script and story. A parody of the franchise"
3784,3,This is not Star Wars,"After watching The Force Awakens and being utterly disappointed, I had little hope that this trilogy could recover. By watching Rogue One and being pleasantly surprised, there was ""a new hope"" in me that The Last Jedi might grow beyond TFA's flaws. And a attempt it did, there were moments in the movies, I thought had great potential, only to be ruined by lazy writing. "
3785,1,The End,"I have never written a review before, but after 5 months of deliberation I felt compelled to express my sincere disappointment at this film. I genuinely feel that this film has single handedly ended the Star Wars saga, and in the most disheartening way possible."
3786,1,"Terrible, just terrible.","While The Force Awakens was merely a re-skin of Episode IV, it did a decent job of relaunching the franchise. However, I had high hopes for TLJ after Rogue One, which is fantastic. "
3787,2,Like a spoiled meal,"Left the theater confused. The longer I let this percolate, the worse it got to take in."
3788,2,Could they have done worse?,I believe they could but they would have had to tried to make it bad on purpose. This movie made long for Mystery Science 3000 to come back and cut this movie to shreds. The opportunities to make fun of it are just endless. But let me summarize in an efficient way. This is some of the worse story telling I have ever seen in big budget movie. If you are invested in the franchise you will be heartbroken. If you are not you will be thoroughly confused for no reason. I wanted to like and delve into these characters but in the end I was routing for the First Order to kamikaze the whole galaxy. Someone else said positive ratings for this movie need to be investigated by Congress. Well Congress has more important things to do. But for me to take imdb or these other rating websites seriously again the average rating needs to below 6 for this movie. The movie only has 2 stars in my review for the visuals. Take 20 million out of the effects budget and 1 star might be too high.
3789,1,What was that??,"Politically correct, socially progressive piece of pandering garbage! It was riddled with plot holes and man bashing I forgot it was Star Wars."
3790,1,The worst!,"This movie made me lose faith in Disney Star Wars. The reasons are many, but mostly because: It didn't advance the storyline one bit. RJ was just hellbent on subverting and trolling the audience. His little ""gotcha"" moments with twists that went in absolutely no direction are annoying. All characters are wasted and/or ruined. Main character Rey is the most Mary Sue of Mary Sues. Plus the whole thing is boring, ridiculous and a mess."
3791,1,Ruin Johnson has killed a good thing,"This was hands down the worst Star Wars movie to ever hit the screens, and in my opinion, the worst movie of 2017. The plot is a jumbled mess from start to finish. Jokes were made, that made the film feel more like a knock off of Space Balls, rather than a Star Wars film. Luke is dead, both figuratively and literally. His character was butchered and became someone whom I could not support. The film is also filled with a lot of sexism and racism, disguised as social justice propaganda. This movie also takes the new characters that were introduced in TFA, and makes them all completely unrelatable and unlikable. The ending left me angry, confused, and utterly heart broken. There is no point in seeing episode 9, for all the Skywalkers are dead in the ""Skywalker Saga"", the new characters aren't worth watching, or rooting for in anyway. Best case scenario for episode 9, is that everyone dies in the first 10 minutes. I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone. May god have mercy on Ruin Johnson's Black soul"
3792,1,I hate this movie the more I think about it,"There are soooo many reasons this movie sucked I will point you to YouTube reviews that do a lengthy explanation. I could write a book as to all the hundreds of plot holes and things you have to shrug off you just can't shrug anymore. You can't shrug after the opening scene, furthermore; I actually thought about walking out during the movie."
3793,1,Writers are probably sith,I don't usually review movies. There's not much to be said that others haven't said already. The Last Jedi makes me not want to watch Star Wars any more.
3794,1,"A poor standalone movie, let alone when connected to others in the series","NO SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW<br /><br />Very surprised like most to see such glowing reviews from critics. Perhaps this is a film that will actually do some good as it has exposed the deep ties that the industry has, and the influence that it has, over supposedly independent critics. It is amusing to see how many articles are now coming out to try to explain the disconnect between many cinema goers and the critics. Most of them are twisting themselves in knots, blaming movie goers for simply being stuck in the past and not being able to take a new direction, but all ignore one main issue. And that is: EVEN ON IT'S OWN, THIS FILM HAS A TERRIBLE PLOT. You can read other reviews to see what I'm talking about. Suffice to say that the best description I can come up with is that it appears to have been written by a Star Wars/Lord of the Rings/Marvel fanboy who is 12 years old and has a severe case of Attention Deficit Disorder. Yes, it really is that incoherent."
3795,3,This is a true testament to how idiotic Rian Johnson is,"I honestly as a critic have zero idea what to say, the direction is sloppy, pacing is awful, the way it is written is like it was originally feminist propaganda which it still is, and don't even get me started on how they handled Luke! You know how to upset fans of the OG Trilogy and ruin christmas, show them this film, warm welcoming from Rian Johnson murderer of franchises!"
3796,1,The Force is Wrong with this one,The Good
3797,1,"As a Star Wars fan, this movie was a kick-in the gut. From a purely film perspective, it still is a terrible movie","If we look at The Last Jedi detached from our feelings on Star Wars and the characters, we are still left with a bad movie. It is a poorly executed film on all levels. The plot is rushed and jumbled and there were multiple occurrences where the movie felt that it was at its climax, but it kept pushing on. In many ways, I felt like I was watching three or four movies hastily pushed into one. The timeline of the movie is confusing as we have the plot with the Resistance fighters and the First Order occurring in the span of 18 hours, but these scenes are intercut with Rey and Luke's interactions, which clearly take place over several days. When we take into account Rey and Ren's force communications, the timeline does not line up. Rey has much more time in her story than the Resistance fighters do, but the movie tries to make it appear like the events are occurring simultaneously. Moreover, The Last Jedi takes place practically immediately after the events of The Force Awakens, but there is no explanation as to how the First Order regrouped so quickly after the destruction of the Starkiller Base or how Hux, Phasma, and Kylo Ren managed to survive the destruction of the base, as the audience never saw them leave the base in The Force Awakens. While Empire Strikes Back places years in between the events of the preceding movie and itself, The Last Jedi forgoes that and ends up leaving many loose ends left loose. <br /><br />The script is bad. The dialogue is forced and cheesy and feels genuinely out of place from what Star Wars movies have provided in the past. The editing borders on amateur. The special effects are a hot mess from hell. Characters move through the air in ways never shown before in Star Wars and it does not work. It looks cheap, it looks like a parody. <br /><br />The Last Jedi is bad as a movie, not just as a Star Wars movie. As a Star Wars fan, I felt physically ill watching the film. I nearly walked out several times, but stuck around hoping that I would find some small reward for my suffering. I did not. I was pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly in the stomach by this movie as a fan. As a film student, I was shocked by how Disney and Lucasfilm could allow a movie to be so poorly executed."
3798,1,Rian Johnson Chokes,"Rian Johnson had access to the best special effects studio in the world, world class acting talent, a studio with a seemingly limitless budget, and a franchise that has stood the test of time with religious followers numbering in the billions..."
3799,1,not a star wars movie,"As i sat watching this on screen abortion one thought resounded over and over in my head: nothing about this looked, sounded, or felt like a star wars movie. this is by far one of the biggest pieces of garbage i have ever seen. wish i could give it -10 stars, but sadly 1 is the lowest i can select"
3800,1,"""I felt a great disturbance in the Force""","I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly saddened. I fear something terrible has happened.""<br /><br />Shame on Disney for destroying the Star Wars franchise."
3801,1,Literally the worst movie I had ever seen,"My passion is terrible films, I go out searching for them. I've seen the Room, I've seen Open Water, but I'm pleased to announce I've found the worst film ever made. It felt like a pretentious 12 year old had written it in an afternoon, and wished they could insert a deep message, but couldn't seem to keep any character consistent in their motivation or beliefs. The plot made no sense, to both casual viewers and Star Wars fans as it is full of idiotic characters who always make the worst possible decisions in their situation just so the 'writer' could get the characters to where they wanted them, and where they wanted them to get to turned out to be dull as dishwater."
3802,1,"As a desecration of everything this franchise stands for, ""The Last Jedi"" does not deserve to be called ""Star Wars""","Disney pulled a bait-and-switch on the Star Wars fanbase. This isn't a Star Wars film, it's a dumb, dark drama with out-of-place childish humor that ignores all established Star Wars world-building and lore, not to mention rejects the mythological fantasy-based storytelling paradigm of the first six films in order to overtly push leftist propaganda. "
3803,1,The Worst Star Wars Movie .... and probably the worst movie of 2017!,"As a big star wars fan for decade, I felt so angry and sad at the moment when the end credit pop out .. this movie, has so much problem that I don't know how to start with...."
3804,1,Star Wars went off the rails ...,A disaster of unimaginable proportions...as TLJ made the Star Wars story arc implode. The character of Luke and the outcome of his character could not be redeemed by the final sequence. Luke Skywalker has become a sad and defeated hermit. The Jedi order never re-emerged... I really doubt if Mark Hamill really got behind this character... A lot of us fans are disappointed in this story at a Gut level. It doesn't feel like Star Wars . I didn't have a problem with the characters per se. I liked Rey and the way she was portrayed... but Luke did not feel like Luke...<br /><br />Also the ultimate villain Snoak was not formidable or even flushed out. Nothing more than a puppet really.
3805,3,"They are just trying to recycle star wars, not improve and continue it",SPOILERS BEWARE 
3806,1,massive disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this movie, especially with all the critics singing it praises ie better than empire strikes back. "
3807,1,Facepalm,"It's a crime against humanity what Rian Johnson did to the franchise with this film. He took 40 years of legacy crumpled it up and threw it in the trash. He tried to be bold and pivot the franchise into the future and failed miserably. A complete disrespect to the creator and fanbase that built this powerhouse of a franchise. The film should be struck from the record, Johnson should be arrested for vandalism and never be allowed near an established winner again."
3808,1,Really?,"I finally rewatched it from the theater release. (Btw, I Saw TFA 3 times in the theater)"
3809,1,Rian Johnson owes me $15 (and my childhood dreams of what Star Wars),I can't add more to what has already been said about how bad this movie is. It's so bad that I could only make it through the first 10 minutes when it showed up on Netflix.
3810,1,"Bring George Lucas back, Star Wars story is killed by Disney","The original expanded universe was better than this garbage, Disney are just making generic star wars films for a joke, this is not inspired by Joseph Campbell or any meaningful themes but by Disney's aspirations to make ridiculous amounts of money off these films and sell merchandise."
3811,1,This is one of the worst movies ever made!,"The Last Jedi is a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. It's so poorly written that you have to watch it more than once to find all the plotholes. There are no relatable characters, not even the old ones. Somehow the director managed to make every single person in this movie pointless and stupid. The storytelling is so bad in both episode 7 and 8 that it's impossible to make up for it in episode 9. Just scrap this trilogy and focus on making new Star Wars movies that's not connected to the 6 original films. Then they can experiment until they get it right."
3812,1,Changed my review significantly! Went from being the worst Star Wars film to being one of the WORST Ever films in history,People go to Star Wars for 2 reasons. Fantasy and Nostalgia. 
3813,3,Just a straight up a bad movie.,"Okay so, I have been letting this ruminate in my thoughts since the movie came out. I watched it twice, and disliked it both times. I hated it so much the first time I watched it that I sat for about half of the movie, with my arms crossed just waiting for it to be over (probably way too overdramatic but oh well) Let's get to the brass tax here. I am a huge film buff. So when I look at movies and critique them, I look at them from technical elements, to the structure and and all the other great stuff that makes a good film. This movie is not that. I love Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars film, but (in my opinion) one of the best films ever made. So watching this movie I had both my love of film and Star Wars going at the same time. The Star Wars fan in me really dislikes this movies for several reasons. Number One, because Luke says that everyone can use the Force, and that you don't have to be special to use it, VASTLY undermines his story in the OT. The whole point of him understanding how to use the Force is so critical to the story. His main motivation to leave Tatooine is so he can become a Jedi. His story from a literary standpoint is called ""The Heroes Journey"" which is so vital to his character. This movie takes his whole story and throws it out the window with that one line. This bothered me so badly. Luke Skywalker is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. His story is so perfectly crafted in those first films. I could write a book on how great his story is. Anyway, this also sweeps everything Yoda taught him under the rug. Yoda says ""Life creates it, makes it grow. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter."" The Force is bigger than anyone in the universe, that's why only certain people can tap into it. THATS THE POINT. ITS A CALL TO ACTION, TO MOTIVATE THE CHARACTERS INTO ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH THEIR LIVES. So the Last Jedi is telling me now that ANYONE can use it?? What??? Secondly, I hate how this just doesn't have almost any payoffs from the Force Awakens. I don't necessarily care that Snokes true identity is never revealed, I liked that! It would have been dumb to keep him anyway because he would have just been another Palpatine. I liked that they just said that Rey's parents were just random junkers. That makes her even more of an anomaly because she has no genetic connection to the Force, which would have made it even cooler that she can control it and made her special. But they ruined that now but saying anyone can use it. There's so much wasted opportunity in this movie. Anyway, my last point (before this gets too long, because I could go on for awhile) they should have had Rey and Kylo become a team. They could take down the First Order that way and completely ridden it of its existence in the universe. But no. They have to have a big fight scene on a random planet somewhere a half and hour after the movie should have ended. I can say I did like some things about the film. There's no denying that this film has a beautiful look to it. The cinematography is excellent! I liked how the Throne Room looked and that scene was great. I liked the chemistry between Finn and Rose. I liked Rose until she made the dumbest decision ever at the end. The structure of this movie is a mess though. Nobody accomplishes anything. The editing was weird, and every single piece of comedy fell flat for me, except for one in the beginning with C-3P0. I'm sorry for rambling and I'm sure no one will read this but I just really needed to get this all out."
3814,1,Embarrassing,"A total SJW propaganda piece. Took one my favorite stories and made it, unwatchable - to a degree that I cannot rationalize see the next movie"
3815,4,A Disrespect To Star Wars and It's Legacy,"The film was beyond being a disappointment , it was literally a mockery of human intelligence. They did not even tried to put something on the screen, they are just abusing the legacy of Star Wars and taking advantage of modern film technologies.<br /><br />Here are the reasons for this deduction:"
3816,1,Huge budget hides an awful movie.,"Avoided spoilers and theories as much as possible coming in to this movie. No reviews, nothing to shape my expectations except 1 trailer. I was stunned on how bad the writing was and at certain points I just stared at the screen in disbelief. Only reason I watched the whole movie was because I hope it would do a rogue one and get awesome in the end but sadly it just wrecked the entire star wars universe even more!! "
3817,1,The Force has left the building....,"This movie is the result of to many peer group surveys being applied to something original and good. The first 10 minutes I hoped I was caught in a really wicked commercial that wanted to make fun of Star Wars fans. But it was real. This is a movie worth not seeing. If you love Star Wars like I did, don't watch it. It is like revisiting one of the magic places of your childhood to learn that reality has turned it into landfill. "
3818,1,The end is near For the star wars franchise . Death of the Star wars saga :,"Star wars - The last jedi - The end approaches. The end of the hit franchisee that created a fan following all over the world. A story that stood strong for many decades. All good things must come to an end. So does the star wars saga .<br /><br /> Now in the clutches of walt disney it approaches a slow death. what was once a epitome of great characters and Inner conflict is now nothing but a movie full of gags , story line for a 4 year old to like and clap to."
3819,1,By far one of the worst movies of all time.,Read some of the other negative reviews. they cover what i thought.
3820,1,How embarrassing....how embarrassing....,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the most disappointing thing since George Lucas sold the rights to Disney. A hyped-up sequel to the ""A New Hope"" rip off, this movie is filled with cringe-worthy dialogue, an embarrassing story, terrible editing, massive plot holes, and a surprisingly awful film score. There are some good things about the film however, which confuses me because it's almost like watching two separate movies being smashed together.<br /><br />1) Apparently people can live in outer space now. In the opening fight sequence, the girl on the bomber lays on a beam that is open to outer space and suffers no consequences. Even though she later dies by explosion.<br /><br />2) The bridge of the ship that Leia is in gets hit by a shot and violently explodes and rips everyone into space. The next scene Leia is floating out and about and just wakes up and flies back to the ship. The doors open, and again everyone is exposed to space and nothing happens. Leia dies a very violent death and then just wakes up and goes back to the ship and takes a nap. 3) As the movie continues you realize that all the buildup of Mark Hamill reprising his role as Luke Skywalker is actually a negative thing. When the anticipated moment has finally been reached and Luke is handed his old light saber, he immediately tosses it over his shoulder. This light saber was created and used by his father. His father fought with this weapon in the Clone Wars. It was given to Luke by Obi-Wan. Luke was trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda. He used this light saber to fight his father and save his friends. He turned his father back to the light side and defeated the Emperor once and for all. And in this moment in TLJ all of this history was thrown in the trash. I guess disregard everything that took place from 1977-2005. None of that matters. Luke is absolutely pathetic and behaves completely out of character. He hates the Jedi? He hates the Force? That's a great idea if I've ever heard one. After a quick visit from Yoda he is changed back to normal, but half the movie has passed by this point. 4) If Luke hates the Jedi and the Force so much and goes as far as to say that it should all end together, AND exiles himself onto an island to die with no intention of ever coming back, then why does he continue to dress exactly like a Jedi every moment of his life? Why doesn't he go back to wearing the attire he wore for the first 19 years of his life? 5) Luke eventually states that he went into hiding because he failed his nephew, Ben Solo, and that Ben has a power that he has never seen before. However, Luke knew Darth Sidious, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and himself. And so far in the past 2 movies in the story line there has been no demonstration that Kylo Ren has any skills at all. Rey defeats him easily in TFA and she has never even held a light saber. In fact, Snoke even makes this point in the movie. You also see Kylo fighting later in the film against Snoke's guards and he is getting slapped around again. Isn't he supposed to be strong in the force? Yet some nobody puts him in a choke hold and almost stabs him. 6) Another huge problem is the distractingly terrible CGI. Snoke is just obnoxious but it only gets worse. The annoying 'porg' penguins and later the giant llamas must have been created by an eager 7-year-old. And how many computer animated explosions can we see in this movie? 7) So Finn and newly added Rose set off on a quest that takes most of the movie to accomplish. Sounds like a big deal but it is simply to find some nobody decoder to stop the 'First Order' from following them. Very nice ideas going on here. Along the way they spend a big chunk of time watching NASCAR pod racing and freeing CGI llamas. Rose tries to explain why this is a big deal but no one cares about this forced subplot. They then get captured and sent to a jail cell where another decoder happens to be there and has been laying around in his cell with a key this entire time. What was he waiting for? Nothing. Actually, he was just waiting for the writers to tell him what to do next. Nice. 8) Later, Poe holds a mutiny against the acting commander and hates her, yet when he is stunned the commander and Leia both comment on how much they like him. I don't think so. 9) After they leave and arrive at the bad guys' ship Finn and Rose get captured. The villain, Captain Phasma, does the typical stalling when it comes to execution and has to find a better way to kill them. In the meantime, a lady from Jurassic Park smashes into the ship and kills everyone in this room EXCEPT Finn and Rose. How convenient. Then Phasma and some troopers come walking up in a formation even though they were all just standing right next to each other. Phasma gets shot but her armor deflects the laser bullet. I think the 'First Order' has the resources to make all their soldiers have this armor so why don't they? They have multiple giant space weapons that can destroy planets but armor that works is a little too much to ask? So Finn gets up and has a very anticlimactic fight with Phasma. Why would they have done it any different? 10) The movie goes between Kylo, Rey/Luke, Leia, and Finn scenes. Is Chewbacca just an extra in this film? Because he gets as much screen time as those frog costumed creatures on Luke's island. Kylo's scenes were all very entertaining and Adam Driver was very likable. Rey's scenes were also interesting and I was waiting to hear what's been happening to Luke, but everything else in the movie could not have been less interesting. I don't think I've ever been more bored while watching a movie. This is why it felt like two separate movies edited together. 11) After the Snoke battle, Kylo Ren appears to have also killed Hux, but shortly after you see them both standing together. You also see a similar deal when Finn is about to sacrifice himself for the 'Resistance', yet Rose smashed into him to save his life, meanwhile jeopardizing her own. But no worries because everyone is invincible in this film. Except for Luke apparently. I guess using the force one more time was just a little too much for him these days. It was a very uneventful and unheroic death for the star of the original trilogy. 12) All this buildup of finding Luke and he does next to nothing. He aides in the plot which is helping the 'Resistance' keep running but other than that he does nothing. Except for complain and die. He doesn't even have a light saber duel. He uses the force to trick Kylo Ren and pulls out his blue light saber, except Kylo had just recently destroyed that one so why did he think Luke had it??? 13) Before transparent Luke shows up, all the rebel fighters were standing in a hanger with the blast door open watching the 'First Order' stroll in and fire at them. Death and destruction could have easily been prevented and we're supposed to believe these are the people who have been fighting the bad guys this whole time? Are they as stupid as the writers? Oh. 14) Even a lot of dialogue from this movie was very childish and made me feel like I was watching a show created for little kids. Finn is sacrificing himself to save the 'Resistance' and Rose stops him. ""We're not going to win by killing the things we hate, but by saving what we love."" Well Finn was about to save everyone he loved by killing the 'First Order' but you just stopped him for no reason. And then she gives him an extremely awkward kiss and proceeds to pass out just like Leia did earlier in the film. How creative. Another childish addition is when they're looking for an exit in the cave and a CGI ice fox is conveniently standing in a doorway waiting to lead the people to safety. I'm not 9 so this doesn't amuse me. There's a lot of trying to lead you to believe someone is about to die, just to have a cheaply executed save. Boring. 15) The plot of the movie is that the ""Resistance"" is trying to run away from the ""First Order"". The presented problem is that once the ""Resistance"" runs out of gas, the ""First Order' will be in range to fire on their ships. Is the ""First Order"" running out of gas too? Is there a reason that the all resourceful ""First Order"" can't cut them off? Or by summoning any ship in their possession? What are all the other ""First Order"" ships doing at this moment? It's supposed to be pretty important that they have the last of the ""Resistance"" on the run right in front of them but all they are doing is following them? 16) Rose was unconscious at the end near the heavily guarded ""First Order"" battering ram. How did Finn drag her all the way back without dying? 17) They even couldn't resist having the droid BB-8 driving an AT-ST walker. I guess the children under the age of 5 need some entertainment too. 18) Disney is in dire need of a thesaurus. Can we get a word count on the word ""hope"" please?! Also, stop with the ""never tell me the odds"" joke. That ended in 1980. Why did C3PO have a red arm in TFA and not in this film? Why is the mystery of Rey's parents never laid to rest? ""Oh they were nobody."" K thanks for the movie bye. Who is Snoke? Why did he show up, supposedly being the most powerful being, and then die with no known motivation/plans? <br /><br />George Lucas' Star Wars movies were told in a unique way that could easily have been told apart from any other writer. It was almost an art of its own. There's a style to making Star Wars and I could tell this movie came out in 2017. There used to be a purpose behind the dialogue, and now it's just schlock. It was like the way Obi-Wan described the light saber; ""an elegant weapon for a more civilized age."" Now writers are clumsy and random, and people laugh at CGI penguins on the screen. TFA and TLJ both focus on what happened between Episode 6 and TFA, but the whole idea of training Jedi and Luke's interaction with Ben Solo sounds more interesting than the current movie's plots. Or lack thereof. At least Leia wasn't killed off in this movie so I'm really excited to see her return in full CGI...."
3821,3,"I just rewatched the first 30 minutes, good thing I stopped there!",This film is a complete flop by Disney.
3822,1,Just saddening....,"Not only is this story and script so bad that it makes it hands down the worst but it's also the most commercial and politically correct star wars movie to date period. While I shouldn't be surprised after the force awakens and how high school, pc, and filled with loopholes that movie was the Rogue one movie I actually enjoyed and it gave me a shimmer of hope that they may get back on right direction but boy was it just wishful thinking. Aside from there being so much moments and scenes that just didn't make sense when it comes to star wars the movie also dosen't focus on the main cast and story well enough and as it should but goes out of its way to make it blatantly obvious how politically correct it is. Now its so much more politically correct then TFA that it's cringeworthy at times and scenes will feel more like watching a commercial then a movie. Looks like the decision to try and commercialize star wars and to push and profit from the pc agenda has destroyed the star wars legacy and shown they could care less about what original fans may think and want or about the legacies of any popular culture they can get their hands on."
3823,2,It Is From Disney Of Course it Sucked,Amazingly bad
3824,1,"Worst Star Wars movie of all time, maybe even worst movie of all time",The plot is horrible. The character arcs are horrible. The empire/first order villains look like they should be twirling their mustaches. The director must hate Star Wars.
3825,5,A disgraceful and tricky attempt to conform a franchise,"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a failure as a film and as an episode of a saga. All the plot and the subplots set on the previous films, were built for nothing. "
3826,2,OH NO!! The Sith Have Taken Over Star Wars!!,"It is that bad. They a =re deliberately trying to sabotage the film of hope, faith and adventure. It is so bad that we are starting to hate the Jedi, the force, Luke and the ghost of Yoda who incidentally can set fire to trees in death (why doesn't he come back and fight the dark side then?).<br /><br />Jar Jar Abrams, Rian Johanson, Iger and Kennedy are the Sith and shame on the actors and crew for cooperating."
3827,1,"My heart is broken, I'm crying inside :/","I was so waiting for this movie, just as I did for TFA and I knew JJ was out so I was convinced that it can only be good. And now, three hours after watching the movie I'm not yet sure whether this was the worst Star Wars I have ever seen or TFA."
3828,3,Even worse the second time,"On second viewing the flaws are only more glaring. Perhaps the best example is when Finn and Rose go on their pointless McGuddin hunt. The scene where they enter the casino and Finn suddenly forgets that he's on a desperate mission to save the galaxy. He's suddenly a giddy kid stumbling around the space casino. Except he's not. He's an adult man acting like a giddy kid. Better yet, he's an adult actor who's been tasked with acting like a child completely out of character.<br /><br />This film is littered with throwaway scenes that seemed so emotionally disconnected from the urgency of the idiotic slow motion chase that the writers created. It's inexcusably bad."
3829,2,The movie that divided the fandom,I hate this movie so much. There's a good reason it divided the Star Wars fandom. Besides the fact that they ruined a specific character for stupid reasons the writing is very awful and the subverting expectations bits are just so frustrating and really tiring after a while. The only thing's I can praise this film for are the special effects and John Williams score but that's it. Although not as bad as The Rise of Skywalker it's still really bad and very overrated. Rian Johnson should not touch Star Wars ever again.
3830,1,From bad to worse,Well they managed to make a character worse than jar jar binks. Kylo ren is to Star Wars what nickleback is to music. Absolute rubbish. Such a shame the final trilogy is ruined by a spoilt child Whose only place in the film is to get angry and upset because he doesn't get his own way. Kylo ren aka the worst thing to ever come from the Star Wars universe
3831,1,Things I learnt from Star Wars - The Last Jedi,WARNING SPOILERS: sorry!
3832,1,Tried the movie again and even more disappointed than before,"With the next movie about to release, I wanted to give this one more try. I regret spending the time watching it. If it had been anything but star wars, it would've been average."
3833,1,Frustation,"An awful movie, simple like that. It is a mistake.<br /><br />Poor Star Wars series"
3834,1,Not as good as WW84,"When people ask me if Wonder Woman 1984 is the worst movie of all time, I tell them no. See the Last Jedi."
3835,1,",',A misadventure that should have never spawned. The essence of defecation upon a Galactic shrine','","';.The art /design and music/sound was what you would expect, fine indeed, but the story and character arc is a ruinous mess. It's an insult to the legacy that has manifested since A NEW HOPE birthed from Lucas and generations of artists who explored and enriched the ideas and images of that Universe. I am a far cry happy about this progression,therefore I lay down an unsettled 1/10 for the sake that is represents a doom of something once great.',;"
3836,3,2022 Review - A Retrospective - Who is it?,I have not reviewed this film previously as I did not deem it worthy of any serious response.
3837,1,Just awful.,All the hatred fans had for Episodes 1-3 can easily be forgiven after watching this disaster. This effectively killed any desire to watch any future Star Wars related material.... at least without guarded hesitation.
3838,2,Star Wars: The Phantom Johnson,Last Jedi
3839,1,Give me a JarJar Binks hosted Holiday Special over this.,It's like if StarWars was a group of wide eyed younglings eager for learning... and Disney was Anakin Skywalker meth'd out on the dark side of the force. Redemption for this betrayal may not be possible for 30 years.
3840,1,I think a blind and deaf ape can write a better movie,"Just as title says. Idk who allowed this movie to even be a thought, but I guess it was made. New magically get out of writing free cards. New mysterious villain written off, why Luke went mia ohh he just hates himself, space Vegas exists, other force users just existing, but are not taken in by Snoke,if you go to hyperspace you can blow up an entire fleet. random love triangle with Finn,a random oc character, and Mary Sue. Oh wait you want to learn more about the characters no here a random heist movie thrown in with the typical double cross. Ohh knock off boba fett is back and alive? Damn did Leia just T-Pose in space? Yup. Did rey just a a gain a power spike from just seeing Luke? Yup. Is this movie a landfill that got set on fire? YUP!"
3841,2,How to kill a franchise,"This movie fails on so many levels, that it almost seems they did it on purpose. It's not only disrespecting the original movies, but turning against its own predecessor as well. Also it spits on the universe 40 years in the making. The plot makes zero sense. The characters only serve as puppets of forced political views. It's not new, it's not brave, it's not modern. Only stupid and egoist."
3842,1,Just not feeling it.,"Mark Hamill deserved better. Why would this get through all of the checks and balances throughout the preproduction and production? I cannot say much more. If you like the film, then you must be very forgiving. I felt dazed afterward. What a waste."
3843,1,Dull dull dull,"Hadn't seen this when it first came out so I'm very late to the party watching it. As much as I wanted I just couldn't get into it. The film looks great, typically, but the script writing is just awful and it's acted out so clunkily and unnaturally. I love Mark Hamill (who doesn't) but his scenes are just ham (no pun intended) - such a shame, they could have been much more evocative. I was hugely disappointed in this film. It's annoying to think the franchise are just relying on great SFX and CG to see it through. No justice to the original film characters and a poor storyline with rehashed mini story lines from past films."
3844,4,"If you're a old star wars fan, this film will destroy you!",No spoilers. 
3845,1,It's Over,"Plot: what is there is full of holes. Story: is not advanced overall, in any way. Disjointed. Part of it is irrelevant to what is supposedly going on. Characters: don't behave like themselves. The Force: just make it up as you go along. The future: what future, EVERYTHING that was teased about or characters that you've invested in, is either dead or irrelevant.<br /><br /> <br /><br />I got the point of this movie, blow up the past, blow up expectations, blow up the characters, nothing matters. You're correct, the franchise no longer matters. Why is there going to be a third movie?"
3846,1,Sickening. No way this movie is at a 7.5,"Horrible humor, no questions answered. Luke milking scene and bad humor had me rationalizing that I was watching a parody movie. The critics were either bought off or Disney hired the mafia to break their legs if they gave a bad rating. I waited two years to see Luke throwing away that lightsaber? Really?! Disney needs to be scared after this mess, and they should be. If the Han Solo movie is bad, it's all over."
3847,1,Most beautiful worst written movie I have ever seen.,The entire movie is essentially centered around the first order chasing the resistance which they cannot catch because they are travelling too fast. Princess Leia gets blasted out into space and takes a nap for a couple minutes. She wakes up (which she wouldn't do after having been out there that long) and slowly floats about 30 feet back to the ship. 
3848,3,This movie is embarassing,"Seriously, cringy jokes, useless subplots and boring as hell. It missed completely the ""space opera"" feeling and felt more like a Marvel movie mixed with the other worst made in Disney."
3849,2,A mess,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to fail not only as an addition to the Star Wars franchise, but as a sequel to The Force Awakens. What promised to be a fine trilogy of films, turned into a tug of war between two directors- Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams, with Bob Iger, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney putting in a load of crap into the rope. It was because of The Last Jedi that made me decide that the sequel trilogy or any of the the Disney Star Wars canon isn't canon. The eighth Star Wars film fails on almost every level."
3850,1,Good to see Luke back,"I thought this film was far better than the previous two. Luke Skywalker returns (this is kind of a big deal) and Mark Hamill does a great job bringing the character back. He deserves a lot of credit for his work. This is the first Star Wars movie I have seen since The Return of the Jedi where there were actual stakes involved in the jeopardy of the action scenes. Basically, characters had clear goals and there was suspense over whether characters would live or die. It is not a perfect film, there is some trans-media marketing at work so not all questions are answered. Some storylines happen for convenience - but there is a lot of good stuff in the film. Highly recommended."
3851,3,underage director and immature writer,"For a mega budget movie, this is a very disappointing flop. Hardly any of the characters in the story are convincing or believable. Luke Skywalker gets old and suffers from Alzheimer's. He is supposed to be a Jedi Master for crying out loud. The writer of the script was either smoking or drinking too much whilst at work, or is mentally sixpence short of a schilling, as the old saying goes. During the scene where Rose crashes into Finn, to prevent him from sacrificing himself, I heard actual booing coming from somewhere in the audience. Those sensitive little ""white men fan babies"" or whatever they are being labelled, did not like being taken for a kid's cartoon ride, with a movie promising so much and delivering only a bad feeling in the lower half of the digestive system. I wish to use only appropriate language to describe the disappointment of The Last Jedi"
3852,3,Trash,"How to destroy a franchise absolute missed opportunity, after all the hype this is what they decided to do"
3853,1,Not worth all the hype and the wait - what a disappointment,Luke Skywalker's character was terrible - not so much actor personally but the character was soooo depressing - terrible !! I don't know how they recover from this - they will b=need a good director and a fantastic new plot - I thought Rogue One was superior to this - All that time waiting and then this - uhhh ! :(
3854,1,Hot pile of dog poopies,I made an account purely to display my hatred for this movie. Continuity is completely disregarded. If I could give this pile of garbage a zero I would. Not my favorite Star Wars movie.................. smh
3855,3,Potentially good movie ruined by bad choices,"Well, after I watched ""The Force Awakens"", I had wished that they didn't carbon copy ""A New Hope"" and instead did something different. After watching ""The Last Jedi"", I now wished they just carbon copied ""The Empire Strikes Back""..."
3856,1,Amazing! Not one good thing about it!,Difficult to believe something this terrible exists in the Star Wars universe.
3857,1,ripoff,"This is the crown on the last couple of movies!<br /><br />Complete rubbish!<br /><br />everybody who has seen the first original movies has to come to the same conclusion: they've cut those movies into pieces, put them into a bowl, and took pieces out, served them with a new sauce and voila: a new movie."
3858,2,A Literal Insult to Star Wars Fans,I am baffled by how much The Last Jedi hates what should be its strongest fans.
3859,1,WORST,I like Daisy Ridley but this movie sucked. I would rather watch Mandalorian or Boba Fett than this crap.
3860,1,"If we could remove this movie, to make another movie, completely different, then awesome.","I understand this review may trigger some snowflakes. Get over it. Reason why I don't admire the Last SJW one last bit, is because of the story, the characters, the character development failure, and even more plot holes after TFA. So, it all starts at D'Qar, because the Resis- I mean rebellion, is fleeing from the powerful First Or- I mean the Empire. How did the First Order get so powerful that the New Republic decided to not monitor the possibilities of a future army rising after the treaty made after the battle of Jakku? This mirrors straight off a New Hope after the better Rebellion destroyed the Death Star. They fled, and some ships got destroyed when the rebellion fled, but the Empire was still all powerful because they had control for years. The First Order got control, in what, 2 days? I mean, I guess destroying 5 planets will apparently not cause any other systems to spark a rebellion with the Resis- Rebellion. Then, Poe Dameron makes a mom joke to stall the Dreadnought, which should've just fired in the first place. Poe Dameron takes out useless surface cannons. But what about the other ships? Why wasn't Hux shooting at Poe too? Then we have the ""just hit it with your head and it'll work"" cliche by BB-8. Then we have bombers appear, which only respond to Poe, and not Leia, although she told him to disengage. Bombers are useless and the battle was lopsided like the game of super bowl 24. The Rebels flee, and they are somehow being tracked through lightspeed. Then we go to Ahch To, where Crybaby Skywalker couldn't deal with his nephew with anger management. Some parts fo it were actually decent, but that's really the only good part i could see in the movie. Then we meet Rose Tico, after Finn comes back after a stupid reappearance. Rose is about the same as Jar Jar, but worse. They waste their time on Kantobite, because Admiral Pink Hair won't tell anyone her plan. Carrie Fisher, I loved her, and I think she should've passed because of actual physics. But, Carrie Poppins. Her plan would've saved 2/3 of the resistance, but since Poe was a male, she won't say a word. So, the adventure on Kantobite is full of cliches, ranging from finding a person who could do it, even though they are the master code breaker, and falling to their death from a cliff. Back to Ahch To, where they train. Why can't Luke train her, if he knows that Ben can't be stopped? What have they done to Luke? Luke was basically a polar opposite of this in 6, when he knew he could bring his father back. This movie reflects the combination between episode 5 and 6. I'm going to skip ahead to Holdo light speed. I'm calling crap. If that's possible, you basically just ruined the entire franchise. An x-wing being controlled by a droid could use lightspeed through the Death Stars, shield gate, blockades, etc., but we actually care about an actual battle. She sacrificed herself because she thought she was more important than anyone else. Now we are the battle of Crait, which is basically a snow planet but salt. Thanks for clarifying Rían, but it doesn't make a difference. It's another battle of Hoth. Then we have the most anticlimactic ending ever. Luke gets killed because all OT men will be killed. Landon is coming for 9, and will probably die. Movie ruined the franchise."
3861,1,The end of Star Wars,"The Last Jedi, with its motto to ""let the past die"" severs all connections to what made Star Wars special - beloved characters, fans, primordial battles between good and evil, to name a few. "
3862,1,Brutal!,I'd give it negative stars if possible. Destroyed the franchise and Luke Skywalker. Writing was horrendous.
3863,1,Boring!!!,"This movie was boring, and you can't keep up with the plot. I was not paying attention during the whole movie. I almost fell asleep. There were lame jokes, weird new rules invented just for this universe like Leia becoming Mary Poppins, and just a lot of confusion. A lot of people can point out all the problems with this movie, but in my opinion, it is just boring."
3864,1,Destroying Star Wars,"The movie was just garbage from the first scene to the last. Cheap plot-twists, unbelievable characters, not to mention that the whole story does not make sense. Any hopes for a worthwhile restart of the franchise got destroyed."
3865,4,Unbelievable disappointment..,"Never written a review before, but I had to for this one.."
3866,1,An abomination,This movie is a visually satisfying abomination of the original star wars universe.
3867,4,Military tactics advisory wanted,The film is a disappointment anyway.
3868,1,I am sorry for our loss SW fans and there is something fishy going on with critics head over heels loving this movie...,***Spoilers***
3869,1,I have no idea how Abrams is going to fix this,This isn't the story anyone wanted to be told. Completely nonsensical story: opens enormous unfixable plot holes in Star Wars universe. Uproots all the nice setups Abrams made in The Force Awakens. Star Wars used to capture our imaginations... now it's just insipid plot contrivance after contrivance. This movie doubles the number of cringe-worthy moments in the trilogies. Luke Skywalker was not handled with care and respect to the previous films. Rian Johnson has made a mess and I don't see any way Abrams can bring this sequel trilogy back from the brink.
3870,2,The worst Star Wars film to date,"Utter trash. Not only the worst Star Wars film so far, but the worst film I've seen a while. After the bore that was Force Awakens and now this I truly believe this franchise will be dead within the next 5 years... if you don't think it is already."
3871,4,And I thought that jar jar binks was the worst character in Star Wars history,"Jesus Christ, rose is the most annoying character of all time. Her whole save Finn moment with risk of death was maybe the stupidest thing I ever watched on the big screen."
3872,1,Improvements need to get involved in e 9,"Very few things I liked about this movie that includes the fighting scene in snokes throne room, and battle of Crait and how Hux is showed like a cowrad"
3873,3,Visually Well Made,I can appreciate the quality of the film based on the time and effort (and money) that was put into it. What I cannot get past is the disregard for what the previous films set up.
3874,3,Star Wars: The Last Jedi... From a Certain Point of View ***SPOILERS BELOW***,***SPOILERS BELOW***
3875,1,In the garbage,Threw away the Blu-ray out of sheer disappointment. <br /><br />Been a long time star wars fan for the 80s episodes. But this was just plain awfull to watch. Gone is the Star Wars feeling and i think i will never watch a new star wars movie again.
3876,3,If you've seen it you know it... Worst SW movie.,"How does this movie have 7 stars? It is easily regarded as the worst Star Wars movie. Very poorly written. Making something ""different"" doesn't make it good. Still gave it 3 stars because it's star wars and has a couple of good moments. Overall terrible story and some bad acting as well."
3877,1,The trailer is better than the movie will ever be,"Honestly I wanted to like it but it's literally the worst Star Wars movie made yet imo. If you're even a casual fan who perhaps liked TFA your going to start to wonder while watching if maybe this isn't real and your simply having a bad dream. And then perhaps you'll wake up and go see the real The Last Jedi. But when it ends you realize the true nightmare is that it's real, all of it."
3878,1,Nooooooooooooo! ****SPOILERS****,"After watching the trailer for this movie about a month ago, I had an inclination this might be bad. However following the amazing reviews on 'Imdb' I thought I'd give this movie a chance. I went to the cinema skipping like a 6 year old with excitement.... walking out however, I found myself trying to make excuses as to why it could be good, and 10 mins later when I got home I couldn't sleep for how terrible this movie really is."
3879,1,Pew Pew Boredom,Pew pew pew pew pew space lasers<br /><br />Pee pee Walmart robot toys<br /><br />Pew pew pew boredom<br /><br />Funny blah blah scene
3880,5,No,"I really want to like this movie, but I just can't"
3881,3,Star Wars-EP 8 just awful,"Who knew that Jar-Jar-Binks was NOT the lowest this franchise could go.....<br /><br />Alas Disney found a sub-basement and 'yegads ! "", it was filled to the ceiling with enough film excrement to drown Jar-Jar's entire race."
3882,1,Is this a stupid joke? I'm not laughing.,"The only way to save Star Wars now is this: In the next episode, one of the characters from the original movie wakes up from a terrible nightmare. As it turns out, he/she was hit in the head in a bar fight, and while unconscious, had this shocking vision of what the galaxy could become in the hands of cynical, untalented, mediocre people who only care about money and a politically correct choice of actors. People who know absolutely nothing about stories, or even logic for that matter. This is not the end of Star Wars. This is NOT Star Wars."
3883,1,oh my..,"A fantasticly stupid movie, even worst than the phantom menace. Oh yeah, you read that right, DUMBER THAN THE PHANTOM MENACE!!"
3884,1,Worst Star Wars movie EVER!!!,"Disney/the director really dont understand the concept which Star Wars is told, i dont recommend seeing this, itll be a waste of your time which you will never get back!!"
3885,1,Just don't bother. This would've been straight to DVD without Star Wars attached to it's title.,I won't rehash what everyone else has already said. It's just completely awful. Just garbage.
3886,1,violating the star wars universe,OMG.<br /><br />If you like Luke Skywalker you'll be very mad.
3887,2,I feel insulted,"Well, it seems my honest review of this title was a little too honest for imdb censorship so I'll try to be as polite as possible this time. This movie is not just bad the way J. J. Abram's attempts at making a Star Wars movie were, who probably did the best he could but just sadly lacks the talent. This movie is a purposeful attempt to murder the franchise. And as it turned out, might have succeeded to do so."
3888,2,"Really wanted to like it more, but it didn't let me...","While not as bad as some made it out to be, it is just not very good. <br /><br />Can't seem to make up it's mind whether it wants to be a comedy, an action movie, part of the Jedi lore.... In the end feels very hodgepodge with okay acting. <br /><br />Tries to be funny but isn't, people are getting obliterated but that seems like no big deal, ""RUNNING OUT OF GAS"" is the theme of the movie- and we've never heard much about fuel in SW before, needless/endless promoting of Porg merchandise, Luke's character is not any Luke we have met before. <br /><br />If the commander just explained her plan, communicated, so much would have been avoided. And I can see damaging Snoke's ship with her suicide run, but every Star Destroyer?,- movie just keeps of reaching and reaching, right out of its ability to tell a really good and coherent story. SW ended with The Force Awakens, which was miles better than this. Even better- Rouge One or the Cartoons, heck even the Lego version doesn't take itself that seriously. <br /><br />And this film drags and drags....... and drags...."
3889,2,It's not cool because it's different.,"Don't try to tag a movie with 'different' or 'alternative' because you put your spin on it, and it has spectacularly failed.<br /><br />This festering turd of a movie doesn't deserve to call itself a Star Wars movie."
3890,3,Worst Star Wars Movie,"I'm not one of the sequel haters just because they are new but this movies is really bad. If you are a casual watcher, you'll be fine but if you are a fan you'll realize this movie goes against everything the characters were in previous movies. It has its moments (especially between Luke and Leia) but overall it destroys character development of main characters. Believe me, you can't be a fan and still like the path this movie decided to follow..."
3891,1,Worst Movie Of All Time,"This movie destroyed the Star Wars universe. The director used beloved characters to preach a socially conscious, politically-correct liberal message. In the Empire Strikes Back Yoda says that the dark side is bad and even a little bit of darkness will ruin your life. In this movie Yoda seems to agree with the director that The Force needs a balance of light and dark and the true path of enlightenment is a mix of the two. I guess that would be true if the film were directed by Satan. "
3892,1,Everything you need to know about star wars and Disney,"First off everyone is wondering how this movie tile got 7.7 out of 10 stars now down to 7.4 stars which is still way to many stars for this title and how all the critics seem to say this is one of the best star wars created yet. Well it all comes down to money Disney paid 2 billion dollars to get this franchise there is no way they are going to lose money on this or break even that is not a profitable business. Also Disney needs to keep making money on this title after it gets old an by it having a very low rating or getting negative reviews by all the critics a new comer to the franchise might be discourage and not want to waste the time to watch it or buy it. This is disappointing me that IMDB a trusted site of mine would sell out a long with the critics but sometimes that is what you got to do to stay in the business. Now the problem is that star wars was a great fantasy world with a very interesting story and something new in each episode created (even star wars episodes 1-3 in my opinion deserve 8 stars as well). This series has flopped because Disney is as stated above in the business to make money an they do that very well but normally the mvoies they make are cartoon movies geared at the younger generation with the intent to sell toys or family orientated like Mary Popins that parents can take their kids to. This is why Disney making the new star wars was a bad idea star wars was not made to sell a bunch of junk to little kids or band wagon fanboys it was a movie for adults who liked the fantasy world and others getting into the fantasy world. Even though Disney has trashed star wars they are genius for making JJ. Abrams who is one of the worst writers and directors of our time to headline this movie because that is exactly what he does sells junk to people who do not understand good movies. An if you don't think JJ. Abrams had a hand in The Last Jedi you would be wrong this movie stinks of him watch some of his other movies if you can sit through them and than re watch this movie again if you can sit through it. Although JJ. Abrams was not mentioned in this title I bet he was pulling most of the strings, but if you want to put all the blame on Rian Johnson that is up to you. Also if you look at Rian Johnson's other works most of those titles are actually good so why wouldn't he try an take another chance at making another great film. Lastly if you watch the side movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story that is a much better movie than the main one because it has no affiliation with JJ. Abrams (still not as good as star wars episodes 1-6 but a mediocre movie if you want something to watch)."
3893,1,Did not feel like Star Wars...what they did to the character of Luke ist a disgrace!,"I cannot add much to why this movie is really awful. Everything has been already written. Basically it did not feel like Star Wars. This gigantic Space Opera. Possibly because of the boring story, possibly because of the destruction of the old characters and no development of the new ones. Especially the way they treated the character of Luke was disrespectful to say the least. Possibly because of shoving a political agenda down our throats. Possibly because it simply is not for people who grew up with the characters but for a younger audience. Since it is not for me any more personally I will not support this garbage with my money . Maybe I will look it on Free-TV when it plays. I think that many people share this opinion which is why Solo flopped. RIP STAR WARS..."
3894,3,Spaceballs 2: The Last Jedi,"I dont know what to say that hasn't already been said. Seriously I thought I was watching a movie that was a parody of Star Wars, Gravity and other space movies. The Last Jedi? By the looks of it, Rey looks like she has a good grasp of Jedi duties by the end with her boulder juggling act. The Force Awakens gave me a new hope (pun intended) when it came to a new wave of Star Wars movies. The Last Jedi pretty much put me in a headlock and kicked me in the nuts. Disney is mad with power. I'm watching this movie as I'm writing this and I just keep scoffing at it. The dialogue is so dumb, the jokes are cringe worthy, I seriously dont recognize this Luke Skywalker. I never knew him to be a pessimist. He went through the original trilogy as determined, optimistic and selfless. In this movie he is passive aggressive and self doubted. Codebreaker????? Wow what a stupid subplot. That casino city section of this movie and that little alien putting coins in BB-8 seriously made me gag a little. I thought Leia being blown into space would've been emotional and a dignified end for her. But low and behold she somehow awakens IN SPACE and floats!?! back to another ship. Rian what the are you smoking? Seriously have you seen a Star Wars movie before or are you going the way of Paul Feig and rewriting how a classic should be remade? Fin was wasted, Rey was neglected, I liked Rose but her character was a bit too preachy. Poe was the only one with passion. Luke wasn't Luke, Leia was a bit wooden and Chewie is now a double act with the porgs. I'm not looking forward to episode IX. I definately wont be watching it at the cinemas. Because by the end of this movie I dont even know what I'm anticipating. There is no cliffhanger, no real development, no questions that I'm looking for an answer to. Thanks Disney for ruining this franchise for me"
3895,1,The Last Jedi Movie,"""Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil, the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is... it's true. All of it""."
3896,1,Terrible Writing,"They completely destroyed previously established story arcs for both new and old characters. You can tell that Mark Hamil wanted Luke to die in this movie and how disappointed he was with how Luke was portrayed. Don't even get me started on Rose or Holdo. These were two of the worst written characters I've ever seen. First Rose will say ""Burn this place to the ground"" because of how much she hates the gamblers, but then says ""we don't win by destroying those we hate"". Absolute garbage."
3897,5,Rian Johnson's mess,How do you manage to kill a multi-billion dollar property....
3898,2,Thank you Johnson very cool,"Everything that has to be said had been said already. I just wish that some other company would buy this franchise and make good SW movies(in a parallel universe maybe). Or at least put someone like Kevin Feige in charge, someone who gives a sht about the series and doesn't just do anything he wants and ruin every character and hero people loved and cared for for over 40 years."
3899,2,I almost cried it was so bad,I came close to tears of disappointment and saddness when I was finally able to see this long anticipated film. <br /><br />It just sucked!
3900,3,This movie is the worst,"I don't know what Disney does to get all the critics write raving reviews about their movies like the last Thor or Guardians of the Galaxy (both very dissappointing), but just like this one, expectation from reviews doesn't compare to reality."
3901,1,Marvel Star Wars: Spoiler-Free,"Powerful force abilities and kicking ass with a light saber is awesome for on screen imagery and marketing. It's not what truly defines a Jedi to me, or makes their characters and stories so intriguing, magical, and awesome. Their unfailing characteristic is a certain noble way of being about them. They are calm, courageous, and clear-minded. Self-sacrificing. Committed to making the galaxy safe and peaceful. This movie has characters using the Force and light sabers to great visual effect, but (despite the title) there are NO JEDI."
3902,1,"Wanted to be the best of all, but turned out a joke","Many described how terrible was story telling; unnecessary plots like trying to find code breaker, which became a fiasco because our heroes parked their ship on a public beach? During whole movie Luke shown like dumb joke. Rian Johnson tried to built something new by destroying history, he could do with a movie named 'alternative Star Wars story'. He complained the due to pace there was no place to show Han Solo's funeral, but we watch birds on an island. At most dramatic moments he used jokes to push audience back from characters. I couldn't understand the relationship between Finn and Rey, how come they have strong bound, how stupid Finn is trying to go away to save Rey, isn't it a bit naive? RJ had thought so we have Rose to cover that part. I didn't like the movie and I don't like to see many generic nice words about the movie in some reviews."
3903,4,Professional reviewers seem to be clueless,The Last Jedi for me was a disappointment. I went in expecting it to be a great Star <br /><br />Wars movie because the critics said it is a great Star Wars movie. I would rate it somewhere between Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith. It does not live up to the original trilogy and was considerably less emotionally engaging than the Force Awakens. Rogue One puts it to shame. The only real thing it has going for it is that the scenes are visually spectacular.
3904,4,What the holy hell happens to Star Wars?!,"I understand what people mean when they say, ""The people that hate Star Wars the most are the fans."" "
3905,1,Among the worst movies ever made,There are 4issues going on here:
3906,1,Disney is ruining the franchise,It doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie anymore. Terrible writing and directing. Story has so many plot holes it's ridiculous. The only positive is the acting is very good. Disney is destroying the best characters while imposing the agenda of girl power and equality. Don't get me wrong I'm all for both of those things but to be crammed down our throats at the expense of the greatest movie franchise ever is very sad. They ruin Luke. Leia all the sudden is a potent force user. And R2 and C3Po get about 10 mins on screen. No wonder Mark Hamill hates the direction but he's right as long as it makes money right kids. True SW fans will look at this as an abomination and new SW fans who know nothing of George's amazing story telling skills will like it. At least JJ followed the New Hope blueprint and it still felt like a SW movie. This is just utter trash with so many things wrong it leaves you shaking your head. Please bring back George so he can try to salvage this otherwise SW is doomed. I've never been more disappointed in all my life. Rien Johnson should be exiled from anything SW related forever for this garbage. Anyone who liked this movie please watch George's movies again and tell me TLJ feels like a SW movie. Franchise ruined.
3907,1,The Force is dead!,"Terribly written. It's sentimental, nostalgic, juvenile, uninspired, unoriginal, poorly thought out. There isn't one line is this movie you wish you could hear again because you want to remember it. The story treats fans like they are idiots. You're either born with super powers or your not. There's no self doubt, not attempt to even hide the fact that the actors and director have no respect for the material or the Mythos. The plot holes are huge! There's no star power here and when you do see a star nothing fits into place. Why bring back Luke? They turned him into a coward. Why use Laura Dern? She has many strengths as and actor but none of them are used here. It seems like she's cast in projects because someone likes her. Spoke? What a poorly thought out name and character. I can say that about all the characters in this movie. The humour is stupid not funny. It panders for the laugh. This is the last Star Wars movie I will ever see. After three terrible movies it's obvious Disney has no interest in the power of storytelling. They are making movies that appeal to some computer model of what will net them the most money. I'm only guessing here but what else could it be?"
3908,1,Just made star wars the worst thing ever,"As the titel says, its just a awfull movie, that ruines all the lore that has been built up for years in star wars"
3909,1,Horrible,Not my Star Wars. Random scenes that tries too hard like the originals. This killed the love for Star Wars for many people. I would give this movie 0 stars if I could.
3910,1,Who is being paid off to keep this terible movie at a 7.3 rating?,"I have scrolled through over 100 reviews, and have only seen a SINGLE 5 star review. 95% of reviews are below 3 stars. Surely, something fishy is going on here. The Last Jedi is a terrible movie written by a terrible, egotistical director whose main goal was to give the middle finger to the audience."
3911,1,"Disney, what have you done?","I'm only just half-way into this movie and for the first time, I'm not watching the rest and the DVD is going straight onto eBay."
3912,1,Bad,"The dialogue is cringey, The characters are forgettable, and the plot is a mess. They ruin so many plot threads, and it feels like the final act of a trilogy instead of a middle act. No set up, or hype for a sequel."
3913,1,The Star Wars Universe has been permanently damaged,"When it comes to a Star Wars movie, there are always two aspects to review: how it works as a film, and how it fits into the larger universe. The Star Wars shared universe is truly remarkable in terms of scope and longevity. It is very soft sci-fi, but generally stays true to rules established in the original 1977 Star Wars."
3914,3,What The Heck Was That???,"Just got back from seeing TLJ. I thought it was rubbish, zero plot, zero character development, they killed off Snoke, we knew nothing about him, they killed off Phasma, we knew nothing about her. Lots of rushing about and shooting stuff but they advanced the story about 1 inch. I wont be bothering with the final installment of this new trilogy as it has totally failed to grab me in any way and i'm a 40 year Star Wars fan. I will simply stick to the stand alone films from now on."
3915,1,bulk load of crap,"So dissapointing, the force is low on this one.<br /><br />pathetic."
3916,2,The force is strong with me!,"I had a bad feeling about this film and I was right. I guess I was warned by the Jar Jar Abrams helmed Episode VII. The force is not strong with this film. It is terrible and weak. It is so bad I am not going to watch anything from Marvel anymore. Those Disney joke movies shall also be boycotted. <br /><br />The Last Jedi was weak and stupid. The chubby chick looked like she should be in one of those movies about animals in a farm that Disney should stick with, the sewer cleaner was just plain stupid and not funny (they did try though), the two main characters make the force seem like a subsidiary of Line with video chat capability and even though they took the cash Luke and Leia's faces tell us everything we need to know.<br /><br />Was this a practical joke by Di$ney?"
3917,1,Let the past die... Yeah we get it Ryan...,"Let the past die, let the past die, let the past die... Yeah Ryan we understand and thank you for giving us Star Wars fans this life-changing advice. This movie is awful and destroy the possibility of this trilogy to have any hope of being decent."
3918,1,Shame Disney!,From 2012 the dark side of the force is winning!<br /><br />Not worth a single star!
3919,1,Watch this if you don't care for Star Wars,"This movie is good if you've never watched the other trilogies, or if you don't care much about the story and just like the action scenes. Story wise this movie payed no respect to it's predecessors, and Mark Hamill himself fundamentally disagrees with Luke in these films. There is so much to unpack I can't possibly fit it all here. Just watch the countless YouTube videos proving how awful this movie is. Please George make it not cannon!"
3920,4,Throws away what was established in previous movies,"This movie shouldn't be called Star Wars, it's humor was so forced and out of place it breaks any the immersion of the movie. Several themes and plot lines had been left out from the previous movie. Just a poor excuse of a movie from disney"
3921,2,Great cinematography but lazy writing,The Last Jedis powerful cinematography is not enough to recover from its lack creativity in storytelling for new and existing characters.
3922,2,Only if you like chubby orientals,And that is all.
3923,4,"Too long, too...ugh","Rian Johnson really did a number on Star Wars, and it's not in a good way. First, the nonsensical premise of this film: the rebel fleet gets in over its head against the First Order, turns tail and jumps to hyperspace. The First Order fleet follows, and then it's a chase until the rebel ships run out of fuel because the First Order can track them through hyperspace. That's the main plot of the film: get away from the bad guys, and it's not super interesting."
3924,1,PLEASE STOP MAKING STAR WARS SEQUELS!,"Seeing all the negative reviews, I wasn't going to write one, but I feel so betrayed by these 2 last episodes that I have to SHOUT IT LOUD.<br /><br />Please don't do no more sequels. You have already done enough to disgrace the original series."
3925,3,What just happened?,"Agree with a lot of the comments and as someone else said, it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. Terrible casting and the characters lacked...character. I felt no emotional attachment to any of them. The Force Awakens promised so much and this sequel just didn't cut it. I will go as far as to say this was the worst of all of them, by a long way."
3926,1,"The 'ANTI STAR WARS"" star wars.","After due thought and consideration, ""The Last Jedi"" runs counter to everything the ""The original trilogy"" stood for. No real good guys or bad guys, bashing or degrading of the male heroes, negative feminist ""woke"" politics (as opposed to positive feminist ""woke"" politics) etc. BAD WRITING. A flat, uninteresting story that went nowhere. The destruction of Luke Skywalker. A lot of political speeches (why?) The most interesting part of the movie, where Kylo Ren and Rey might have joined as a third force against the Jedi and the Sith, was SQUASHED. Too bad, That might have saved the whole movie. This should have been the last Disney Star Wars movie."
3927,1,This movie should be banned,"This is not only the worst star wars ever made, It's probably the worst movie ever made. This film discover new depth of mediocrity. The only positive point about this scam, is that the destroying of the star wars saga and spirit is definitely over, at least we hope so..."
3928,1,Simply horrid,"I am not sure how this movie could have been any worse. The plot was something a three year old would find simple. The characters are paper cut outs with no depth or development. The direction and editing are rough. On top of it all, the writer chose to shoehorn in a bunch of social justice subplots that are totally out of place and pad the run time by an extra hour. If you have the choice between seeing this and getting a root canal, do yourself a favour and head to the dentist."
3929,1,Very poor,This film tried to subvert expectations at every turn. This lead to poor direction and the next film needed to retcon much of this film. In this film it has one of the most forgettable sequences regarding a casino and served nothing to the plot. They reset Finn's character arc just to introduce a new one-dimensional character. They used the concept of fuel to try to have a chase scene which woefully ignores physics in both the real world and the star wars universe. Holdo does not display any leadership qualities whatsoever and is purely used as a way to insult another character and to show the lesson of just obeying your superior no matter what. (that's a warcrime btw)
3930,1,"Good movie, bad Star Wars movie","This movie is very hard to rate. It is pretty cool, have several of great scenes, the cinematic is great, the directing great, the acting great, BUT the movie still sucks. "
3931,1,Hmmm,"What to say??? Since it truly is the most unredeemable pile of dog muck in the Star Wars universe! They lost me with forced and unfunny attempts at humour in the first 5 minutes. A travesty from start to finish. I think after the Laiya super-girl stunt I started to write a shopping list in the middle of the cinema. Then I checked myself that if I am that disinterested to be writing shopping listed in the middle of a new Star Wars film, it must be unimaginably poor. Yet I forced myself to endure it to the end.....that was a bad bad call! I recommend not spoiling your previous experience of the franchise."
3932,1,The Last Hype.,Even as I decided to review this... This atrocity in cinema history. I am stumped by the point that I don't even know where to begin. Or how to avoid making it into an essay.
3933,1,Star Wars parody?,Not sure if the producers really meant this serious.
3934,3,Worst Star Wars movie. Ever.,"Despite having a collection of over 3000 movies I rarely post a review on IMDB...but this movie deserves its increasingly poor rating (the ""other site's"" 4.x user score is closer to the worth of this picture)."
3935,2,The disrespect towards Luke Skywalker is enough proof that the director is in fact: not a Star Wars fan,"This film was made by someone who hasn't seen the previous films, throws away the lore of the prequels & represents a lazy piece of fan fiction."
3936,4,"Weird , Gloomier , Flawed , need much better than earlier Star Wars epics","Almost the first and half screening is more to fantasy drama with too long dialogues of bridging the storytelling, while overall much more to be improved comparable with most science fiction Star Wars epics & trilogies that always provides new space technology ideas of weaponries and vehicles with wonderful nature sceneries ; The Last Jedi is not having more creativeness including remarkable characters and with almost many similarities predictable stories and the similar amenities ever had made , and seems it is made most purposely for targeted China market aims.<br /><br />And surprisingly there is no extra post-credits scene in the closing film as if The Last Jedi is having drained of story overall as well out of its production within-off budget (as usually Star Wars provide it in its screening history , whilst Marvels mostly also have it recently).<br /><br />Even worse than The Force Awakens and Rogue One, it's losing touch cinematic & positive stories with favorable surprises usually innovatively created before by Lucas teams ; consider Disney should be having all the resources needed.<br /><br />Some kids are yet able sleeping during watching the film as offering standard only limited typical space cinematic of star wars (innovative) actions.<br /><br />Though having its new complicated release marketing rules and earlier enthusiastic promo to see it soon after watching Wonder (2017) ~ eventually it's sadly first ever feels that Star Wars new 2017 release is preemptive presumption entering the non favorable trend similar to Jurassic Park (1993) declining into 3rd Jurassic Park III (2001) and better Disney should fix it in getting much more Box Office as well much better Opening Weekend ; if necessary getting Lucas back with Spielberg also capturing wonderful Indonesia natures ; consider its more than 40-years epics history.<br /><br />Please create better Star Wars as well do not disappoint Star Wars fans after these long years :("
3937,1,This is not the Luke Skywalker that fans know and love!,"For over thirty years, the stories have been about Luke Skywalker and his companions. The original book based on A New Hope was even titled Star Wars: From the Adventures of LUKE SKYWALKER. Luke grew from an idealistic farmboy into hero of the Rebellion. Time and again he thwarted the legions of the dark side, including a dark clone of himself, the potent spirit of an ancient Sith Lord, and even the resurrected Emperor Palpatine himself. He confronted the Empire with his ""laser sword"" time and time again. He even used the force to create a doppelgänger of himself in order to save his friends, but it certainly didn't kill him."
3938,1,unbelievable.,Who ever wrote the beginning ... The bombardier thing is so unbelievable. WW2 in space? Yes spitfires and Messerschmidt as X to Y wing and we got a T Fighter. But not the bombing thing. big -1
3939,2,so disappointing.,"It's so sad. When there is huge potential and it's wasted like this.<br /><br />This is content, it is not art anymore. This feels manufactured, not created.<br /><br />Movie visually is amazing, only reason for 2 stars.<br /><br />But the legacy of amazing actors and characters where just disrespectfully dragged through mud.<br /><br />Writers should be ashamed. Everybody who approved story should be ashamed."
3940,3,A tale of one man's ego,"Rian Johnson is about to become known as the man who killed Star Wars and you can put money on Disney reversing their decision to hand him a new trilogy. Who in God's name saw what he did here and made him an offer on that basis? The best advice I can give Disney is to fire that person, immediately. The next best thing they can do is write this trilogy off and have someone wake up and discover it was all a terrible dream. As nonsensical as that sounds, it would be less damaging to their franchise than this was."
3941,1,God-Awful,"This is the WORST Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I really feel sorry for Mark Hamill. Appalling plot, too long, bad jokes, limp direction and yet apparently we're hailing Rian Johnson as the next big thing. What a waste of nearly three hours of my life. No tension, no excitement, no anticipation. Oh, and wait for Luke to start breast feeding some kind of giant bird. Got what a shocker. Stay well away!"
3942,1,Did what I didn't think was possible in a Star Wars movie...,"After the prequels, I didn't think it was possible to break the franchise with a single movie...but I think they somehow managed to do it here. "
3943,5,This is a Parody film...,This is a Star Wars Parody film.
3944,4,"Pathetic fairy tale, disgrace to all star wars franchise :(","Its just so pathetic.<br /><br />Story is bs.<br /><br />Just read review below, why did they event wasted time making it ?!"
3945,1,Lactose problems!,"Awful movie, they completely screwed up. I can't believe I complained about Jar Jar. This is way worse."
3946,5,"It may be the best Star Wars film since 'Jedi', but that's not saying much.","Taking no issue with aping 'Empire', with a good dose of 'Jedi' thrown in there for good measure (seriously, there's a significant scene that's almost identical to its thirty year old parallel), the latest entry in this now farcical franchise has caused a great divide between the apparent critics and the supposed fans mainly because it plays so fast and loose with the cannon it calls home. 'Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2018)' makes more than a few questionable decisions with the classic characters and their established abilities, as it chugs through its overly long, narratively messy story stuffed with too many stagnant subplots, each of which cut in at the most inconvenient times and only detract from the true 'meat and bones' of the piece, and a bizarre third-act that's totally tacked on to do little else other than detract from what would've been the perfect climax. Yet for all its faults - including an incredibly silly scene involving Leia which may just be the worst moment in the series since Jar Jar Binks first stepped on screen, it's still the best 'Star Wars' film in years (the prequels are included, to put some perspective on that). That's thanks to an improved tone (aside from all of the out-of-place and jarring jokes), a few entertaining set-pieces, a lack of force-fed nostalgic fan-service, some general visual splendour and a genuinely interesting core story strand involving Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren, who has been highly improved from his last outing to be the most engaging character. Still, Mark Hamill supposedly disagreed with every choice Rian Johnson made for his character and, I have to say, I can see why. 5/10."
3947,2,Erm,"Okay, so like I said in a similiar review from Rise of Skywalker, I'm not an avid fan. I grew up with the sequel trilogy (sadly, lol). I just finished all the Star Wars movies and completed the Clone Wars tv show and half way through Rebels (not as good as clone wars btw). I'd like to think I have a basic understanding of what makes Star Wars so special and incredible. This is an unpopular opinion, bur from a technical standpoint, TLJ is a good movie. It has great effects, great musical score, decent acting (good enough to make an average movie; I swear no hate tho), okay writing, decent pacing, etc. It's a pretty okay execution, hence the positive reviews from critics. However, it is a TERRIBLE Star Wars movie. The whole trilogy is just a copy of the original. I mean, the First Order is the empire, Snoke is basically Palpatine (but just a completely underdeveloped character compared to him), Ben is Anakin, Rey is Luke, the Resistance is the Rebellion, another death star, Hux is Tarkin (if tarkin was a naive, annoying brat; don't wanna curse rn lol so I used ""brat"" :/), etc. It's just a direct remake. Also, it's like they're trying to copy Marvel with the humor and everything because they know they are doing a bad job. TFA was decent, but TLJ really just destroyed the work Abrams did, and then...well, Abrams had to fix up the mess, but really just ended up doing nothing with TROS. I really want Lucas to come back and rewrite the trilogy (he can do the story, but definitely not the dialogue...no offense lol). But, who knows (sry if dis review is all over the place, I don't express my thoughts well xd). Since we're all in quarantine, better to start trying to patch up the franchise now before it's too late. For now though, I guess we can just consider Legends (haven't explored legends yet, but want to after a finish with all the official canon stuff) canon and make our own sequel trilogies in our head lol."
3948,1,"Fooled me once, shame on you. Fooled me twice, shame on me.","Following the unoriginal, uninspiring, pathetic Force Awakens comes The Last Jedi. I was not excited for this movie at all, the only draw for me was that at least Luke Skywalker was in it. Well, at least that's what I thought...."
3949,1,Worst Star Wars Movie ever!,This movie is terrible. It destroys the Star Wars Saga. it destroys Luke Skywalker.
3950,1,String his ass up!,Totally unwatchable.What were you thinking? Did the Disney Woke crew have a gun to your head? Do not waste money on pay per view or dvd. Watch the originals on the big screen at a local revival theatre.
3951,1,Really wanted to love this movie,"After watching this movie (twice, now), a certain Firefly quote has been ringing in my ears -"
3952,4,From a saga to a cheap fan fiction comedy,Star Wars saga starts with 4 and end with 3 so the rest is such a joke I can't even take it.
3953,2,And we thought Phantom Menace was a letdown,"When the credits began to roll in the theater, the audience gave a standing ovation to the film, while all I could think of was ""Why?"" This movie wasn't like Force Awakens where it left me wanting more and making me wonder what comes next; all this film did was make me wonder why? To its credit, I did like some things about the movie; it had a strong opening scene with an entertaining space battle, and sassy Luke Skywalker I enjoyed, but that's about it. The biggest issue with the film is the plot. I know this is all probably leading leading somewhere in future films, but nothing really happened here. Luke became one with the force, Snoke was killed by Kylo Ren, and the resistance took a serious hit to its numbers and equipment. Like I said, I'm aware its likely all leading to something, but at least when Empire ended, all we could talk about was ""Is Vader really Luke's father?"" ""How are they going to get Han back?"" and after Attack of the Clones (as bad as it was) we could say ""Well at least the giant Jedi battle was cool"" ""So this is how the Clone Wars began"" and ""that's how Palpatine grew to power."" In the car ride home my friend and I were trying yo find things we liked about the movie, one of my telltale signs that a movie wasn't good. When I first saw Star Wars as a kid, I knew what I liked about it, I didn't have to think of reasons to try to like it. When I first saw Force Awakens a couple years ago, I knew I liked it, even if it was a large callback to A New Hope. Many things in the film have no place, especially the side plot with Finn and Rose (and I liked both of their characters) that could have been written out entirely, as it has no impact on the films in anyway. It was kind of like in Revenge of the Sith, where they knew Obi-Wan needed something to do until he fought Anakin in the climax, but they didn't know what he could do. Another big plot issue I had was killing Snoke off. After the Force Awakens, he was easily one of the top two enigmatic characters along with Rey, and with all the theories of who he could be, where he learned to harness the force, and how he lead the First Order to power were all debunked in less than 5 minutes of screen time. When he was killed, the entire audience clapped, while Just threw my hands up and wondered ""Really?"" He could have survived and the plot after his death could have remained unchanged. This film's biggest downfall was TRYING to have the character driven plot and emotional payoffs, and it fails miserably at that. This was the first movie I've ever seen in a theater where I almost asked for my money back, and what hurt the most was that it was a Star Wars film, my favorite series of movies ever. I love the Harry Potter films, I love the MCU films, but they don't even come close to how much I love Star Wars. I was hooked ever since my dad showed them to me in the mid/late 90's when I was 3 years old and was immediately hooked. This is not just a bad film, it was an absolute insult to Star Wars fans everywhere. That isn't a knock on director Rian Johnson, who has had some films I enjoyed in that past such as Looper, but this is inexcusable by Lucasfilm. We trusted them and they failed us."
3954,5,It's taken me a while to write this!,"First watched this at the cinema just before Xmas 2017. My overall feeling when walking out if the cinema was , and I can't believe that I'm saying this, heartbroken. I'm 38 years old and naturally Star Wars WAS my childhood. I'm not a hard core fan, I can't name every character to ever appear in the film's nor do I hoarde memorabilia around the house. I tolerated the prequels mostly, just happy at the time that we were getting a star wars movie. The Force Awakens gave me everything I ever wanted in a sequel. Absolutey crushed it as a film. I guess it was foolish to think the last jedi could do a 'empire' and match or even surpass the previous film. I don't buy the directors comments about how he had to go In this direction for the sake of the franchise. That is true for most franchises but not this one. Star wars shouldnt be compared to the marvel films, star trek etc. JJ Abrams understands this . It's arrogant and disrespectful to treat it any other way. Parts of the film were ok, too much reminded me of the unessesary set pieces of the prequels. Nobody is impressed anymore by CGI, George Lucas already wowed the world with it and it's not going to happen again. Story wise it just is a big let down. Such a waste for Mark Hamill and Luke Skywalker as a character. I mean it's Luke Skywalker! Can't believe I've waited over 30 years for him to return and he's just been demoted to a grumpy old man. The best part was the flashback of him and that lasted less than a minute. Even the final hurrah for him, I feel , was added as a compromise, Probably ordered by LucasFilm to just give us a glimpse of what could have been. The dialogue really got on my nerves. Too much attempt at comedy that just sounded like a pale Tony Stark impression. Star Wars is set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away and that is exactly where it should stay. The director should have remembered that and not tried to panda to current trends in the movies. Overall I'm just sad that it was not a good film. Star Wars deserves better and hopefully JJ Abrams can hit it out of the park with Episode 9."
3955,5,Spectacle Over Substance,"I was already disappointed by The Force Awakens as it had a rehashed, dull plot, poorly written characters and interesting thematic choices. The Last Jedi, does very little to redeem anything that the new generation of Star Wars movies have accomplished so far. Director Rian Johnson pulls no punches as a first timer to the series. Bold, captivating sci-fi visuals and battles make Episode VIII quite possibly the most vibrant Star Wars installment to date, but aside from standout performances from Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver and of course, Mark Hamill The Last Jedi suffers from ever branching, irrelevant subplots, boring new characters and mismatched lore elements."
3956,1,Disney ruined Star Wars,"Disney, thank you for ruining the childhood dreams and memories of so many adoring and loyal Star Wars fans."
3957,1,Welcome To The New World,"I wont write what has already been rehashed thousands of times in reviews already, thats for you to assess on your own. So forget being a star wars fan or not, this movie just isnt any good. If you like having money then so not spend it on this.. but if you must then try and trip the fire alarm while you are in the cinema so you can get a refund. If you paid for it on itunes or blueray then I have no sympathy for you, as you should have looked past all the disney reviews (paid for in full with he threat of never working again) and avoided with every fibre of your being - ok you didnt? Welcome to 2018, you now have to live with yourself."
3958,1,"A very long joke, and not even funny","The opening lines of the movie, delivered by General Hux, truly felt like a parody and I genuinely wondered if it was some kind of pre-movie joke. Unfortunately, it wasn't, the real movie had indeed started and felt like a joke throughout. "
3959,1,Makes Phantom Menace look good,"I have spent hours discussing with people why this is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It has a stupid plot, there was too much humor at parts that could have been deep and tense, Luke skaywalker wasn't even Luke Skywalker, Rey is doing the exact same thing Luke does in Empire strikes back; she's leaving her training to go and save her friends from the first order. Luke does the same thing to Yoda, but suddenly Luke doesn't care about anything and he's too lazy to go out and have an awesome fight to help the resistance. There was very little action, we had a cool new side antagonist; Phasma, who has an awesome deleted scene where she kills her squad and fights Fin, but instead of getting that we get a stupid casino scene that does nothing but take up time. Did you want to find out more about Snoke, Reys parents, and the knights of Ren? Well to bad cause Ryan Johnson obviously didn't care.<br /><br />I'll never get over how bad this movie is"
3960,1,Complete Recycled Trash,I wish Disney would stop destroying the good characters in an attempt to get you to like the new ones.....Spoiler they are all uninteresting and under developed ...and really awful actors.
3961,4,So much wrong,"1. Did Rian Johnson ever watch the original trilogy?<br /><br />2. Luke deserved better<br /><br />3. Rey went from a cool new character to the least relatable character of all time. Seriously she's just amazing at everything just because the plot demands it.<br /><br />4. Remove Finn and Rose, movie will remain about identical...<br /><br />5. See ya Snoke, we hardly knew ye...<br /><br />6. Leia turns into Mary Poppins....<br /><br />7. Seriously? Why Hordo or whatever her name is... Star Wars introduces too many character they don't spend time developing. Just stick ackbar there..."
3962,1,Gender Wars: The last Snowflake,"I find it hilarious that some people actually can tout this as a good star wars movie. I could only give it a good rating if it was either a star wars spoof or was a general scifi movie unrelated to star wars, and even then the science flaws would give me an issue. Please note that the following paragraphs will contain some plot information.(Spoilers)"
3963,1,It was pretty much nonsense,"I can't watch it again. I've tried to overlook the cheese, the OP hero, the powerless villain, the nonsense they packed this movie with. The badness of it refuses to be ignored."
3964,1,Best movie ever,This movie is probably the worst movie i have ever seen and I would even stretch it to say its the worst ever made considering its star wars. Rian johnson should be ashamed of himself
3965,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever.,"Horrible movie. Bad story, bad acting, poor characters, grotesque humor. Coarse feminism. Complete lack of respect towards our most beloved Star Wars classic heroes: Luke, Leia, R2D2, C3PO, Chewie, Admiral Ackbar. Rey is a Mary Sue. Countless plotholes. Star Wars is dead and was killed by Kathleen Kenedy and Ruin Johnson."
3966,2,Disappointing.,"I love Star Wars, but this film is so poorly written as to be unwatchable."
3967,2,That director must never be seen again in Holywood.,"He made of General Hux a comic relief. I couldn't expect something so incredibly wrong, useless and dumb. He made of Luke Skywalker a whiny youknowwhat. How on Earth could one have such an idea? He made of Rei, the second most controversial Starwars character after JarJar Binks a vulgar nobody. He made of Leader Snoke a vulgar nobody. He brought in an Asian actress who's a nobody and that nobody wanted. What does it remain in the end? Nothing... Hopefully there will remain nobody to watch the ninth episode. It will be without me. "
3968,2,I hope the director is to never be seen again after that.,"He mae of General Hux a comic relief. I couldn't expect something so incredibly wrong, useless and dumb. He made of Luke Skywalker a whiny youknowwhat. How on Earth could one have such an idea? He made of Rei, one of the second most controversial Starwars character after JarJar Binks a vulgar nobody. He made of Leader Snoke a vulgar nobody. He brought in an Asian actress who's a nobody and that nobody wanted. What does it remain in the end? Nothing... Hopefully there will remain nobody for the ninth episode. It will be without me. Can you realize that newspapers and journalist are restoring the value of the first prequel with beloved JarJar Binks and Hayden Christensen after this film? I totally detest directors who let their ego surpass the power of a myth: that little man mae his film an is happy about it. He kicke everything forward for the next director who surely won't be him, who has to sort himself out of a mess created by a coward and petty director. Episode 7 enraged a lot of people, this one brought them desperation. There is nothing, nothing and nothing in this episode. This episoe is nothing, it means nothing, and there remains nothing after it."
3969,1,Amateur Director ruins Star Wars,"I would argue that this is one of the most incomprehensible movies ever made. Characters do not make intelligent decisions, follow logic, or act in anyway that is true to their character, and no believable explanation is given for this aberrant behavior. The use of bathos is used liberally throughout the movie for cheap laughs that undercut all seriousness of purpose to what is presented as being a story line. <br /><br />New concepts are introduced in the movie that break the rules established in the star wars universe that make one ask, if this is possible why has it not been done over the course of the last seven movies? <br /><br />Setups from the previous films seem to be purposely brushed off as a middle finger to fans who are trying to follow this Frankenstein's monster of a story line which has elements ""lifted""(stolen) shot for shot in some cases, from a wide selection of other movies. Seriously the main chase theme is unashamedly lifted directly from Battlestar Galactica.<br /><br />In summary this is a complete pile of excrement that tarnishes the entire world built by Lucas. Avoid at all costs, and if you do, well, you've been warned."
3970,2,It gets a star for the milk scene,"Terrible Star Wars movie. The movie makes a yo moma joke in the first 3 minutes of the film, why is that in a Star Wars movie? I'm sorry but in the entire history of Star Wars has humor ever been done in this way? It's so out of character, I'm not saying Star Wars is funny (atleast not all the time) it's just the fastest possible way they could break and suspension of disbelief. I made this account just to bring the score down on this one movie, I honestly think the phantom menace and friggen jar jar binks in all his stupidity have more merits than this movie. This movie is so confused, forced, and incompetent. If you like this film I'm sorry but your a zombie."
3971,1,Garbage branded with the Star Wars name,This film needs to be destroyed and Disney should apologies for creating such a pile of crap
3972,1,"Long, tiresome and irrelevant",The kinda of film you wish didn't exist. Now we have to act like it didn't happen. Think: Justice League.
3973,5,Star Wars?,"I really, really, really wanted to love this movie. Unfortunately just wasn't going to happen. Was searching, and hoping for a storyline that made somewhat of any sense. Again coming off the force awakens the storyline is so thin that a five-year-old could have written it. It seemed rushed, not really thought through and at times a little chaotic. Killing off every main character really didn't help for the validity of the movie either. It's unfortunate that you've taken such a great franchise and turned it into an after school special. Sad just dramatically sad."
3974,1,The most expensive B grade SCI FI ever made,Words cannot begin to describe how disappointed I am with this Disney cookie cutter drivel. 
3975,1,Lol,"An absolute train wreck of a movie, but all of you already know this."
3976,3,In political galaxy not far away....,"I've been at every movie premier since The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi battle's it out with Episode 1 & 2 for second worst ever. The Force Awakens was great but this current episode/chapter crashes and burns. It is like they found Lawerence Kasdan's evil twin to right this movie!! Jedi history is forgotten and Intergalactic force skyping is in full effect. All the male character's are presented as childish, incompetent, ignorant or evil !?! There is more attention give to campy funny scenes than actual plot development. From out of no where Jedi Masters are obsolete and training is no longer needed and all Force skills come preloaded for Rey!?! Disney creates a Star Wars feminism movie with a dash of politics with the only thing missing was a bumbling Ray Romano. If the roles were reversed between male and females, outrage would ensue throughout the media. I feel very bad for Mark Hamill. <br /><br />The Two major storyline cluster bombs are;<br /><br />1)Luke could not bring himself to Kill Vader (a child killing Dark Sith Lord) but led him back to the light; but was willing to murder his nephew in his sleep?!!??!! <br /><br />2) None of the Empires ships couldn't just simply light jump ahead and destroy the fleeing ship?<br /><br />If you have a fond childhood memory's of Star Wars this one will put a dent in it for sure. Disney/Commercialism/Politics finally kills the Last Jedi. ""Han shot first!"""
3977,1,How not to subvert expectations,"A son is about to kill its mother. It already killed his father a couple of years earlier, so he hesitates. He is not alone, and the companions decide to seize the opportunity during his pause... and take the shot. The mother, and the rest of the people that was with her, get sucked up by the cold vacuum of space.<br /><br />All seems lost. But then, the mother, the leader of the resistance opens her eyes, extends its hand to the ship, and flies towards it! It's a miracle!"
3978,1,"More than just a bad star wars movie, but just an awful movie.",Where do I begin with this. I will start off by saying that I kept checking to see what time it was. I was keenly aware that I did not bring enough snacks and drink.
3979,1,No. Just... No,"I would rather gouge my eyes out, rather than watch this garbage again. Glad it's not canon!"
3980,1,Expected a desaster and was still disappointed,I didn't want to watch it because Episode VII was already a disappointment. Like what was even the point of the plot here? The rebellion running away in slow motion while everyone else is travelling the galaxy up and down showing up like boss suddenly? How long are they crawling away (days? Weeks? How? Why?)and why is nobody cutting them off? Has the new order no other ships? How do you even get anywhere in sub-lightspeed? The galaxy is stupidly huge... And where did all of the new republic go? Why am I watching the same story again but worse?? You butchered it so bad i don't even... How can you mess it up so bad?
3981,3,The Force did not guide The Last Jedi,Rey talking to Luke
3982,2,Starts well but goes horribly wrong,"I was fooled by the professional reviewers again. While I do think this was better than The Force Awakens and Rogue One, I'm still hugely disappointed by it. "
3983,1,"Not just the characters and plot, the Star Wars astrophysics were destroyed","Listen, ignoring the ""man-hate"" destruction of all the male characters, the physics are irrevocably destroyed. 1. Space cruisers (and most ships) do not require a stop at the nearby gas station. They have reactors. (ahem, they don't run out of fuel like they were depicted in this Sith propaganda film). 2. If it was so easy to destroy HUGE vehicles by jumping through them with light speed, why even build anything large like... say a death star? 3. If the First order ships were so slow, why not just light speed jump ahead of them and blow them away? (As an aside, see below *) 4. Has stealth technology become ubiquitous in the star wars universe? 5. Transports have always had light speed. Just send them in 7 different directions. 6. Leia. In space. Without a space suit. And she survives the blast AND zero atmosphere? Morons. The lot of them. 7. Finally, where did the entire resistance fleet go? (* obviously they focused on speed of their ships over the number)."
3984,2,I turned it off.,"I don't know where I got this from but I have it on a DVD. I got about an hour in but that was all I could take, Star Wars has offically jumped the shark."
3985,2,I think I just watched a Star Wars parody,"It must have been a parody. The amount of slapstick and senseless humor that was put into the movie was meant to turn this into a parody, right? I can't explain this mess any other way."
3986,2,two stars,I gave it two stars for the Space penguins. Their hysteric and frightened face expressions are literary depicting my feelings when I figured out that I gave my money for watching ''The Room'' of Star Wars movies and SF movies in general.
3987,1,"As Yoda said.... ""There... is.... a-no-ther.... story..... here!""","The real story here, how can this movie.... AT BEST..... a below average to average movie, start off with a 9+ rating on IMDB and a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes for a lengthy period of time, giving the impression that this was a epic film. Simple.... CORRUPTION...... corruption of the media, film critics, big movie companies and special interest groups. They all had this power to give us a false sense of greatness to this movie, which only by the will of the average movie goer, exposed this flick for what it is. This should be a warning..... TRUST NOTHING !"
3988,1,Sad,How can there be so much disrespect for the millions of people who grew up with the saga and had such strong connection with the characters? what's with the worthless gags? why is the logic of galactic battles completelly shattered? why is every sort of logic and common sense destroyed in such a clumsy way? why does Luke milk a cow and drink its milk? how can such a bad writer/director even make it to the project? 
3989,1,The worst of the Star Wars Movies,"Silly jokes, bad script, and worse directing. If Lucas was dead he'd be rolling in his grave. Never let Rian Johnson direct anything Star War again."
3990,2,Sick and tired of the lying paid off fake news,"There's nothing to say.. Hollywood is simply out of very good script writers and has lost any ability to cast any actor in a lead role that doesn't look like an emotionally inept doll. Performances are so incredibly surface due to both casting and ridiculous scripts that it's a wonder even the wooden actors go ""bluuuur"". A shambles, a ridiculous, insensitive plot, zero spirituality, and a corporation gone utterly mad via its own greed. One of the most important stories in film history ruined ( possibly on purpose ) with a complete disregard for ingenuity and sincerity of the artists and original crew who made this story such an important story for almost all of us. The limited knowledge understanding and inability to feel anything other than profit has finally infused itself into the heart of this corporation / banking business gone mad. A Long Time Ago... they gave us everything... now they offer us poverty, middle eastern wars and incredibly poorly designed cinematic drivel."
3991,1,Stunned by stupidity,"After having to walk away and ""force"" myself to see finish this parody of a movie. All I can say is this.<br /><br />I thought The force awakens was the worst movie ever created, but now it is The last Jedi.."
3992,1,This movie was terrible,"Definitely the weakest film of all, and that's coming from someone who despises the prequels."
3993,1,"An entertaining film with interesting ideas, that is let down by poor writing","Unlike many people I didn't mind 'The Force Awakens'. Its purpose was to set up a new trilogy and introduce us to new characters, which I think it did very well. Though it took very few risks and was very similar to 'A New Hope', it had reasons for it."
3994,1,"Wow, but not a good wow.",I would have walked out in the first 10 minutes if the grand kids had not been with me. I have been a fan since I was a kid. I have no interest in the next one.
3995,1,Worst. Adam Driver the worst,"The worst Star wars ever.<br /><br />The talentless Adam Driver is the worst choice ever. The producers and directors joined the Dark Dodd by getting paid to choose Adam Driver..,<br /><br />Worst.<br /><br />Dart Vader crying and...."
3996,2,Like a boil on the face of an old friend.,"I thought after watching The Force Awakens that I could believe in these new characters, that Disney and Abrams had pulled off the impossible, that Star Wars lives again and I could get the toys out of the loft and do the whole Star wars thing all over again with my boys and now their kids too. Now, after a bewildering family evening at the local Showcase with The Last Jedi, all Disney has achieved is spoiling everything we had before. Shame on you. We've erased this from our collective memories and we wont be queueing for Ep.9."
3997,1,Rian Johnson is trash,I will never watch a movie or TV show with this guy's name attached. He took a well established and iconic franchise and almost destroyed it with this movie. The total lack of respect he has for the viewing audience is appalling. I would give this 0/10 stars if I could.
3998,4,You get what you didn't ask for,"Critics be damned. They want to review the film by calling out the audience as unable to understand, acting as if The Last Jedi is some higher than though cinematic idol that only those of supreme taste can understand. The truth is that we now live in a time were the people do understand the language of film and care about what you do when telling a story. They don't always just want a spectacle to distract them and should desire more than that from films they admire. "
3999,1,It crushed my expectations,"I was expecting the movie to be utterly garbage, and it was even worse than that!!! "
4000,2,Easily the worst of the franchise,It's difficult to even know where to start...<br /><br />
4001,1,The Parallels to the 2016 US Election are Uncanny,"So, so painful to watch. Star Wars: The Last Jedi will evoke many of the same emotions as the 2016 election in the US. It has all of the contrived inauthenticity of the Clinton campaign, and all of the infuriating brainlessness of the Trump campaign. Disney has absolutely destroyed a once-beloved franchise. Don't get me wrong - this film will make it's money, but at the cost of the franchise's spirit. Storytellers are needed for a new generation, and it's time to say a fond farewell to Star Wars."
4002,1,This movie was so bad it compelled me to make my first review ever,"As title suggested, this movie is an absolute joke. It is so unfathomably bad it's an embarrassment to the everything Star Wars has ever been."
4003,1,gorgeous looking no content,So many horrible story line twists that go no where...the bombers ..ancient 1942 technolgy ...slow chase from hell space scene...too many unanswered questions...who what was snoke....this movie had potential but ran on to no where...horrible
4004,1,Just chiming in...,"I came here very disappointed, and sad. I wasn't sure that people would agree with me, but it looks like the majority do. How the math works out that IMDB is able to say the user ratings are a 7.9 when all I see are 1-3 stars, I don't know? I get the idea that they are being paid by Disney to post a fake number up front. Sad, because the IMDB user reviews were becoming one of the only things I could trust in the sea of fake media out there. Disgusted with Disney, disgusted with Star Wars, and now - also - disgusted with IMDB."
4005,1,Only thing that can be said.....It was terrible,"5 years from now, this movie will go down as the worst Star Wars movie to ever exist. "
4006,2,I really wanted to prove myself wrong!,"To start I loved The Force Awakens. I know others didn't but I did. I don't mind watching it over and over again because it was fun. The Last Jedi had so much to work with and had so much potential and well.... it sucked. As simple as that. There were some good parts but the character felt that they were handled wrong. I wasn't expected anything specific but this was a disappointment. Even though I believe that you don't have to follow the majority, you can still do it wrong. Thumbs down"
4007,1,WHY??,"Full of plot holes.<br /><br />The hole casino plotline can be scrapped.<br /><br />Misuse of characters.<br /><br />Destroying the lore.<br /><br />Should have ended 3 times but kept going.<br /><br />A bad movie, filled with ready to buy merchandise.<br /><br />Why Yoda..... Why???????"
4008,2,Worst Star Wars movie,"Don't watch it, simple, it's terrible. Not even Star Wars tbh"
4009,2,What ?,"It's just not Star Wars.<br /><br />Tried to watch it again tonight and it's unbearable. The Disney's injection is not working. When they bought Lucasfilm I knew this would happen. They try to make all the movies the same. A watered down version so that everyone ""will enjoy"". It's all profits and no soul. They should stick to making cartoons and family movies."
4010,5,Flow & Continuity,"Let me start by saying this: I didn't hate The Last Jedi, there were aspects of the film that I liked and some (many) that I didn't. But my overall opinion on TLJ comes from the fact that I have watched every Star Wars movie time and time again including TLJ, and every time I watch it I find myself disliking it even more, here's why..."
4011,3,Basically terrible.,"You know, if you skip all the scenes with Poe, Fin and Rose this movie is almost bearable. Almost. Still though, WHAT was Rian Johnson thinking?!"
4012,1,the Marvel intro was more enjoyable than this entire movie,"Everything about this movie was bad, from the story all the way to the terrible acting. This movie gives me no incentive to watch the 9, and am not the least bit interested to see were the story is going. <br /><br />Without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie ever made."
4013,1,Great fun with a few flaws,I just got back from watching this movie and I really enjoyed this one. I had goosebumps through several scenes and thought it was better than Force Awakens for sure. 
4014,1,A Total Disgrace,"Rian Johnson and Co succeed at ruining both this new trilogy, and the old by totally crapping on old and new characters. "
4015,1,The Worst Star Wars yet,"Uninteresting development of the plot, again, a bad copy-cat attempt of the first trilogy ( rebels are found, they need to escape, the hero undergoes training etc.. ) <br /><br />The screenplay is the worst one yet, it could have been literally any other bad blockbuster movie full of of special effects. Half of the scenes make no sense ( Rose kisses Fin in the middle of the base being blown up???? ) , add no value to the story ( What was the point of that 5minutes long mutiny?!?! ) and have child-like superficial humour.<br /><br />Characters are badly developed too, they turned Luke into an idiot who's lost and confused, Leia ( RIP Carrie ) does nothing to the storyline, Kylo is still the same traumatised kid and what's the point with Banderas!??! <br /><br />You can read George Lucas's comments when Disney took over, even Mark Hamill said he wished they followed George's ideas. No need to analyse though, you can clearly tell Disney shifted focus audience to new generations as this is a movie for kids. For the rest of us, the whole movie almost felt like a parody of STAR WARS."
4016,1,The Disney Deathstar,"Over the recent years Disney has been slowly though steadily revealing that the dollar and the agenda seem to be their most significant driving force. This film actually hurt many people's feelings, myself included. Sadly, Disney's true colors are beginning to fully show."
4017,2,I wish this was the last movie..,"I wish I could wipe this movie from my memory. As well as the endless list of stupid plot points, bad writing and a total failure and disregard at handling the Star Wars universe and it's characters Disney also allowed the franchise to be used to try and push ridiculous feminist views."
4018,1,Don't believe the hype,This film is just god awful and it pains me to say this
4019,3,It hurts... It really hurts. I take Jar Jar-Binks any day over this...,"If you just casually watched a few ""Star Wars"" movies & thought they were alright, this is for you. If you are a ""Star Wars""-fan you can't take this new installment seriously; to a point where you actually feel a bit of shallow pain after you leave the theater. The movie feels like fanfiction, which threw all the rules, that George Lucas created, out of the window und made your childhood characters fly through space without any suit or anything, but with the force. Star Wars always felt like a real thing far far away, now it feels like a summer blockbuster movie, that you'll forget the second you come home. There are so many Things that are bad about this movie, that i couldn't get them into the review. I'm not a Review guy, but now I felt a strong sense do get my disappointment out of my system. KATHLEEN KENNDEDY: PLEASE GIVE US MORE FROM GARETH EDWARDS, THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE!"
4020,2,This is not Star Wars!,"It makes me sad and angry to see what Rian Johnson did to the Star Wars universe.<br /><br />J.J Abrahms has made a great, visually bombastic film. The figures have all harmoniously inserted and made you want more. We all wanted to know who Rey's parents are, where the Knights of Ren are and what the hell Luke has been doing all the time. Johnson ignored most of these questions (Knights of Ren) and if he answered one, I could have started crying. For example: Rey's parents were insignificant alcoholics, Luke had drunk green milk from a weird cow, and Snoke ... well ... he's dead now.<br /><br />What really bothered me about the movie was its jokes. Of course, Star Wars is funny (droids, han, etc) but not to that extent and not so artificial.<br /><br />Oh yes, there is something else: PORGS! I hate Porgs. These things are just there for little kids to buy and for Chewi to have 5 minutes more screentime. There is much more that bothers me about this movie (Rose, Holdo, ...), but I do not want to bore you with it :)<br /><br />I really hope the next part gets better.<br /><br />May the force be with you!"
4021,5,Fails miserably as a middle to a trilogy,"Being tonally different to the first part of a three part story is not necessarily bad , after all episode 5 was tonally different to episode 4. Not continuing to tell the story in a meaningful way from the first part and changing basic character motivations and character traits is bad."
4022,2,Anyone who watched Episode IX after this deserves his stolen time and money,"And let's be honest, JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson have no talent. Well, they have one talent. They can steal money and time from the simple-minded. I guess they are like Donnie the New york City STD victim. Even with all the mega amount of Disney marketing dollars the original trilogy is still a 10/10 and this is a 1/10. K.P.K.L 😚"
4023,1,Absolute Garbage,What'sCant add anything more than that has already been said.<br /><br />So much wonder has been destroyed by the Hollywood tripe since I was a 6 year old watching Episode IV on the big screen. Can someone please tell me whats happened?
4024,5,That does it,"It was the last movie I watched from the Star Wars franchise ever. It is a waste of time and resources and ruined the best franchise ever in movie history. The previous episode was also a disaster but I thought that this will get better. Well, it got worse and it shows that the whole concept of the new trilogy is a miserable failure. It would have been better if these new SW movies would not have been made at all. Shame on the story, shame on the direction. Lots of B category low budget sci-fis are much more enjoyable these days. Frankly speaking, this episode is full of so dull and illogical things that I can't even beleive it actually happened as a SW movie. Shame, really shame... I am totally disappointed in Disney and will never ever watch anything that they do."
4025,2,I am 51 year old white male,I am 51 year old white male and star wars gave me hope and inspiration as a kid these last 3 star wars movies make me wanna cry
4026,1,"This film is no good, unfortunately.","I'm writing the review rather late, but better now than never. I went to see this movie on its premiere when it came out a couple of years ago - and still it remains the worst film I've watched in the 2010's."
4027,1,Not impressed.,"As a massive Star Wars fan I was very disappointed with this movie, I didn't agree with anything the arrogant director Rian Johnson did. He selfishly made a movie for himself and not the fans. I watched it once in the cinema and NEVER EVER again! That's 2 hours I could have used watching an MCU movie at home instead."
4028,1,Why?,"Why, Rian? Why did you write this nonsense piece of crap?"
4029,1,I have no words.,I have no word to say how bad it was so ill just say. IT SUCK SO BAD!!!!!!!
4030,3,What an absolute trainwreck of a movie,"What an absolute trainwreck of a movie. I don't even know where to begin. I've tried approaching this review several different ways, but I have so much to say that it feels like I'm writing a novel. This movie is a perfect example of poor writing and should be used in all scriptwriting classes to teach aspiring screenwriters what to avoid doing."
4031,1,Star Wars is dead,Unbelievable how horrid this movie was. I heard many bad things before but nothing could of prepared me for this abomination.
4032,1,the last jedi was so bad it made my sister cry,"Putting aside the fact that TLJ destroys all the original trilogy characters development and motivation as well as the new trios, or the way it contradicts or ignores all of star wars canon, or even the fact that it kills every interesting plot point from TFA, it an incredibly poorly made film. i have no idea why people are giving it good reviews; it was poorly edited, poorly plotted, poorly designed, and flat out did not feel like a star wars movie. i dont see how episode 9 can fix any of this. as a star wars fan, im heartbroken"
4033,3,Harry Potter with the plot from Mad Max Fury Road,"From the very first scene you realize this film is a whole new direction for Star Wars where jokes and fun scenes trump the story, the universe and the plot.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The force awakens left some really interesting questions but all of them are incredibly unsatisfied answered. Like Rey's origin, who Snoke were, what Luke actually did and so on."
4034,4,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Latest Dud,"Story and Plot - F<br /><br />No main plot but several sub-plots we don't need to know or care about. Story is very boring, confusing and hard to understand."
4035,1,Doesn't feel like a Star Wars Film-So disappointing,"This disappointed me so much, I was expecting to really enjoy it being a complete Star Wars fanatic but it just didn't feel like a Star Wars film at all. I could (and have) rant on for hours and days about how much I dislike this movie and how much is wrong with it but I think the best thing to do is just to say skip it, maybe look up the few important plot points (basically just some of what Luke, Rey and Kylo do) on the internet and watch Rise of Skywalker instead after Force Awakens."
4036,1,Yes. It's true. I just made an account to fundamentally disagree with everything this movie stood for,"I have many words for this film. But, alas, that would take a millennia to type. So, just know that I not only hated this movie because of my love for Star Wars...but because it was a terrible movie in every aspect. Just a crappy, long, boring, directionless mess of a film. Fire Kathleen Kennedy and never allow Rian Johnson on a project again. For Christ's sake."
4037,2,Disappointed,"I missed the cinema release and have been avoiding reviews until now. I noticed it available on the new movie section on a Delta flight and was excited to finally get to see it for the first time, thinking I would buy the full digital version to do justice on a big screen. <br /><br />My quick review:<br /><br />"
4038,5,TERRIBLE,REVIEW - STAR WARS - THE LAST JEDI
4039,1,Trash - RIP franchise,This movie subverted my expectations quite thoroughly.
4040,2,Oh it's bad!,"When you think of a chase scene, you think exhilarating, fast paced and exciting. Think again because the whole of the last Jedi is one slow boring goose chase accompanied with some horrible comic relief."
4041,2,Star Justice Wars - The Last Woke Jedi,"Having barely got through The Farce Awakens, I thought ""well it can't get any worse right? RIGHT?"""
4042,1,"Two words, pacing and evocation. This film had neither. What universe are we in?","Been to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and it is just not good, not good at all. "
4043,1,"we get it Rian Johnson, you love Kylo Ren","I was so excited after The Force Awakens to see the next saga of our main trio of heroes, Poe Finn and Rey, and even more excited at the new character of Rose and the roles that Leia and Luke from the OT would bring. "
4044,3,"Nice CGI,Awful story and progression","It's just a dead end movie didn't care about the 7 previous episodes its like a standalone or an alter universe thing, if you watch it put aside the nice CGI and take a good look at tge story you will without a doubt hate it."
4045,4,What...was THAT?,"I'll start by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars. It's entertaining enough but not great, and it's the most overrated film franchise I've ever seen. Now that that's over with, I'm not going to mince words."
4046,1,Littlerly top 10 worst movies ever,Its embarrassing comparing this movie to any of the previous Star Wars movies. The director and writers would better off working for Starbucks. Didn't think it could get worse after that last piece of crap jj put out. This is laughable
4047,1,The only way this changes is if you stop supporting the Star Wars franchise.,"If you have been a Star Wars fan since the beginning, chances are: You'll hate The Last Jedi. I'll simply say that it destroys Luke's character. There are other beefs that other reviewers have pointed out, but it is what Rian chose to do with Luke that made me dislike it so much. I don't believe that they tested a full audience with enough people born 1960 to 1980. I belong to that group, btw. My guess is, like me, almost all of them would have said, ""Sorry, but you'll have to rethink a few things and especially Luke."" Like the title says...this only changes when people stop supporting the franchise and send Disney a pain in the wallet."
4048,1,Spaceball 2 incoming,"Ok, VII was not very good. However, Abrams tried to implement new storylines, Charakters etc... Johnson destroys all of these with only a few swings, leaving you with just nothing."
4049,1,"Luke Milks A Sea Cow, Super Leia Is Marry Poppins And Snoke Is Only Half A Man","When in 2015 I had the displeasure of watching the bland and unremarkable copy-and-paste Star Wars-like ""The Force Awakens"", from noted hack and serial plagiarist J J Abrams, I had a hard time imagining how the next instalment in this new, soulless trilogy could be worse."
4050,1,Worse than the Phantom Menace,"Awful storytelling, a pointless subplot that shifts to a casino for around an hour, stupid death of Snoke and an AWFUP"
4051,3,Catastrophic sequel,"I first need to state that as a Star Wars Fan I'm thrilled to witness all those new sequels,<br /><br />for instance I didn't praise The Force Awakens however I thought back then that rebooting such an old franchise is a hard task, I really enjoyed Rogue One which I'm thinking is maybe one of the best Star Wars movie ever even compared to the first trilogy."
4052,1,Severely Let Down,I made an account just to review this.
4053,1,A huge mess,Pros:<br /><br />1) Looks good. <br /><br />2) Decent soundtrack. 
4054,4,"A tecnically well shot, directed, and acted pretenious black hole of a narrative.","If you don't put any thought into the plot, characters, setting, story or mind getting hit over head with themes that aren't really supported by the narrative you might be able to enjoy this film otherwise, like me you'll probably find this film to be a frustrating almost insulting disappoint."
4055,1,Bar none worst movie in the Star Wars series.,"This was a terrible movie full of bad unoriginal writing filled with plot holes. If it was a standalone movie it would have been fine and brushed aside like the trash that it is, but it completely renders the previous original trilogy meaningless and irrelevant. I'd rather they just have not made a new trilogy instead of ruining the whole star wars legacy. Nobody at disney is going to care about this review so i plan on doing the only thing i can to express my disappointment and refuse to watch the final episode and boycott any Disney and Star Wars merchandise for as long as i can."
4056,1,Letdown of galactic scale,"Ninth installation of this space-opera serie was a devastating letdown. The movie does not ""drag a little in the middle"" as many critics claimed, it just drags; in the beginning, in the middle and in the end.<br /><br />Plot of this movie is splintered into way too many little paths each hosting its own stars. This movie is just filled with characters that are by no means important or relevant to the story, they just are there.<br /><br />I don't think Star Wars should be dead serious. But in all honesty, the amount of jokes in this movie just killed all the atmosphere what remained of the Galaxy far far away.<br /><br />It seems that easter eggs, puns and lazy action were more important than plot or continuity."
4057,1,It's unbelieveble it even exists..,I am totally shocked by this as it shatters everything i loved about Star Wars. Its not even worth the name.
4058,2,Absolute disgrace,2/10 for a Star Wars movie! Probably 6/10 if it was an unrelated science fiction adventure! Nicely done piece of s*** thou!
4059,2,"Social Justice Warriors make a Star Wars movie, how sad.","It´s hard to sit back and enjoy this when all I can see are card board cutout political and social agenda placements all over it. If these people want men and women to be equal (they already are) then why do they have to have women copy and paste women into every conceivable role in a movie, have those women make all the decisions and ensure success while leaving the token male cast to be badies or be incompetent?"
4060,1,More corporate drivel about fake rebels,"I was so excited to see this film after Rogue One crushed it in every aspect and The Force Awakens had great entertainment value, minus retread plot. But wow, this movie was so lost and stuffed full of unnecessary characters and plot lines. What happened? Couldn't they afford to have Lawrence Kasdan do a pass on the script? The worst part was the bad humor, attempting to fit in to the millennial, Guardians of the Galaxy, aesthetic. This movie was made to sell stuffed animals to 4 year olds."
4061,1,HATED IT!! Sucked!,"When a New Hope came out in '77, I was just 6 years old. For the past 40 years, I have LOVED Star Wars!! Empire Strikes Back was epic!!"
4062,1,The force wasn't with this effort,This is just terrible! Awful acting and same old predictable storyline. We're not seeing anything new here. It's like a mix of all the other films in the series and Harry Potter. The film is littered with some very poor attempts at humour that just don't really work! Not sure why Princess Leia is now able to fly though space without a ship or why at times she sounds like Marge Simpson. <br /><br />Only the most dedicated Star Wars fan could get any enjoyment from this.
4063,3,So sad....,I am compelled to share my view of the movie to give my feedback for others to more easily pin point where our sadness comes from..
4064,1,hi new su.ks magic world,Terrible movie. wht rian why? what is the problem with yourself?<br /><br />hoca kamooon kamoon hoca you can not that
4065,2,A Fan Boy wet dream but in Reality A below average movie,"It had Special Effects to the max. It had light saber fights. It had Rey in training to be one with the force. Who could not like that?!!? Well, what they forgot was a storyline, character development, a continuation of a 'mary sue' character, logical story telling, Luke being a whiny little 'bit**' like he was in the original Star Wars (he did grow up a little in Return of the Jedi but reverted to the 'Whiny little 'BIT**' in this movie). Rey having no character development. The movie wanted to please every 'family friendly' family out there to only find it only pleasing 'Fan Boys' who have no clue about real cinema and the history of American Cinema and Politics. It was an utter disappointment to be nice."
4066,5,Painfully average,"I'm in my 50's, which means I was alive to see the original in grade 6 or so. I was amazed. Still am. I weathered through Jedi--even through the prequels, which truthfully, weren't very good. My faith in Star Wars was satiated with the force awakens, which was well done."
4067,1,This movie broke the fan base,"Contrived rubbish, Rian Johnson clearly is the sort of person who smells his own farts and buys himself trophies."
4068,1,Worst movie ever !! Thank u disney for ruining star wars for me,"I think most of the people give 10 is disney employee also i see they have perfect grammar as well and most of them don't have reviews other than a few movie. Yeah, also they don't want to spoil it because there is nothing to spoil !!!!<br /><br />Characters are shallow most of the good characters are npc animals which disney try to sell I think. There is no sense from beginning they follow the last ship of resistance about 20 hours ""reason thier ship is faster"" they don't think to send fighters or jump in front of them no they follow 20 hours with no logic. Mark Hamill probably have a bad stomach or something with that face they think this is a good acting.The script is worthless, the act is shallow and directing is boring he just does fast pace and slow pace with scenes it's like two different directors directed it. Anyway, this movie so bad too many levels. They killed star wars for me. thank u Disney"
4069,2,Destroyed me,To snuff out the main goodie and main baddie in one movie was too much for me to bear. I'm signed up here just to say RIP Star Wars.
4070,1,Death Star? Death Planet? Meh... Here's a film that can destroy a whole universe!,"There's nothing more to say that has not been mentioned in the other negative reviews. It's all true. But i was dissapointed to read this in many of the positive ones: ""I'm giving this a 10/10 to compensate for the 1/10s"". No, please don't do this. Just rate the (f-word) film! But no person who has watched another film in his life would give it more than 5 (maybe for he hard work on visuals, sound etc...). I'm sorry for all the people who worked hard for this film. I'm trully sorry, it's 1/10."
4071,1,Bots don't write reviews in English,Notice how the good reviews look like they're written by bots? Yea... nobody liked this movie
4072,1,"Absolutely horrible movie, wish I could rate it -10 stars.","Star Wars isn't about politics or social issues, it's Star Wars and escape into fantasy. Bringing all this into the movie was horrible. Even worse is the timeline, jumping around here and there and needless irrelevant scenes that added nothing to the movie. Iconic characters made weak and stupid and killed off wholesale so the undeveloped new characters could step into the light and fizzle. No story development, no character development and a horrible ""plot"". I saw a New Hope in theater at 7 years old, my sons where excited to finally be able to see a Star Wars movie with me in the theater and experience that excitement with me and this crap comes on the screen. So disappointing, will wait for anything else Disney Wars to come out on streaming service than waste money at the theater. So wish I could have given this 0 or negative stars as 1 star is WAY too many."
4073,2,"Women good, men bad","Seems to be the premise of this entire movie. Also, so many plot holes in this that i cant even comprehend how real people read the script and accepted it??"
4074,3,Below average,"Really bad choices with the plot ,characters and the political messages they promote through this famous franchise.im keeping the old trilogy and the prequels i dont care about the new movies."
4075,2,"A ""B"" Movie with a BIG Budget","The story, dialogue, and at times, the acting, are all ""B"" movie quality. You would think Ewe Boll wrote and directed this mess of a movie! Not only is that bad, but apparently Rian Johnson didn't understand the Star Wars universe at all. His script basically BROKE the Star Wars universe, and especially this particular story line, that there is no reason to even want to watch the coming final chapter of the trilogy."
4076,2,Awful,The new trilogy is disappointing. They have ruined Star Wars.<br /><br />P. S The special effects are terrible too.
4077,1,Woke Piece of Garbage Belongs to the Trash,"Without a doubt the worst Star Wars film in history in my opinion. Lots of wokeness and lots of political correctness, this movie is nothing but a Political and woke Garbage that belongs to the Trash. I will not watch any Star wars movies or tv shows in my life again. Don't waste your precious time and Hard earned money 💰 i give this movie 0 stars 💩🖕👎"
4078,1,"Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, Kiri Hart and Jar Jar Abrams *SLOW CLAP*","Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy and the all Female story group led by Kiri Hart at Lucasfilms (plus Jar Jar Abrams) have literally destroyed Star Wars - and the film is explicit about it through Kylo Rens sentiments of wanting to destroy everything from the past, kill it if you have to. (These are the people who had one chance to reunite onscreen the original cast and failed so miserably)."
4079,5,What the hell happened?!?!?!?!?!,"What the hell happened?!?!? The first movie was pretty safe, they didnt took any risks and the og characters were basically the same, it was lazy writting but it could be improved; but now on this movie, literally they dont even act as the characters they used to be, Luke is the worst one by far, to the point where they just killed his character before his death. 2 of the 3 characters from the previous movie do nothing but mistake after mistake and just make things worse while also eing boring, and the other character Rey does nothing besides being with someone who says its Luke but doesnt act like him by far, until the end when she kinda does something. The villains are just a mock of what they used to be in chapter VII and the previous movies, and speaking of wich, this movie has even more jokes than the previous one, if the jokes on chapter VII where mildly OK because they were a little funny, in this one they are said in the worst situations possible and just ruin the rythm and little tension of the story. Now that Ive seen episode IX I can tolerate a little more this one because it tried (in the worst way humanly possible) to look up to the future instead of the past and make something new, but the problem is that it tried achieving this by ruining everything from the past, while also making everything new just boring."
4080,1,Nope - on an Epic Scale,NUTSHELL:<br /><br />This movie destroys what a Jedi is and completely ruined the entire franchise.
4081,1,WORST STAR WARS EVER!,God awful in every way possible! What they did to Luke Skywalker was a travesty! Ans some of the worst editing I have ever sen in a Star Wars movie.
4082,1,An Incoherent Fan-Fic Mess ***SPOILERS***,"Kathleen Kennedy cooks the Golden Goose that is the Star Wars franchise, eats it, and then excretes it in the latest entry of the Social Justice Trilogy; The Last Jedi."
4083,1,Ep.8 Eternal massacre,"When a franchise is sold, you as a seller always bakes in som perks. The characters are one of those perks. I bet whatever merchandise is sold involving Luke, Han, Yoda and the rest of the backbone characters - the profit lands in George Lucas hands. Whatever new character that joins the story belong to Disney. Simple math here is, use the old characters to draw the crowd, but don't make them significant to the story - give them some old lines everyone's seen or heard before and then wipe them out - they are not moneymaking - dishem out."
4084,2,Purposefully Mediocre & Insulting,"This is my first Imdb review. Felt the need to do so due to how disappointing this movie was. I'll keep it short. There were some nice visual parts, but if you care about story development or the original start wars story/characters, you will be disappointed. It's to the point that I felt they purposefully took a lackluster approach. 7.5/10 is a ridiculous score for this movie to have. Imdb loses credibility for me when higher ratings are given unjustly. The writing of this movie is just fundamentally flawed. I wanted to like this film."
4085,1,How is this movie connected with the saga?,I felt completely confused after watching it!
4086,2,This movie isn't good,"I'll make this a short review, the actors did an amazing job for the most part, the only one I have a major issue with is Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of DJ, his character really serves no purpose for this film and the whole Finn, Rose and DJ arc is one big political statement against rich people, I don't need that in a Star Wars movie."
4087,5,Superbly mediocre,"I'm going to make this short and sweet. I've been waiting for the next episode in the Star Wars Legacy, and all my waiting was not rewarded. I don't know if it's Disney, but this was just not a good movie - not a bad one, but definitely not a good one. The actors did alright, but the plot and some of the scenarios were just ridiculous. Certain things happen and you ask yourself - how did they get there, or how did they know. Situations are just implied and it does not come off in a good fashion. It took me 2 sittings to get through this movie, so I honestly can't say I'm super hyped about the next one. It's a shame too because the Star Wars franchise (the original trilogy) are some of the best movies of all time. Thanks Disney."
4088,1,Worst Star Wars movie EVER.,"Episode 7 set up all kinds of very important questions, and we were all waiting patiently for some answers:"
4089,1,You have failed me for the last time!,"Been growing with Star Wars (3rd movie I saw in theaters was the Phantom Manace a long time ago...). Now for this movie, It is just wrong, I won't go on to the details, please check some comments where people had the patience to list what is wrong and trust me they are very thorough and hit the spot. Overall, weak plot, boring, slow paced, no questions answered or answers ruined the plot, characters are destroyed (old ones or not present at all), too much comedy, ALMOST NO Lightsaber fights, or the fights are short and not significant, no emotion generated for the characters (I have absolutelly no attachment to any character from the new saga) and the list can go on. I will see the next one when it appears on torrents, waste of time and money. I was understanding with TFA since it is hard to continue such an epic saga, but this thing buried my hopes for this Star Wars.... For me Star Wars ended with episode 6"
4090,4,This isn't Star Wars,"I love Star Wars, I'm a child of the 80's. "
4091,1,"Terrible film, shame on you Disney!!","This movie was terrible, hardly even felt like a Star Wars film. JJ Abrams set up what could've been a great sequel to TFA and Rian Johnson threw all that potential away. The writing was awful, characters were flawed, no respect given for the lore and plot holes everywhere. The forced humor and political undertones made this already bad movie even less enjoyable. Disney, is this seriously all $317 million was capable of?? Rian Johnson has shown his incompetence as a director and should never be let into a studio or near a Star Wars project ever again."
4092,1,Abysmal,"This was garbage, to those responsible (I'm not going to show you any respect by typing your names) I hope you never work in the entertainment industry again PERIOD. If you had any decency you would give back your fee's and compensate all the Star Wars fans whom you essentially made pay to watch you destroy their franchise. To Mark Hammill a huge thank you and show of respect for trying to warn us and congratulations on your well deserved Hollywood walk of fame Star."
4093,1,"As Usual, all the money went to Special Effects, not good writing.","It's a pity to waste good actors on re-runs. If I wanted to watch Empire Strikes Back, again...I'd watch the original. So disappointed in this offering. Much of the dialogue was <br /><br /> muddy...and the many characters making sacrifices had no story for them....(The Resistance General for one.) "
4094,1,A no hope,"This is just an all-trash movie, taking an awesome franchise down to a circus.<br /><br />I don't see a point."
4095,1,Amazingly terrible,"Anyone who enjoys this film over the age of 13 is obviously just a huge fan of the original trilogy and is not giving an honest review of this appalling mess of a movie. The part with Leia 'force Mary Poppins' back to the ship got a WTF reaction from me (out loud) and everyone in the theatre laughed.<br /><br />This is not star wars this is appalling feminazi garbage, if I could give zero stars I would."
4096,3,WHY OH WHY,"This was so unsettling that I almost cried. The cast was struggling with generic script, space battles were awesome sometimes , til just boring on other occasions. Mr. Hamill had few moments in where he shined despite the obvious non directorial guidance. Some scenes felt like ripoffs of TLOTR, other SW movies. Just utter persistence of Studio on cramming cute and annoying animals in movie made it Disney like. Yuck.... The heads of many in theater fell more than one occasion due to unnecessary scenes, attempts of tiding up loose ends from previous movies, super occurred scenes that had no general meaning. Lack of story consistency with characters popping up randomly not related to story afterwords...Wat's up with that??????<br /><br />When you try to create line of story and waste 10 min on creating plot stick to it, make twist sure....BUT DON'T LOOSE characters in the process. Or add random . Bad editing ....<br /><br />I'm cutting on franchise. Rouge One was cool compared to this..."
4097,1,Bots keeping this high,"How this is averaging a 7, when it is a disaster of a movie, I don't know. It can only be bots. Disney have destroyed the Star Wars legacy with this nonsense movie. No character development, annoying new characters, old characters ruined and a disregard to storytelling and script that is jaw-dropping."
4098,2,I'd rather this movie never came to the theatres,"Maybe because of the high expectations, maybe disney doesn't have what lucas has i really find the movie a lack of time. everythings moved so fast, dialogs were very simple and there were tones of matterial to be bored.Also it shared the same timeline with ""empire strikes back"" with some (but very little) modifications. escape from the base, rey's getting lessons, duel of the bad and good. It really make me sick to watch the movie."
4099,3,Saw it... merited my first review on IMDB,"What did I just see? I saw that it was available on Netflix and I said to myself: at least the special effects should be cool. They were cool, but nowadays that is the minimum you can expect from a large budget movie. "
4100,1,An absolute mess,"This movie is a disaster. I saw it in a completely filled theater opening night and you could feel the sense of disappointment and betrayal hanging in the air. I was not a fan of the Force Awakens, and was cautiously hopeful of this movie. It was worse that I could ever have possibly imagined. Disney should be ashamed of what they did to the franchise; good luck at recovering from this one."
4101,2,Worse than the Prequels,"This movie, apart from major plot holes (a whole side mission to nowhere for no ultimate reason), some laughably bad scenes (""Leia Poppins""--you really don't ever want to scar your brain with that image), and deus ex machina contrivances everywhere (BB8 solves many problems instantly), has a serious problem with characterization. Rey has no backstory. (The movie takes pains to point out that she has no real story--weird.) Kylo is not intimidating, just a dithering weenie. Worst of all, Luke is no longer Luke. If you make the mistake of seeing this one, you'll find out what I mean. They absolutely trash Luke, the hero of the original trilogy. That's just mean. The movie is boring whenever it's not frustrating. Yeesh! All of this adds up to a movie that is actually WORSE THAN THE PREQUELS. Do not waste time, money, and your good faith seeing this at the theater. If you want to take the family out over the break, Jumanji (surprisingly) and Coco are both very good."
4102,1,Consider the Star Wars saga to have ended with Return of the Jedi,The Last Jedi is a spectacular visual film but in term of living up to the awe inspiring Star Wars mythology Rian Johnson failed dismally particularly because he didn't try. 
4103,2,Bombs drop in space!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,No pretty actresses
4104,1,This might have been good in 1985 or 95.,"First off, yes ... IMDB ratings are now a complete joke. To be fair this movie is probably a solid 3 out of 10, but I'm voting strategically to offset the biased ratings. "
4105,1,No Satisfactory Answers/Disrespects Characters,Did we really wait two years to find out Rey's parents were a couple of drunks who sold her for drinking money? Lame. 
4106,1,Atrocious,Disgusting. Atrocious. Terrible. Horrible. Basically takes a giant dump on the entire Star Wars saga. It is almost a crime that this was allowed to be produced.
4107,1,Rian Johnson should be fired.,Rian Johnson gave us a jumbled mess that was haphazardly thrown together and had tons of plot holes. The main plot was weak and the side plots were just ridiculous.<br /><br />I don't think he's seen any other Star Wars because he has no idea how the force is supposed to work. He completely ruined Luke Skywalker's character. He spent 2 ½ hours and provided no character development. <br /><br />This was just horrible. I don't think I'll see the next one in theater.
4108,1,Please stop filming....,Why is so bad....
4109,1,Garbage movie,This movie is such a joke it makes The Room look like Godfather.
4110,2,Hello disnay is it you ?,Are you paying for stars disnay ? who would even give 5+ stars to this ? must be a close friend or working for it .....
4111,1,"The shark, you did jump","I'm not a Star Wars fan, and I don't know what order this movie is in the series, but even I could tell that this wasn't a proper franchise movie. "
4112,1,It stinks!,"Boring, pointless, awkward, and just flat out dumb! I normally don't write film reviews, but this one deserves to be dragged through the mud. After watching just a portion of this film I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. The new characters are uninteresting, the once beloved characters are old and useless. What's the point of making a star wars film if you're not going to have a good story ark? And what is up with the purple haired feminist? That should not be a sw character!"
4113,2,Slapstick Wars,"It has it's moments, but unfortunately everytime it was about to turn interesting, some stupid, ill timed attempt at humor totally ruined it for me. Chewbacca's reply to Rey regarding Finn was however spot on, and propably the best thing in the whole movie.."
4114,4,Trying to Kill the Franchise,"If this were a pilot movie of a new franchise, no sequel would ever be made. This has none of the swashbuckling heart or humor of the first three movies. TFA and Rogue One we're bringing it all back, and held such promise. This bloated failure brings that resurrection to a screeching halt."
4115,1,Star Wars is getting worse each day,It's really sad to see such a good series as Star Wars as bad as this film. I believe it should have ended at VI and should'nt have continued. 
4116,1,Why? Just why?,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, not even exaggerating. It has definitely made me leery about going to see anything Disney ever makes from now on. This was just a shameless money grab aimed at taking advantage of nostalgia and hardcore fans. Seriously, execs approved this. Rian Johnson should be barred from film making."
4117,3,Just generally bad - basically a toy commercial,"It would be easy to get into spoilers, trying to explain why this move was bad. There are multiple reasons. Firstly, it conflicts entirely with the cannon and themes of all the previous movies. And by this I mean, it does not just disagree with those themes and that cannon, but it goes out of its way to poop on it. <br /><br />Secondly, it's plotting is terrible. Almost everything that happens in this film is pointless. It's a nothing. The entire plot could have taken place in about 30 mins, that's how little of anything happens, and that which does happen is largely meaningless. <br /><br />Characters get no evolution, no back story. Nothing is moved forward. Again, the whole movie, the only significant thing that happens is pooping on everything prior to this film<br /><br />Thirdly the reason why this is terrible, is the themes that are promoted, are far left liberal values. Environmentalism, anti-capitalism, feminism. This is pushed so hard, that all of the male characters are made out to be fools, incompetent, dangerous, weak, cowardly. <br /><br />It's really really bad. The visuals are good, but I wouldn't even consider this a bad TV adaption - the pacing, plot, characters, themes - all bad. The dialogue is bad. This film is also soaked in pointless cute animals, and sad dad/college humour that would be better suited to a marvel film, and here, robs the viewer of any investment."
4118,1,Probably the worse movie I've ever seen.,"I fell asleep halfway through. If you have a major character that can be dropped from the story and it makes zero difference to its outcome, that's a problem. Finn was useless in this story, though almost accomplished something at the end, until that idiot crashed into him."
4119,2,8.3 ??? How ???,I clearly don't understand the global grade of the movie.
4120,1,Stupid movie!,J.J. Abrams is a much better director!
4121,1,Movie created by millenials for millenials.,"Visual effects are not Star Wars soul. This is like bad version of the original. The idea of Star Wars have so much inside, you can expand and change the scope of the story. This is like everything else nowadays, corporations are using metrics and data analysis to make a profit. Until the consumer stops paying for crap, things will stay the same."
4122,1,It gets worse with time.,"I watched this movie last night again after watching all of the others in preparation for the new one coming out at Christmas. Some say that time heals, but not in the case of this pile of a movie, it actually got even harder to watch. I have to hand it to Rian Johnson, but he managed to do the impossible. Star Wars has a huge volume of novels, storylines, history, and legends to draw off of. It has a HUGE fan base ranging from young kids who loved the prequels and the well written Clone Wars series to 50+ year olds who grew up amazed with the original 3 movies. The series itself is one of the highest grossing movie series in the world. Rian Johnson had the momentum of a highly regarded, and super successful blockbuster, The Force Awakens to lead the way. And he had over a quarter of a billion dollars to spend along with the vast talents and technology of LucasFilm and Disney. Yet he managed to make an unbearable, boring, silly, slap-in-the-face mess. It starts bad, gets a bit worse, then even more worse, until it ends. If you read a few reviews, you can get up to speed on all of the really stupid, frustrating, parts of the movie. Trying to come up with my own worse part is near impossible because there are so many awful moments. From the opening prank phone call bit, to Luke milking the cow creature, the running out of fuel space chase, Finn and Rose falling madly in love in a few hours, to the end when the fleet is destroyed, and the half dozen that survived are happy and filled with hope as they zoom away in the Millennium Falcon from the corpses of thousands of friends that were just killed. It's really hard to choose a worst moment. Everyone dies except Rey, Poe, Leia, Finn, Rose, Chewbacca, and of course, the 3 droids. High fives everyone, at least our stars survived. If there is anyway they can rebrand this terrible movies as a Bobby Ewing type dream sequence (google Dallas dream season young people), they should. Put number 9 on hold and completely re-do number 8 without Rian Johnson and after firing Kathleen Kennedy. What a shame. I will wait for some reviews from people I trust to see how well Abrams cleans up the mess Johnson made and if he somehow salvages the series before I buy a ticket. Rian Johnson managed to really mess up a great opportunity. Gosh, how do you do that with all the money and resources he had?"
4123,1,Star Trash: or how the franchaise falls into a void,"I´m gonna be short; my level of disappointment grows every unnecessary minute of the movie. The script, empty of originality, with so many holes is boring as HELL. Of course none expects to be as good as the first ever made trilogy, but this?...is a joke...really!!!"
4124,1,Reviews are paid for. There is no other way.,"You'll see the plot holes when you go see it. Have fun! Flipping between stories was a mess. Also, did anyone else's movie theater burst out laughing when Kylo Ren showed off his pecs? I was laughing the whole way. At all the parts they didn't mean for me to laugh at. "
4125,5,When Star Wars meets Disney,"Watched the movie at midnight screening with my 13 year old daughter. The first thing the struck me was the use of humour, far beyond anything we have seen in the SW franchise before. The opening scenes with X-Wing vs Star Destroyer ""being put on hold"" was bordering on farce IMO. There were a few incidents like this that felt forced attempts to lighten the mood. Secondly are the Disney merch team now heavily involved? The number of new cuddly aliens introduced in this movie 3-4 at least, I can see them all appearing at Disney stores near you in the not too distant future."
4126,1,What a shame...,"This movie was the dumbest I've seen in a while, it makes you question who take those big decisions. It's really strange to see that this movie is still rated at 7/10 on IMDB and have a high score on other websites despite seeing that every reviewers and persons I know are rating this movie way below 5, as they should. Disney should spend more money on writing and less on advertising, marketing and buying off influencers."
4127,1,Not enough world building,You have to be a real Star Wars fan to like this movie. I found the pacing slow. The dialogue was stilted and not very creative. I was a fan of the original movies. I saw them when they came out in the 70s. They lit up cinema for fans of Sci Fi. The newest iterations seem stale. Same old big space ship shoots at little space ship. My favorite part of the movie was the Jedi Temple. I wanted to see a whole lot more of that and less of the space shootem up action. The sea lion was great or whatever it was. And why does the villain look like Voldemort.
4128,1,A heart can only be broken so many times...,"Not worth paying for, they made star wars in to a comedy movie, for no reason, this is 100% the worst of alle the movies.. atleast Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace had som Lightsaber Battles.<br /><br />I never thought I'd say this, but...<br /><br /> maybe it's time to give star trek a chance.."
4129,3,"Shockingly, Staggeringly, Offensively Bad","Other spoilery reviews have covered the details of the bizarre and contrived plot so let me add in that the pacing is so bizarre that the entire first half and last half hour feel oppressively heavy, scenes cut between each other right when things get interesting, characters react entirely arbitrarily, and, most importantly, only one character has something vaguely resembling an arc! What's the fun in watching people who always interact the exact same way for a movie that feels so tediously long?"
4130,1,Terrible,"Had no feel of the Star Wars movies before it, no wow factor, at no point did I find myself willing the film to move closer to finishing, but never wanting it to end like the others. To me it was a pointless film, the relevant parts that were in it could have easily been tagged onto the end of The Force Awakens or the beginning of The rise of skywalker. If only directors would listen to the fans!!!"
4131,1,This film literally killed Star Wars (Spoilers),"This movie is absolutely an insult to anyone's intelligence. Huge plot holes, zero character developments. It teases things only to either forget about it or when you do find out the answer, it is pointless. Speaking of pointless, this movie is full of pointless and boring subplots that have no bearing on the movie. How can this movie possibly get a 7.5/10 on IMDB. It really makes one wonder how these ratings are tabulated. The treatment of Luke Skywalker's character was an abomination. It made no sense and was not even close to the character that the movies had established. Then they ruined the finale of Luke by making the entire thing an astroprojection, then he died from being tired. OMG. Why not just go and fight if you are going to die anyway? Leia turned into superman in space. Incredibly stupid. I can go on for pages but this is already pretty long."
4132,1,Kill the past. Star Was has gone once and for all.,So I've seen The Last Jedi and I must say apart from some great Star Wars action the storyline and character development is basically non-existent.
4133,1,They should apologize and remove this from the series.,"The only good scene that seemed to have some consistent thought behind it was the R2-D2 scene, that's about it. The rest, trash. Story was terrible, went nowhere, insulted anyone with have a brain. Want Rian and Disney to know I and every other Star Wars fan I've talked to is just sick over this movie. What were you thinking? Why did you hire this guy? Ugh."
4134,2,Absolutely horrible,Plot Holes and underdeveloped characters. terrible writing and misplaced humor.
4135,1,The worse movie ever produced by Lucasfilm,"An epic fail on every level, well done Rian Johnson and Pablo Hidalgo and every other moron associated with this abomination. It fails on storytelling, character building, star wars lore, scenario depth, writing, directing, story building, cohesion with other SW movies, giving us anything new about SW. What did it succeed in? Giving every Star Wars fan the finger for loving Star Wars. As it is evident from Rian and Pablo's personal attacks on fans on Twitter, for liking the Mandalorian. They are such unhappy people that they have to attack everyone to make themselves feel better. Seriously, this is everything that is wrong with Disney."
4136,1,How can you be the Rebellion when you are the ruling Government?,"There are two was to look at this film. One, as a standalone film that has nothing to do with anything and two, as a film that assumes to shoulder the responsibility of thirty plus years of history, fandom and anticipation."
4137,1,Epic Fail,All fans of star wars and the expanded universe just crying after this movie.
4138,2,I Expected This Movie To Be Good. Consider My Expectations Subverted.,"Rian Johnson stabbed me in the back, wiggled the knife around, pulled it out, and let me bleed out on the floor. It's not that I want all Star Wars movies to be exactly the same, in fact my biggest complaint with TFA is that it was too similar to A New Hope. But when you try to reboot a franchise halfway through a trilogy which in itself is a reboot, you have to be more careful. Rian is an amazing visual director, (see hyperspace ramming and Crait), but this mas should never be allowed to write another script again. He effectively made a meme out of what used to be a legitimate form of writing scripts. Fin's side mission is completely pointless, Rose is annoying, Pinkie (you know who i'm talking about) has no reason to withhold vital strategic information from the rest of the crew, and to top it all of; Luke Skywalker, the man who tried to redeem Darth Vader and succeeded in doing so, feels like his nephew may be thinking of some bad stuff so it's chop-chop time.<br /><br />This movie is as bad as Attack Of The Closes if not worse. at least that movie acknowledged the plot lines set up by the episode I."
4139,3,SpaceBalls Part 2,"Spoilers Ahead>>>>>>>><br /><br />What a disappointment ... I thought i had seen the back of the Bad Star Wars Films with the Prequel Trilogy, But during some scenes of TLJ i thought that The Prequels were masterpieces. There are so many attempts at humour and a lot of it is misplaced and awkward , The Blue Milk, The Shoulder Dusting.... <br /><br />Its a shame what was teased in TFA has not been expanded on at all here.<br /><br />Overlong and Drawn out in the Middle, This must be the longest , slowest space chase ever put on screen..."
4140,1,Trash,"It is a character assassination masterpiece. It is not our fault Johnson had an unhappy chidhood... <br /><br />It is exactly like taking someone's favoyrite cake and replacing the ingredients with dirt, rocks and sewage water..."
4141,1,Sort by helpfulness...,"...and you have a perfect review of this movie. I hope that this franchise ends with the 9th movie. This movie could have been anything, but somehow they managed to do everything wrong."
4142,2,Not as bad as people make it out to be,"You may have heard this is one of the worst movies ever. It's not. In fact, most aspects of the movie are quite good. The visuals look good for the most part, aside from a somewhat ugly yellow tint. The film is competently shot with some incredible scene blocking and framing choices.<br /><br />The acting is good all around with great performances by Adam Driver the voice actor of Snoke. The score has some nice cues as well. Pacing is good during tense scenes, but drags in the beginning and end. And of course the Casino side plot grinds the movie to a halt."
4143,1,Letdown,To this day I will watch any of the original trilogy anytime & I will enjoy it every time.<br /><br />I have no desire to ever see this again.
4144,1,Star Wars is Dead. RIP. (But it's Worse than that) continued,"Three main points here. First, Luke Skywalker was absolutely committed, totally loyal and faithful, body, mind and soul. He did not compromise. That is why his character was so beloved, despite his flaws. Second, his path to Jedihood was very arduous, truly a pearl of great price; earned, not bestowed by some cosmic accident. And third, Jedi were crusaders for Truth and would die to protect the galaxy from the tyranny of the Dark Side.<br /><br /> At the end of the last episode of the first trilogy Luke confronted Darth Vader yet again, this time knowing that this embodiment of evil was his real father. In this battle Luke fought not only Darth Vader, but his Master, the Evil Emperor. In the three way battle that ensued Luke bested his father, but refused to succumb to the dark side of hate and finish him off. Instead he appealed to the love that he knew must still hide somewhere in the shell called Darth Vader. Just as the Emperor was about to kill Luke, Vader turned on his master to save his son and in the ensuing battle both died, ending the Evil Empire and freeing the galaxy of its dark despotism.<br /><br /> At the conclusion of this movie, the spirits of Obi wan Kenobe, Yoda, and Anniken Skywalker, appeared. Skywalker was the redeemed soul of Darth Vader, now basking in the Light and Love of the Force. Goodness triumphed over evil without compromising itself.<br /><br /> This was Star Wars. A morality play, a rather simple story of cosmic good versus cosmic evil. The differences were clearly recognizable, we cheered for the good and, on a galactic stage of vast proportions, the Truth ultimately triumphed against great odds. I don't know of any epic fiction in human History that has told a grander story. That is why the atrocity that Disney has committed against this epic myth arouses such passion and anger.<br /><br /> The Last Jedi looks and sounds great, but the story is a mess, with so many plot holes, dead ends, contradictions, inconsistencies, impossibilities, players out of character, deus ex machinas etc. that you can't count them all. Critics in mainstream media have overwhelmingly adored this movie and overlooked its obvious flaws, no doubt because they share the movie's underlying ideology. Fans of Star Wars have been much more critical, and numerous YOUTUBE critics have enumerated the movie's many flaws. As one critic said, ""This is Star Wars in the world of Idiocracy."" I will mention only a few of those flaws here.<br /><br /> What I want to focus on is the Last Jedi's betrayal and repudiation of the Star Wars' core myth. This betrayal is put into the words and actions of the greatest Jedi of all time, the man who saved the Galaxy and seemingly vanquished the Dark Side forever. Luke Skywalker, who would have been remembered for ages as one of the greatest heroes in the history of mythology, will now go down as the greatest apostate. Its like, after hundreds of millions of people have invested their time, energy, billions of dollars, hope and love into seven Star Wars movies, Disney then pulls a Gilda Radner and just says, ""never mind.""<br /><br /> When the latest great hope of the Force, Rey, came to Luke for training and introduced herself by handing Luke his old light saber, Luke, by now cynical, disconsolate, demoralized, depressed and dirty, responded without hesitation by throwing the light saber away. Thus, Luke symbolically expressed his rejection of everything he once stood for. He then went on to say just that in ensuing dialog with Rey, basically refusing to train her and telling her what a mistake and a failure the Jedi movement was. ""All I know is that the Jedi must end,"" he said, accusing the Jedi of inadvertently ""allowing"" the Sith to subvert the Republic. Somehow, his father's turn to the Dark Side was the Jedi's fault. Luke explained that he went to the sacred Jedi planet, not to train, but just to die. <br /><br /> At some point the apparition of Yoda appeared, and they discussed the anachronistic nature of Jediism, and the worthlessness of the old sacred texts. Yoda then seemingly set them on fire, along with the sacred tree which protected them through the ages. Symbolically, a very long and eventful life of reverence went up in smoke. As did the concept of reverence itself.<br /><br /> Later we discovered why Luke gave up on Jediism and seemingly life itself. Years earlier, his nephew, Ben, the son of Princess Leia and Han Solo, during Jedi training, turned to the Dark Side. This happened because Luke, sensing dark proclivities in the youngster, tried to kill him in his sleep, kind of, but in self defense young Ben, (later Kilo Ren) destroyed the Jedi school and almost killed Luke himself. Thus, Luke caused the very outcome he most feared and himself helped create a Sith Lord.<br /><br /> When Rey found out about this, because she was in psychic communion with Kilo, she confronted Luke, and after a brief stick fight, the untrained little neophyte defeated the Great Skywalker, and he ran away in fear. Eventually Luke gave Rey about three minutes of Jedi training, during which she explored both the light and the DARK SIDE, and she became seemingly the most powerful Jedi of all time, even though we are told she had no pedigree or prior training.<br /><br /> At the end of the movie Luke finally showed some spirit, appearing dramatically to save the remaining handful of Resistance fighters from the new evil emperor, the last Sith, his nephew Kilo Ren. But instead of an epic fight to again vanquish evil and/or redeem it (the origins of the resurrected Sith we are never told, but we did see Kilo, improbably, kill his Master and take control), Luke wussed out and just projected a hologram of himself, tricking Kilo into a fake sword fight that took just long enough to allow the Resistance to escape. And then, inexplicably, with the entire Galaxy under the control of Dark forces, the real Luke just vanished, presumably into the Force, from which, we were told earlier, he had disconnected himself. Was this transcendence, like the ascension of Christ, or just a cop out? This Luke, this wastrel, who had rejected his precious, sacred Jedi inheritance, committed suicide to avoid his Jedi duty. What an ignominious end to one of the greatest epic heroes ever.<br /><br /> So, let's compare the Luke Skywalker that was developed in the first three movies to the Luke Skywalker of the Last Jedi.<br /><br /> The Luke Skywalker of Legend had absolute, child-like faithfulness and loyalty to his teachers and their teaching. Though for one second, like Christ on the cross, in his moment of greatest defeat, Luke experienced doubt, he resumed his quest steadfastly and attained his goal. He never wavered in the Truth again. He was always brave, always strong, always faithful to the principles he knew were right, and willing always to sacrifice his life for the right and to fight for that right and the rights of others.<br /><br /> The Luke Skywalker in Last Jedi became agnostic, cynical, weak, indecisive, selfish, lazy and a bit cowardly, because he no longer believed in anything. The Luke Skywalker who would not kill evil Darth Vader in self-defense, Luke Skywalker the Great Redeemer, raised his weapon against a sleeping teenager, his sister's son. And because of this failure he just quit. This is not Luke Skywalker.<br /><br /> No, the trashing of Luke Skywalker is not a literary accident. Trashing Luke Skywalker is trashing everything Star Wars ever represented, and Star Wars, despite borrowing so heavily from Eastern mysticism, represents something deep and abiding in the civilization we inherited. And what does the new Star Wars offer? Nothingness."
4145,1,Spaceballs II: The last Jedi,"Seeing this just after midnight on the opening night with a IMAX full of super fans, and then sharing in mutual facial expressions of WTH am i watching? Leaving the entire room confused at the end."
4146,2,Disappointed fan - Did they just kill the brilliance of one of the most stunning sagas ever?,"As a fan of the whole saga I am really sad the last jedi was so disappointing. Special effects were great. Some characters interesting but in the midst of so many characters that should be relevant (and they ate), they lost the opportunity to invest the time needed for them to stand out as much as they should (and deserved to) - Too many important characters in a film that lasts 3 hours is still too many characters. OMG about the script and storyline. We have waited so long to see Luke, the last Jedi and basically what they delivered was hours of a depressed heroe that quit on his job. WHAT??? Solo's son, not believable. We can see that there is still some good in him... Only to find out he might be worst than Darth Vader - in a non-believable way. What else? Too much blasts. IT is actually what I took most out of the movie. Too many bombs and blasts. And a feeling of emptiness. Where are the heroes that never give up? Exhausted, not appealing at al. I am sad, seriously."
4147,1,I sense a disturbance in the force,"Which brings me to this short review and opinion. Stunning CGI and Sound Design? Yes, Space Battles and Laser Swords ? Yes, Starwars inside? Ehm, err , who produced it? Ah Disney. Here we go. Different receipe: Inappropriate jokes, empty plot lines with no synthesis, while using the framing of episode V Empire strikes back and giving in some hipster PC feminism, ehm pardon, strong female characters and dumping the most powerful force users for what message? That fairytales dont sell anymore and u have to bloat it with political messages and empty plotholes?....Come on, maybe im an old fart, that cant accept the remake of Starwars for the New Generation and their values, but I still think that this movie is rather a soulless one. Btw what i also asked myself was: Is the mass of a Dreadnought enough to make bombs usefull in weightlessness. And i want back some Boba Fett, not that polished Cylon Trooper. Its Christmas, come on...."
4148,3,Not Star Wars,"I'm a big fan of independant, closed story films. They always have a rich narrative, fleshed out characters, and an overall a full, believeable world. This film has all of these things. BUT I am also a big Star Wars fan. This film, if it wasn't part of the Skywalker saga, I think would have been a great film, but as it is, in this saga, it doesn't fit in at all with the pacing and style of the rest of the Star Wars films. The characters act very differently to how they have acted in previous films. The pacing is very slow and all over the place and there is little action for a Star Wars film. As I said previously, I enjoy films like this, but if I go to watch a Star Wars film, I want to watch a Star Wars films. I enjoy the over the top action, the quick pace of the story, and the ridiculous scope of the stakes involved. These are what I want to see in a Star Wars film. Not this subverting expectations you get in a lot of films now a days."
4149,4,Star wars: the last jedi,"The ending has children, as if looking to the future.To another episode, perhaps. The two ladies don't even hug.What a tragedy ! At least the director could have been more human, more emotional.But no that did not happen.A real waste.Of the audience's time. And of the franchise.Don't watch."
4150,1,Garbage! Absolute Garbage!,"What a disappointment and waste of a great hero, Luke Skywalker! This by far the WORST StarWars movie ever! "
4151,5,An insult to every Starwars fan,This movie was just so disappointing and an abomination on an entirely different level. Disney basically spit in the face of every star wars fan when they proceeded to release this pile of trash.
4152,3,"Guess I'll Have To Watch Rogue One, for the fourth time, to wash the memory of this horrible film from my mind!","3* for Nostalgic Reasons only, tied for the worst Star Wars movie ever!"
4153,1,Strogen Wars II,"The worst movie of the century, cheap comedy, doesn't looks like a star wars movie"
4154,1,Horrible Movie,"Everything about this movie is horrible. My god, there is nothing positive."
4155,1,Rian Johnson The Re... I mean special person.,Rian is a liar he lies about the empire being polarizing that movie made more money than any other of the top 5 movie of that year combined and was re-released two more times to keep up with demand. Luke is a curmudgeon who hates everyone and has turned his back on all that he learned from Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda.
4156,1,A car accident of a movie. Luke deserved better than this,"Some of the things wrong with this movie, and there's a lot. Too many to list, but here are a few:<br /><br />>Poe takes on entire fleet and Q U I P S Hux to pieces right after the text scroll<br /><br />>Snoke suprises Hux and Hux slips Three Stooges style <br /><br />>antagonists are supposed to be revered yet they are reduced to lauging stocks in the first few minutes (besides Kylo)<br /><br />>Admiral Holdo was out of place <br /><br />>Superleia doing a Merry Poppins impression. ANY other way to show her force powers would have sufficed <br /><br />>Phasma comes back real quick to die again? Waste of character<br /><br />>Artoo and 3-PO doing nothing again<br /><br />>the handful of rebels versus an entire fleet is becoming<br /><br />>Luke doing the shoulder brush and the theater applauding (cheesy)<br /><br />>the overall plot of the film being one ship with a 16 hour forcefield and they'll run out of fuel. Really, the whole plot revolves around a snail's pace Chase where the bad guys are just behind them, but for some reason can't catch up<br /><br />>Maz giving instructions in the middle of a huge gunfight (waste of character)<br /><br />>Yoda showing up an acting a fool ( more cheesiness)<br /><br />>the relentless quips, star wars has small jokes, but there were so many it was unbearable. The jokes sounded like they belong in gardians of the Galaxy or Independence day, not star wars!<br /><br />>the callbacks to Empire and ROTJ wre subtle at first but went too far in the end <br /><br />>Snokes death ( hugely wasted character)<br /><br />>Rey ""trained"" for two days before stealing books because we all know you can become a Jedi by taking a weekend training class<br /><br />>Yoda suddenly agreed despite telling Luke to train as many Jedi as he could and pass on his knowledge<br /><br />>Yoda was also ok with destroying an ancient jedi tree for a prank<br /><br />>Luke being portrayed as a cowardly grumpy hermit who we don't even get to see in action."
4157,1,"Flatline disgrace! Horrible storyline, and bad directing.","As you have all awaited this movie for quite some time.<br /><br />It ends up being a complete letdown.<br /><br />The story drags on with no point, and there is absolutely NO character development AT ALL. Everyone just assumes their previous roles from EP. VII.<br /><br />Nothing important even happens in the movie. There is absolutely NO climax.<br /><br />Even when you THINK they are actually going somewhere with the storyline 2 times at most,.. it lets you down like opening a bottle of flat Pepsi with no bite."
4158,3,"Unbeliavably stupid, politically correct, dumb, predictable, and boring.","Awful, stupid, dumb."
4159,1,I'm heartbroken,I am a life long Star Wars fan and having just watched The Last Jedi I am absolutely gutted. The opening scene featuring Adrian Edmundson set the tone and it didn't improve. The minute I saw Adrian he was Eddie from Bottom and I expected Rik to jump out as Ritchie and start a comedy scene. The hoax call by Poe to the dreadfully acted General Hux was just not Star Wars. Have the writers and directors ever watched any of the films? The Force Awakens has a different feel to it but I felt it created some characters that could bring something to the Star Wars universe. I thought that Reys parentage and Snoke's back story would feature heavily but no I was wrong. Luke Skywalker is without a doubt the greatest Character in the history of film and to a degree he is Star Wars. To treat him this way in this film is an insult to fans and Mark Hamil. To me the Star Wars films ended with Return of the Jedi.
4160,1,Dull Colorless and Boring,"The Characters are un-believable have no soul or character, story is weak and I found it very painful to watch, to see the original 3 Star Wars performed and filmed in such a brilliant way to end up watching this pile of rubbish... 0/10 I don't know how this has scored 7.5/10, good luck trying to make it through the whole movie"
4161,1,The usual conservative capitalist rubbish from Disney,Just stupid meaningless sequels and reboots and remakes from Disney that keep coming like diarrhea to con stupid morons... Disney doesn't even pay to have decent actors and actresses.<br /><br />What a joke.<br /><br />Nothing makes sense and the chicks happen to be big boned or have short hair and a scrawl.
4162,3,Feels like it was directed and written by people who have never watched the PT/OT,"Background: life long Star Wars fan, grew up with the prequels, love the OT, liked TFA and loved Rogue One."
4163,1,Disgraceful,"How amazing is it, that John Favreau and Dave Filoni managed to make Star Wars fans cry with tears of joy, with just a cameo appearance of a fake CGI Luke Skywalker, in a single TV show episode."
4164,1,Huge disappointment,"When Episode VII came out I had this feeling they were setting things up to portray the old heroes as nothing but losers... and yet, I wish I could say I was prepared for what they had in mind for us this time around. No way I could have foreseen to which degree they would degrade the heroes of old (particularly Luke Skywalker) and the Skywalker bloodline in this movie."
4165,1,Just bad.,Pandering to a prefered audience of early teens and children. This was just bad. Bad. Bad.
4166,1,1 star is too much.,This movie has created a need for a new ratings system.<br /><br />IMDb please consider this.
4167,3,"Um, what?",The only three things I liked about this movie were....
4168,1,Disney Have Destroyed Star Wars ! Well Done !,"Star Wars fan very very disappointed. This movie is not Star Wars that we know of . If this movie was on its own , its a good film . But it isn't. George Lucas , how could you sell up your creation for pure money to Disney , to let them ruin it the way they have, Shame.<br /><br />They have insulted the character of Luke Skywalker<br /><br />. Turned him into a cowardly hobo, fighting the main baddie as stupid hologram and then dying of exhaustion, pathetic. General Leia , they blew her off into space , would have been ok if not sad that she would have gone out that way , only to start using the force and flying , yes flying like a cross between Superman & Mary Poppins , then goes into a coma wakes again and limps on through the rest of the movie. With all the original cast members gone now in the stupidest disrespectful ways , it would have been better not to have them back at all , leaving their characters untarnished but well done Disney for messing this up. The director can't have watched any star wars films otherwise he wouldn't have created this load of rubbish . The 1 rating goes for the actors who I thought did well with what they had to work with , just a shame they were let down with poor story and script . Kylo Ren could have been a badass baddie, if they just kept his face covered . Adam Driver has the voice to give you the fear he's a bad guy a quality actor when used right , but let down in my opinion . Rey turns out to be a nobody , next. Snoke turns out to be a nobody , next . Fin and Rose , waste of time , next . They killed Admiral Ackber like he was a nobody . Why is there stupid comedy in this . The originals had comedy but genuine character comedy , it suited the film . This film is cringe worthy cheesey rubbish . Overall this is the worst star wars movie . Shame on you Disney and Lucasfilms ."
4169,1,This movie will make you permanently lose 35 IQ points.,Do you like movies where anything can happen at any given time for no reason at all? 
4170,1,Noncense,"I'm getting to old for this. This is not ""our"" Star Wars anymore. Huge letdown after decades of George ""maybe/maybe not"" antisipation. Just in case it's not obvious enough, we get the books burned to leave no doubt that what has come before is no longer wanted or cared for. Clean slate is an understatement. Mass appeal approach is to be expected; but you CAN make a movie that appeals to children, the ""Twilight"" crowd and also viewers like me. Major missed opportunity. I'll just keep re-watching the end of ROTJ. Luke will always be the hero archetype and nothing that Disney does will change that for me. Those that felt a ""disturbance in the force"" when Disney bought Lucasfilm were right. Shame on you Kath and the Disney puppeteers that pull your strings."
4171,1,This didn't felt like a Star Wars story,"1. The script is full of fillers so Rey's story can advance. The whole trip going for the decryptor and infiltrating the enemy was pure garbage, was completely pointless and it didn't affect the story.<br /><br />2. Who was Snoke? So much talking about disappointments just to die sitting in his chair.<br /><br />3. The new nerdish character so badly force, it looks like a character from The Big Bang Theory. Like somebody said: ""Hey, our fans are nerds, so lets introduce a completely pointless nerd character so they can relate to."""
4172,2,Hahahahaaaaahhhaaah,"In spite of some clever FX this unrelated sequel cannot stand up to the original Star Wars. Even then, the FX sometimes looks a little not quite real, particularly a few of the space shots which have an element of in-game-graphics about them. The storytelling is slow and rather boring because they explain nothing about Daisy, the emperor or the first order. They just didn't bother or didn't think the low IQ Disney audience cares. Stick with the masterful originals and hope you are not stupid enough to watch more Disney rubbih."
4173,2,Disney's take on Star Wars is Abysmal,"Had serious misgivings at Disney taking over from Mr Lucas, and oh dear... my misgivings were sadly, disappointingly, proven correct with this flick."
4174,1,Insulted for two hours,Running out of fuel? If I was the director I'd look for another job. You've ruined the best thing to ever come on the cinema. You should donate all profits to a charity as the film is not worth making money off the back of Star Wars fans. Rogue one was a much better film in every way. That's how a modern Star Wars film is made.
4175,1,completely senseless,"This film as itself isn bad made, but it is completely senseless because it doesn't drive the story forward and ignores the previous films.<br /><br />What Rian Johnson is doing with this film is brazen egotrip because he ignores nearly eveything what star wars stands for. Luce Skywalker, the hero of our childhood, is shown as an depressive wreck. It is such an depressing message that everything luke, leia and han solo fought for was useless. This film wipes out the whole legacy of every star wars film before.<br /><br />Shame on you Rian Johnson, I don't questiong your talent as a filmmaker. You made many georgous films, but with this film you're doing an egotrip because you decided to make ""your"" and only your version of star wars ignoring the soul of what is was meant."
4176,1,Don't watch,"Kills starwars, not going to see the next one. Destroyed star wars, just watched it. If a star wars fan stay way"
4177,1,Too much bad joke,"Too much bad joke and comic of situation used excessively prevented me from being immersed in the film notament in the scenes where there should be some tension or scenes that should be beautiful and poetic, with this movie star wars becomes his own parody. congratulate to the rat."
4178,1,Was this even a movie?,"There's so many things wrong with this movie, i don't even know where to start. The storyline is a mess.... They act like the entire episode 7 didn't exist. Horrible character development, I cared not one bit about anyone really in the entire movie. I'm so sorry i'm about to say this (since i'm a star wars fan since birth) but Star Wars is officially over for me and I am sure I'm not the only one who feels this way."
4179,2,Awful not at all what the fans of the film said it was,Everyone who loves the film says it's different goes in new directions either I was lied too or those people are blind. It blatantly rips off ESB and ROTJ all it does is subverts into itself. How is that art how is this entertainment and then to tell fans to screw themselves fans that hung around for 40 years to see Luke Leia and Han together again at least ones lmfao wow
4180,3,"Disney, Rian, you really managed to break my heart.","I still don't believe it. Yes ok, VII was a bit exaggerated and resumed a lot of the stereotypes of ""A New Hope"", but this is pure madness! <br /><br />From too many forced humorous jokes to a story that tries to innovate but turns out to be pure unemotional anarchy. The only good thing is the role and the interpretation of Mark Hamill, beautiful and unexpected. <br /><br />They forgot that STARWARS is an epic fairy tale with a certain romance and that transports the imaginary elsewhere. I felt completely present and upset for two and a half hours.<br /><br />So sad. With this last step they have disintegrated the possible future of the saga ... not to mention that R.Johnson will be entrusted with a whole new trilogy!<br /><br />We can only hope for some spin-off to let us smile again...trilogies are over.<br /><br />Personally, the only one who understood what STARWARS is was the great Gareth Edwards with his ""Rogue One""."
4181,1,A sucker punch to the gut for Star Wars fans everywhere,WARNING - SPOILERS!
4182,1,utter crap - leia acting like super girl in space (spoiler),"POOR, POOR , POOR I WANT MY MONEY BACK<br /><br />1: leia surviving space and then flying WTF<br /><br />2: Snoke oh so powerful dying instantly WTF<br /><br />3: 1980's joda puppet (all budget for cgi spent on pointless space battles)<br /><br />4: pointless storyline!!!"
4183,1,"Star wars is dead. One star is too good for ""Last Jedi"".","I have seen some bad Disney movies. I recognize they have to draw from the shallow end of the gene pool for their directors to ensure political correctness and the political agenda of their mouse overlord. I've refuted their lost worldview so many times now I sound like a broken record. Yet never before has a Star Wars movie been released that made me want to see the whole cast killed on screen! I kid you not, by the end, I was disappointed we didn't see any major characters bite the dust because they were that hateful!"
4184,1,Lazy and Just really bad :(,"Wow! I honestly couldn't believe this crap. This movie ruined all the potential for an amazing trilogy! It introduced some awful characters such as Holdo and Rose, and it made interesting and awesome characters from ""The Force Awakens"" straight up terrible and lazy like General Hux and Snoke. The Last Jedi was suppose to be the best movie from this trilogy, and I couldn't be more disappointed on Rian Johnson's stupid decisions and lazy writing. People who like this movie say it adds ""new dynamics to Star Wars"" but honestly that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. The movie does not feel like Star Wars at all. Star Wars is always filled with creative and awesome writing, but The Last Jedi is the complete opposite. It turned thing's south all the way from TFA and it ruined Luke Skywalker! It honestly just makes me sad on how bad it turned out to be, It's just unforgivable :("
4185,1,Wow - just leave this franchise alone!,I won't be paying to see another Star Wars movie unless they re-release the original George Lucas ones for a theatrical screening.
4186,1,What has happened to this once great Saga,"Quite paradoxically, The Last Jedi is a film that is loved not by what it defends, but by what it seeks to destroy. Aesthetically ugly, deliberately degrading, with a nihilistic anti-Star Wars message and lines so badly written it may be the most critically overrated script in quite some time.<br /><br />It's like Lucas told Rian Johnson that he felt that ""I hate sand"" was the worst romantic line ever written and Rian replied ""hold my beer"" before writing ""This is how we win"". It seems Disney and maybe even the higher echelons of Lucasfilm were acutely unaware of most of this before release.<br /><br />Claims to its success are based on misrepresentation of the facts. Avengers: Infinity War - a true modern masterpiece that deconstructs the genre and subverts expectations in an intelligent, engrossing, satisfying way - made nearly twice as much like its predecessors, The Last Jedi barely passed the halfway mark."
4187,1,The worst movie I have ever seen.....,"I like many others made an account specifically to leave my opinion about this abomination of a film. This won't be a long review as there are many others already here which go into detail about this travesty. This movie was a disgrace and a total and utter betrayal of everything Star Wars. It made absolutely no sense in keeping with the lore and themes of what this beautiful franchise was built on. Congratulations to Kathleen Kennedy and her moronic protege Rian Johnson for destroying something which meant so much more to the fandom than just a series of movies - a spectacular artwork which brought together and connected so many people. This space opera has now turned into a divisive means of social propaganda, contaminated with feministic and political ideologies."
4188,3,Not the best.,"Leia is Marry Poppins, Fin was completely trashed on, Luke was just a sad old man with nothing to live for, and a big hyper explosion death that no one cared about."
4189,1,A Complete Betrayal of the Star Wars that George Lucas created,"I could spend so much time talking about this movie, but I will try to keep myself contained. But in all honesty, I have never, ever in my whole life been so disappointed by a movie."
4190,1,"""Miss me Yet ? "" George Lucas",I felt like I was watching a Mel Brooks genre parody movie from years ago.It has elements of many movies - none of which are Star Wars.<br /><br />Rey goes in the Dark Side cave to try to see her parents in a dirty mirror - just like Harry Potter. Fin and Rose go to a high end casino - Just like James Bond. Liea flies like she was Mary Poppins.<br /><br />All of this would not necessarily make it a bad movie if the story was great but its not even good - Way too many plot holes and inconsistencies. At this point I honestly I would be more excited about Spaceballs 2 than I am Episode IX. One star is generous !!
4191,1,Didn't feel like Star Wars,"There are some beautiful scenes and CGI but other then that the story is sloppy and there is a lot of missing pieces and just overall horrendous at fitting into the Star Wars Universe. I keep hearing ""you have to look at the particular movie and can't compare it to the series!!!!."" Those people need to stop. The Entire Skywalker Saga is one giant story and George Lucas did an incredible job at fitting it together. Episode XII fit the initial story and was setting up for potentially finishing one of the greatest stories of all time and this film comes and just tears it down so they can create a new edgy and artsy and creative and hip Star Wars. This movie was not good. 1/10."
4192,2,Disney and Rian Johnson just ruined Star Wars,"This movie has way too many forced Marvel movie style jokes in the wrong places that kill the drama. They even have Leia flying through space like Iron Man. Yes, I'm serious."
4193,1,Please do yourself a favor and watch infomercials at home,"Instead of watching this garbage, you are better off watching infomercials at home, at least you don't have to fork money to watch something that makes your colon go all watery. And in which case, your toilet is very near."
4194,1,Worst movie ever,Worst movie ever. This and the others made by Disney.
4195,1,Once more Disney has ruined Star Wars.,"After disney had regained my trust with an amazing movie that is Rogue One, this year they let me down again. Disney is being disrespectful throughout Lucasfilm, it was like the director had never seen a Star Wars movie. I left feeling like I saw a lot of cool things but didn't witness a story, because once again they are remaking the original trilogy. <br /><br /> The entire Finn and Rose part is unnecessary to the movie, Leia floating through space... Phasma is like Boba Fett is just there to sell toys, the amount of funny moments makes this feel like it isn't truly STAR WARS. They disrespected the character of Luke so much, and after not using him in the force awakens, they killed him off to soon in the most stupid way possible.<br /><br /> Overall it's a trainwreck, the prequels are still way better."
4196,3,What a trash pile this film is,"I'll start off with the only decent thing I liked about this film, Kylo Ren, the only character I actually sort of care about in the Disney trilogy. His arc in this is not bad, it's just a shame that he's been punked so hard in these films that it hardly matters at this point."
4197,3,Ughhhh,"Where do I even begin with this film? Kylo Ren is a whiny teenager, Rey is basically Luke Skywalker but *even more special-er*, Rose is an vaguely interesting character ruined by a terrible forced romance, Finn mostly wanders around for a while and visits a casino, Phasma is once again deprived of screen time, Snoke talks a big game and then gets stabbed like an idiot, Chewbacca babysits some Minions-- I mean, porgs, Leia dies but then doesn't... The list goes on and on. The worst thing is that there are so many times where you can see how great The Last Jedi could have been. Kylo coming into his own as a villain, Luke's rejection of the Jedi Order in favour of something new, and that absolutely stunning hyperspace collision that almost made everything worthwhile. But ultimately this was a safe Disney Star Wars film that's most comfortable staying within the tracks of the original trilogy while making token gestures to satisfy older audiences."
4198,3,One Sentence Reviews,"This movie has some moments of fun mixed with your head scratching and dear god, please don't make think it that hard!"
4199,1,A lame superheores movie RPG,"Star Wars is now just a lame cross breeding between Magic + Super Heroes + RPG.<br /><br />The Force has no meaning other than magical powers that work similar to a skill in a RPG game. Mastering the way of the Force means just going somewhere, talking to somebody, there's no work involved not sacrifice required!<br /><br />There is no idea, anymore, of being a part of something bigger than you. Everybody is a hero acting as they like because feelings! It's amazing that the New Order can even function with Stainless Steel Troopers, custom Emperor Guards, disobedience of rank and order. The Resistance is just a bunch of teenagers playing war and having personality issues, with no connection to a paramilitary/military organization whatsoever.<br /><br />The story itself is actually a collage of old scenes and subplots recycled and mashed together with no relation one to another.<br /><br />Like stated in the movie we have to leave all old things die. Apparently beginning with Rogue One the Star Wars Universe is truly dying."
4200,1,Rian Johnson should NEVER touch a Star Wars movie... EVER,"This movie destroys everything the previous movie tried to set up. It's preachy with extremely useless characters. This is by far the worst Star Wars movie of all time. The Star Wars Holiday Special is better than this piece of crap. The director basically gives the fans who grew up with Star Wars the big fat middle finger. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Mark Hamill was spot on when he questioned the direction of his character. Rian Johnson destroyed everything that was great about Star Wars and took a big fat dump on it. I hope every other Rian Johnson film flops and he's driven out of Hollywood and he ends up flipping burgers the rest of his life. That'll be a fitting end to the career the man who hates Star Wars. It was crystal clear he hates Star Wars and for that, Rian Johnson doesn't deserve to be directing anything."
4201,2,Worst chase scene ever put to film,Who in their right mind read that script and thought.......Star Wars? The only thing this movie has in common with others Star Wars films are the character names.
4202,2,Disappointed,"Just watched it and I am very disappointed. It feels like it got almost everything wrong. Everytime you expect something awesome to happen, you are disappointed. I mean, for christ sakes, there were 0 lightsaber duels. Even at the end it builds up to an epic duel and then lets you down."
4203,1,Those who gives this 9-10 stars are obvious Contrarians,"Its been said to death about the depths of failure of this film & how the hardcore fan base is alienated, boycotting future movies. Ruining the legacy of maybe the most beloved movie franchise ever. Only the people who like to hate on things people love are giving this high ratings. 9, 10 stars, seriously? First of all, a 10 star movie is like The Wizard of Oz or The Godfather or the original Star Wars film. How they thought this ridiculous over the top left wingism, goofy movie was what fans wanted to see is just baffling. I made an account just to write this. You can make a good movie that is either a sequel or a spinoff within the universe of a franchise & make it good on its own while paying homage to the original without undermining its legacy. See Rogue One, Creed or Blade Runner 2049. All good movies that only enhanced its predecessors. The film is a joke. Ruin Johnson is a joke & who honestly cares about Episode 9? What can they possibly come up with that will be in any way interesting? Its such a shame. The Force Awakens wasn't even that good to begin with, when people I trust told me TLJ was much worse, I knew I was in for it, but I had no idea we were getting Spaceballs 2"
4204,5,Hope the series makes one more remarkable movie and that they stop for the sake of the old ones,"No new ships, no new aliens, nothing new about the force, no new plot, nothing about who's Ray, and so on ... sorry but is no star wars."
4205,1,The people who made this did a bad job,"Completely devoid of previously established in universe logic, as well as real world logic, the characters don't make any sense, and the writing is terrible. A movie has never come closer to ruining my childhood"
4206,2,stop mickey-mousifying Star Wars,"Lightsabers are supposed to cut stuff... its not a stick, its a high power, dismember on contact, energy sword."
4207,1,Nonsensical delusional plot. Awful film,"I couldn't even begin to get my head around how bad this film was. It's so inquantifiably bad that to take this as a serious film borders on delusional. In an already rich and expansive franchise there are so many directions they could've taken this film in, and this is what they came up with?!?! How the hell did this abomination get through editing? <br /><br />Even after the below than average Force Awakens, they had set up numerous directions to have taken this film in. <br /><br />Just what on Earth Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson were thinking I'll never know. <br /><br />Starwars fan, or film fan, surely anyone could pick up the glaringly obvious plot holes riddled throughout this awful film. <br /><br />Everyone knows Rian Johnson blatantly ignored JJ Abraham's direction, and that he couldn't care less of who was to direct the third enstalment after him. Why would I even want to watch the next one. It's unsalvageable."
4208,1,Truely bad,Abhorrent treatment of the Star Wars universe. Don't watch this movie if you haven't seen it and you like the OT.
4209,1,What was this Sh!tt ??!!,"I was not a fan of the force awakens since I saw that movie as a remake of episode 4. That said, the writers had a chance to answer some of the questions posed in that movie. They didn't. This movie will come to be known as 'how to not make a movie' shown to students of script writing.<br /><br />This film is a great example of how to poorly end every plot point of the previous movie is a very unsatisfying way. Shame on you disney. I am a fan no longer."
4210,5,They have ruined Star Wars.,"I am sad to say that they have truly killed Star Wars. I am long time Star Wars fan since I was a kid, watch every episodes in theaters since I was a small child. The last jedi was directed by a terrible director who obviously knows nothing about Star Wars. I don't think I can go watch it anymore, If you are a long time fan of Star Wars and haven't yet to see it, you going to be disappointed. I wished I had known it was going to be terrible and stupid because if I did, I wouldn't have gone to see it."
4211,4,The Force Whimpers,I saw 'The Last Jedi' opening night with all the fan fare and I walked out thinking we had a contender for the worst 'Star Wars' movie. I've been wanting to elaborate further with a full blown review but honestly the internet drama has been so off putting and childish that meh...
4212,1,Helló,"Crap, junk movie ....<br /><br />This movie has nothing to do with classic movies.<br /><br />Horrible bad scenario, bad director ....."
4213,1,not for star wars fans,"This is not for die hard star wars fans, this is more about brainwashing a new generation of young people and pushing poltical agendas."
4214,1,"Yea, complete stinker. Ruined Star Wars","Terrible film. Ray is always gawping with her mouth partially open, in support of the most dull and nonsensical chase scene ever filmed. Oh and what they did with Carrie is a disgrace."
4215,4,This is not the Luke you're looking for,Thank you very much for destroying my childhood memories this is not Star Wars.
4216,1,I have never ever been so angry at a movie...,"First of all, I don't understand how these critics gave this movie more than 8 stars, it doesn't even deserve 1. I never write reviews but I felt like I had to this time."
4217,1,Star Wars in Title only,The did a great job on creating the most boring Star Wars movie ever. The biggest mystery is where they spent the 317 million on production.
4218,2,Blasphemy made into a movie,"What the hell did I just watch? This is such a desecration and blasphemy of star wars that I am ready to blow up Disney's HQ, fly out into the space and create a civilisation where movies like this are punishable with death. The force doesn't work like it does in this movie, and I wished they had continued developing Snoke, the only character with potential. And it wasn't even a good movie, it completely lacked structure and logic and destroyed the only good characters. And then we have Rey. What a Mary Sue. This is the result of making Star Wars political. If they don't fix the trilogy with episode IX which actually has potential due to them bringing back a little bit Canon, God I hope JJ Abrams hides quick, because I am not responsible for what I will do to him"
4219,2,Disappointing!!!,"This is by far the worst film, and I thought The Force Awakens was bad. The moment there was a forced joke I knew the movie was going to be bad. On the originals there is some humor and sarcasm but this was very childish. Also the characters are hard to capture the audience. There is no connection whatsoever. The plot was really boring and there was hardly any duels. I am really hoping the next film really makes up for the first two of this new trilogy."
4220,1,Do you know the joke about Luke milking a space cow? It's called SW8,"Repacked junk food for those, who don't care about the ingredients list."
4221,3,I don't have a problem with yellow cars.,I don't have a problem with yellow cars.
4222,1,One of the Worst Big Budget Movies and Worst Star Wars,"This is without a doubt the worst example of script writing in Star Wars and one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. As feminist and an intellectual it's embarrassing to have people, who claim to be on your side, butcher your beliefs and try to force it into their terrible movie. Every scene defies common sense , logic, military tactics, and shows a complete disregard for the emotional development and personalities of the characters. It is disconnected from every single previous Star Wars movie in both plot and tone. Not even the brilliance of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher can save this movie. They turned Leia into a laughable tactician in both the space and ground battles, a poor leader, and an unconcious force user while floating in space. They turned Luke into murderous psycho who doesn't know how to forgive. They wasted hours of time casino scenes that no one cared about and only purpose was as a bathroom break. Introduced a new Temp Female Leader of the Resistance and managed to make her look foolish too. In fact she was so bad that the main characters were actively rebelling against her and then they tried to explain it all away as the main characters were wrong when basic reasoning skills suggest otherwise. They created force powers and hyperdrive abilities that aren't shown any where else in cannon and are actually huge plot holes. Example if you can weaponize hyperdrive then why didn't the droid armies ever use it? What about the Empire? The Rebellion might have used if they were desperate too. Especially since their is no reason to lose a single non droid life. Killed off interesting characters without developing them and most likely set up the final movie for failure."
4223,3,Bad legacy for Star Wars,"Starting with Episodes I, II and III Star Wars lost something. This trend toward poor storytelling, unnecessary characters and repetition. This continues with the new episodes. This episode was not only redundant but irritating. The plot was telescoped a mile away, the villain (both villians) weak. If the writers of the new movies want to just repeating the same old thing this trend will continue. Fight scenes for nothing, creatures for nothing, excessive silliness and dialog so bad a child could have written it. Star Wars is about imagination and these movies lack imagination totally. It's too bad because this series could have gone on for a while. The writers should have taken a lesson from the animated clone wars."
4224,1,Garbage script writting and story telling,"Not only as a fan of the old saga, but the whole star wars universe and rules have been broken, and given no concrete direction. The film is totally random and bases everything on political agendas and light-saber battles. Way to much to write about, deserves a book analyzing all the mistakes the filmmakers have done to make star wars just another marketing product with real morals or point or world to connect to. It's a lifeless place where people just pose. Check out just one of the multiple videos just destroying the filmmakers ...skills. Search on youtube: ""Why Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a Complete Cinematic Failure"" Enjoy. Laughs and Tears. What we have today is not Star Wars, and don't pay to watch any further films because you will only encourage these A&&Holz"
4225,1,This film made me lose my smile,The story is uninteresting and the whole film is weak.
4226,1,The worst star wars ever made,"So you thought episode 1,2 and 3 were bad?<br /><br />boy you're in for a ride with this new piece of garbage"
4227,1,Not compelling dissapointment,"TLJ is like a particular TV show called The Walking Dead then throws surprises just to throw surprises. Unfortunately this makes the movie less compelling. <br /><br />Movie tries to be political, subplots are too long and you don't care for them. Characters except for Ben are not compelling. "
4228,1,Terrible Star Wars Movie,"Force Awakens had built up so much great potential and character and seriousness.... then comes The Last Jedi that just ruins the whole trilogy... When you watch this movie you literally say to your self jesus, the force awakens was actually AMAZING... thats how terrible this Last Jedi movie is. Just an absolute disgrace to Star Wars fans. Then go on to not even show Lukes reaction to Hans death and make general hux look like a fool for no reason after being such a threat in The Force Awakens??? And the killing of Snoke?? Just so you can leave Rey and Kylo alone ? Ffs terrible terrible terrible, down right disgraceful to Star Wars fans."
4229,1,Ryan Johnson why?,The decisions Ryan Johnson made directing this movie not only ruined this movie but also ruined the potential of the next movie!
4230,2,Ultra Collectibles Review.,One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my 32 years of life. Luke was a complete ass hat and Holdo was a useless character. I really regret seeing this twice at the theater. Kylo Ren still a terrible villain and whiny like Anakin from attack of the clones. Shirtless Kylo made me throw my popcorn away and almost made me throw up. The movie is one big chase scene between the rebels and first order. I really hate Rey. Only 2 good characters was Finn and Rose. I recommend staying far far away from this movie.
4231,5,just painful to watch.,How trashy this movie is..<br /><br />it's like how thrash Kathleen Kennedy as a producer and Rian Johnson who directed this.. they are the ultimate villains.
4232,1,How is this rated 7/10?,"This is by far the worst Star Wars movie, which is hard to say now that episode 9 is out. Seriously, how did a movie this bad come to be associated with Star Wars? It feels like Disney was trolling us all along, with such low quality film making that will haunt the series for many decades to come."
4233,1,Trashes on the legacy of Star Wars and insults the intelligence of the fans,"I had high hopes for this one. TFA I enjoyed and Rogue One wasn't bad either, so this one should have been fantastic. Instead, we got a lazy, incompetent mess. Basically, every interesting bit in The Force Awakens, which was otherwise a rehash of Episode 4, was scrapped or messed up. Rey's parents, the Knights of Ren, Kylo's obsession with Vader, Snoke's origin, Phasma basically worthless and it's all either unanswered or resolved in a completely underwhelming fashion. "
4234,1,Why destroy one of the best series with political correctness!?,"When I watch a movie, I want to escape reality. I want to be in a completely different world. I do not want to be bombarded with such obvious political agendas being pushed on to me. I don't care for politics, I know it's important and I'll keep up with it somewhat, but I'm just not the type to care all that much. But when it starts showing up so blatantly obvious in movies and destroying one of the best stories ever written, then that's when it's getting to be too much. If you can't separate politics from creating a movie, then you don't need to create it!! If it matters so much to you, then come up with your own original storyline or even write a book!! But don't go taking great original work and filling it with a bunch of bull that's not relevant to the storyline."
4235,1,Ruined the Franchise!!!,"Watch, if you like having your childhood memories crapped on!!!"
4236,1,This is not the Star Wars movie you are looking for...,"It is such a shame that after a cool series of trailers prior to the films release, what we are treated to is little more than an unfortunate mess of a movie..."
4237,2,I Am Not Upset That Rian Johsnon Has Something For BBW Asians,"That is fine and tastes are individual.<br /><br />What I cannot fathom is how these chicks make bombs drop in space. There is no gravity in space, Rian!!<br /><br />What's more why have bombs?? I mean shoot a canon or whatever."
4238,1,Awful in almost every way,"Having seen the film, I can see why Mark Hamill hated the script and its treatment of Luke Skywalker. This movie was awful in every way except the cinematography. What's most shocking for me were the 'spoiler-free' reviews in mainstream media which contained flat-out incorrect statements or facts about the movie. Either those reviewers watched a different version of the movie, or they never watched the movie at all and were just paid to publish some positive drivel and ""facts"" provided to them by the studio. An amazing misfire in the SW series and the first one which doesn't feel like a SW movie at all."
4239,1,One big sad disappointment,Wish I could give 0 stars ...
4240,1,Rian Johnson should wear a bag over his head in public,"Rian Johnson should be ashamed, not just because he made an atrocious movie, but because he wasted so many great opportunities and made such a mess of this franchise that I honestly don't know how it can recover. This movie is beyond bad. Nothing about it is good. The timing is off, the story is trash, the dialogue is terrible, the characters behave in ways that make no sense, there is way too much pointless scene-ruining humor... It would take all night to produce an exhaustive list of how screwed up this movie is. Ideally, this movie would be scrapped entirely and redone, pretending that this just never happened."
4241,1,Warmed over turd of a movie,"It's still boggles the mind how bad this movie was. Not one original thought. Everyone involved, in even the smallest way, making this movie should be embarrassed. Like really embarrassed."
4242,3,Episode VIII: Hope is Lost,This movie was worse than The Force Awakens and that movie was awful. Rian Johnson decided to rip off Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in much the same way that J.J. Abrams ripped off A New Hope in the previous episode. 
4243,1,Save your money. This should've been played on Disney Channel.,"I have been an avid Star Wars fan since I was little and although I disliked portions of the prequels, I never gave up on Star Wars and cringed as much as when I watched this movie. Everything about it was terrible. Nothing made sense. Why were they following a ship for 9 hours and trying to look all menacing when they could have flown a couple tie fighters and blown everything up. Terrible directing and terrible plot lines. Nothing made sense. The Star Wars cartoons and animated series had a better story line than this movie. Disney only cares about selling plushed animals of chicken birds and crystal foxes. If you, like me, thought The Force Awakens was too corny and giddy, this one beats that right out of the park. The First Order was supposed to be the most feared organization in the galaxy and yet they are run by kids and an egotistical dis-proportioned troll. They didn't explain anything and instead gave Leia flying witch powers. Why did they have to ruin Star Wars?"
4244,4,The Most Boring Movie I have Ever seen,And that is saying a lot. Because even Blade Runner 2049 was a long movie but it did not feel boring. 
4245,3,never thought it would be possible to ruin Star wars...,"I am shocked that lucasart storygroup let this movie turn out this way. No character background, messy plot, slapstick humor, over the top happenings and bad manuscript.<br /><br />This is coming from a hardcore Star wars, not sure if I even want to see IX anymore.<br /><br />But, some of the acting was amazing (kylo, rey, luke, leia)"
4246,1,Not Star Wars,"Terrible movie where ""subverting expectations"" is used as an excuse for horrible writing, character development, continuity, and respect for the original trilogy."
4247,1,Not the Star Wars you are looking for,"I am a big Star Wars fan. I was always fascinated by its universe, its lushness, its colorful planets and basically everything. I was very happy seeing the saga rebooted with the former movie, but now, after watching this one, I wish it hadn't. It has nothing to do with Star Wars, it is in short put, a bad movie. It is bland, too long, it lacks the Star Wars feeling and has many useless elements made only to have acceptance from everyone without making any sense in the movie. The whole casino scene, which lasted around 30 minutes(give or take) had nothing to do with the plot. The characters had no substance, it has no real antagonist, and it brings pain into the already destroyed thorax of Darth Vader seeing his grandson being so off character, so off the ideology of a Sith lord.All in all it is a bad Star Wars movie that brings shame to the franchise and to George Lucas!"
4248,1,Incohesive,"It really showed that TFA & TLJ where some by different directors. They clearly did no planning together. TLJ disregarded everything set up in TFA, and had no pre meditation on where episode 3 would go. Horribly incohesive story with more plot holes than Swiss cheese. You don't have to be conservative to see why this movie was god awful. Politics aside, it was simply horrible story telling."
4249,3,Let go of Star Wars,"The thing is, Disney doesn't know what to do with Star Wars, except push feminist agenda. One by one, all men (especially old ones) of power die out, in meaningless and silly ways, while women prevail. Men do silly, immature, irresponsible things, while women save them, scold them, do great and mature things, sacrifice for the greater good, etc."
4250,3,The first step in destroying Star Wars,"While Disney were off to an OK start with Episode 7, which while uninspired, was not horrible, this movie takes a sharp turn immediately.<br /><br />The first scene has Mark Hamill act out a bizarre parody of his Luke Skywalker, to such a degree that he even spoke publicly after the film's release about how he didn't agree with it."
4251,1,Do not touch,"Bombers... in space, literally dropping bombs... vertically... in space, after... one... fighter... destroys point defence... of a whole dreadnought. And that's just in the first 3 minutes of this movie, the rest is even more nonsensical (unbelievably much, much more). I'm actually speechless how bad that whole mess pretending to be Star Wars was. Honestly... I'm lost for words O.o. Part VII was bad, just maybe, just slightly, just perhaps, better (or at least more entertaining) than the prequels - although definitely more repetitive - but this... this is, in my opinion, THE WORST, Star Wars movie EVER (period). I just want my illusions about franchise and two and a half hour of my life back :(. Shame on You Disney, shame , shame, shame."
4252,1,Holy failure,"I can't express my disappointment in words, but the review has to be so many characters to submit...so blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah, disappointment blah blah blah. Failure blah blah blah blah. There."
4253,1,Disaster,"Made an account only to share how displeased and unsatisfied I am. Wouldn't even consider this fan-fiction considering how much stupidity, hate and nonsensical thinking that was put together when making this film."
4254,1,"A film that completely betrays starwars lore, and lands like a wet fart","A film that completely betrays starwars lore, and lands like a wet fart."
4255,3,They forgot to make a good movie.,Only gave it 3 stars due to some of the stunning cinematography.
4256,2,Too Bad it is not the Last Film,There is very little in this film that is original. It is a direct parallel story to the Empire Strikes Back without the heart and character of TESB. There is virtually no story and it is pop to action scene - pop to action scene - pop to action scene with nothing written well enough to explain the film. It is a virtual eye candy movie with no story - but that is Star Wars - just a formula that has gotten worse and worse and worse. 
4257,1,A travesty,Hated it when I first saw it on cinema and totally unwatchable a second time round. Disrespects all the previous movies and introduces stupid magic/powers that don't appear in the universe of previous Star Wars film.
4258,1,"Why this is probably the worst of all the films, yes even episode I, II, and III.","This film is pure garbage. I could go into detail but I wont and save you time. Luke is completely mismanaged as a character. How dare you with Luke? Stok is completely mismanaged as a character to the point of trivializing him. Rey's back story is boring and completely mismanaged. Kylo Ren is completely mismanaged. The love between Finn and Rose was completely mismanaged and shoe horned to the point of hurting Kelly Marie Tran's career. The ending in space is senseless and destroys any sort of space battles or realistic physics. The opening space fight does not follow any space physics what so ever and senseless. The space portion of this film is ripped off from Battlestar Galactica, which isn't necessarily bad is itself but come on better is expected. The second film ignores all plot lines from the first film especially anything that was interesting concerning back story of the new characters destroying an attempt at liking them like the first group of characters. You could actually do a full 2 hour video on why this film is terrible. What is worse is that it hurts a good franchise and has nearly destroyed it all the sake of Rian Johnson's ego. I wish I could skip it, actually you might just be able to because the next film tries very hard to get you to forget it."
4259,2,How could this happen?,"I'm a huge SW fan since I was a child. Now, I'm 30 and greatly disappointed."
4260,1,This is not Star Wars,"This is just a rubbish money grabbing with some stupid genderism.<br /><br />This is not Star Wars.<br /><br />Disney and the stupid/lazy writers, directors can call it and pretend that they made a new SW movie, but is it though?<br /><br />They can't and don't want to understand why the previous films was awesome.<br /><br />I have spoken."
4261,1,Absolutely mind blowingly bad film,"Plot holes galore, forgettable characters, a tarnishing of the Original Trilogy character, macguffins, zero character development, sub par humor, I could go on. This really nailed the coffin for the Star Wars legacy. I hated this film as a Star Wars first, but second as a film aficionado."
4262,2,So painful to watch. I wanted to cry for the death of Star Wars,"I know, sounds extreme, but it's true. Try as I might to see what others saw in this movie as ""good,"" I simply can't. This movie seems to be trying its hardest to ruin the original series in order to create a new series, but here's the real problem, there's NO chemistry between any characters in this movie. None. Zero. This movie is cold. Never mind that it is a Star Wars movie, it's cold as a movie can get, any movie. If it wasn't Star Wars no one would go see this movie. I'm working extra hard not to reveal any spoilers, but I fear for the future. Rogue One was so much better than this and showed the potential for Star Wars, and then TLJ ruined all of our hope. Hope is gone in this movie. Our hope that Disney would do right be Star Wars. Maybe they can fix it in the next installment, but doesn't seem there's any care to even try based on this movie. Let's hope JJ can save Star Wars in part 3. He can start by giving Luke a much better send off as the Luke we knew and loved the last 30 years. If Luke only comes back as a merely a Force ghost, I'll never forgive Disney."
4263,2,40 years and loved ALL Star Wars movies but not this one,"J.J. Abrams set up a really good potential 2nd movie in this trilogy. I loved The Force Awakens. So much excitement, suspense, lighthearted in moments, tragic moments, but still very gritty SW feel. Rian Johnson dropped the ball so badly it hurts. I did NOT go with any preconceived ""fan theories"", just expected another good movie. This feels almost completely disconnected from TFA storyline. "
4264,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever,Been watching this series since the early 80's and Empire is one of my all time favourite movies but that was the high water mark and its been all downhill since then with TLJ being the straw that broke this camels back.
4265,1,A Hate Letter To Fans,"I was truly disappointed with this film, I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember.This film almost seemed designed to ruin the legacy that George Lucas left with the originals. For starters, the fact that they had a side quest that took up half an hour of the film is taking the piss, and the fact that it's only purpose was to tell us that capitalism and animal cruelty was totally unnecessary.<br /><br />The way that they handled the characters from the original trilogy was criminal, they killed off Admiral Ackbar like he was just a background character. Having never seen Princess Leia use the force, I was surprised to see her not only survive in space, but to also then fly back to the ship basically unharmed. Meet Princess Leia Poppins everyone. And last but not least we have Luke Skywalker, a character who saw good in Darth Vader, but will attempt to kill his nephew because he thinks that he will turn the the dark side is just ludicrous. The fact that they had time to show him milking an alien and yet no time to show emotion is simply ridiculous, and then have him beaten by someone who has only held a lightsabre twice seems like a total waste of time.<br /><br />When the head of Lucasfilm was asked what she wanted to do with a new trilogy, her response was ""The main character has to be female"". I have no problem with a female led Star Wars film. I however do have an issue with Rey, she has no character development, has only used a lightsabre once and yet is now the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy. Finn does pretty much nothing throughout the film apart from kill Captain Phasma and then nearly himself. Poe destroys a Dreadnought in the beginning of the film (I know that it was Rose's sister) and is then sidelined by Admiral Holdo for the rest of the film.<br /><br />The addition of Laura Dern to the cast excited me, that was until her character turned up and consequentially added an additional hour to the film and then kills herself in a role that was befitting of a good character. Snoke had the makings of an excellent villain, and then is killed off halfway through the film. Kylo Ren seemed to have a cool story ahead of him, but then this film happened and he was reduced to just another crying emo kid that like to show how swole he is.<br /><br />And onto the worst character in the film, Rose does nothing through the film but say stupid things and bring us to canto byte.<br /><br />Captain Phasma was a waste of time being given that she is only in the film for about two minutes and is then killed off.<br /><br />The film is also riddled with false humour which ultimately makes the film even worse."
4266,1,I still can't believe this. Star Wars is over in the worst way possible.,"Don't even know what to write in this review, but to summarize in one word: Atrocious.<br /><br />Help us Irvin Kershner, you're our only hope..."
4267,4,my first review on IMDB,"I am not trying to compare this movie with the previous ones as obviously they are different. <br /><br />The CGI wasn't too bad, the action scenes were entertaining. <br /><br />I just didn't enjoy the character build up or lack of. The direction of this movie seemed as if they knew Star Wars itself would make money so the effort in creating characters we can like or understand was a total fail, for me. I just wasn't ""compelled"" to care for any of the characters. The decisions made throughout the movie was rather frustrating. <br /><br />How I usually rate a movie is, will I watch the movie again tomorrow, or next week? With this movie, it may be another year for me to watch it again. <br /><br />I usually have movies that I like/love running in the background while I go about my night, this won't be a part of that list. <br /><br />I hope they do better on the next movie, however, I wont be watching it when it comes out. I'd rather wait a few months. I'm just not jumping for joy in the direction they are taking the star wars story."
4268,1,What have you done?? Why??,"Unfortunately for all of us the saga Star Wars as we knew is now DEAD. People seem to be out of ideas for new movies, and out of nowhere the ""brilliant"" idea of remake a good movie or continue a saga pops out in someones mind."
4269,1,Bad,Very very very very very very very very very very very very bad
4270,5,"Entertaining, but completely misses the point of Star Wars","Besides the use of the kind of humor that's even becoming stale in marvel movies, this product completely misses the point of star wars and butchers original characters in the process. First, I don't claim to know what the point of Star Wars is (even though Lucas explained it in interviews), but I can tell you this is not even close. It's no wonder the concept of the grey jedi wasn't invented by Lucas because it makes not much sense in the rules of this universe. It's already been established that jedi=good and sith=bad but Rian seems to think that jedi=hard-left and sith=hard-right so it's better to come to the middle or something? This has never been a contemporary political franchise so I don't understand how in this universe grey jedi could make sense. Besides this, several established rules were broken like hyperspeed and Luke being practically the most hopeful character in the universe etc. Also the direction was quite bad compared to even Rogue One, where the camera in space battles flew with the fighters to put you right into the action and the objectives were well visualized and oriented in the scene, while here it was just fighters flying all over the place with no clear objective or threat (completely ruining the tension). This is just one example of the bad choices made. Another thing that did not make sense was the slave kids supporting the rebels because they freed the animals or something? That's such a huge leap of logic, I can't get my head around that decision. In the end I don't remember much from this movie but I do remember being simultaneously entertained and confused at the same time. Star Wars needs to move onto new directions, even Return of the Jedi already had problems with recycling things from the first movie, and Disney decided it would be a good idea to essentially try and tell a similar story as the OT."
4271,1,Dreadful. Easily the worst of them all.,"It's funny. As I sat through the movie, I was entertained. I laughed at the silly MCU-style jokes and reacted where I was supposed to react. But then at the end, I realized just how bad this movie is. It is empty. It is devoid of anything that made Star Wars, well, Star Wars. SPOILERS AHEAD"
4272,4,Not what Star Wars is about,"This movie falls flat in every way. You've probably already heard about the inappropriate attempts at humor. The Last Jedi is missing everything that you want in a Star Wars movie. The characters are bland and uninteresting (I thought Benicio Del Toro was the only one with any sort of characterization), the dialogue is completely forgettable, and the set pieces are just place holders for some stuff that passes as ""story""."
4273,1,Terrible,"The treatment of Luke and Leia as characters is insulting to Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Terrible story writing and no character development, Disney have pushed the reset button on star wars. They even ignored what happened in episode 7. This is no longer Star Wars, I'll watch the original films a hundred times more but never will I watch a Disney Wars movie again. Disney is the new evil empire."
4274,3,Terribad,Just so bad. The franchise should have ended long ago and this horribly boring excuse for a film should never have been made.
4275,4,Worse than the Phantom Menace,This film is as bad as Daisy Ridley's acting....Absolutely shocking..
4276,1,DISASTER,Should've never handed the reigns over to Disney. A true disaster of a film that ruins yet another hero (Luke) and fails to develop new characters.
4277,3,I forgot it before I even left the theater,"This is a bad movie, don't get fooled by all the phantom mencing that's happening. "
4278,1,"Alas, the Pointless Finn Subplot","If you remove Finn and Rose and all their story from this movie, NOTHING would have changed: not the future of the galaxy, not the main plot, not the force...NOTHING. Phasma didn't even die because of them. If Finn died colliding with the buster gun he would have made a weak presence."
4279,1,"Terrible story, Bad writers, bad acting. *spoilers*","1 day of training (sitting on a rock) you're a Jedi knight! Ships that run out of power and randomly fall/drift off (Guess space dont work the same way), Princess Poppins somehow only now shows her 1 power? Token chick to get the Asian market, Talking about marketing ""Jar Jar worthy"" Porg's for kids to buy, Luke was a wimp, remember not just 1 person in the same place at the same time who can do the same thing *crack codes*, Dead Jedi can still use force lighting?! Random orphans, Phasma was a space filler, pointless crystal foxes again just to sell toys? Snoke was a total badass but pointless and dumb & So where are the Knights of the Ren? Or did they become the red cheap henchmen?<br /><br />Anyways as a great man once said ""ITS A TRAP!"" - Admiral Ackbar. (Rip)"
4280,1,7.2 cant believe,"I did never expected, that episode I would not be the worat Star Wars movie. This film is sh*** in so many ways..."
4281,1,"""Age of Ultron"" Star Wars version","I'm writing this review just to make something clear: whether you are a SW fan or hardcore fan or not, whether you know the SW lore or not, this movie is a very mediocre movie that presents itself as a stand-alone crappy story with bad acting and bad scripting. The TLJ is a movie that sells itself as a sensation at first sight but then on next day makes you wonder what the heck you saw: A very hollow movie with a story that makes no sense and lacks of ambition. I fear that there is a formula at Hollywood to film the latest movies to attract the audience very similar to the one seen in The Expendables or Avengers: Age of Ultron, Justice League, etc, etc. One liner dialogues, stories that make no logical sense, not even in fiction, characters introduction to show some portion of a story that may or may not follow further, the killing of a hero character such as in Alien:Covenant between film, stupid humor sense that is not even adequate even for kids. SPOILERS AHEAD!"
4282,4,Really disappointing!,"Really disappointing! Didn't fit with the previous Star Wars movies. Was definitely missing J.J Abrams on this one. It was like they didn't know the characters in this story. I say this as a woman - it might not have been so bad if they didn't work so hard to push a feminist agenda trying to make all of the women look so much smarter and making all of the men look foolish and hotheaded. Anytime you have to make yourself look good by putting others down, everyone loses. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses with flaws."
4283,4,"Not as bad as they say, but very bad","The movie suffers from multiple plot holes, uninteresting characters, and endless Disney jokes that are just bad. However, the movie has very impressive photography, a great production value, acceptable acting from part of the original returning cast, especially Mark Hamill and Adam Driver."
4284,3,What were they thinking - so many plot holes,"Just watched the movie and while it was entertaining it's really bugging me how far they missed the mark on this movie. Could have been so much better. It's more akin to the George Lucas 2nd trilogy in it's plot holes or story devices that go nowhere, general bad story and dialogue and inability to capture the magic of the original trilogy - which is even more maddening as I felt that Force Awakens was able to do that somewhat."
4285,3,What just happened?,This movie has no cohesion with the force awakens at all. Countless plot points that were built up in the episode 7 only to be swept away in the last Jedi. Snoke backstory? Nope. Rey's parents? Who cares. Luke as a powerful Jedi? He gone. Mystery of Ahch-To and ancient Jedi teachings? Dusty books in an old tree. 
4286,1,It's a Trap!,"Now I know how heartbroken Obi Wan Kenobi felt when Anakin turned to the dark side. My heart breaks for my childhood hero Luke Skywalker, in my heart this never happened because this simply isnt a star wars film. There is nothing left to save this film franchise which has never been able to recreate the spark in the universe that Star Wars gave generations of film goers from 1977. "
4287,1,Now cometh the destroyer,"It's hard to find anything at all to like in this movie. There is quite literally nothing redeemable - not a single scene that does any sort of honour to the spirit of Star Wars. Not one single scene. Every now and then it comes close... but then promptly and intentionally ruins every single potentially ""cool"" scene."
4288,3,"The truth about ""The Last Jedi.""","Coming from a background where the Star Wars franchise had developed such a strong and positive reputation, makes one begin to contemplate the direction the most recent Star Wars films are headed.<br /><br />From fast paced space battles to intense lightsaber duels, one is most certainly going to be entertained. <br /><br />The most recent expedition into the Star Wars saga includes many modern visual effects as well as humor- something the earlier films may have lacked. This recent embarkation has left many fans in ""awe"" and others in a raging dispute.<br /><br />Recent Twitter and Instagram disputes between fans and the acclaimed Writer/Producer/Director Rian Johnson bring to light the obvious shifts in the general dynamics of the Star Wars films. <br /><br />Most if not all fans highly esteem and claim that the ""Original Series"" from 1977 are the pinnacle and ""gold standard"" of what and how a such a franchise should be represented. Once the 'Prequels' hit the theaters, many fans were repulsed by a certain ""dopey"" character (Jar Jar). Fortunately for the millions if not billions of fans, Jar Jar's role shifted. Certain feelings of negativity towards the prequels as well as ""less than stellar"" acting, created a band-wagon on which many quickly boarded. However regarded the prequels were, the films in and of themselves ""felt"" like a Star Wars film- something the modern day ""adaptations of Star Wars lack."
4289,1,"Brutally, crushingly disappointing","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything has been said already, I just forgot to rate it. Subverting expectations for an established franchise was clearly a horrible idea, and no thought was put in to how this would affect fans, even casual fans, of the franchise. IMDB should publish the ""unweighted"" score here, which is <7. What a horrible thing to happen in cinema!"
4290,1,Disgrace for the Star Wars Universe,"This was so dumb, so bad, so bad. The only thing worth watching is to see some of the elements of the real Star Wars universe. Acting is so irritating and bad. Character development? Kidding me? Like the so calles Rose? Phasma? Holdo? And the kid in the space Monte Carlo barn? Snoke? A decent trooper was more original and better character in lets say The Jedi Returns. Kylo Ren? The big nose guy who is evil (or not) or evil... Man, 5 seconds of Darth Vader is better than... Ah, shame. Even the first 3 episodes look not as bad after watching this piece of..."
4291,1,"If it wasn't a Star Wars film, this could have been a great Sci-Fi Film","Everything that the critics, fan and alike, have said about this film is absolutely true. There's some great iconic shots, but the film is all style, no substance."
4292,1,As i expected.. Since the day Disney took over SW.. It's a mess that can never salvage.,"Start with The Force Awakens , Star Wars Rebels, The Rogue One and now this THe Last Jedi.. I already expect ''The Last Jedi'' its the same pile of shit that first come out from JJ Abrams ''The Force Awakens''. I only regard those Star Wars before Disney took over as the authentic ones.. In my personal Star Wars Collection i never keep a single piece of those Disney Star Wars trash given out starting by JJ Abrams and all jokes and failures followed. The lead actors mostly looks damn ugly in this film.. Start off with Finn got such a big cheeks and mouth that look like a grouper fish, Rose Tico looks like an auntie trying to act young in those costumes. Her face is so big and chubby there is no way of hiding it.. Is there no other prettier females or handsome guys choices in hollywood these days to be pick as leads? Or is it cheaper to hire these as to squeeze out more profits from audience.. By the way Finn is a black, All Storm Troopers are clone from a bounty hunter name Jango Fett which look like more of a Latin. All clones should have the same face and similar skin tone.. How come when Disney took over, it clone out a black that look like a grouper fish in storm troopers? Defects in the cloning system? Each time i look at Finn in the movie, i can't help but laugh out.. Nothing personal ok. If you are a fan of Star Wars, 100% you will know this fact on Storm Trooper.. He is in the movie 'Attack The Block' and i like that movie.. It's just the Storm Trooper thing is not for him.."
4293,4,I love Star Wars but what was this!,"Too many jokes, distorys everything of the Star Wars universe, I fell cheated and hugely disappointed - how can Disney mess up a franchise so badly."
4294,1,The reason I brought tissues,"Hi, yes you the reader. You expected me to say I came out with tears running down my cheeks at the ending of ""The Last Jedi"". However, to your surprise I came did indeed leave the cinema with less fluid than I came in with and I'm not talking about my eyes. Shame, could've enjoyed this film if it wasn't for the close up shots of that naughty Princess Leia."
4295,5,Fairly Schmeh,"I wanted to give myself time to sort out my thoughts on this film, and see what others had to say, which seem to be on-par with my feelings, which aren't good. If I were to use two words to describe this film it would be disappointing and boring. I had high hopes for this film since The Force Awakens was good and I loved Rogue One. This, while not a total train wreck just did not have much going for it in way of story, plot, excitement, fun. The script was just terrible. Full of holes, all over the place, meandering and lifeless. This SW edition definitely ranks around the bottom for me with Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, which were nothing more than long toy commercials. If anyone were to ask me if they should see it I would suggest they see Jumanji instead, which was entertaining, funny, and a lot more fun."
4296,3,"2,5 hours of another remake for gags and for ruining a universe","Star Wars is a special place for me, where science fiction meets the era of knights, high-tech or mystical things meet the seriousness of the faith in something you cannot explain. After the disappointment caused by the prequel trilogy thousands of fans asked the filmmakers to make Episode VII more like Star Wars. Let it be dirty again, forget politics, don't be childish and ridiculous, let only some of the characters be funny, and respectfully let the Force be as it was in the original trilogy. I think that J.J.'s crew followed these instructions well and the fans liked the result. However, it brought some new warnings and requests to life (such as ""don't copy the plot twists of earlier episodes, because you'll make Star Wars boring""), but I think this wasn't the moment when the makers of this episode were listening."
4297,1,A BLACK DAY IN STAR WARS HISTORY,"""A review from a true die-hard Star Wars fan""<br /><br />I am 42 years old and i'm a Star Wars fan since i was young and i own a huge collection of vintage Star Wars toys which i collect ever since (for nearly 30 years now) so for me Star Wars is more than a movie.<br /><br />Besides that i'm a big movie fan and own a 4000+ dvd collection (from Bogart to Schwarzenegger , from Hitchcock to John Carpenter , from Film-Noir to Comedy , from France to Hollywood...) so it might be my first review but i know the score.<br /><br />First of all i certainly don't wanna say that everything was better in the old days.<br /><br />Offcourse nothing beats the originals (Episode 4-6) where i grew up with as a kid - yet they simply don't have to!<br /><br />ESB is close to perfection, but ANH and ROTJ have their flaws. The prequels (Episode 1-3) have many flaws (mainly the CGI overkill) , but the storyline was good , the music was great , they have some nice characters and most important ; the movies came from the heart and had soul. Then, after 10 years of waiting , there was TFA (Episode 7) and in my opinion JJ Abrahams delivered a very good movie. Altough the story was a bit of a rehash of the original trilogy , JJ was able to capture the ''Star Wars Drive"" (switching between scenes and storylines with perfect tempo and timing) that is so typical for Star Wars movies. Last year there was the spin-off movie ''Rogue One'' , which was outstanding (I personally just had some issues with the score, but other than that it was great)<br /><br />And now we have 'The Last Jedi' (Epsiode 8) which i really looked forward to. Wednesday i went to the openingnight of this newest instalment and it was bad. Very bad. In fact it was such a painful experience, that i left the theater devastated after 90 minutes and returned the next day for another try (this time together with my 8 year old son who loves SW as well)<br /><br />But unfortunately ; what a massive dissapointment!<br /><br />Its too much of everything except too much of a good story.<br /><br />The story is just awful and respectless to the Star Wars saga. It has so many (bad) jokes that it almost becomes a parody. There are multiple ridiculous scenes (the flying princess, bb8 in the scout walker..) There are unnecessary scenes - especially at the end where the movie doesn't know when to stop- which makes this movie way to long and at some points even boring. There are annoying characters (especially Rose). Again there is too many CGI. And what about the scene with the Race Horses that makes Star Wars looks like a Harry Potter movie!? From beginning to start its a chain of unbelievable choices. Almost like if this movie was controlled by people who don't know anything about the history and magic of Star Wars at all. There is such an overkill of force and tricks that it simply becomes a common thing. What happened to Subtlety? At almost every point this movie is such a big dissapointment. The critics all wrote good reviews. No wonder. Disney has become so powerfull that being banned for all other Disney projects simply means losing a job. Also don't be misled by the high rating. Wednesday thousands of mysterious voters rated this movie with a maximum score of 10. These votes most likely came straight from the darkside. Its shocking to see that Disney -with all the money in the world- did not manage to come up with a decent movie. That they hired a second rate director and used a poor script to mess up one of the biggest pieces of art of the 20th century. The Star Wars universe has lost a bit of its magic after this episode."
4298,1,what the hell happened?,"What a big pile of s**t! What a way to make the worst star wars movie ever and stick up the middle finger to long life fans and the most important characters.<br /><br />No one is ever interested in the new characters, they have no story. We want to see the original cast finish the trilogy."
4299,1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!","The most powerful jedi of the Star Wars saga gets back to the screens after 30 years and dies without any reason. Good job Disney you destroyed something which I thought was indestructible. Although maybe there's a deeper message,Darth Vader also thought the Death Star is....hmmm"
4300,1,So bad,This movie was terrible. It was tough to watch. The plot was jumpy. I was generally unhappy after watching it.
4301,1,Identity politics saps the joy out of all it touches.,Hopefully the amount of negative reviews serve as a wake up call for Disney and Lucasfilm.
4302,1,They Tried but Failed,Never should have been made. The story is boring and the writer doesn't even know how the Force works. I am fine with it being forgotten.
4303,1,"Star Wars, for people who don't like Star Wars","Everything that could possibly be said about the weakness of this instalment has already been made crystal clear by other users on IMDB. All I can add is that I suspected the title of my review after leaving episode 8, with everything held dear by old fans being ruthlessly destroyed. But I'm losing count of the number of people I'm now hearing voicing that exact sentiment. ""I'm not a Star Wars fan/I've never seen Star Wars... but I liked TLJ"""
4304,1,How much did Disney pay all the movie review sites for good ratings?,"How could they have let this movie happen it left me feeling profoundly sad. Not the kind of sad I felt at the end of Rogue One either. That was just showcasing the costs of war and made all the triumphs of the original trilogy more weighty. This horrid movie took all the sacrifices hopes and dreams of the characters from the original movie and my childhood, then just took a massive dump on them."
4305,1,One of the worst movies of the decade,"Characters attitudes and motivations make no sense, most of them are contradictory, shallow or just non-existent.<br /><br />You can't really understand why nor how characters are taking decisions and actions.<br /><br />The world of The Last Jedi has no consistent rules or standards."
4306,1,The Last Star Wars I pay to see.,"It breaks my heart to write this but this movie is truly soulless and all around awful. Absolutely poorly written and conceived. The characters are flat, weak, one-dimensional, and out-of-character. The structure is massively flawed and the plot is riddled with holes."
4307,1,The reason my wife left me.,"I come to watch this film after a long session of counselling with my wife. I suggested this film as we first made love to the Han and leia theme. Unfortunately, gregg from Greggs stole her. Now they watch Star Trek and fornicate with Spock ears on."
4308,1,this movie didnt make sense,"I had a flashback about how bad I remember this movie was and I was inspired to leave a review. I remember it being a pointless let down. The plot didn't have any direction, characters i liked from previous movies were turned into pitiful a-holes, and there climax of the movie had a hyperspace gimick that pretty much destroys the entire narrative of the entire franchise."
4309,2,"Well below average as a stand-alone Film, not even bad as a Star Wars Film","The first major complaint is that we don't really understand what the situation in the Galaxy is. The First Order come across as a fringe group of right wing extremists who somehow have the arsenal of US Military. In the meantime, the New Republic - who we understand were until recently ruling the Galaxy - have the equivalent of a few jeeps and some AK47s. Although the Force Awakens is responsible for getting the franchise into this situation, the situation was not irrecoverable. However this film just digs itself deeper into that particular hole. Even the opening crawl gets it wrong: The very first sentence states that the First Order rule the Galaxy. Later on, it states that they are rising. Are the First Order ascending, or are they ascendant? How come the First Order are so powerful and the New Republic so weak? Why didn't the New Republic assimilate any of the Imperial military technology? If you're expecting answers to these questions, then your expectations will be subverted."
4310,1,Huge disappointment,Just disappointed about the last movie. Everything was wrong.
4311,2,Popcorn Movie with High Budged.,"The plot is so weak and silly. Unbelievable that this is the plot for big movie.<br /><br />The characters is so stupid. The mighty Snoke died by the most stupid villain in Starwars' history. The legend Luke died pointlessly. If finally he has to die, why he doesn't go fight directly with Kilo? Stupid. Have all the knights been trained? They fight lilke kids who got light saber as x'mas gift! Forget spectacular Jedi fight like in Ep 1-3. Only kids fights you can see. "
4312,2,Bought Scores...,"This is a disgrace to Star Wars in general. I was unhappy with 7, there's a lot of things I can say about why they didn't make it feel like a Star Wars movie but Episode VIII is bad even by the standarts set by Disney themselves."
4313,1,There's nothing to look forward to.,1st review ever. That's how dissapointed I am. I've loved starwars my whole life. But now it's dead. I'll just keep it short.
4314,1,Something died inside of me...,"I am a fan of Star Wars, not a die hard fan (didn't read the comics and books), nut I love the Star Wars universe, the characters. I even like the prequel so I don't qualify as a difficult viewer. <br /><br />But after watching Star Wars: the Last Jedi, I deeply feel disrespected, betrayed and disappointed. This is the worst star wars movie ever made.<br /><br />It hurts me to write this but it is the truth. <br /><br />The movie is wrong on so many levels:"
4315,1,Nice One Ryan!,Where to begin with this film.<br /><br />Well we can start by saying what a SURPRISING movie that you made for the FANS Rian. It's really odd when a director decides to go purely for shock factor rather then seeing why the decisions made by certain characters are just utterly dumb. Oh wow! Luke throws it over his shoulder like it meant absolutely nothing whilst ruining his character from three previous films..... Nice One Ryan. Oh wow! Kill off the main villain leaving JJ to try to figure out just how in the crap he is going to complete this trilogy.... Nice One Ryan. Oh wow! Leia got shot out into space and has been out there for minutes and is clearly dead. Nope she uses the force to Mary Poppins herself back into the ship...... Nice One Ryan.<br /><br />These things were supposed to be shocking but wow did they just come off as completely dumb and nonsensical. I understand why people hate this movie but if you like it there is no problem there. This is all subjective. Even though in my opinion this movie is Garbage.<br /><br />There is one good thing to say about it though. Adam Driver is a tremendous actor and Kylo can be cool at times as well as his back must really be sore from carrying the largest boulder on earth that is this new Star Wars franchise is.<br /><br />I can't wait to see how Disney will mess up the franchise that I loved as a kid and still do. Somehow.
4316,3,The only thing this film forced was a feminist attitude,"I'm not saying I'm a sexiest dude, but I felt this film was just a campaign for feminism. Like just make a film, don't make it so political, especially not Star Wars."
4317,1,This kills the Star Wars,"I'm a woman who has loved Star Wars for more than two decades. I created this account because I want to talk about how much I hate The Last Jedi. It's been 9 months since I first saw the movie and I am just as angry about it now as I was in December 2017. This movie has killed part of my love of Star Wars, which means it has killed a part of me. This movie is a criminal. My issues with the film:"
4318,1,Garbage,"Where does Disney come off giving Rian Johnson a TRILOGY after this garbage? He doesnt know how to tell a story! The pace was totally off. The story was nonsense. The vision was small. Almost EVERY choice Johnson made was a bad one. Quite simply NONE of it felt EARNED, which shouldnt be surprising because clearly the writer/director didnt earn his job."
4319,1,How the hell does this have an 8 star review. Worst movie I've ever seen.,"I've never written a review. This is my first review for any movie and I wanted to write this just because I fully believe that this movie should be buried and never shown again. If you are on the fence on whether to see this piece of garbage, save your money. You are better off watching the live action dragonball z movie - which was honestly a better movie. No joke, that's how bad this is. This movie takes you on the most mediocre ride of your life. They have moments where you think that it will get better and then they choose the exact opposite option of what should happen. Burn it to the ground. "
4320,1,The Demise of Star Wars,Let's see if the third time's the charm.
4321,1,The Anti-Star-Wars Star Wars Movie,"For those who have watched (and read) Star Wars for most of their lives, this movie is a huge disappointment. It goes to great lengths to mock and insult all that made the Star Wars saga special -- the heros, the Jedi, the Force, and the main characters. In this movie Luke Skywalker becomes a hobo drinking from a sea cow (not joking), Princess Leia becomes a space traveling Mary Poppins (not joking), all prior Star Wars principles and principals are thrown to the wayside, and even heroes introduced in the prior episode, Poe and Finn, are turned into bungling stooges. I think I might finally start encouraging my son to watch Star Trek movies instead."
4322,2,Deus Ex Machina loaded moral Absolutism disguised as moral complexity,"Once more we have a movie that has too many convient coincidences that allow the protagonists to succeed whilst being the purer than driven snow good guys. Far too often you see main characters face situations where they conveniently get out of them with skills they haven't developed and have no reason to have. 'The Force' seems to have become a convenient tool for deus ex machinas. The film also has a few moments where it pretends to suggest moral ambiguity, but that turns out to be a red herring as it doesn't even get explored and the movie largely promotes the heroes as the unimpeachable good guys. Painfully disappointing given how the movie was sold as the birth of the grey jedi"
4323,3,My review,A realy good movie but an awful one in the star wars franchise
4324,2,Rian Johnson's Star Wars movie is NOT good - SPOILERS? - Kind of,"Wow, I am so disappointed in the story. I get where they were trying to go with The Last Jedi but it did not get there at all. Holes in the story and too many assumptions are only a few of the many issues that plagued this movie. I love the franchise and I was 5 when my dad took me to see the original Star Wars movie at the theater. I feel like they treated Snoke like Darth Maul, a gimmick. They also tried to make Luke feel like Obi wan but a sadder version. I thought there was going to be a huge fight seen on the ground like in Empire but the new Walkers were just for show. In the end (not the real end) it made me feel like the way I felt in The Departed but now they have to do a part 9. The visuals are great except for a couple of scenes (hence the 2 starts) and I like Carrie Fisher's final performance. They could have cut at least 30 min off the movie and it may have made it a little better. *sigh* But hey we all have our opinions right? Disney, if you are reading this, I could definitely write and direct a much better Star Wars film even though I have zero experience. I'm just a fan that has watched a lot of films."
4325,4,Total mess,How uninspired and messy. Not looking forward to more star wars.
4326,1,A miss on every stroke.,Its hard to find a single good point to this movie.<br /><br />The way they mistreat the legacy characters lore and galaxy. The way the Break space combat. FUEL!!! The add new characters like Rose Tico(or to a very lesser degree finn) to be a role model for women but then make her lame and do more harm then good and then wonder why fans hate the character(anyone who hates the actor though is scum). The only strong women in this film Is Leia and Rey(who is a total mary sue with no character development). They waste Phasma who only has 3 1/2 minutes of screen time over 2 films and gets beaten by a janitor.
4327,2,Disney PC pablum,"This product has been homogenized, pasteurized and sanitized by the Disney PC machine for your protection. The end result is a product that is totally tasteless without any nutritional value but it contains every race, age and gender possible. Acting ability is not a requirement."
4328,1,What a joke...,"It's been thoroughly covered, but this movie has nothing going for it. "

Tell Vader I do have a lack of faith and couldn't care less if he was disturbed.<br /><br />4. Jump in the garbage chute.<br /><br />3. Find myself floating home.<br /><br />2. Summer vacation on Alderaan.
4330,1,The Worst Star Wars movie made,"WORST Star Wars Movie ever made, Disney pushed their own agenda, in the meantime destroying established characters.Bad humor, terrible backstories. Everything was just flat out B A D. <br /><br />Thanks Disney, I know you don't give a F about us (fans) but you just ruined a legendary lore rich culture phenomenon such as J.K Rowling, J.R.R Tolkien stories. Now, G.W Lucas JR great storytell is considered a joke."
4331,2,killed my joy,"This honestly killed my enjoyment of Star Wars, causing more problems for the universe than solving. All this while mixing together pointless characters."
4332,1,Who writes this stuff?,"Probably the worst Star Wars film ever. A travesty. An absolute disgrace. Look at Mark Hamill's facial expression after the movie premiere-he was totally shell-shocked. Luke Skywalker, the man once called 'A New Hope' is now a fear filled shell of a man. Stupid plots-what's the point of the Rose character? And Finn? Been a star wars fan since the first movies. Passed the legacy onto my children. Disney is intent on killing the legacy for money. Why did Geo Lucas sell the franchise? Won't be watching any more-I'll stick to the books."
4333,1,How did this happen?,"How can so many people with so much money in their hands and so many possibilities deliver something that bad? I've been using imdb for years and this movie made me create an account just to give 1 star. It deserves more than 1 star but since somehow this movie got good critics from... I don't know who, I had to give 1 star to balance things out. If you think I hate this movie to jump in the hatewagon, no, I hate it because:<br /><br />A single X-wing can now cause huge damage to a capital ship, and said capital ship doesn't have a tractor beam, no fleet, no fighters... because plot hole (can't remember what happened to the shields...)<br /><br />After 7 movies magically appears the gas/fuel issues in star wars. <br /><br />Mace Windu, a powerful master Jedi dies after losing his arm and falls from a window. Leïa? An old woman with close to no training? She gets blown up by a torpedo, floats in the vacuum of space, flies because the force now makes jedi pulling themselves to a place and survives<br /><br />Snoke is an old ""sith"", he has scars, he must have been around for a while. What are his motives? His story? He dies, no explanation. Fine, but in that case don't make him old with a face that screams ""you want to know my story"". <br /><br />Jedis can now use lightning from their ghost forms. How about you kill Sith instead of burning books Yoda? <br /><br />Finn and the chubby asian girl did nothing. And they recruit a random guy instead of the one maz insisted on. Finn sacrificing himself might have saved the movie, huge ""wow"" but no, the annoying asian disney character even ruined that.<br /><br />Rey is on a planet where Luke is hidden and she skypes with Kylo, almost revealing his lair. <br /><br />The whole Rey going in the dark side whole is useless. <br /><br />We know that imperial guards aren't force sensitive. We've seen Kylo in ep 7 stop blaster shots mid air, probing brains, paralyzing people without even holding his hand toward his target, send Rey fly meters away and make her pass out while he was bleeding.... and now he is at full strength and can't use the force against imperial guards. Both him and Rey struggle and almost die... Yoda in episode 3 knocked out two imperial guards by waving his hand without even paying attention to them<br /><br />Well, I could go on for a while but the worst: the out of nowhere pink haired female admiral AND AND AAAAAND how do you destroy a fleet? By sending a ship at lightspeed in the ennemy's biggest ship. What... the... hell? Imagine Star wars the phantom menace ""we can't get through the federation's ship: send a ship or even a random object at lightspeed through it? GG EZ DIRECTED AND WRITTEN BY G. LUCAS"".<br /><br />This movie has way too many flaws. As a Star wars movie, it ruins over movies by creating dumb new rules and removing old ones. As a standalone movie, it's a cool scifi flick, could have Cara Delevigne in it but don't think too much. To be honest, it feels a lot like one of those boring Star Trek episode where the ship is iddle and they beam themselves on a planet to find a solution to their issue. That's exactly it. And it's bad, slow and poorly written. You remember many lines from ep 4 5 6? Even from 1 2 3? You won't remember a thing from this one, except it being bad.<br /><br />Oh and they killed Luke by having him make an hologram of himself. Well.. bye I guess, hero of our childhoods?"
4334,1,More than disappointing,"I'm a big Star Wars fan. But these new movies are a huge let down. The force awakens was 'ok'. Happy to see star wars movies being made again. It was basically a copy of episode IV. Disappointing, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and looked forward to an original story with the last Jedi."
4335,1,Epic Failure,"If you're going to hire someone to make a Star Wars film, the first question really should be, ""Have you ever seen a Star Wars Movie?"" The second should be, "" Did you like it?"" Clearly this director came in with a checklist of possible storylines to dismantle and erase from previous films."
4336,4,what's up with these characters,I'm giving this a higher rating because 1. I love star wars 2. i love rey 3. i love kylo ren because wow.
4337,2,Lazy and careless,"Someone at some point should have stopped this happening before it was released and said this isn't Star Wars and took it back to the drawing board and started again, it would have been better to wait a few more years rewriting this episode than write off the last 40 years releasing it."
4338,2,"Never thought anything would make the prequels look good, but here we are.","I'm not going to write a long review here, because many others have covered the many, many problems with this film. From the weak characters, to the lazy and nonsensical writing, to the total disrespect for the franchise... it's just not a good movie. "
4339,3,The TMP of the Star Wars Saga...,"Long, slow and for the most part - boring."
4340,1,"Poor show, just poor..","Poor plot, mediocre characters, poor continuity and unanswered questions."
4341,3,Let the Past Die,Star Wars Episode 8 The Last Jedi was very boring the acting was far worse in this one the story was flat out boring I didn't like this one at all.
4342,1,Worst Star Wars EVER,"Honestly, I wonder if director Rian Johnson ever watched a Star Wars movie before getting this gig. And J.J. Abrams hasn't done us any favors either as Executive Producer. Like the first seasons of 'Lost', 'The Force Awakens' was brilliant, when Abrams had heavy involvement in the project. Then, just like the last seasons of 'Lost', where they needed to add subtitles just so the audience could figure out what was going on, 'The Last Jedi' seems to have suffered the same fate when Abrams became distracted by other projects and largely delegated creative control of the project. I have never forgiven him for the disappointing conclusion of 'Lost'. Let's hope Abrams doesn't screw this one up the same way with Episode IX."
4343,1,NOT a Star Wars Movie,"The movie has some of the best space action sequences the SW universe has to offer however Rian Johnson has single handedly destroyed everything Luke Skywalker stood for. Luke's legacy and lucas' vision are both a joke now. We are basically left with a poorly written, non-compelling but for no good reason an overpowered female lead who I am sure ""will prevail against all odds"". Wow this isn't a Star Wars movie at all guys. This is just another Disney fairy tale for 12 year olds!<br /><br />Mark Hamill and Luke deserved way better than this!"
4344,1,It hurts me to write this...,"I hate this movie. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan. This franchise has crept into every corner of my life at some point or another, so please believe that I am a fan. I just want to add to the many other voices who have already said it better than I could: this movie is an abomination, shameful and a sin."
4345,1,Maybe the last Star wars movie i will see at the cinema :(,"This movie is summed up by one line repeated a few times in the movie. Let the past die, kill it(I didn't think Disney meant it literally) It had small spurts of good, but at points i wondered whether i was watching spaceballs, or watching Disney butcher my childhood. The crazy pacing, and spectacle based narrative just felt flat, and ultimately underutilized. As much as I wanted to enjoy this, it just didn't come anywhere close to what could have been. Did they even realize they had made TFA? So much that was setup has now been shunned, that's sad. The forced humour in Disney owned IPs needs to stop. It works in marvel(sometimes), but not everywhere, and especially not here. best since empire...............no way"
4346,3,Bad directing.. all around,"I write this as I'm watching the film for the 3rd time. From the anticlimactic reintroduction of Luke to the pansy display of a performance by all characters at the casino plantet, this film is an utter disgrace of the SW franchise."
4347,2,I am here to thank Disney!,"Thank you, Disney.... You da best.<br /><br />For 3 years I was dating this super thin, leggy girl with round breasts and long hair who flaunted her body with micro skirts and heels. Everyone was jealous and she was called a goddess. I would have proposed because she is everything any sane man would want.<br /><br />Well, no. Not true. Disney saved me!<br /><br />After watching The Last Jedi I have been transformed (improved). The Last Jedi is a life changing experience. After watching this i noticed how butch and handsome my girlfriend's brother is and we started dating. I am now in love forever and have proposed. Mr and Mr Eric and Billy will soon tie the knot.Wish us well. Thanks Rian and Kathleen."
4348,2,I Wanted To Like It. I Really Did.,"This is a movie I really wanted to like. I went in with moderate expectations though as to not be disappointed. I still was. It totally ruins the magic that I felt The Force Awakens was able to find. It didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. Shall characters, laughable dialogue, and plotting issues that really bog the entire thing down. "
4349,1,"Worst writing, plotline and story ever created, sad this god screwed so bad.",I cannot believe that the writer and producer couldn't come up with a better story.
4350,1,Terrible waste of money!,What a awful film I am ashamed I spent my valued time watching this rubbish. Being honest I think I would of rather sat on the toilet all day with the worse case of the runs. Star Wars has been turned into some PC garbage. I hope the people that made this filth have eggs thrown at them in the streets. Don't waste your time watch the original PROPER Star Wars films not this 👍🏻
4351,2,Can we just forget this whole mess ever happened?,"This was the first time I'd seen a Star Wars film at the cinema and knew that I didn't like it when I walked out. Often I'll think about a film afterwards and began to question aspects of it and wonder whether they made complete sense, but the plot holes and awful humour just ruined what should have been a great follow up film to The Force Awakens. They were just so obvious while watching that they managed to ruin the film<br /><br />There were a couple of redeeming qualities and a couple of good concepts, but all were poorly executed and left the film in an absolute mess. And don't even get me started about Finn's side quest! That whole segment needs erasing.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to say that I'll boycott Episode IX, because I won't. But I'll wait to see what the consensus of that film is before going.<br /><br />What actually annoys me about this whole mess is that the loose ends which JJ left to be answered were not only ignored, but so very often just ruined in such a way that they can't even be salvaged in Episode IX. So I'm expecting that film to be bad because it has such a mess to work with."
4352,1,Disney 1 - Star Wars 0,Thank you for the comedy. <br /><br />We might see them dance and sing on the 3rd one. <br /><br />Sad time for this most incredible saga of our time.<br /><br />RIP Star Wars
4353,5,I think its one of the most hated movie i have ever seen,"Dont get me wrong, i put 5 out of 10 because the concept and the visuals are good, but the whole movie is trash. I think Ryan Johnson should be ashamed of this movie. The man seriously took everything that we loved about the franchise and threw it away!"
4354,4,A pale and poor imitation of the original and great Star Wars movies,**** Contains Spoilers ****
4355,3,Wasted opportunity.,"Spoilers ahead. Came out of the cinema 2 months ago, my main criticisms at the time, were: "
4356,4,Agree... why this has a good score when its so bad?,"After Episode VII i thought that the new trilogy was going to be awsome but Episode VIII was a huge let down the movie i think it honestly too long and boring the new characters are not likable (specially Rose) and others are forgetable like Holdo and Benicio's DJ (and dont understand how great actors like Laura Dern & Benicio said yes to this movie off course, if i think a symbol, $, i think i just answered my own question)<br /><br />The movie, if you LOOK CLOSELY has some ripoffs from episodes V and VI like Rey arriving to a planet to be trained by Luke, she begins the training but then leaves half-way the training (the same happened to Luke in Episode V with Yoda in Dabobah) and then Rey surrenders herself to Kylo and is taken to meet Snoke and then she ""convinces"" Kylo to turn against Snoke killing him the same happened in Episode VI (!!!) Luke surrenders to Vader and is taken to see Sidius then both turn against it and kills Sidius (come on!) and honestly at some opint i find myself looking at the clock asking ""How much til this ends?!?!"""
4357,2,A Mockery of original triology,"When I told my friends in 2012 when Disney buyed Lucasfilm, that they will destroy original franchise and the name of Star Wars no one believed me but now, as a time passed, more and more people are agreeing with me. I still don't get it how it is possible to make such a bad movie, The Last Jedi is one of the worst movies I have ever watched in my entire life and I have watched a lot of them, I say the same words in 2015 when I watched The Force Awakens but Force Awakens now looks like a solid movie compared to The Last Jedi. With The Last Jedi they has destroyed everything I loved about Star Wars, for entire movie I had a feeling that I am watching a mixture of some new bad Disney cartoon and Star Trek with elements of Spy Kids with Antonio Banderas. The movie is watchable for first half, I love some parts on island planet where Luke is in exile, and yes Mark Hamill is the only one in movie who is really acting, others are really not worth mentioning, they are looking like total clowns, but total letdown starts when John Boyega and Mongol girl are going on some planet like Las Vegas, total disaster, totally unimaginative, and everything is becoming a total mess, and yes Benicio Del Toro in Star Wars movie, it is even not ridiculous, casting crew madr total mistakes, he is very good actor don't get me wrong, but for Star Wars universe definitely not. Then we have part on the main star destroyer and killing of Snoke, Snoke is presented like the most powerful antagonist in the galaxy even more powerful than Palpatine is killed in second, total unimaginative character, we don't even have explanation how he became the leader of new Empire. And for the end we have totally not necessary battle on some salty planet, it looks like bad imitation on Battle Of Hoth, and yes it is finished in 5 seconds, like Rey is finishing her training with Luke, she just take a look on Luke's eyes and after that she can do everything she wants, total disaster. Design of ships and vehicles is also unimaginative, and the whole universe is looking somehow empty and depopulated. We don't get any information who is ruling the core worlds now. I also really miss original alien species, the new ones also look empty. This was definitely the last Star Wars movie I have watched created by Disney, I wanted to give them a chance but they don't get it that Star Wars is not ordinary action/superhero movie, it is whole world with itself with history, mythology and feelings, and they have all erased buy this one. My suggestion is even better to watch Star Wars rebels cartoon than this, it has Star Wars feeling, and Rogue One it was definietely not a good movie, but it feeled like Star Wars. And another message, the real Star Wars will forever live in our hearts and our minds, this was just one bad dream, we still have legends, we have so many great video games, comics and books, and the universe will never die."
4358,1,"Betrays old Stars Wars fans, INTENTIONALLY.","It literally said: ""It's time to let old things die""."
4359,1,Painfully Disappointing,"The reason why it's not that good and that it's hated is because of Disney, they bought Star Wars and Marvel. Don't get it wrong, the Marvel films are good still, but the Star Wars films not so much, they're literally getting ruined by Disney."
4360,1,It's extremely fun,Let me start by recognizing the best movie of the entire saga is The Empire Strikes Back. But I think this entry has now become its second greatest.
4361,1,Too much going on and many things were recycled from previous films,"I'm usually a fan of star wars films, but this film tries to squeeze in too many characters, plots, and recycles old storylines from other Star Wars movies. It's like they analyzed the formula from the old movies and reguritated it. It would be better if they focused on just a few characters and told a smaller story. It needed more depth and character development. Instead it was a wild roller coaster ride with ridiculous concindences, and making sure we saw almost every character possible from previous films, or a similar character (the dinosaur ewok-esque people).<br /><br />I don't normally give bad reviews, but this film doesn't deserve anything higher than a 1.<br /><br />Disney, please make something new - we don't need to see recycled Star Wars."
4362,5,WTF This was supposed to be Star Wars,Can we please get light sabers that actually work and better choreographed scenes like n literally all of the prequel look at the tracing in flipping the phantom menace the amount of training that went into those scenes was a lot and light sabers that will cut limbs off and do more damage to the human/alien species for the love of god please
4363,1,One more One,I really wish I could give this movie zero stars.
4364,2,Commodified fantasy,Following the loss of Ursula K. Le Guin I think her point of view about commodified fantasy is excellent as a review for TLJ and Disney in general.
4365,1,I created an account just to express my disappointment. This movie really SUCKS!,"I cannot believe this movie has 7.4 on IMDB. I went ahead and read some of the 10/10 reviews in here and asked myself: Guys what the heck have you been smoking? This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen, not just the worst Star Wars, the worst movie of them all. They should make an Oscar section for that and this movie should receive the award."
4366,1,Good Job,Rian Johnson ruined the whole saga in 2 hours... no wait. In a few minutes. 
4367,1,Sad. Confused. Angry,"I walked out of the cinema sad, confused and eventually angry."
4368,2,The need to get JJ Abrams in immediately to remake this disaster.,The need to get JJ Abrams in immediately to remake this disaster.
4369,1,This it not star wars,"So I finally watched it again after being so disappointed with it on first viewing in the cinemas. And unlike a fine wine, it has not got better with age. It is a horrible film that attempts to use nostalgia and political agendas the draw the viewers in and give reason for the movie, but it fails miserably."
4370,1,"First 911, Now This!","I have seen many films in my life and only one has made me truly angry. I went in smiling and came out fuming.... Director/writer Rian Johnson didn't understand that he was making a direct sequel to a film as he has now managed to retroactively destroy many plot points from The Force Awakens... It's actually much much worse than Brett Ratner's treatment of X-Men: the Last Stand. A rare feat. Bravo Rian! Where were the signature Star Wars scene transition wipes? Where was the line ""I've got a bad feeling about this""? Are you even a Star Wars fan, Rian? In TFA Finn needed a pilot so he could escape the First Order, yet being set literally days after that event he now has the ability to fly anything with ease. Bravo Rian! In TFA there was a map left by Luke Skywalker so that he could be found if the resistance needed him and now he just tosses lightsabers over his goddamn shoulder. He wants nothing to do with the Jedi anymore even though he wears their clothes and lives on their island. Bravo Rian! The Last Jedi features a lot of underdeveloped/pointless new characters while old characters (from pre-Disney) didn't live up to their potential (Luke Skywalker, Leia, Chewie). Costumes (Such as Holdo's dress) didn't fit the scenes - she's an admiral in a battle wearing a ball gown. A lot of hypocritical actions like Leia pushing responsibility for military deaths onto Poe for actions she had the authority and awareness to stop (when Poe led a successful assault to destroy a lethal threat) or when Rose stopped Finn from committing suicide to protect the resistance and then telling him that the only way to win is to protect the people he loves (which is what he was trying to do and almost did, Rose literally almost got the resistance killed). The internal contradictions in this film are laughable. First Order are childish villains and would be lacking punch if it weren't for the resistance being just as incompetent (First Order are supposed to be a military, yet their general is literally toyed with in the opening scene by an idiot, like an idiot). Old characters are humiliated and killed in the most lacklustre ways. Epic Rey training montage missing. Phasma exists, and then doesn't. Snoke exists, kind of reveals his grand plan, stops existing because Deus Ex Machina. To finish, Canto Bite. Even the morons who defend this film agree that Canto Bite was the worst scene.... This movie had large backing, talent, and still ended up in a state which leaves me genuinely stunned at how badly they f*$ked it up. Bravo Rian! ""Your move, chrome dome!"""
4371,2,#SnokeAndMirrors,"I've never written a movie in my life until now, but as a Star Wars fan for 40 years I felt so betrayed by this movie that I felt compelled to write this. "
4372,1,SWTOR trailers more logical than full Star Wars movie,Star Wars The Last Jedi or How To Reshoot A New Hope.
4373,1,Shame on you,Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring... Nothing interesting in the characters.... Almost fell to sleep....
4374,1,This made Attack of the Clones look like a masterpiece,"The worst starwars film ever made. Why didn't purple hair lady just tell Poe what her plan was at first? Why didn't the rebels use a ship to ram Snokes ship at lightspeed in the beginning? (Put a Droid on the drivers seat). Why is Luke Skywalker a depressed and lonely loser when he himself turned Anakin Skywalker, the most powerful Jedi ever to the light side? Why would he think he couldn't save Ben? Why kill off Luke? Rian Johnson should never touch a starwars film again. Disney needs to start listening to George Lucas and do exactly what he would do with the future films."
4375,1,Luke the Bumbling fool,"So the hero of Star Wars, the Jedi Master, the Man, the myth, the legend and the hero becomes a bumbling fool. And Rey the newbie becomes hero, compassionate and smart? Why? Because its 2017 and this is how movies are made to cater to this PC world of women are better than men, and men are stooges? The plot was egregious. The writers lost the magic and the purpose of good story telling. This movie was garbage. Pure junk. I am ashamed at Disney. crap movie of all crappiness."
4376,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever,"Somehow with the bar being set as low as Attack of the Clones (Episode 2), The Last Jedi is still worse and disappointing. Rian Johnson is the opposite of what the franchise needed as a whole and with Disney giving him an entire trilogy in the near future I'd say Star Wars is dead. I wanted to like The Last Jedi but it just disappointed me every chance it had. The only way to even fix this would be to scrap it all together. Erase it from the 'new canon' and completely redo episode 8. Otherwise I see a grim future for the once beloved franchise."
4377,1,mediocre script.,"I went with low expectations. Somehow, they managed to even go lower! I can't describe how bad it is. It would run up a thesis of 3 volumes!<br /><br />I will not put spoilers but Disney should outsource SW to someone with imagination and a genuine knowledge of the SW universe.<br /><br />It is pathetic, how they are treating legends of SW and how they are introducing new ones, if there are any.<br /><br />The script could have been written better if given to a high Bollywood director who just had 1 ton of tequila. Yes that bad.<br /><br />I feel sorry for Mark Hamill agreeing to this scrip, no wonder Harrison Ford wanted to get killed in the first place.<br /><br />Bottom line, I disagree with everything in the movie. the script, the acting, the plot, the fights (OMG if there are any!!!! reminded me of kung fu panda) and the final outcome!<br /><br />I don't know who to pity more: those who wrote the script with a 5 years old imagination or those acting with a smug face that tells you ""I can't believe I'm in a SW movie!."
4378,1,a modern blockbuster ..with all that entails :barf:,Last Jedi suffers from franchise disease. There is a great deal of action and melodrama-many close ups of faces that are either concerned or sad- but there isn't that much actually happening and no one is in any real danger.
4379,2,"Disappointed, bemused, and confused!!!","Just come back from the cinema, was looking forward to it, and now feeling very deflated. It felt like they only had half script, and instead of sorting it out, they thought they'd just fill it up with benign, unrelated segments. I very nearly walked out when Carrie Fisher started to fly through space like Thor from a Marvel Comic; and after Mark Hamill milked a four nippled extraterrestrial walrus, well!! If your not going to do something properly, don't do it at all!!!"
4380,2,Kathleen Kennedy has lost the plot,And whoever thinks this crap is important.
4381,1,What the HELL,The movie was pointless. What was the point to the movie. So sad of a movie.
4382,1,Criminal,We need to protect our cultural art in the same way we protect areas of natural beauty from corporations who would bulldoze through it.
4383,2,"Failed they have, into exile Disney must go.","Firstly, let me applaud Disney for episode 9. It isn't out yet but my Jedi instinct tells me all you cry babies who hate TLJ will probably go see it because Disney markets the f$#k out of their movies and they'll probably release a perfect trailer that will reel in all the fools like me that were disappointed with TLJ. Now on to the review. "
4384,3,"""Permission to get in an X-wing and blow something up"" -Sums up the movie","Star Wars: The Last Jedi deviates from the homage that was The Force Awakens in narrative and quality. Disney jumped the shark in this disappointing, forced, cartoonish joke. The Force Awakens mashed everything we loved about the originals (albeit, maybe too much) into a modern mix of pop entertainment. The Last Jedi subverts fan expectation in favor of a more logically inept, dramatically empty, and cringeworthy bore. "
4385,1,Star Wars' world is gone for good,"This is the only review I'll post. TLJ sucks in every posible way, it literally destroyed the amazing world created by George Lucas. And you, IMDB, sucks aswell. Do you get money from the studios or what??? I can't understand where did you get more than 7 points for this movie."
4386,1,So bad it's like it was written by a 3 year-old,"The Last Jedi was so bad it felt like it was written by a 3 year old. The Leia flying in space scene was DUMB and STUPID, and the scene where Paige Tico drops the bombs onto the First order Dreadnought in SPACE is not possible."
4387,1,Terrible Writing,"It's clear that Rian Johnson made a movie for himself, not for fans. The writing is terrible, Finn (the co-lead) is sidelined, Poe is wildly out of character (I thought there was a team to ensure that nothing contradicted canon?) and you'll notice that the people of color in this movie are subjected to some of the most violent stereotypical racial violence I have ever seen. Rey is not empowered, she has no storyline and instead is only there to further Kylo's story. Luke is out of character. This entire movie begs the question: What on gods green earth is Kathleen Kennedy doing, and why hasn't Disney fired her already?"
4388,2,"Sigh, what could have been","Just got back from the theater, so this will probably more of a ramble as I process than a well written review "
4389,3,"It's junk and not worth the time, money, or effort to go see it","Seriously Disney, this is he best you could come up with. Bombers???? Really????"
4390,1,"The last meh, sigh.","I avoided all talk about this film before going in as I was so excited for it. I was shocked at how bored I was. It felt like an eternity of missplaced humor, misplaced 'emotional' beats and missplaced energy. So many intriguing character/plotlines set up in TFA are deflated and replaced with nothing. By the time the third act rolled around I cared so little about anything happening on screen. People in my screening walked out and a girl sitting next to me fell asleep... maybe they were just petty fanboys?"
4391,4,On a par with Independence Day 2,"What can I say. This is one of the worst additions to the Star wars franchise!<br /><br />Finn has become the new Jar-Jar Binks! <br /><br />He's scenes are pointless and added nothing to the movie. <br /><br />There's an entire 30 minutes where the director was channeling George Lucas in the middle of the movie, which can only be described as pure dribble.<br /><br />The rebel command can only be described as laughable in their decision making. Which explains why they are losing.<br /><br /> <br /><br />It's just a poor story line by a director that just isn't up to scratch and has made it difficult for the next director to fix the mess he has created."
4392,3,Disney moneymaker,"Mark Hamill should have stuck to his guns and not accepted this version of Luke. We all love the original story, and the prequels gave us a bit more. The Force Awakens was a solid movie (though a rehash in a sense), but The Last Jedi was an insult to both our love of Star Wars, and quite frankly, George Lucas' vision. Anakin was good - then evil - then redeemed. Luke was innocent - then good - and then Anankin's own redemption. This film looks to throw a great hero into a place of abandonment, complacency, and hatred. This movie is not Star Wars."
4393,1,Listen to the user reviews!......aka the fans! Not the shill critics!,"I haven't written a review on here ever but this movie is so bad and so insulting I had to go to this trouble for the first time.<br /><br /> The story doesn't make any sense the characters don't make any sense.<br /><br /> How they let this happen is beyond me. Here's the thing..... this franchise is a Space Opera or if you want to call it a science fantasy. Don't try to teach us any lessons,second guess our wants or subvert our expectations.<br /><br />Just Give us what we want ......that is how you sell tickets and merchandise.<br /><br /> I've got a feeling the merchandise for this movie is not going to sell nearly as much as they were hoping.Im not buying any. <br /><br />Keep Johnson the writer director who did this movie away from this and any franchise!"
4394,2,NOT star wars movie,They should start a new sequel without borrowing the star wars franchise.<br /><br />It will be better without the burden of linking of the origins of the star wars franchise.
4395,3,Not star wars,"Weak storyline, characters that lack character, irrelevant scenes and scripts - star wars is officially dead - felt like I was watching the extra series that shows put out to make more money where the story just becomes pathetic."
4396,1,Disappointing,"I have seen a lot of movies. And a lot of bad movies. And yet i have never felt the need to comment on the movies here. Until now, I used to think the Star Wars franchise was a high end, well thought out, and interesting series. This movie was anything but. Opting to instead tell some sort of symbolic political reflection of the outside world, and going for cheap thrills, cheap comedy, and (admittedly beautiful) cinematics rather than something deeper. There is no deeper character development, there is no deeper symbolic reflection, there is no deeper conflict. It's a shallow movie. Star wars used to be a rival to the lord of the rings franchise now its a marvel copy.<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie to escape reality and be taken to a dimension far, far away, it would be better to watch star trek"
4397,2,Throw me a bone,Look I get it feminism and matriarchy rule the world
4398,1,Awful Waste of Time,"Definitely thought that Chewbacca got dreads, so when I watched this movie and didn't see Chewbacca with dreads, I was bitterly disappointed. In fact, I was livid. Who even were these new characters??? As a die hard fan, I don't appreciate these newbies coming in and acting like they run the place!!!!!!!!!!! UGH!!!!! I cried, not because of the plot, but because it was terrible. In hindsight, I would not have given this franchise any of my money or my time."
4399,1,Welcome to heartbreak,I have tried so hard to like this movie...I have watched it two and a half times.....on the third viewing i walked out on the Luke flashback sequence.
4400,1,Terrible,"Dialogue is cringey, the characters are forgettable, and what they did with Luke Skywalker's arc is unforgivable. The movie feels like a final act to a trilogy not a middle act."
4401,1,"Better than The Force Awakens, but still TERRIBLE","After the awful Episode VII, things could only get better. Barely."
4402,1,Disney's market engagement piece,"A soft sci fi movie thick with backwards logic, pandering, and childish humor that lacks adherence to the rules and motives of the established narrative. A light fan might enjoy it's farcical antics, random action and melodrama. But for most people this market engagement piece for Disney's star wars property is wholly and ridiculously unenjoyable."
4403,1,I would have made a better movie.,"There are plot holes all over the movie and when you include the very bad writting on top you get the ""Last Jedi"" no wonder they sellected this name because they wont be any more ""Jedi"" movies if they continue like this."
4404,1,"Weird how all really bad movies get 7,4 stars on IMDB now?",For a review about the movie go read the thousands of bad reviews written before me.
4405,1,The Unexpected Break-Up.,"Have you ever been in love and out on a special night together, in which you had been looking forward to for a long time? Then you were dumped unexpectedly and left to wonder, what the heck happen? You thought your relationship was solid, built to withstand anything. That was the feeling when I left the theater. It hurts, so ,so bad."
4406,4,Cannot connect with these new characters.,"OK. Here is my summary of STAR WARS - A BAD JEDI movie<br /><br />The movie starts out with an Sprint to T mobile call, which as we all know, has really bad communications. <br /><br />However, this is just a ruse because we all know that the Empire uses Death Star telecom (known as ATT) which is used throughout the galaxy."
4407,1,Turd,Turd<br /><br />This film is turd. <br /><br />This film is massively turd.
4408,3,Worst Starwars Movie too date,"This Is was such a disapointment I don't know where too begin, the writing was Is so lazy. The Prequels weren't good movies but they had a great story, and they had over the top graphics..."
4409,1,Very poor,"Now I'm not a Star Wars fan at all but I'll sit down and watch them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />This one though, I didn't expect it to be so awful.<br /><br />Was such a complete mess I wouldn't even know where to begin.<br /><br />So I can't recommend anyone to waste their time."
4410,1,Another C-Rate Director by Disney,Movie Mood Level: Waiting in the Doctor's Office Lobby When You Were On Time. 
4411,3,Why The Last Jedi is Junk,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie. I was worried about what they would do with Luke and Rey and Snoke and everyone else. I worried about a lot of things, and every worry I had was fulfilled in full, glorious technicolor from Perfect Rey to Sulkey Luke."
4412,1,This isnt Star Wars,"As a star wars fan... this movie was painful to watch... do yourself a favor and just watch any other movie, nothing to see here. They destroyed the characters and anticlimactic."
4413,2,It's getting worse and worse...,"It just keeps getting worse and worse. I'm sorry, but if you can't hire any good writers to make these films then I'm out. Thank god I didn't have to pay to see this. I decided they wouldn't get any more of my money or time about 3 movies ago. I have a good idea, stop making them and start something new. BUT if you have to keep going then at least get out of the Luke/Solo universe. Rogue One was at least watchable."
4414,5,These are the most expensive kids' movies ever made,"My wife and I saw this just last week, when it was really at the very end of its theatre run. From the IMDb vote breakdown I see that women rate this one notably higher than men, in all age groups. But also that male voters outnumber female voters by 7 to 1, which isn't surprising. The median vote is 8/10 but -- no way. If you remove the nostalgia factor and the ""modern myth"" juggernaut status of the Star Wars franchise complete with all the spinoff books and TV -- it just doesn't stand up very well as a movie on its own merit. I give it 5/10 because it's technically very competent, but inside the surface layer of actions and special effects it's an empty shell. There's lots of activity to keep your eyes moving, all the favorite characters get their chances to strut and fret their hour upon the stage, but ..."
4415,1,Avoid the movie! It will ruin your love of star wars,"I've never left a review, I've always found that reviews should be ignored and that you should give all movies a chance. HOWEVER, this film comes under the star wars banner and to put it simply is not a star wars film. It tries to be an action comedy, jokes are thrown at you all the time and I personally found myself not laughing at one. I was sitting there as the film not only contradicts itself (E. G. Failures are the biggest lesson followed by giving up on life and joining the force) but every other star wars film. What can't the force and hyper space solve? I can't think of anything. The space chase an makes zero sense as the first order has ships that it can send ahead at light speed but chooses not to because... Instead of looking for faster ships to evacuate the fleeing resistance ship, the plan was to hack into the tracker of snokes destroyer? No wonder there's only 400 surviving in the resistance at that point. The characters are dull and everyone has a cringey moment cracking wise. There's literally no consequences for any of the characters decisions. Ray goes in to the dark side cave and faces no backlash. The kids openly free the animals in front of there masters and face no punishment. The character that takes over Leia for some reason keeps her flying straight plan a secret (the worst tactic ever btw) a mutiny ensues and nobody strips any one of these weapons and they just hold them there in the middle of a busy hanger for no reason apart from so they can escape easily. For some reason it was a genius move to completely pave over what happened in the force awakens and openly mock dedicated star wars fans by telling the audience how stupid it is. I have no idea how this got through the board room. Probably because they are trying to net the biggest audience possible from the already biggest movie franchise ever. I hope it fails. I won't see another Disney movie. Marvel, Pixar, starwars it all lines the pockets of people who don't care about movies. It's all about money and selling the merchandise. One quick note Rose that character who literally dies and is brought back magically is my least favorite part of the last Jedi. Mary Poppins Leia was stupid but they could of made it work if the rest didn't sell itself out soo much. Also forget using any imagination, it's all spoon fed to you as the movie treats you like an idiot. Hence it has a seen were ray narrates herself and a overlay of the description Luke gives of the force. Starwars #MeToo"
4416,4,Visually deserves its rating. As a whole it does not,"This movie (as expected was visually stunning) but thats about the extent of it. The story, in no way seemed like star wars. It's like they tried too hard to make it seem like the original Star Wars, but without directly copying it. Also, they attempt to add the humor that we see in many of the Marvel films. To top it off, they then throw in R2D2, C3PO, and Chewbacca as an attept to make it seem even more like a star wars film, with them playing no real part in the story at all. At least in the prequel films they stayed true to Star Wars as far as the content. Poor acting aside."
4417,2,What Were They Thinking!,"Good god bruce almighty, its bad! It is beyond terrible. It is a meandering mess and the script, the plot, the dialogue, is on par with the prequels. I swear to you, you could almost believe that George Lucas wrote the script for this, and that's not a good thing, but if he had, I'm sure Lucas would have done a better job at it."
4418,1,Not understandable...,"How the hell can this absolute piece of trash reach 7 Stars??? I am a huge Star Wars fan and even love the prequels, but what they did with this movie is a spitting in the face not only to the fans, but also to people who love film as a medium and not to forget a disrespecting of the characters that accompanied us through decades. Go watch that film and form your own opinion, but I for myself can just say the only thing I saw which was comparatively disappointing and bad written was the GOT final (which was disastrous if you are not familiar with it)."
4419,2,Straight Trash,Quite possibly the worst sequel in cinema history. Not only does Rian Johnson not know Star Wars he literally breaks the universe moving forward. People are petitioning to have the last season of game of thrones redone they should do the same with this pile of garbage.
4420,1,Full of garbage!,Let me start by saying I am also not Russian spam bot and have no political views.
4421,1,Disney please dont ruin our beloved universe,"Half an hour on a casino scene with a chinese girl??<br /><br />One of the strongest jedis in the history die like this and he is interacting from distance???<br /><br />Plot holes like ""who is snok?"" ""where was snok in the first 6 movies"" etc etc.<br /><br />Star war 7 was like a prologue and most of the people was ""ok"".<br /><br />But this is No8 and its so so bad.Please make something that will remind the moder trilogy of star wars(1,2 and my favourite 3 movies)."
4422,1,Disney should not continue with Rian,"Having seen every SW movie on opening night since 1977, I will see Ep9, but if Disney decides to have Rian write or direct anymore, then I will break that 40 year streak. And not only that, but they wouldnt even be rentals.<br /><br />It was too political, broke away too much from canon and the whole Leia Poppins move totally wreaked the movie. And knowing CF passed away, he could have done a simple rewrite to have her swap out with Laura Dern.<br /><br />Having taken each movie on its own merits, I have enjoyed every one, except Ep8. Again, breaking from canon, scenes that were really far fetched (even by SW standards), trying to turn SW into a comedy movie, and a lack of story/plot has destroyed Rians credibility. If you havent seen it, dont bother."
4423,2,Bad Movie,"I was so looking forward to this movie. To see the return of Luke, to see them build on some of the things JJ started in TFA (a movie which I thought was a 5 of 10). TLJ killed absolutely everything in the SW universe. Let me start by just saying the humor is absolute garbage. ""Yo Mama"" jokes in the opening 2 minutes, Luke milking a sea cow, wtf man. Then there is the whole bomb dropping scene in...yea space."
4424,4,This is not the Director you're looking for.,"What is this film trying to do? I thought it was a hot mess. It had some great things in it (pretty much everything Rey and Luke; some of Kylo's stuff, some space fights) but a larger proportion of things (slapstick, poor cgi, nonsensical plotting, underwritten AND overwritten characters, overlong) that were truly woeful. If the criticism of TFA being too like ANH was equivalent to asking for central heating and getting a lovely antique wood burning fire fitted instead, TLJ is like the fitter listening to your concerns, then coming back and setting fire to the whole house. 4 out of 10. and thats generous!"
4425,2,Incoherent stupid political garbage,"A complete disgrace to the franchise, but what else is new. So much make so little sense. And what did you do to Luke! Damn you Disney / Kennedy.... Damn you"
4426,1,The critics are wrong,Why are their so many positive critical responses to this film? 
4427,1,The film that killed the franchise,The story had way too many plot holes and was not true to previous films.
4428,1,Poor,Kiss my taint. Kiss my taint. Kiss my kiss my kiss my taint.
4429,1,Awful,"It was totally wasting of time. All scenes were predictable which ends with main characters victory. it hasnt impress me at all, such disgraceful to the legendary saga. i even chose the dark side in this movie."
4430,2,Toss It,"This entire film, how it treats the legacy, how much thought & effort the director and team put into this film....can all be summed up perfectly by the character allegedly Luke Skywalker, taking the iconic lightsaber from Rey and tossing it off the cliff over his shoulder. That scene summed up the entire film. Could say it summed up both TFA & TLJ. Only after watching the entire rest of this fubar did I understand that scene in the beginning. Maybe the writing/directing of that scene is more clever than I give credit for."
4431,2,Sith Apprentice And Master,Based on this film I am scratching my head whether Rian Johnson is the master or JJ Abrams. Always two there are!<br /><br />In this film bombs drop in the void of space! A puffed up oriental chick auditions for Ghostbusters 2016 and the audiences lap it up!<br /><br />Oh my!
4432,1,Worst star wars movie.....by far.,"Zero plot - 3/4ths of the movie is just a ridiculous chase, Luke was a complete joke, Snoke turned out to be nothing, lots of unimportant sub-plots, and one of the most idiotic dialogs and not just in star wars movies. Just a dull, mediocore, way too long movie. I really dont know where will they begin part 9 from this..."
4433,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever,This movie is a total betrayal to the original Star Wars. It destroyed Luke's character and jammed unnecessary SJW crap down our throats. Worst Star Wars movie ever!
4434,2,Save The Animals!,"Nothig better than taking a half hour out of the movie to have an annoying side character save stupid animals. Last I checked this was Star Wars, not Free Willy."
4435,1,Not Star Wars,Rian Johnson systematically tears down everything that George Lucas built and the fans have come to love for so many years. Without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie in history and really should be completely withdrawn from Canon. This movie is infested with liberal politics and draws away from what everyone loves in Star Wars. This movie has so much potential to be great but it was just tossed away. Really sad for all Star Wars fans to have to endure.
4436,1,Terrible absolutely terrible,Im a massive star wars fan but I never liked this movie at the cinema I tried again to watch it today and found myself fast forwarding through it then eventually turned it off just so disappointed with pretty much everything about the movie I think it just doesn't work. Terrible comedy show
4437,1,"Boring, Not Really worth watching","Like The Force Awakens the film leaves me apathetic. I don't hate it, but I didn't enjoy it either. It's well made visually, but ultimately feels very shallow. Rey is still a perfect mary sue that can do no wrong. Kylo is still a whiny emo man child who hates everything and everyone. Snoke is wasted. Luke is kinda diminished as a character in this. The story surrounding Finn/Poe/Leia/Rose feels so pointless, like it busy work until they move to the ""arena"" to watch the spectacle of the ending. There are good bits here in there, but they seem to ultimately serve a anticlimactic and boring conclusion that doesn't do much in moving the plot anywhere far after the ending of the last movie."
4438,2,Takes the lazy plotting and characters of TFA and makes it even worse,"The Force Awakens, as covered in my other review, was a lazy rehash of the original Star Wars movies that didn't even bother with creating a compelling or even logically consistent backstory for it's war among the stars."
4439,1,It is time for Star Wars... to end.,"Disney really ruined Star Wars. I'm profoundly sad, as a fan so deeply connected to the original trilogy since immemorial times of my life.<br /><br />I agree when I hear people saying ""this is no longer Star Wars"". It really isn't. It's just bad movies BASED ON the original story of Star Wars.<br /><br />Disney makes the prequels look nice."
4440,1,Just Awful.,Really? Didn't anyone watch this movie before allowing it to be released? 
4441,1,Just horrible,Realy bad movie. Takes a huge dump on the Star Wars franchise.
4442,1,How to sink one of the most profitable franchises of all time...,"This movie is a complete dumpster fire. The tone is set from the very beginning when we see General Hux, who was a threatening villain in The Force Awakens, reduced to a bumbling clown. Remember the high note The Force Awakens ended on when Rey handed Luke his father's light saber? I can't say I like what happened when he took the light saber, but wow were my expectations subverted! So I guess that makes it brilliant? <br /><br />Speaking of subverting expectations, "
4443,1,"Horrible, illogical, disappointing and lazily written","The Last Jedi is a horrible and unending disappointment. A complete fail for a Star Wars movie. It is unimaginative, underworked, uncaring, unappreciative, unmoving and soulless. We can only conclude that the director is untalented, negatively deceptive, lazy and insulting. His work gives the impression that he hasn't left his school, that his homework is only an accumulation of copy paste from different pages he found on the internet, that he is someone who would just learn the minimum required to pass a mock test and that he is a young anarchist giving no importance to respect and good conduct. An uneducated person.<br /><br />The Joker he is not, because even that character in the DC universe has a lot more personality, style and cunning.<br /><br />A, sadly, very bad follow up to an already doubtful and wavering first sequel (Episode 7). One that will be nearly impossible to save from further disaster."
4444,1,The 'Dark Side' have won!!!,"I've never written a film review before, but in this instance I feel I must say something. This film was an absolute disgrace, it wasn't just a bad Star Wars film but a bad film in it's own right. I feel strongly that people need to stop supporting these type of corporate movies if the writing, scripts and plots are this bad. If i'm being constructive I liked the beginning and the soundtrack, the rest....I have no other words. For the first time of seeing a film I actually want a refund."
4445,1,Worst Star Wars film. as the actors and fans were deceived by Disney.,"I watched this movie with an open mind, even though I had read and seen reviews online. I am very sorry I went to see this movie and gave Disney my hard earned money. There were so many plot holes and problems with this film that I am amazed the actors did not speak up more to tell the writer and director to make changes so the film could be greater. Kylo never does anymore training with Snoke. Rey suddenly becomes a more powerful Jedi in a few days by doing things on her own. Yoda arrives and turns the Jedi beliefs into nothing with burning down a tree. Luke is made out to be a bitter, old Jedi who makes jokes that don't fit him. Rose and Finn go to a planet and spend way too much time in a casino, jail, and on social justice issues while their resistance friends are being killed off and time is running out. Leia flies through space and then is in a coma?The newly found resistance base has no other way out?! No way! Look at the original trilogy and you will see that the leaders had plans in case they were found by Darth Vader. What I ended up feeling after I watching this movie is that Disney and the writer/director pocketed a lot of money by using and deceiving the original actors of Star Wars and many fans. I will not be going to the next Star Wars film."
4446,1,Mocking fans?,"Episode VII was far from masterpiece, but it was very intriguing: they raised several questions that generate hundreds of fan theories, some of which were pretty elegant. Who were Rey's parents? Why she is so strong in force? Who is Snoke? How Rey related to Luke if he's not her father? Is there something special about Anakin's lightsaber? There was a huge potential to make some very unusual interesting twisted plot from this."
4447,1,Worst Star Wars movie ever,"I'm not one of those people who say tha TLJ ruined my childhood, and my dislike for the movie has NOTHING to do with the leading hero being a female because Rogue One is one of my favorite movies of all time and Jyn was my favorite character in the movie. My disdain towards this movie comes from the MANY plot holes, the unnecessary and cringe worthy ""comedy"", the 40 minutes of boredom that came from the casino scene, the wasted characters such as Snoke, Luke and Phasma, the Leia poppins scene, shirtless Kylo Ren, Rose thinking that saving the Resistance was second to saving a herd of horses and stopping Finn from sacrificing himself, Rey's parents being nobodies and finally the fact that Rian Johnson wrote and directed this movie as if The Force Awakens never happened and instead told the story as if TLJ was a stand alone movie and not the sequel that it was. Because Disney thought it was a good idea not to use the same director throughout the series, we now have this disaster of a trilogy which is nothing more than a bunch of ideas, that make no sense, all jammed together... And thats why this movie has a 47% audience rating that's still dropping."
4448,1,Worst star wars film yet,"As a star wars film, its horrible and riddled with plot holes. Obviously the staff aren't fans and don't know anything about the characters. <br /><br />It was as if a horrible script was handed to a good director. It was visually pleasing and the crew was great but the story was appalling. <br /><br />As a huge fan I don't even consider this canon. Every person I talked to was equally displeased. C- , I am so upset."
4449,4,Go See Solo,The Last Jedi had all the elements to be the best SW film since Empire and redeem themselves from the dreadful Force Awakens. 
4450,4,Please do NOT waste your money on this.,"This is my first ever review, having voted on at least 1000 movies."
4451,5,If you like explosions in space,"I gave it a five because it's not a terrible movie, it's just not a real Star Wars movie. I mean, the actors are doing a great job, there's a lot of cool effects and you get nostalgic to see Mark Hamill as Luke again, but you can feel that Disney has brought their ""magical"" touch and PC into this one. When I go to see a movie, and especially a sci-fi/adventure one, I want to have an escape from reality and just leave real world problems outside, too bad that the last jedi couldn't give me just that..."
4452,5,"Neither Great, Nor Terrible, The Last Jedi is Oddly Anti-Star Wars","I have written about my absolute disdain for Disney's Star Wars on the basis that I find it immoral to highjack an author's story for the purpose of building a brand. There is no getting around that. But I'm open to viewing Disney's fan-fiction as just that. And there is nothing keeping me from judging them as films, and not personifications of corporate greed and creative bankruptcy. And so, I sought out The Last Jedi. What I found was a film that was neither the masterpiece some claimed it to be, nor the failure others did. Instead, Episode 8 left me feeling a dull indifference about a property I thought I loved. Much like the latest Pirates of the Caribbean misfire, I walked out wondering if I actually did love Lucas' movies. Because The Last Jedi is prefixed, 'Star Wars', and it does follow familiar characters, but it felt alien. Like it was trying not to be Star Wars with the same transparent effort that The Force Awakens had trying to imitate it."
4453,3,Poorly written abuse of cannon,"Everything in this film goes out of its way, to crap on the cannon and themes of all the franchise. Monastic tradition is gone, good versus evil is gone, all the characters from prior movies are rudely shoved to the side. Even the new characters are given terrible arcs - no depth, no development no explaination. The plotting is also terrible.<br /><br />3 stars because its pretty."
4454,1,Why??!!,"It is hard to write this review due the massive and honestly, this very perplexing new addition to the Star War universe. Before I begin, here is my history with Star Wars. I first saw Star Wars in the theater in 1977 and was completely mesmerized by what George Lucas had created. The cast not only had chemistry but both strong male and female characters working TOGETHER as equals (with some friction at times, which makes it all the more interesting). I was also enthralled by the canon of the Star War Universe which Lucas created. I read many of the books that followed as well and found many of them equally entertaining. So that is my ""starting point"" so to speak."
4455,2,I can't even tell where the store is going.,"This is a terrible example of a Star wars movie, I can't believe Ryan Johnson can make such a horrible movie with a normal plot holes in it and random fixes to force the narrative. I had to take a break multiple times while watching this for how inconsistent and absurd the story was forced into a direction. I wasn't surprised to see that there has been zero effort in developing any of the characters so far."
4456,2,Force Awakens - RUINED.,"A complete blunder of a film, ""The Last Jedi"" fails to capture the true essence of the Star Wars franchise. Director and writer Rian Johnson stumbles through an obvious plot line with incoherent editing and far too many jokes. Star Wars isn't a comedy flick Rian. Great actors like Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley struggle showing us their true thespian colors attempting to bring to life a script that feels like it was written by a 12 year old. The entire rhythm of the movie is just wrong. The battle scenes are unsatisfactory and plain, there is far too much fan service and no true content or meaning. The art has disappeared. They might as well have brought back Jar Jar binks. This fan is epically disappointed."
4457,5,Visually: 10/10 - Everything else sucks.,Visually: 10/10 - everything and more my inner 1959 fan/self could have wanted. Possibly the best of the bunch.<br /><br />Script: Competent re-hash of everything we've seen before made acceptable by improved tech and the above.<br /><br />Dialog: Insipid - is there a filter to remove just the dialog?<br /><br />Fathiers are cool.
4458,1,Strong Female Character!,Avoid this Title. There is Strong Female Character starring and all males are emotionally disturbed and she needs to tell them what to do. Star Wars cannon is disturbed by the force by this Title.
4459,1,Social Justice Wars: The Last Feminist,"If you can imagine your sister piloting star fighters, your mother ordering seasoned soldiers around and your grandmother giving sage advice then this movie is for you. However, if you wanted to see Luke prove what it is to be a bad-ass Jedi then you have the wrong film."
4460,2,Disney Wars: 3 Episode 8,"What a mess, At parts I thought it was going somewhere, Lowers the bar, Not excited for the next one."
4461,4,"""We've lost the spark""","Leia accurately summarizes the state of Disney film-making. While, as a big-budget mainstream picture, it's incapable of being offensive or terrible, The Last Jedi tries so hard to be appealing to so many audiences that it never gets around to being good."
4462,1,Something isn't right here...,"As the most die-hard Star Wars fan who saw Episode 7 as a brilliant movie, I cannot for one second understand how this is 'The best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back'."
4463,1,DISNEY KILLING AND HUMILIATING STAR WARS,"Man o man... As a true Star Wars fan, I was extremely excited about the trailer and after the ripoff of TFA I had regained trust with trailers from TLJ that things would get better... The trailers suggest that Rey gets a kick ass hard training by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who is determined to restore the peace in the Galaxy after the will of the Force brought Rey to him just after the First Order blasted so many planets to dust...But no, he is an afraid old man and is whining all movie long that he wont do anything. I thought he would have discovered that being a Grey Jedi, fyi Jedi that find a balance between dark and light, is the right way to bring balance in the Force and that he would learn Rey to do so and eventually get Kylo Ren to understand. But NO. Disney doesn't give a crack. It's all about children watching that want to buy the toys."
4464,2,not that good,This film kinda ruins luke the story is horrible over all. The mouse ruined this trilogy. GARBAGE FILM.
4465,1,Total disaster,"As a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy I hated this movie.<br /><br />Especially all the bad attempts at being ""funny"". I don't want a Star Wars movie that has jokes for little 3yr-olds.<br /><br />Just stop all this stupid slapstick nonsense when it isn't even funny."
4466,1,Ruined Luke Skywalker,This movie ruined Luke Skywalker. Pretty much sums it up. I'd rather they never made this movie.
4467,1,"Star Wars is Dead. RIP (And that's not the worst of it), continued","In the Last Jedi we have already examined the sad demise of Luke, although his twin sister remained strong, centered, wise, and maintained her hygiene. The demise of Luke is not just symbolic of the demise of his religion, it is also symbolic of the demise of white males as well. Men are weak. Even Jedi.<br /><br /> Men are also evil. All the space Nazis who worked for the Alt Right First Order except one were white men. All Sith were men, mostly white. When Finn and Rose were in jail on the casino planet, they were betrayed by their shady collaborator, another white guy.<br /><br /> Men are dumb. All the men did something stupid. Luke tried to kill his nephew. Finn tried to escape the Resistance but was luckily prevented by the Asian girl, Rose. The First Order commander, Hux, was not only a space Nazi, but an idiot. The Supreme bad guy, Snoke, who could twirl Rey around like a rag doll, who could create a mind meld between Kilo and Rey even though they were half a galaxy apart, got killed because he wasn't paying attention to the light saber right next to him, which Kilo activated and used to cut him in half. <br /><br /> Then there is Poe. He was the closest thing to a male hero but was a special kind of dumb; all hormones, no brains. He was a daredevil pilot but his insubordination cost lives. At the beginning of the film his heroics were largely responsible for the destruction of the dreadnought, but also half the Resistance fleet, so he was demoted by General Leia. Later, while Leia was apparently dead, he was bypassed for command by Admiral Holdo, a friend (possibly lover) of Leia. Poe, when introduced to her, (how could he have not already known her) made a rude, sexist comment, because that's how men are, even long ago, in a galaxy far away. She then proceeded to upbraid him up and down, calling him a ""flyboy,"" a speech so emasculating that I think even most feminists cringed. She then showed herself to be weak and indecisive, and in the face of massive casualties and no apparent plan for escape, Poe led a mutiny. The audience are all pleased, because clearly this purpled-haired space-witch didn't have a clue, and its time for some good, old fashioned testosterone to get a hold of this situation. But Leia was miraculously revived, (ridiculously) saw the situation, stunned Poe, and reinstated Holdo. It turned out Holdo did have a plan, she just didn't condescend to tell anybody, and after the plan to evacuate the main ship was executed, she ensured everyone's safety by using her doomed ship to ram the First Order vessel at light speed in a kamikaze attack. She died a martyr and a matron of cool wisdom. So, for a while we were made to think that male leadership somewhere on the side of the good guys might help. But in the end, we were proven wrong. Punked again.<br /><br /> Resistance leadership in the Last Jedi looks like an almost total matriarchy; all leaders are women, all women are smart, all women are good. Cue Helen Reddy. Men are all bad and/or incompetent/insubordinate. This matriarchy is far more thoroughgoing than the supposed patriarchy seen in the previous Star Wars films. Oh well, payback time. But besides being misandrist, it's also unrealistic and unbelievable. <br /><br /> The silliness reached its apogee when Finn, despite violating the orders of the now tamed Poe, proceeded on a suicide mission to fly his space jalopy into the giant energy weapon battering ram that would destroy the last Resistance fort and completely wipe out all the Resistance. Just as he was about to finish his kamikaze mission he is bumped off course by his new love, Rose, who later explains, ""we will win this war not by destroying what we hate, but by saving what we love."" How sweet. PRIMAL SCREEEEEAM. Seven Star Wars movies have featured space cowboys, and a few cowgirls, who did nothing but blow up things they hate, like battle cruisers, dreadnoughts, DEATH STARS etc. against great odds IN ORDER TO SAVE THE ONES THEY LOVE. If not for the unexpected intervention of Luke right after that, Rose saving Finn would have ended the Resistance FOR ALL TIME. <br /><br /> The matriarchal leadership in this movie was hands down the most cautious and passive we've ever seen in a Star Wars movie. You'd think they would have avoided that stereotype. Demoting Poe after he single-handedly took out the Dreadnought defenses for example, or Admiral Holdo sitting around watching most of the Resistance get killed as the escape craft got destroyed one by one. The last attack getting called off even though, unlikely as its success might have been (aren't all rebel attacks almost impossible) it was the only chance for the Resistance to survive. Never before in a Star Wars film had the good guys taken such a terrible beating. They are down to a dozen or so fighters, no vessels. What? Where's General akbar? Oh yeah, they wasted him.<br /><br /> The President of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, goes around in T shirts saying, ""The Force is Female."" No, it is not. It has no gender. It never did.<br /><br /> There are other Cultural Marxist elements in this movie. In a pointless foray onto a casino planet we see the filthy rich (white people) exploiting child slave labor and animals. All they do to get so rich is sell weapons and all they do with the money is waste it. Moral: rich people are disgusting, capitalism is pure exploitation.<br /><br /> So where does Star Wars go? <br /><br /> I believe that eventually Kilo and Rey follow the path that Kilo is on and that Luke and Yoda have suggested; to forgo the past and blaze a new path. They will bring peace to the galaxy by merging the dark and light side of the force, creating a gray Force, if you will. The redemption of Kilo will come, not from the love and forgiveness of the Force directly, as in the case of Anniken Skywalker, but the redeeming love of a woman, Rey. Of course, this reconciliation of good and evil is a Nietzschean doctrine, which, as much as Luciferianism, denies the existence of absolute morality. Assuming this scenario is right, this love will be so beautiful, and so powerful, that anyone who suggests that sexualizing the Force cheapens it will be considered a fanatic. And after all, sex IS God in our society today. Sex is the real Force, not that metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. How can Star Wars continue with celibate heroes in this day and age. <br /><br /> But then what? When Superman made love to Lois Lane he lost his powers. But that won't happen in Star Wars. Young Anniken and Padme already proved that. Of course, in the original Star Wars, Anniken's broken Jedi vows were part of his downfall.<br /><br /> What will the politics of the Star Wars galaxy look like after Rey joins with the Dark Side? A compromise, of course. Not quite a free republic, not quite an evil empire, but a benevolent dictatorship run by a wise and loving, bi-partisan Sith-Jedi co-""Presidency."" It will be a new Galactic Order, a New World Order if you will. If we just have a properly engineered, kinder, gentler dictatorship run by the right people, and if everyone obeys, then we can usher in a millennium of peace and prosperity, just as Darth Vader promised. But unlike Darth's this empire will be run by the gray Force. it will combine the best of both Sith and Jedi, good and evil; beyond good and evil. But ultimately when good allies itself with evil, or tries to transcend good and evil, there is no moral principle binding or limiting a government formed on that basis except the prerogatives of power. In the end, the Sith, Jedi coalition would not be much different than rule by the Sith. There would be nothing to stop the gray Force from becoming ever and ever darker over time. I think the Jedi knew that. ""I will never Join you"" young Skywalker said, in a more innocent time. So, if this is the direction of the new Star Wars, in a subtle way, the Last Jedi is slowly shifting our allegiance from the Jedi way to that of the Sith we had been led to despise.<br /><br /> There still remains one possible way to salvage the traditional myth. Although Yoda tried to burn the ancient texts, it turns out that Rey actually purloined them, although you only see this in about ten frames of film. Furthermore, Luke told Kilo at the end that the Resistance and the Jedi would continue. Perhaps Rey will maintain the purity of Jedi mysticism by intense study, and maybe, possibly, the Luke who dematerialized into the Force can, reinspired by his ethereal sojourn, rematerialize to guide young Rey. Or perhaps he and Yoda can give her mental guidance as she rediscovers the ancient truths. She can then, Joan of Arc-like, pick up her saber and lead a revitalized, spiritually awakened Resistance, start a new Jedi order, and restore Truth and Force-realization to the whole Galaxy. Perhaps she can convert Kilo, the way Luke converted his grandfather. Or perhaps, as Luke foresaw, he must die. Either way truth will again triumph over evil and the true balance in the force will be restored. Then, that desecration of Star Wars known as the Last Jedi will have been a mere detour, and it will have been the critics like myself who got punked.<br /><br /> Not likely."
4468,1,The worst star wars film,"The writing in this film is unbelievably bad. There's no logic to it, no subtlety and no wisdom. There's bad jokes and over the top nonsense all the way through.<br /><br />You might be thinking that sounds like Star Wars, but I can assure you this is 10x worse."
4469,1,Disney had a boardmeeting and they wrote a movie...,"So when Obi-Wan Kenobi told Luke ""The force will be with you, always"", I am now to believe Disney and Rian Johnson that ""always"" only extended to Part VIII..."
4470,1,Dear Disney,"You had to ruin this film and all it stands for, it's a shame you didn't have any planning for this and you just went on and simply destroyed some iconic characters such as Luke and Leia, you really had to consider renaming this movie to the destruction of Skywalkers. I think George Lucas will rest now as he managed to make every Star Wars fan love him and the prequels again."
4471,3,Gave it some time....,"And it was still weak. Weak in plot, weak in character development, and weak in dialogue. I have watched the original trilogy well over 100 times each. The prequels, dozens of times, and even the force awakens over 10 times. I've read the EU as well as the new canon. There is no connection between those movies, those stories, and this movie. Rian Johnson just cannot tell a story. No real Star Wars fan cares about blue milk, they care about Rey, Luke, Ackbar, and a good story. RJ challenged nothing, he just turned the movie into a political statement. The""brilliant"" admiral holdo comes up with using light speed for the first time to destroy a ship? Ridiculous. Even if I could get by that, it should have been ackbar, not some random woman, just to be a woman. Leia? Why have her use the force for the first time in a scene that reminds everyone of Mary poppins. The whole scene about ""mansplaining"" is ridiculous. It goes on and on. RJ should just not be allowed to direct movies, any movies."
4472,2,GARBAGE,Complete Dumpster Fire. They single handedly destroyed Star Wars in one movie. The saddest part is I no longer care what they come out with next. I just have lost all curiosity about the universe.
4473,1,Rain Johnson does not deserve to work in Hollywood,There is so much wrong with this film it is even funny. and it doesn't help that the Director along with several employees at Lucusfilm harassed people on line for not liking the film itself.
4474,1,"The worst Star Wars movie yet - yes, even worse then episode 1",My main issues:
4475,1,And I finally watched it....,"For free of course, although my initial reaction after knowing all the facts was swearing never ever to watch it.<br /><br />But there it is... I did it and I have to say it is not so terrible when you realise it is just a movie like others. That's the positive and also the huge negative... it is supposed to be STAR WARS., not just your regular blockbuster."
4476,3,"Not bad as a stand alone film, terrible as Star Wars.","I am a life long Star Wars fan, from having the toys as a kid to the wallpaper that covers my dining room now (no joke) I love it, so it pains me to say I have just left the cinema rather dissapointed."
4477,2,Disgraceful to Luke's legacy,"This movie has completely neutered one of the best fictional heroes of all time. The hyperspace scene looks pretty but completely breaks canon, and the casino scene lasts far too long without any meaningful impact."
4478,1,"How can you be the ruling governmental body and still call yourself ""the rebellion""?","There are two was to look at this film. One, as a standalone film that has nothing to do with anything and two, as a film that assumes to shoulder the responsibility of thirty plus years of history, fandom and anticipation."
4479,1,So much potential.....,I have never left a review in my whole life but feel compelled to here.
4480,2,Might have been mediocre if not for the continuity errors and the weak subplots that basically served to shove propaganda down my throat,"Following the Force Awakens, which was largely a rehash of Episode IV, one might have thought that The Last Jedi would be a lot like Empire. While that is somewhat true, The Last Jedi also clearly attempts to take the series in a bold new direction. However, this move leads to two main problems: a) the movie shows a total lack of respect for the previous movies as well as the universe they constructed and therefore has several continuity errors and b) the 'new direction' is not very exciting, nor very new. "
4481,1,Over in 5 mins,Why did the empire's ships not just warp to in front of the resistance ship and blow it up?
4482,1,Less than 1 - blah,Lame. Very lame. You will not care about any of the characters - there was no connection.
4483,5,Star wars is burnt,"My feelings about Star wars are disappointing. I feel they have burnt this universe without giving the best of it. As well as we have seen the best comic adaptations in Marvel, in Star wars we've witness how they wasted great universe once and another time. Precuels where disgusting, and these secuels are not getting better"
4484,5,Really not great.,"This once again shows that the critics have lost the plot, and that they'll throw out high ratings to anything Disney dumps out on our screens. The plot was filled with problems and the movie prefers to stand alone rather than develop the series as a whole. "
4485,1,Absolute irrefutable proof that Critics Reviews are bought and paid for.,Critics Review average 8/10<br /><br />User Review average 2/10
4486,1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!,"I am still stunned at how jaw droppingly awful The Last Jedi is. It truly is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! No character development, nonsensical plot, poor continuity (e.g. the Resistance stated that being tracked through hyperspace was impossible, yet the Millenium Falcon was tracked through hyperspace in Ep.IV), plagiarisation of the previous films, etc, etc, etc. I can't believe how this pile of sh*te ever managed to make it to the screen. No doubt that Disney will keep the Star Wars gravy train a-rolling, but I for one won't be boarding again!"
4487,1,Awful,"Everything in this movie was horrible, flat, and is hard to finish watching. What Rian Johnson did to Luke Skywalker is unforgivable. This man should not write or direct anything ever again."
4488,1,How does this movie have over 3 stars?,A complete mystery to me why the critics praised this movie? Were they all paid off by Disney?
4489,2,Listened to The director Rian johnston on the radio,"Go on and on about his love for Jesus Christ, Trump and of course Mary!! and I am not shocked this movie sucks so much. The morality is forced and doesn't belong. It is nice that they tried to introduce diversity with all races and sizes but the actors and actresses are not good to begin with. Hence the problem!!"
4490,2,Epic Failure,"The Last Jedi, which came out a couple of months ago, was released on DVD, and Blur-ray, so I had time to analyze it. I was disappointed with how they treated Leia. She should've felt horrible still, because she lost her husband forever. BB-8 is able to do anything in this movie. Rey is just annoying in this movie, and so much potential in this movie was ruined. I'm going to start with what I Thought was the worst. Crait. The lightsaber battle should've happened. Instead of making something lame, because everyone likes lightsaber battle, you just had to make an illusion of Luke. Leia should've died, because you can't survive in space like that. When I saw that flight, I was so mad, and was thinking of supercalifragilisticecspialidocious. I wanted to be y-wing light bombers, and wanted to see more action with the space battles. The similarity between 5 and 8 is true. Resistance /Rebels are fleeing from the pursuit of the First Order/Empire, while the force user is going to a person in exile, and they refuse to train that person for a while, until they can understand why they want trained. That adventure on Kantobite was something I did want think was necessary. Just find the person, and get out. That man that was in it for the money? Exactly like Lando. I wanted to see Lando, Lando was awesome. I don't care if he ""died"", bring him back! He could be in the Outer Rim. ANd why wouldn't they answer to the distress call? They were all allies! Wish the music was a little more creative in some parts. One of the worst things, Vice Admiral Holdo, or Honda is what I like to call her, completely ruined my thoughts of the movie. Ackbar, who has been with the Alliance, for a long time, made good memes, and knows when there was a trap. Ackbar should've been put as the one in command. You should've kept him alive, because he was something original. Yet you decided to Mary Poppins and kill every original male character. I was completely disappointed after seeing the potential of this movie just obliterated by the massive lack of logic, exclusion of original characters, killing off all of the original males, feminism, SJWs, etc."
4491,1,"First draft level, diabolically poor storytelling and no substance","From the very outset of the movie the opening title crawl is loaded with poorly thought out sentences which contradict themselves and feels like a first draft rush-job. Perhaps the greatest let down is that the movie comes across as novice story telling from the initial title crawl and the lack of flow and development just doesn't engross the viewer (no suspense, no real threat, no reason to continue watching). Odd for a Star Wars movie, it features very unconvincing villains who are established as ""merciless"" and without-substance-heroes who aren't really threatened by a merciless enemy because the enemy is a comic failure . The old Star Wars characters are dealt with as though the writer isn't familiar with them and the ""story"" ends with no cliff hanger and the viewer is left with absolutely no reason to see the next episode.<br /><br />It's the first Star Wars movie I've ever experienced the feeling that if I left my cinema seat to go for a coffee and take my time coming back that I would have missed nothing of worth. My wife and my children actually fell asleep at around the 20 minutes point and they were loaded with popcorn and slushies! I stayed awake but was fighting the urge to just get up and go because I thought I owed it to myself to see it to the bitter end in order to wait to see if it would improve. It didn't and it just became sillier. If I could describe the movie in one word then ""missable"" fits best."
4492,1,Only an idiot with no understanding of SW or basic school science could like this mess.,"There is so much wrong with this movie:<br /><br />-Tons of plot holes. Too many to get into.<br /><br />-It contradicts the other movies without justification. It ignores the lore, the characters and the politics of the previous movies.<br /><br />-The writer clearly doesn't understand the basic science needed for a movie set in space. For example, you see bombs dropping towards a ship rather than a nearby planet. Also, you see multiple characters unsuited in the vacuum of space without getting fried with radiation, swelling up etc."
4493,4,I really wish this is all just a bad dream!!!!,"I always prefer reading the reviews, but this is the first time I'm taking my time to write a review. Honestly I'm the only Star wars fan among all my friends and I've been waiting for 2 years for this movie. "
4494,5,When a Jedi makes a long distance phone call he runs out of minutes?,"Inside joke, that will be really funny to you after viewing the film. Or you'll hate me for it, and all the many things they did wrong with Star Wars. For starters the film still fails to establish Kylo Ren as a monumental threat, his character simply seems to devolve throughout the film, and further shows what a whiny child he is. Mark Hamill's acting is awesome as expected, but the writing for his character leaves a lot to be wanted, especially towards the end. Ray remains unlikable although her acting seems to have improved a lot from the 7th entry (Open eyes wide... all the time... Now this is acting!). I struggled to like any of the characters throughout the film, and any scenes with significant impact were greatly soiled by all the misplaced humor throughout the film. When the film ended I walked out in awe at what the film could have been, and what a great missed opportunity it was. The film could be worse sure, but it fails to be a decent Star Wars film, and with the sub-par writing it failed to even feed into my nostalgia, even with all the starpower of Mark Hammil throughout the film, it failed to do much with his character, and was overall a major disservice to its large and dedicated fanbase."
4495,2,I don't know. I'm still at a loss and I will likely pass on XI at least at the theatre,"1. The Luke who ended his training to save his friends. Who stubbornly believed his father would turn to the light... Was like Han who? My sister's in danger? Meh. ""I can't save him"" when it is made clear he's conflicted. The character was so off in this movie. It just was not Luke Skywalker they should have just had him turn to the darkside."
4496,4,Train wreck of a film,"What can I say? Rian Johnson literally attempted to destroy everything that had come before. The Force Awakens had some major issues to begin with but this sequel just went off the rails, crashed into a school and exploded into a fiery ball of death."
4497,2,Disney is getting strong,"Disney is getting strong on the series, both in good and bad. The movie was very entertaining and delivered lots of nostalgia for an old fan of the originals like myself. The movie made me feel great suprise in many parts, as there was so much new eye candy to be discovered. It kinda makes me understand all the positive critics reviews out there."
4498,5,At Least It Didn't Revolve Around Yet Another Death Star. Sorta,"Hey. Just two episodes ago was the return and now this is the last? Well, that was short lived."
4499,4,Army of hyperspace ship.,"Next episode would be the rebel creating army of hyperspace ship with autopilot, launching them at big enemy ship, planet etc."
4500,1,Awful,"Horrible, lazy and RUINED classic Star Wars. The new characters are beyond bad. Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, will never be canon to me. It's about ruined the classic 6 that George made. I'm a fan who loves Phantom Menace through Return of the Jedi, I loved Rogue One, but this trilogy is garbage."
4501,1,NOT a Star Wars film. Long long ago in another reality........,"I'm trying to be fair here. If you are a Millennial or even a Gen X'er and you thought Pacific Rim was one of the best films you've ever seen, or you've never ever seen STAR WARS then you will probably love this film. It does entertain in a very childish clownish kind of way. It felt more like something shown on Saturday morning on the disney channel or cartoon network. Sadly it has been Disneyfied.<br /><br /> <br /><br />If you sat in a theater as I did in 1977 and had your mind blown by a movie unlike any movie ever made before then you will not like the Last Jedi. It is the least Star Wars of any yet made. I actually thought i'd gone to the wrong movie."
4502,1,The murder of Star Wars,"I feel like my best friend has died. Disney and Rian Johnson have successfully murdered Star Wars. <br /><br />The story was a total shambles from start to finish and the classic characters were practically unrecognisable from what we know and love. It is almost as if Rian Johnson has never watched ( and even less understood) the saga. Obviously the critics have been bought, because absolutely NO TRUE Star Wars fan would give this more than one star. <br /><br />I enjoyed TFA and thought there was potential and looked forward to seeing the last Jedi. However ( coming from a fan, whose very first film he ever watched at the cinema was A New Hope), this film has destroyed everything that Star Wars truly is."
4503,2,Disrespects fans and destroys any intimidation factor the new order had,"The Last Jedi had great special effects... 2 stars for that. But that is about all the good it had. There is no character development and nothing in the story is progressed from the Force Awakens. Rey receives 2 minutes of training from Luke. Luke turns out to be a horrible human being who not only personally drove Kylo to the dark side but afterward abandons all his loved ones to destruction so he can go pout on an island waiting for death. Luke is a beloved character and they destroyed him for the sole purpose of trying to humanize Kylo and make Rey seem even more perfect, amazing and completely unrelatable."
4504,1,Worst Episode Ever.,"They just kill the whole foundation, which was laid on episode 7 and literally destroyed all Classic trilogy persons. They just nothing, they fought for nothing, their legacy is nothing, their life was nothing. After that they ruined almost all new characters, only not-so-good plotted previously villian Kylo Ren now have really strong motivation to be bad."
4505,1,Rian Johnson killed Star Wars,JJ Abrams started what could have been an epic trilogy but Rian The Johnson decided to totally destroy everything Abrams had set up in TFA with his abysmal take on the Star Wars universe.
4506,2,RUINED THE STAR WARS SAGA,"This film has utterly gutted and disappointed me the dark, serious sci-fi atmosphere of previous films is completely shattered in The Last Jedi, with constant corny jokes (most of which are good for 13 year olds) and shirtless kylo (is rian trying to make all the twelve year old girls love star wars now? never before has a star wars film had a shirtless male, it generates a new feel losing the original ""Star Wars mood"". Futhermore there are many cringe scenes and moments, and not enough focus on the paramount characters with too much action from side characters."
4507,1,"Worse than I imagined, instant sequel not worth seeing","I was wondering whether the torrent of terrible reviews was some type of trickery because so many critics claimed to have loved this film. My first thought when it ended was ""what the hell did I just watch?"" Without spoiling the film, here's a list of everything why this film was such a clunker."
4508,1,The magic is gone!,I have watched all of the Star Wars films with the same child-like sense of wonder I did with the originals as a kid but 20 minutes into this film it faded and by the end was crushed completely. This has killed the Saga storyline for me!
4509,3,Shocking.,"I don't think I've ever seen a film with a script as poorly written as this. The plot makes absolutely no sense and is built upon so many coincidences and contrivances that it breaks the ""suspension of disbelief"" rule that is so important to scifi/fantasy stories. Thinking back, this film only gets worse and worse with age, every crack, every inconsistency within the story becomes more noticeable with time. The film takes the most basic and obvious writing tropes imaginable and somehow does them wrong. Then we have the very confusing portrayal of Luke Skywalker, who acts very out of character. To put it simply, the reason why Luke is the way he is in the film is because of a stupid, underwritten scenario in which he made a choice so horridly out of character its shocking. When even Mark Hamill objects to the handling of his character within the narrative, that should've been the moment when they stopped completely and rewrote everything. You will hear people defend this movie based on its themes, visuals and action, all of which are great don't get me wrong, but WOW is this script a disaster."
4510,3,A silly backwards step,"As a life long Star Wars fan it was so heartening to have JJ Abrams ditch the lens flare and create a solid entry in the Star Wars universe. It has its faults, but I loved it anyway and it made up for many of the wrongs George Lucas had inflicted on us with Episodes 1-3."
4511,1,Disappointment. Star Wars is Dead,"I think Rian Johnson should give up the new trilogy Disney offered him. The plot has so many holes in it. So many questions unanswered, like who's Snoke? He was able to merge Kylo Ren's and Ray's minds together, but not powerful enough to feel a lightsaber is moving towards him? "
4512,1,Disappointment,"I think Rian Johnson should give up the new trilogy Disney offered him. The plot has so many holes in it. So many questions unanswered, like who's Snoke? He was able to merge Kylo Ren's and Ray's minds together, but not powerful enough to feel a lightsaber is moving towards him? So many disgusting things about Luke's character. "
4513,1,The death of star wars,"Perhaps a drastic remark ""the death of star wars"" I know it will live on in our hearts (and hopefully in the new movies). I have always purchased every star wars movie on Blu-ray but I refuse to support this film. I was open minded and willing to look past what I new would be cheesy and a cheap knock off of the originals but I could not handle it from the start. The WORST STAR WARS EVER BY FAR!! I cannot believe what they have done. Star wars is now mixed with some sort of kids Disney show such as Hannah Montana or high school musical ( minus the singing). I hope they do not make a sequel but make some new story line and stop destroying my childhood heroes like they did to Luke skySkywal, Han Solo, and Leia Organa. The director clearly does not understand who they were and what they were meant to symbolize. Sometimes in moments of weakness I think about punching JJ Abrams in the throat"
4514,3,Worst episode...so far,"This movie made me long for the days in which Jar Jar was the worst decision of the serie.<br /><br />It's basically bad for the entire duration without any redeeming moments.<br /><br />The fact this movie has a score of over 8 (at the time I'm writing this) proves two things for me, the majority of voters are fanboys who don't remember what starwars supposed to feel like and that the crowds are getting easier to win over"
4515,5,"Not Entirely on Topic ""Empire Strikes Back""","Basically the whole movie was about a general called Snoke ruling The Empire and he is trying to use the power of Kylo Ren. Meanwhile, Rebels are trying to forge a new colony and find a new planet to message other rebels for help on their adventure forming their empire from the beginning. Also Rey travels to the secret Jedi Island in a secret planet where Luke is located at. Rey asks for Luke's assistance on controlling her powers to fight with the Empire. Snoke knows this and connects Kylo and Rey with the force to find Luke and kill him. His plan is to kill the last Jedi and take the whole control around all the major galaxies. After Rey gets her training she goes to meet up with Kylo Ren and change his side. Snoke captures and tries to read the mind of Rey to find Luke's location. Kylo kills Snoke and tries to change Rey's mind and recruit her to his side. Rey refuses and fights with Kylo. And the war continues... "
4516,2,IMDb LIES,"After scrolling through the comments for a few minute, there is no way that this film got 7+ stars... NO WAY! The average rating I saw was probably 2/10... Who paid you off IMDb? Disney? The Star Wars franchise? Rian Johnson?"
4517,1,"Stupid, stupider and stupidest",...take your pick.
4518,4,Woke Killed the Star Wars Franchise.,"The last Star Wars isn't a film, but rather a woke de-construction for woke's sake. Every Star Wars fan hate it, but what's the use? Making a statement, not a fine movie but a simple statement is obviously the goal here."
4519,1,Boring film that spits in the face of everything that makes Star Wars special.,"Went to see the movie with my dad (both of us are life-long Star Wars fans), expecting to see another great chapter in the saga. Unfortunately, everything that made Star Wars the great movies that they are, are no where to be seen. Where are the characters we are supposed to care about? This is Star Wars, where are the lightsaber battles, besides that whatever it was with kylo, rey, and the red guys. Worst of all, the totally deflating, slap in the face, last ""battle"" for Luke. The movie was so boring that I looked at my watch quite a few times to see when this would ever end and even almost feel asleep watching this movie. We left with a feeling of disbelief, anger, and shock."
4520,5,Star wars is dying,8.6 8.8 8.3 Thats the original trilogy. This 7.2 and thats all you need to know.
4521,5,This ain't the worst movie ever...,But it is the worst Star Wars movie by far.
4522,1,Very disappointing,I was hugely disappointed in this movie. 
4523,4,Meh,"Okay, to get the good things out of the way: great visuals, some interesting new ideas, decent acting and entertaining on the surface. However, after watching it a second time, the glaring plotholes and lazy writing in general just cannot be overseen.<br /><br />The worst of those instances is perhaps the way Luke Skywalker, the sympathetic, optimistic hero of the original trilogy, is dealt with. While I generally think it could have been interesting to give his character a dark side, the way it is done in this movie is just terrible. The same character who did not hesitate to risk his life because he believed in the good of Darth Vader, who not only cut of his arm and tortured his sister, but slaughtered billions, is now willing to kill is student and nephew in his sleep because of some vision? Far from being a clever ""subversion"" of his character, a well written subversion catching the audience by surprise at first, but appearing entirely logical in hindsight, it is just lazy writing, and takes any credibility from the plot.<br /><br />Similarily, the movie works hard to reinforce sexist stereotypes, Rey being essentially perfect in everything she does etc without much training (see Mary Sue), Admiral Holdo being blatantly incompetent (see How to communicate with subordinates) and Rose saving Finn ""for love"" when he was about to save the resistance from obliteration, something that is done instead by Rey in another incredibly convenient scene.<br /><br />Apart from that, plenty of other minor and major problems, even with stuff as basic as object permanence (weapons disappearing midfight, people ""teleporting"" over battlefield"".<br /><br />So yeah, not the best."
4524,1,"Star Wars is no more, RUINED!!!",Im so so soooo angry and sad about this new take on the saga that was the awesome star wars universe. RUINED!!!
4525,4,How many stars? no idea. I like the number 4,"I like reading bad reviews but I wish folks would be specific. I'll bet the stuff I wanted to change were details most folks had no problems with. I see lots are not happy with Luke. Was it his reluctance to recommit? His choice to live a hermit? I hear from older folks myself too who have lost their idealism and have turned misanthropic so I'd say Luke's character change seems pretty realistic to me. The claims about powerful women and lousy men doesn't wash, I don't think although I could see their viewpoint. Just today I heard a lady on NPR say she wanted to work with people who look like her and not the white men on a scientific panel. not that they did anything neg at all to her. They were merely white men. Period. So I can see how Last Jedi might be a teeny bit vulnerable to that sort of interpretation.<br /><br />I blame bloated budgets and CGI. Fight scenes go on too long. There are too many characters. So many special effects they're not at all special anymore. So many spills and near death misses that one feels nothing.<br /><br />I'l take a rubber Yoda and a rubber Jabba any day over the CGI creations.<br /><br />The scripts of '77 '80 and '83 aren't great lit, but there's a simplicity to most of the scenes so that when there's a crowd or noisy scene, one appreciates the change. The CGI era episodes are so often cluttered with characters, droids, chase scenes, fights. one longs for a simple 2 or 3 person low key scene.<br /><br />I noticed in Last Jedi the main characters hardly ever are in the same scene together. That's not a Last Jedi problem, that's a lesson from TV. Sure, characters separate for adventures, but they come together and form an ensemble at some point. Imagine if George, Elaine, Kramer, and Jerrry never even were in the same room. 3po, R2, Leia and the boys (chew, Han, Luke) belong together like Dorothy Gale and her 3 buds. Having said that, could be audiences like a nice mix in their ensembles. Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo all seem about the same height and fitness level , look 25-35 yrs old. All feisty and confident.<br /><br />I could see a director exchanging their roles before filming with little problem.<br /><br />You couldn't do that with the Scooby team, The Clampetts nor the castaways on Gilligan's Island. Each is a distinct character in personality and form."
4526,1,Beyond Horrible,"Unwatchable.<br /><br />Ruined the franchise.<br /><br />Disrespected everything anyone ever loved about Star Wars.<br /><br />Would rather have watched Jar-Jar do 2 hours of stand-up with only ""dad jokes""."
4527,1,Not good at all.,"Disappointed with this movie for all of the obvious reasons. Also I ask you reader, would you drink thick, green colored mucus-looking milk from a strange, multi-breasted sea creature? ...Luke seems to have no issue. Ugh what a bad movie."
4528,1,WORST STAR WARS EVER! TOTAL GARBAGE,"Never reviewed anything but this one deserves it. It's so bad I can't be quiet. As long time fan of Star Wars I just watched the new one, last Jedi; I have to remind myself more than one time that I was looking at a new SW movie cause I kept on forgetting that... it just feels like a complete different experience and not in a good way. It used to be awesome. Now its just an animated series for kids with kids humor too... it shouldn't be watched from long time fans unless you wanna loose any appeal or interest for an (used to be) amazing saga. Thank you Disney and thank you for your politically correct policy . You just killed one of my childhood dream!"
4529,1,"Complete, utter disappointment. Try and disagree with my remarks.","It's such a disappointment for me to write a bad review to a movie I was desperate to love. I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so much so, in fact, that I even found episodes II & III (especially III) perfectly enjoyable."
4530,2,I wanted to like this movie but i just couldnt. Im done with this NOT Star Wars,"I was so disappointed in this movie i basically machine gunned it the whole ride home to my wife. the plot was laughable and ridiculous. every other dialogue had silly forced humor that took away from the tone and feel of a star wars movie. none of the major questions from TFA were answered and were steamrolled and shoved aside like they werent a major element of the last movie. over half of the movie was unneeded and just fillers. not to mention every white male is portrayed as intensely angry, and a complete nut case with no tact or character. it was long and teedious. the special effects were pretty good but the main thing i appreciated about this movie was the score. Classic John Williams masterpieces as usual. all in all it was just too disappointing for me to stomach. dont think i will be in a hurry to see the next installment and certainly wont fork over more cash for a hard copy of this trainwreck. I loved star wars ever since i was a kid but this is just plain wrong to pull on the fans. Disney congrats. you destroyed everything i loved about star wars."
4531,2,Proof that no one cares about SW anymore...,".... only about $$$. There are many of us who just hate this film for so many different and varied reasons. My reason is that Disney, JJ Abrahms and co all just want to cash in on Lucas's dream before the fire runs out. JJ is all about self, popularity and dollars NEVER about the art of film making. Otherwise why copy what has already been done so well? The new clown on the block Rian Johnson is of the same ilk, despite impressing me with Looper a few years ago, his credits as writer and director of this boring contradictory mess confirms his position as Stooge No.2."
4532,3,Star Wars is officially dead!,Less worse than The Force Awakens. Still a mess. Shake your ass and bring back George Lucas!!!
4533,1,"Disney, Why?","Forget the last 40 years of star wars and perhaps its bearable. Please never touch Star Wars again Rian Johnson, spare us. Some how you managed to strip its heart and soul by making it completely void of any substance, conviction or direction. <br /><br />Apparently Yoda, Obi Wan, Luke, and every other Jedi wasted all their time bothering to learn about the force and about following the light. This movie makes Luke's journey to become a Jedi through The original movies look like a pointless odyssey which would have happened eventually. <br /><br />I have never been so let down by a movie and I saw all the Hobbit movies... all of them. I have loved Star Wars since I was five and it was simply my childhood. This is the first Star Wars addition that I have ever wanted to be destroyed other than the Christmas special and I have seen the Battle of Endor, The Caravan of Courage, read the EU, and watched the cartoons. Disney, why?"
4534,3,Care more about merchandise sales than a good storyline,Visually the movie was great. At the beginning the 3D seemed a little fuzzy and faces in the background were blurry but it seemed to clear as the movie went on. There were a few scenes that were too dark as well. Other than that it's what we've come to expect from a Star Wars movie especially the scene when the rebel cruiser collides with Snoke's ship. The musical score was on point as well. These are the parts of the movie I can't complain about.
4535,1,A horrible Star Wars film,"I think everyone has said it, this was such a disappointment to Star Wars fans. To seriously have Luke milk an animal... have no answers to Rei parents, and what's the background on Snoke he just dies? Absolutely awful movie, very disappointing"
4536,1,Being fresh cannot mean to ignore sense,Spoilers !
4537,4,Really bad script writing and directing,The second worst star wars movie of all time (after the rise of the skywalker)
4538,4,Third best Star Wars film ever? More like third worst,"Imagine ten people on a boat (nine bad, one good). A giant wave crashes into the boat, knocking off nine of them, and the one remaining just happens to be the good guy. This just about sums up The Last Jedi."
4539,2,Total mess-up from beggining to an end.,"There is no single Star Wars fan who will like this movie.<br /><br />A combination of a remake, stupid comedy and full of some totally illogical plot-twists. It is fun to watch only because it is bears Star Wars name, but nothing more than that. <br /><br />I will give it 2 stars, only because of special effects which are great and that is pretty much all."
4540,3,Big Disappointment,"I was waiting so long for this movie and I really thought it was going to bring a next step after the reboot of Force Awakens. But, Rian Johnson, takes this to another dimension that is the opposite of the universe of star wars. I felt he decide to do is own thing and I felt this was very selfish on is side cause this was not a universe created by him. So many wrong things in this movie. Maybe not wrong, but definitely a lot of things just didn't work. The comic movements were obvious, the pace was dull, most sequences were long and without any purpose, aside fill the ego of Johnson. I gave 3 stars cause it's Star Wars, but I wanted to rate it with 1."
4541,2,Proud to Be Stalked,"Remember Star Wars? The tale of adventurous in the stars? The fable of hope, integrity and triumph of the noble against the downtrodden?<br /><br />Well, hold on to that feeling."
4542,1,So Bad it's good!!! But not becase it sucks!,Think Family Guy meets a horrible Guardians of the Galaxy.
4543,1,Awful,"Where to start how about everywhere this movie sucks, acting, storyline, everything it has no substance and in no way represents the Star Wars legacy. I am ashamed to have even have sat through it. Avoid at all costs unless you love plot holes and wooden acting."
4544,3,"""Hey guys. I think we forgot how to Star Wars...""","Like most people who enjoy Star Wars, I grew up with it. I watched it every time I found it on TV as a kid. I purchased The Trilogy about three times in various formats and iterations. Then, the Prequel Trilogy (The Poop Trilogy, as I tend to refer to it) comes along and ruins all of hope of seeing a good Star Wars movie again.<br /><br />The Force Awakens is released two years ago and my hope is restored. It's not the same, but it doesn't need to be. It has the spirit that I want. There was love in that movie. And Rogue One was great in ways that I hadn't expected. It was also different, but made it clear from the beginning what its intentions were.<br /><br />So the roller-coaster ride of Star Wars fandom brought me to The Last Jedi with pretty high hopes. My friends and I were all pumped up and cheering as The Crawl began, like everyone else. <br /><br />By the end of the movie, the customary applause did not occur. The theater was silent, and I realized that a contorted expression of disgust that remained since about half-way through."
4545,1,"Political message first, Story second and it shows!",Political agenda comes before good story in this Star Wars film unfortunately. In the process of making their political message they have ruined almost every character new and old. 
4546,1,Star Garbage,"This was, without question, the worst! The Force Awakens set us up for something truly great. R. Johnson butchered it. Just butchered it. He does not get it. And that's ignoring the absolutely HORRIBLE script. To M. Hamill, it's inexcusable that you'd have been subjected to a director with no love for the story, your character or the myth of the Jedi. It's hard to imagine Disney would think this was a plausible storyline for any universe. Let alone the Star Wars universe. I wish this entire movie could... vanish."
4547,5,Breathe. Just breathe...,"""This is not the way the Force works"", Han Solo tells Finn in The Force Awakens. This statement couldn't be more true for a lot of stuff we see happening in The Last Jedi: Leia surviving the deep freeze of space vacuum and flying back into her spaceship like some kind of Marvel superhero; Force users projecting themselves across the galaxy, not simply as holograms but also physically (Rey & Kylo touch hands, Luke's lightsaber clashes with Kylo's, Yoda's ghost burns down the tree); Rey and Kylo still being able to connect telepathically after Snoke (who supposedly was the one who created the mental bridge between them) gets killed; Snoke not being able to read Kylo's true intentions and dying like a Dark Side rookie, even though he earlier seemed to be way more powerful than his apprentice; Kylo and Rey (both carrying unprecedented raw strength) having a hard time to fight a bunch of pretorian guards (who might be well trained and armed but don't have any Force powers whatsoever); and, perhaps most importantly, Force sensitive nobodies needing absolutely no training and experience to reach a level Obi Wan Kenobi never managed to even dream of. None of those things make sense, even if we accept that the Force is ""so much bigger"" than what we had taken for granted so far. "
4548,1,title,Bad movie__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
4549,5,Rogue One is the best one yet.....,"The rest are amateur hour. Last Jedi and Force Awakens can't even compete. No matter how many famous actors/characters perish for shock value. Rogue one light years ahead. For the next Star Wars film can Mr. Edwards direct it and the beautiful Felicity Jones be in it? ( unfortunately she can't lol) anyway not much of a review, I don't just don't like The Last Jedi. If you watched Rogue One..... don't watch anything else"
4550,1,One of the worst movies ever!,"The level of stupidity of certain decisions is amazing:<br /><br />which general with dozens of starships is unable to surround a single enemy ship?, there are 30 'cloaked' ships: at a rate of 3 ships per minute, it should take 10 minutes to blast them all (even without using the 10+ ships First Order has...)<br /><br />The lack of originality cannot be unseen:<br /><br />Hoth and the AT-AT, the training with the Jedi in a remote place, the well with Dark Side in it, the Apprentice turning back against his Master at the least expected moment...<br /><br />If jumping into hyperspace can cause such distruction, why the other Rebel ships (like the hospital one) didn't use the last of their fuel to kamikaze on the Big Enemy ship mid-movie?"
4551,1,Star Wars: Six Feet Under,"This is my first review on IMDB, so please don't judge harshly. "
4552,3,What have you done to Star Wars?,"After watching what seemed and endless movie, I was left wondering... What was the point of the movie? What was the plot? Where's the story? Because there wasn't any! It was a combination of bad ideas + more bad ideas in a not very well thought plan. There were a lot of explosions, dead pilots, and cool effects, but Star Wars should not be a movie that relies on that instead of its story. So sad."
4553,1,Blah,"Just misses pretty much everything about the original characters, especially Luke. Silly and slow going with the side plots too."
4554,3,Such as a disappointment,I've been a hard core fan of Starwars. They are one of my most favorite films.
4555,2,I didn't think SW could go lower than the Phantom Menace. Boy was I wrong!,This movie was 3 hours of fluff. None of the characters actions or choices had any consequences or made any sense. Almost all the lines were cheesy or recycled from the original trilogy. 
4556,3,avoid this crap,"This is my first review after years in IMDB, and just wanted to let you know that Disney has finally destroyed the Jedis saga. The movie is totally pointless and a mixture of canned jokes for young kids and copy/paste scenes of the saga. "
4557,3,Runied Luke and entire franchise,Disney completely threw away Luke's entire character.
4558,1,I through that they couldn't get worse then TFA,"I will try to get this as spoiler free as it can get,"
4559,1,Suggested Title: Star Wars: All For Nothing,"Just as a future clarification, I am a long fan of the Star Wars story and I deeply loved the characters and I felt their pain, despair, betrayal, struggle and happiness throughout the story. So that is why watching the 2017 squeal was so painful."
4560,2,My Last Star Wars Film -- Ever,"Like another reviewer said, this is the last movie in the series I will see. I will not be disappointed again. I was there 40 years ago and have been to every one of them since within the first couple weeks of their releases. Though a notch above The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, this dreadful film is like a rag you soak up spilled coffee in and then squeeze into the sink. There is not an original idea in the entire wretched business and what's worse, whole parts of previous incarnations are blatantly stolen from to create this mess. Some of the ideas are slapped together and amateurish to boot. Only the casino scenes have visual merit but again they are derivative. The Yoda figure is almost inanimate and unforgivably boring. Worst of all are the appearances of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, who, rather than be presented with iconic build up and respect, are two geezers wheeled out of the home to get some sun. I wasn't sure if Leia was Carrie Fisher or Ethel Barrymore. Knowing Carrie is gone also made some of her scenes a bit creepy. She was much better served by the HBO documentary ""Bright Lights"" as a swan song. And Hamill looked like the bum who asks for change with the cardboard sign by the highway. Remember when Luke Skywalker used to wash his hair? Finally Luke's absurd death reminded me of the scene in Wizard of Oz when the Wicked Witch melts away. Please."
4561,2,Delusion and Depression,Heroes are made not born...except on Jakku apparently.
4562,2,"Astonishingly bad, I still can't believe it, it's as if its been deliberately made as badly as possible.","Well there are already 4000+ reviews stating just how astonishingly bad this film is, I don't really have anything to add here ontop of what has already been said, however I felt it necessary to contribute to the masses to add a bit more weight to the necessary backlash that Disney surely cannot ignore completely I the very vague hope that Abrams can somehow rescue something from the obliteration of anything he setup in VII to make IX even a 5/10 film."
4563,1,A Total Betrayal of the Star Wars that George Lucas created,"I could spend so much time talking about this movie, but I will try to keep myself contained. Nonetheless, I have never, ever in my whole life been so disappointed by a movie."
4564,1,Absolute TRASH,"Rian Johnson made the impossible..........he made SW fans hate SW. The new episode 9 spends over 2 hours undoing the damage RJ did. I will take episode 9 as Disney's apology to episode 8 and I hope Rian never writes, directs or produces anything else again for the sake of Holywood."
4565,2,Please let this tired franchise die!,"This needs to end... Intellectually exhausted and lacking thrills, 'Last Jedi' will make tons of money yet is more proof this franchise has been pimped out to the point of embarrassment. I didn't care about any of characters nor the outcome... I simply wanted the movie to end. No one clapped at the end and the conversations I overheard from audience members were of disappointment. This movie is ""The Empire Strikes Back"" without the thrills and excitement."
4566,1,I couldn't believe my eyes,"Very bad writing.<br /><br />Horrendous plot holes.<br /><br />Arcs insufficiently developed.<br /><br />Avengers vibe all the movie.<br /><br />Star Wars vibe absolutely deleted.<br /><br />Luke is turned into a bad Tony Stark.<br /><br />Snoke is left as a tertiary character.<br /><br />Rey is the new Yoda with just a 15 minute training.<br /><br />All in all, I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES."
4567,1,"A sterile, but fun, provocation","Reducing Star Wars to an entertainment film only, after the work that George Lucas has done (of research and writing) is absolutely simplistic; work that had always been reffered to the studies of the anthropologist J. Campbell, for example. Let's be clear: I don't say that there's no attempt in The Last Jedi to relate to the great anthropological issues (which have always characterized the franchise) such as the overcoming of paternal hegemony, but, the few things that may have worked, have been sacrified in the name of childish jokes and grotesque situations. Giving the peculiar explanation of why Kylo Ren turned evil, by the way, was the only thing that may have really surprised in the movie, on which base, could have been settled a better plot. The main issue of The Last Jedi, in fact, is the total lack of a solid narrative structure and filmic logic, which, at least, had always characterized George Lucas storytelling, from the very early beginning."
4568,1,Wow - how bad is it? VIII has killed SW.,"This movie shouldn't be anywhere near the Star Wars saga. It is a nonsensical piece non-science fiction with some of the worst plot and and non-story writing I've ever seen. I mean its just a plain lousy movie. Where the end leaves you with an empty feeling of getting nothing for your money. AND worst of all, it so<br /><br />destroys the Star Wars saga, I have no, zero, zip, nadda reason or want to watch SW VII Force Awakens again - because I know how much this movie killed SW."
4569,3,Why,"This is my first review ive ever written and its just something i felt i had to do. First, they killed Han Solo, now not only did they kill Luke they turned the whole movie into a bunch of cheesy one liners. I feel like they killed the image of who we all grew up believing Luke Skywalker to be. I like Rey, but feel like Star Wars as we knew it is gone and this is what we are left with. i did not enjoy the movie, although the visuals are very well done."
4570,1,Just terrible,"I love Star Wars, always did. I'm sad to say The Last Jedi, was terrible. The story was really bad. I didn't recognize the characters from Force Awakens. The new Star Wars movies I've seen more as free Star Wars movies, rather than belonging to the original first three movies. The last jedi was bad as a sci-fi movie generally, and terrible as a Star Wars. Actually I was so upset the night I got home from the movie, that I had trouble sleeping. Here are a few things I felt was just awful. "
4571,1,So sad,Disney should film Thrawn trilogy instead of this crap.
4572,1,Do us all a favour and cancel the rest of the series.,Others with more time on their hands and more expertise in the field of cinematography and story writing have already written long reviews going into detail as to why this film is bad.
4573,1,The Disappointment is Real!,"Boring, disjointed, jumbled mess; other people seem to like the special effects but I found it painfully obvious the whole movie was shot in front of a ""green screen"" and everything is animation; what made this movie putrid to me was the lack of character development and abuse of existing characters."
4574,2,Fell for the hype...,Too bad there were probably some really talented people that worked on this. They deserve mad credit....<br /><br />But this movie was very painful to watch at times. I got major Ep1-3 flashbacks throughout. 3 hours and hardly any progress in story or character developement. Very very disney childish. This movie will not hold up with time.
4575,5,A flawed movie which has its moments,"First of all, I must thank all the people leaving 1 or 2 star reviews here. You set my expectations so low, I actually enjoyed The Last Jedi. "
4576,1,In a Galaxy SO SO SO Far Away............,The Force Awakens was a triumph in re-kindling our passion and thirst for more Star Wars epic adventures and our need to continue that adventure with The Last Jedi is sadly taken away with this pitiful instalment.
4577,4,What a frustrating movie,Had a tough time with the Last Jedi.
4578,1,Partial review is all I can offer,"This is a review of the first 25 minutes of the film only because I couldn't watch any more of it.<br /><br />It's the same old crappy unconvincing amateur dialogue, poor forced humour and lots of cgi that I don't care about. Is there a highlights version so I don't have to sit through 2.5 hours of it?<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie and give it a go but I just couldn't."
4579,1,Made account just to review this!,"Everything we thought we knew about the legacy of Star Wars and George Lucas, even JJ, was screwed up and thrown out of a moving car window. Disney have made a gross mistake with this film and the story line. The warning came from Mark Hamill in the way he protested how his character was written, seen the poor bugger after the premire, shock does not cover it. I have seen every Star Wars film at cinema, escapism at its best, funny entertaining and even with the prequels, a sense of hope and doing better as you left. This film made me want to board a plane find the director and take in front of disney and display him as a traitor to all those who had held Star Wars in high esteme. We have scientists, physists, astrologists, astronauts, engineers, leaders, inspired by the story telling in the Arthurian Star Wars, the last installment just wiped it out and rained it out from on high all over these people, it was not fair and how they got this past as a Star Wars film beggers belief. I have to say Rogue One was an outside bet, but turn out, in my opinion, to be one of the best stories from Star Wars, I will not support anymore Star Wars films after this one, family and friends feel the same. If you have not seen the film then DO NOT."
4580,1,"Watching this felt like Luke at the end of V; falling through a garbage shoot, screaming, in disbelief about some bad news",I have never been so disappointed.
4581,3,Marvelastion of the Great Saga is complete,"Horrendoues movie that is just a bit better than the abysmall TFA. Useless villains. no plot, no logic, no light saber duels, stupid gags that feel completely out of place, all actions defying the logic and rules of the world established in the previous 2 trilogies."
4582,1,Death of a franchise?,"Pointless and overlong, a disjointed mess of a film."
4583,1,"For the very first time in my life, I wanted to rage quit during the movie","TERRIBLE movie... SO BAD, this is the end of star wars for me !"
4584,1,This has made me not want to watch another Star Wars movie!,How could they got this SO wrong? I have been watching these from the very first day of release back in the 70's! I've spent months excited giddy with anticipation for the next Star Wars movie. I've been excited about every little thing about Star Wars.
4585,4,Heresy,"Heresy. This movie ignores the basic character development of Star Wars, and even the basic rules of science. I won't spoil the plot with the former, but examples of the later are: gravity fed bombs in space, bodies exposed to the vacuum of space and not violently decompressing, and people opening hatches directly out to said vacuum with no consequence. Did the writers have even half a brain ?"
4586,4,The final nail in the coffin for the Skywalker Saga,"The Last Jedi is the most divisive yet also, I believe, the most maligned Star Wars film ever made. The decisions that were made in this film range from questionable to completely incomprehensible (and I'm referring to both the decisions made by the characters and director Rian Johnson in this statement). Most of the defenders of the film seem to believe that because the film was not in line with the expectations of most fans, it is by default good. This line of thought makes no sense whatsoever and is simply an excuse to handwave away the many mistakes this movie makes."
4587,3,Star Wars lost a bit of it's magic after The Last Jedi!,"I am a big Star Wars fan and I really appreciate the revival of the Star Wars saga. And with The Force Awakens and Rogue One, it seemed the Star Wars Universe was back shining like never before. But after seeing The Last Jedi I am afraid that same Universe lost a bit of it's magic. The Last Jedi is full of bad jokes, unexplained phenomenas (like how does Lea, get blown out of a ship and then get's back in, like some sort of Superwoman). Together with some bad story choices: like light speed tracking? Snoke playing ""Jedi mind tricks"" on Rey and Kylo so they are connecting with each other? It feels like this movie missed the point in what makes SW so special. Was it all that bad? No, the ending scene on Crait was interesting, and that is where you will see a little bit of the ""old"" Luke Skywalker back, but that real ""Star Wars"" moment was sadly short lived. Off course as a fan you have to watch this movie too, but don't set your expectations to high."
4588,1,I felt a disturbance in the force again....,"It is a period of Walt Disney. Rebel script writers, striking from a hidden base, have won their next victory against the Great Movie. Pursued by Disney's sinister agents, Star Wars fans race home, custodian of their stolen dreams that can save the Epic and restore freedom to the galaxy...."" <br /><br />....<br /><br />....<br /><br />....<br /><br />Help us, Lucas-Wan-Kenobi, you are our only hope!"
4589,1,"No Laws of Physics, No Danger, No Characters, No point","I've never been a Star Wars maniac, but I've enjoyed all of the movies for the most part leading up to this one. Here are the reasons this movie sucked out loud, and why there will probably be a worldwide outcry for the movie to be deleted from the record and be remade."
4590,1,PURE GARBAGE!!!,This movie is sooo stupid. Oh my God! The new characters suck. The Story is laughable. First they kill off Han and now Luke!!! What the Hell!!!
4591,1,"Not the ""Star Wars"" you are expecting!","Congrats to Disney for stealing my money and many others to pad their pockets. Don't waste your time with this one. You will leave this movie with the same questions you had after the last one. The story did not develop or progress like other Star Wars movies. I feel like this was a huge waste of money and time for all involved. You could literally skip this movie in the series and pick up with the next one and not feel like you missed much...I guess that is what you can expect from a ""no-name"" director!"
4592,4,It Simply Wasn't Star Wars,"Okay...This one's a doozy. I'm gonna make this one brief, because the movie upsets me. There were definitely strengths in the film, performances, visual effects, that one lightsaber team up, and the relationship between Rey and Kylo to name, well, all of them. The Rey and Kylo relationship is actually the only real thing this movie accomplishes, now that I think about it. Everything else was pretty much just filler. <br /><br />Now, the cons. The whole thing was bloated and sporadic, and should've ended a half hour sooner. Right after Rey leaves Kylo after fighting alongside him, and he decides to remain evil. Sidebar, I wish the director and writer were brave enough to actually have an impactful storyline, like Rey becoming evil and Kylo becoming good, or them teaming up in anyway. But no, we're robbed of that, and no real character development happens. <br /><br />Anyway, there were a lot of plotlines happening with a different pace per plotline. The Finn and Rose plot was unnecessary and again, robbed us of an interesting storyline for a beloved character. Plus, the scenes where they're in the casino place were totally out of place. The other thing that pisses me off about the movie is that it destroys all the great possibilities set up in Force Awakens, for no real reason. My beloved pilot Poe had a strangely written arc that wasn't really an arc? I guess it was just showing him becoming more responsible and less reckless, but it was just underwhelming and cheesily written. <br /><br />Also, Luke Skywalker was just a totally different character than the original trilogy Luke. Which isn't a bad thing in theory, but when it's not logical aging and character development and just lazy writing, that's upsetting. And I'm just gonna bring up the obvious; Leia using the force to fly through space was maddening. Yes, she's been established as force sensitive, but never enough to pull herself through space when she should've died instantly. What the heck. The tone of the movie was also all over the place, volleying back and forth between serious and funny. Just pick one, god damn it. <br /><br />It just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. It needed to be trimmed way down, and focus on building off what was established in Force Awakens. That one had a clear story, which is what this one should've had. It was just a mess most of the time."
4593,1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,No answer at all to so many questions from the force awakens.
4594,1,Some people actually like this,"Pointless, childish, self-spoofing, and boring. I hated the prequels, but this is a new level of senseless stupidity."
4595,1,People actually like this,"Pointless, childish, self-spoofing, and boring. I hated the prequels, but his is a new level senseless stupidity."
4596,3,This movie is NOT good,"This movie isn't consistent to other SW episodes: they didn't explain anything, like why is Snoke so powerful (he is not) or who are Rey's parents and why she has so much midi-chlorians to be so powerful forceuser. <br /><br />The clumsy and amusing tone of narrative(because of unnecessary humor) breaks suspension of disbelief, so do a lot of plotholes and weird decisions of scriptwriters. The plot structure (as whole it is unpredictable, it's nice) is OK, the character development is OK, but it makes plot even clumsier and worse. Why did they make whole casino plotline? <br /><br />Luke's behavior also seems to be strange. <br /><br />Visual part is quite cool, there is some epic scenes too, but plotholes and humour and absence of any willing to give us understanding of what and why is going on in the Galaxy make this movie far from 10/10"
4597,1,"A Complete Travesty of a ""Star Wars"" Film","When I first went in to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I initially walked away thinking it was good and that- aside from a few questionable moments- there was nothing wrong with it. But after taking some time to think about it and in reviewing the previous films, I realised that I was blinded by the smokescreen of the film's special effects to notice how poorly written and horrendous the entire movie actually was. Even my friends saw the flaws in the film that I didn't, because my love for the Star Wars name kept me from seeing the truth- that this film was filled with so many plot holes, retcons, and writing choices that it made me question how this movie ever made it off the drawing board and into production. I mean... did they just get one guy to proof check this as opposed to an entire room of people... or did a certain someone on the crew simply push this film to being made regardless of its gaping flaws?<br /><br />After what I've been hearing lately, I wouldn't be surprised."
4598,1,This movie had so much wasted potential.,"It was disappointing to see what they did to character progression. But of all characters they have ruined, Luke Skywalker was the worst. Luke Skywalker has become a coward that considered murdering his apprentice (which was also his nephew) in the middle of the night. The same guy who entered the Death Star to face Darth Sidious AND Darth Vader ALONE! The same Jedi who have trained with the ghosts of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin for 30 YEARS, that Jedi tried to kill a young boy... COME ON."
4599,1,Made an account to rate this movie because it's so bad,"This movie is a clear case of ""professional"" reviewers either being strong armed or paid for their good reviews. I've never seen a movie absolutely ruin an entire franchise like this one has. If you actually acknowledge this movie as part of the lore, every other movie in the franchise is completely trashed. I will disassociate this one from ""my"" star wars universe instead.Thank you"
4600,1,Impressive,Last Jedi pulled off an impressive feat. It made Episode I look like a masterpiece.
4601,1,blah,"Awful movie, one of the worst SW series. just jacked butt awful."
4602,2,Dumpster Trash,Worst piece of dumpster trash I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4603,1,TERRIBLE.,"The only reason I am writing this review is because I could not believe how terrible Star Wars the Last Jedi was. I became a huge fan because of the Force Awakens so I was soo looking forward to watch LJ - and I did....and I wish I didn't. Story is soo weak, characters were underdeveloped, the ENTIRE Fin and Rose sequence was trash, they did not give justice to Luke and sooooo many many more Cinema Sins!!! I just feel so disappointed!"
4604,1,"Please, no more.","Where to begin...I have never in my life been more disappointed or even mad at a Star Wars film. This film quite literally makes me angry. I have been a fan since the OT. I remember having endless amounts of fun watching the movies and playing with toys along with my older sisters. I grew up with Star Wars being a huge part of what we enjoyed together as a family. Just to put into context how important Star Wars was and is to me.<br /><br />I remember the enjoyment of seeing the originals again on the big screen. I didn't really care for all the changes that were made for the special edition edit. I've always been a firm believer of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". However, although some of the changes were cringe-worthy at best, they didn't completely take away from the enjoyment of the film and the overall narrative.<br /><br />When the prequels launched, I was just so excited to see something new and Star Wars after so many years. The story line was good but there were major missteps in its execution (i.e. Jar Jar Binks, wooden dialog, things talked about that would've been more exciting to see rather than just have explained through exposition, etc.) As bad as the prequels were at times, they still had redeeming qualities that had me wanting to see them multiple times.<br /><br />Fast forward to today's Star Wars. TFA, while mostly fan service, did a great job at resetting the expectation/hope meter for Star Wars fans that had a bad taste in their mouths from the prequels. Even the first line of the movie was ""This will begin to make things right."" Although, it was sad to see Han Solo's journey end, it carried with it an enormous potential to be an extremely heroic moment for his character to end on. It also had the potential to create more character depth for Ben/Kylo. Once again, while not perfect and leaving a lot of questions unanswered, I came out of the theatre knowing I had enjoyed the film, despite its issues because it felt like Star Wars was back in a big way. I was really looking forward to seeing the next film to get some of these nagging questions answered that were extremely important to the plot and the pulse and direction of this new trilogy. I also enjoyed Rogue One which was a great film, despite its flaws, to hold us over until the next main course was served.<br /><br />Now, TLJ: My wife and I didn't end up seeing it until it had been out for about 3 weeks or so because it's extremely hard for us to get free time together when we can go out; not to mention medical issues getting in the way. So we had most of the theatre to our selves with most people having already watched it. We didn't have much in the way of theatre-wide audience reaction to influence our enjoyment of the film. At the end of the film, I felt confused and extremely conflicted on how I felt about the film. My first thoughts were 'I think I liked it...I mean it's Star Wars, how can I not like Star Wars? It took a little while for what I saw to really click and sink in. As time passed and the more I thought about it, the less I liked it. The film picked up right where TFA leaves off, zero time has passed between films. The moment we've all been waiting for. Luke is reunited with his father's lightsaber; an object that carried with it endless lore and emotional attachment not just for those within the Star Wars universe but the fans who know its history. What does he do? Chucks it over his shoulder and off the cliff then walks away...my first thought, 'oh no, what the hell is this...you've got to be kidding me...' The entire movie although visually stunning, was filled to the brim with moments like that. Rian Johnson, I guess believes that good story telling equals building up people's expectations and intrigue in one scene only to undermine it in the next; ""pull the rug out from under the audience"" as they say. This was the theme of the entire movie: build, build, build...annnnd let down ""haha gotcha!"" They should have renamed this, Star Wars: The Endless ""Gotcha"". Even without the mind-numbing amount of ""gotcha"" moments, the overall plot was ill-conceived, at best. Plot motivations made no logical sense and the character development during this 2 1/2 hour long mess, was rife with missed opportunities and decision making that served only the purpose of moving the plot forward but carried little logical weight. As far as any of the answers that were set up by TFA, Rian Johnson, gave answers in TLJ that were either dumbfounding, irritatingly unsatisfying or completely ignored. I have a big problem with how the character of Luke was handled in this film; extremely unflattering vision for someone who has been a childhood hero to many, downright criminal. Luke's character wasn't just ended in this trilogy, it was utterly destroyed; such a waste. Although, I really like the idea of Rey's character, she was given zero depth in this film and those who believed she was nothing more than a ""Mary Sue"" in TFA, have had their suspicions confirmed. She's only just found out about the force with in the span of what, a few days? After almost zero time and two lessons from Luke, she's a full fledged Jedi who can best Luke, Kylo and pretty much anyone else; lame. Why are we supposed to care about this character who seems to have no trouble being the best at everything she does? How is this character relatable? Bad character development and bad writing. But so long as Kathleen Kennedy loves it.... ""The Force Is Female""; no that's not sexist....Ex machinas and Macguffins were an epidemic in this film. I also left the theatre with a headache from all the heavy-handed political nods this movie beat me over the head with. These explicitly overt extreme leftist mentalities are probably what made me more angry than anything else in this film. I'm sorry but if I wanted the current pulse of politics and social unrest in America while having extreme liberal propaganda shoved down my throat, I would've turned on a documentary or the news; not Star Wars which says a lot for being mostly liberal myself. I could go on and on about the issues with this film but that would turn this review into an essay. bottom line, this continuation of the saga was such a disappointment. Time will tell but I think Rian Johnson killed this trilogy, as I, as well as many others, have completely lost interest in it. For the first time in my history on this planet, there is a Star Wars movie I don't want to own and have no interest in seeing again. Thanks Rian Johnson, how bold of you..."
4605,1,"From puzzled and insulted, to confused and heartbroken","Two days ago I went to see The Last Jedi, or so I thought... it turned out to be Fast & Furious The Political Correct Star Wars Marvel Franchise Block Buster Tropes Movie Series Entry 1.. <br /><br /> <br /><br />After 10 mins I was puzzled by the setup and lack of competent opposition for our heroes..<br /><br />After 20 mins I was weirded out by slapstick and out of character moments..<br /><br />After 60 mins I was in denial... so many awful choices made for this movie.<br /><br />After 90 mins I was angry and wanted to walk out - a feeling I've never ever felt for SW or any other film before. <br /><br />After 120 mins I was insulted by so many strange plot holes and lost opportunities.<br /><br />After 152 mins I was confused... why would anyone do this to a beloved story? <br /><br /> <br /><br />After two days I'm just heartbroken :("
4606,1,33 Battlestar Galactica,"A mess would be the best way to describe this thing and the more I think of it the closer it gets to prequels in terms of quality. The writing was woeful, there were a lot of unnecessary jokes throughout, there was way too much CGI, the characters are boring, the big villain, Snoke, is essentially a mincing halfwit and then there were the endless dumb touches - I guess we know where the name Skywalker comes from with Leia's ridiculous space expedition."
4607,3,Possibly my least favorite Star Wars movie *SPOILERS*,"The night before I saw this movie, a close friend of mine who had seen Last Jedi said, ""Possibly the best Star Wars movie ever."" Even still, I went in with no expectations because I've found going to a movie with high hopes tends to lower my overall opinion of said movie."
4608,1,Heartbroken,"At least Disney can't go any lower with the next movie. Cheesy and disjointed. Leaving aside 'history', as a stand-alone movie it simply lacked credibility, and was further undermined by some shocking casting decisions. It aimed to tick all the genre, moral, ethical and ethnic boxes, and for that it gets 10/10, but as entertainment is was probably the biggest letdown in my movie watching lifetime"
4609,1,Star Wars is now a lame joke.,"In keeping with this brilliant new theme of killing off all the beloved original cast, I predict in the next film the Millenium Falcon will be put in a car crusher, Chewie set on fire and R2 and 3PO die of a mutual suicide pact.<br /><br />And now that The Force is just plain magic (untrained force wielders can instantly fight like Jedi's and survive the vacuum of space), the Porgs will become force wielders and become dark Jedis riding a magical wave of green milk and shooting lasers out their bums."
4610,2,This Film And The Farce Awakens Made Me Lose Interest in Star Wars,As such I am completely uninterested in the unhip Episode IX.
4611,1,Possibly the Last Starwars I pay money to see.,"The movie was poorly written. The pacing was bad. It felt more like a collection of side stories thrown together without a main purpose until the very end. The Canto Bight scene took unnecessary time away from more important things like backstories, and character delvelopment. Rey hasn't really developed as a character. The handling and treatment of Luke Skywalker was awful. It feels almost like they are trolling long time Star Wars fans and purposely subverting expectations just for the sake of doing so, and overall it didn't feel quite like a Star Wars film. The lack of lightsaber battles is a minus as well."
4612,2,TRASH,Screw Rainnne Johnson for Turning Luke Skywlaker into an untter coward and loser. I'll never forgive that hipster wnnabe for what he did to my boy Luke just to prop up Mary Rey Sue. Ugh. This movie needs to be decanonized ASAP
4613,1,This is unforgivable ...,"How could you do this to us? I am 43 years old and have been a faithful Star Wars fan for almost 4 decades. At the end of Episode 7 they finally find Luke, who is already a Jedi Master .... Our hope was to see our great Hero confronting the First Order ... And we are not given more than a scared old man, and without hope to see our hero fight a last battle with his lightsaber. They are all stupid who made the story and those who authorized it ... Without doubt the worst Star Wars movie of all. You can not imagine my disappointment after 2 years of waiting. After Rouge One - which was magnificent - my expectations for episode 8 were very very high. I don't want to spend money on this franchise anymore."
4614,1,what a disaster,"Disney at it again. the last jedi left me with a empty heart hoping that this was just a dream and not an actual movie. i was really hyped only to find out that my favorite luke skywalker killed off in an unethical way. the writing is off, its just ohhh but Reviewer gave it high rating but its disney they have tons of money."
4615,1,A cataclysm of garbage,"Genuinely the most depressing movie experience of my life, this movie sucked the magic and life out of Star Wars for good. Nothing in this movie makes sense or even attempts to make sense. A slow speed chase in space...glorious just what we all wanted and expected from a Star Wars movie."
4616,2,The main emotion I felt after watching this movie was disappointment.,"To be clear, I don't usually invest my time on the internet complaining or hating on other peoples creative efforts just be cause I don't agree with their choices.<br /><br />The last Jedi is an exception. <br /><br />I'm driven by the rave reviews by professional critics to provide a counter point, and it seems many many other fans are too. To be very clear, this movie isn't just bad because it doesn't fit the Star Wars ""formula"", it is bad because it doesn't fit the ""interesting and engaging cinema"" convention."
4617,4,The SJW saga continues under the disguise of a Star Wars movie.,"This is simply a continuation of Kathleen Kennedy's SJW push and i really don't care for it. Kylo Ren comes off as more of a whiny little b**** than anything. The whole idea of the rebels just ""running until the fuel gives out"" isn't what i call a plot, but what do you expect from a female commander that doesn't even dress like a soldier. Sorry but Leia got down in the trenches (with the boys) during Episodes 4-6, and i had some respect for her. But this story....it's just stupid and it makes the rebels look like incapable idiots. We ended Episoide 6 with the Empire broken and we come back to this nonsense? I could have written a better script."
4618,1,Star Worse,"The plot of the story has holes that you could pilot a dreadnought through. The main premise of the story is ludicrous, the few rebel ships travel slightly faster than the First Order so the main thrust of the movie is an exceedingly slow motion chase until the rebels run out of gas (wait, what!) "
4619,2,Rian Johnson was always the wrong choice...,"I predicted that this film would not crack 1.5 billion 12 months ago. Johnson is a fledgling director and a yes man. He was hired to bring Disney's new vision for Star Wars to the screen, the price of which was the deconstruction and destruction of Star Wars itself. Instead of reviewing the film (which is an abomination) I just want to ask how the overwhelmingly horrible reviews on these forums can result in a 7.6 score? Just read the scores here and tell me how the math adds up?"
4620,1,It's really bad,"When I first saw it in the cinema, I found the opening scene quite alright.<br /><br />But the movie got in a downward spin the moment Luke throws the lightsaber away."
4621,1,Please don't give money to Kathleen Kennedy and her agenda,Kathleen Kennedy is bent on trying to kill Star Wars all in the name of her social justice warrior / liberal agenda. This movie is everything that you have heard bad about it.
4622,3,Episode 8: The Wasted Opportunity,"At first, I didn't want to write this review, but this movie was such an injustice to the franchise that I couldn't hold back any longer. Before I continue, yes, as a fan, I had expectations, but those expectations were fanned by the lore created in TFA. If you didn't want the fans to have expectations regarding certain elements, which I will cover in this review, than you shouldn't have created the lore responsible for said expectations. We were given so much possibility for potential growth and Johnson destroyed all of it. For the sake of this review, I will only cover a few major issue I had with TLJ. I will not be covering Luke Skywalker cause as much as I didn't like his direction, it did match similar Jedi in the past like Ulic Qel-Droma (Redemption) and Jedi Master Lucien (KOTOR)."
4623,1,Anti capitalist cokmmie dem trying to pushwomen into space,And ones into oriental men even more.
4624,1,Watch MauLer's critique on youtube,"It's hard to summarize succinctly just how much is wrong with this movie. Instead of watching it, I'd recommend anyone to watch MauLer's critique of the movie on youtube. It's infinitely more entertaining and makes it very clear just how broken this movie is. It humiliates Luke Skywalker, shoves in tonally deaf comedy, and pays absolutely no respect to the worldbuilding of Star Wars. Heck, it doesn't even pay respect to the movie that came directly before it."
4625,1,A Violation of Meaningful Archetypes and Diversity,"A violation of meaningful archetypes, the need for wisdom of the past, and teachers. In the internal struggle against fear and failure, a suffering hero re-emerges to transcend to nothingness. The new hero needs no guidance nor backstory. That isn't celebration of gender or diversity but a crude devaluing of femininity to a fantastical, utopian idealization and white males to power-hungry, fearful mongrels. This is worse than the objectification of women."
4626,1,Here's why I think this is a terrible film,"""These are not the droids you're looking for."""
4627,4,Just me honest feelings as a big Star Wars fan.,"The movie totally abandons the whole logic and themes or Star Wars.<br /><br />Spoilers !!!<br /><br />The bad guys are now completely stupid unlike the genius Sidious , the bloodline is no longer connected Jedi ability and talent."
4628,1,This film has ruined my childhood,I remember as a 10 year old I went to see Star Wars at the cinema not knowing anything about it. I came out on cloud 9.. I had never seen anything like it before. 
4629,1,Thank you Disney... for burying the greatest franchise of our time!,I thought that TFA was the worst movie ever made...<br /><br />I was wrong THIS is the worst movie ever made.
4630,1,I'm sooo insanely disappointed...,"I for one enjoyed The Force Awakens. It had heart, energy, awesome new characters, caught up with most old characters, lightsaber battles, then we were left with tons of questions. The mystery behind it all was thrilling to me. Yes it wasn't the most original plot, but in my opinion JJ had to be under insane amounts of pressure bringing this franchise back to life. I feel he did star wars right, he seemed to care and it ended up being a Star Wars movie. "
4631,2,The last Star Wars I will ever watch,"Moving to Disney was de worst idee ever for mr G. Lucas. The franchise goes from bad to horrible. I gues Disney thought that will be a movie for stupid or very innocent people (toddlers). And they were right. A total waste of my time and money. But WTF, entire society goes from bad to worst, so it was obviously that movie industry will fall. Because it's not only this movie, 2017 was a desastrous year for entire industry. God knows that we are lucky that some TV series still exists."
4632,1,Rubbish,This is truly awful.<br /><br />Tragic. Such a lacklustre plot with far too much padding and uninteresting characters. Star Wars was always loose with physics but this goes too far. Dipping blaster shots in space. Explosions that arc debris down. Absolutely no respect for what came before. It's almost as if we are being trolled.<br /><br />Massive disappointment.
4633,1,Forgettable,"Lots of spectacle, but ends up being a forgettable film. Legitimately made me angry at times. It's bigger, but not better."
4634,1,How Disney destroys an iconic saga,"After watching several times star wars IV to VI, comes the prequels with jar jar binks. Alright, the movies were... ok despite its flaws and then comes Rhian Johnson with Kathleen Kennedy inside a death star to blow up to atoms this franchise. Disney transformed this successful franchise into a carousel for a disney audience."
4635,1,Total BS Wars,"How do I despise thee, let me count the ways... actually lost my count already..."
4636,5,'Salt',Story is a mess. Massive plot holes all over the place. Below is a list of what made me laugh
4637,4,8 Stars? Absolutely Not,"Sadly this film was completely underwhelming. The Last Jedi didn't stand much of a chance considering JJ ruined any chance for the trilogy to be good but TLJ didn't do much to try and change the course of the new trilogy. There were defiantly many routes Rian Johnson could have taken but decided to copy and paste from the Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. Same plot, same scenes, and the same characters. "
4638,1,A Real Review of Star Wars The Last Jedi,"There is nothing else to say about his movie . All the negative reviews and reviewers are absolutely right about this movie. This movie is the worst Star Wars movie ever made , the worst common sense movie ever made, the worst plot in a movie ever made and the worst way to treat a character who paved the way for this Star Wars universe to ebe created ever done by a studio . All Disney wants to do is make comedies with these new franchises they have hacked into.No Plot or good story writing or common sense .Disney has ruined the superhero movies along with Star Wars now and are moving to ruin whatever is left of the X-men universe . It's over for good action movies ."
4639,1,Violent and ugly,"What an appalling piece of cinema. As if you can make a good film with nothing but special effects and very very loud bangs every few seconds. What does it say about our culture that Disney can not only think they can get away with such brain dead fare but, judging by the viewer numbers, are right. One of the worst films ever made, makes Plan 9 from Outer Space seem like a masterpiece in comparison. The only fairly pleasant scenes in this waste of 2.5 hours are those on Luke's island. Lovely to look at and nice scenery there. But even there explosions and violence regularly occur, as if the audience will drift off with without regular shocks to their nervous systems. Typical of this disgrace's lack of subtlety is Lord Snoke (Snake?)What an ugly name, to go with his reptilian appearance, just in case we don't get the message that he is a bad guy. Childish, comic-book stuff."
4640,5,As much an amazing film as it is a massive disappointment.,"I decided to give The Last Jedi a second chance and see if I could understand better how come it is so divisive. I belong to that 50% of people who saw it at the cinema in 2017 and felt completely heartbroken. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a work of art in my whole life. Not only I got bored, I felt so let down, so angry. The film even managed to ruin my love for Star Wars as a whole. I wasn't able to watch or read any Star Wars content for about a year. My illusion was gone, my heroes tainted, the stories I had once adored now felt dumb and broken. And yet, I could see that some people genuinely liked The Last Jedi, and many film critics praised it. So, was I wrong? Did I overreact? Did I focus too much on what I didn't like instead of allowing myself to enjoy a novel approach on my beloved saga? I recently rewatched Episode 8 with an open mind to challenge myself.<br /><br />The truth is the film is not the bland, boring, nonsensical heresy I remembered. It isn't a cinematic masterpiece either. And, ""from a certain point of view"", it is both things at the same time.<br /><br />The Last Jedi is probably the most beautiful film in the whole of Star Wars. It is gorgeously shot. It is full of poetry and symbolism. It also has one of the best soundtracks in the saga. Very possibly, the best since the Return of the Jedi. The mixture of music and cinematography is stunning. A treat for the senses.<br /><br />The story is simple, but it works, and it even challenges the viewer with some unexpected twists, driven by a concept that is repeated througout the film: you must let the past die, look forward. Sure, there is a kiss that feels shoehorned because there must be a love story, a dramatic situation that is dragged for so long it ends up not being dramatic at all, some pedagogical moments that feel cringy, pretty bad humour and a main character that is so flawless it is hard to connect with her. And yet, overall, the story is consistent and interesting, plus it is told beautifully.<br /><br />Doesn't sound too bad though, does it? So, why did it disappoint me so much when I first saw it? Was I a bit of a drama queen? I probably was, yes, but that doesn't change the fact The Last Jedi is a disappointment.<br /><br />The reason why I felt so heartbroken back in 2017, and the reason why I still can't really enjoy this film even if I must admit it is not that bad as I once thought, is that it not only ignores the lore and the atmosphere of the older films, it doesn't even respect the previous installment of the sequels. It goes its own way, which would be okay if this was some spin off with new characters, but it isn't. For the invested Star Wars fan, the sequels, and The Last Jedi in particular, are a frustrating and disappointing experience.<br /><br />JJ Abrams was so scared of the fans it risked nothing on The Force Awakens. Anything that could have been challenging or new, was left as a cliffhanger or a black box. The infamous ""good story for another time"" quote summarises well what I felt throughout the whole film. Everything is either a lazy copy of the original trilogy or a story for another time. Why is Rey so overpowered without training? Who's Snoke? Who's Maz? What is the First Order? Is Finn force sensitive? Was Han waiting for Rey? As disappointing as it was, I believed at the time I could be forgiving because it was the first part in a trilogy.<br /><br />The Last Jedi not only didn't bother to deal with any of those questions left unanswered by the Force Awakens, it went against what was built by that film, creating confusion and frustration on viewers like me. Characters that seemed to go on a direction, suddenly go on a different one. Even established characters like Luke Skywalker are drastically changed so they can match the film's message. Where JJ Abrams philosophy was ""don't risk"" and ""repeat what worked in the past"", Rian Johnson's was, ""grow up"", ""kill the past"". In my humble opinion, both approaches are wrong or, at the very least, they weren't accomplished with enough skill and taste.<br /><br />Rian Johnson believes the manichean concept of good and evil in Star Wars is too simple and must evolve. He thinks heroes like Luke Skywalker must be shown as pathetic relics, so we learn that we should all fend for ourselves, we must not rely on heroes. Instead, we can all be heroes, like Rey or the broom boy. Beautiful concept, if it wasn't because it isn't what we have seen in the previous 7 films of the saga (Jedi knights are heroes, people are people), it goes against what makes Star Wars special (hope and optimism) and Rey is so perfect it is impossible to use her as a role model. If anything, farmboy turned Jedi knight Luke is more ""one of us"" than perfect Mary Sue Rey. Also, I don't need to be told that wars are bad, profiteering is bad and heroes are imperfect, I know that. But I watch Star Wars precisely so I can escape from the grim reality of life, because it is about the triumph of hope and perseverance, because good wins in the end and because there are no grey areas. Characters are powerful archetypes. The themes of family and betrayal are grand. The Last Jedi is a contemporary take on something that is atemporal. Star Wars is epic, motivating and it rings with the same tone of the great tales of old. Those tales bonded communities and made them part of something bigger than themselves. The Last Jedi, in spite of all its poetry, its ambitious themes and its cinematic beauty, achieves the total opposite. It is divisive, annoying, childishly pedagogic and disrespectful with everything that came before. It is great cinema, average story telling and horrible Star Wars."
4641,1,An Insult to the Star Wars Franchise,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I am severely disappointed. In all honesty, I really enjoyed the Force Awakens. The new characters were lovable, it had a good balance of old and new so it appealed to all audiences, and it had that classic ""Star Wars"" feeling. I left the theater in 2015 feeling hopeful for the future of the saga, thinking that The Force Awakens had set up a ton of potential for the characters and story.<br /><br />For two years, I looked forward to The Last Jedi. And...well...it's bad. Really, really bad. If you enjoyed it, good on you, but here are my opinions: "
4642,1,Wow what a disappointment!,I really wanted to like this movie l. Really i did. But man what the he'll happened to star wars?plot holes upon plot holes.does not make any sense from the force awakens just terrible!
4643,5,Not impressed,The story was boring. I liked the intense fight scenes but Luke wouldn't come with them.
4644,1,One of the worst films in cinematic history.,"Not only is this horribly misthought abortion of a film the worst Starwars film ever made, it is also one of the worst films ever made.<br /><br />We all waited two years to see how the epic ending of the The Force Awakens would pan out, morphing into the next chapter. To say it was disappointing and was a harsh kick in the nuts to ALL Starwars fans would be the understatement of the century.<br /><br />It takes what JJ accomplished in the first new film, picks it up, then wipes its rectum with it.<br /><br />The epic moment we all waited for was soiled in some sort of sick joke, as Luke throws the lightsaber away in a sort of terrible attempt at comedy. It lost me right then and there.<br /><br />Was there bad blood between Rian and JJ? It seems the only logical conclusion to why he would destroy all the hard work put into the first new film by a far superior director and storyteller. Maybe he was jealous? Maybe he has an exceptionally low IQ? <br /><br />If there was ever a film that was a red-hot candidate to be instantly remade - this is it.<br /><br />I hated the prequels, and never thought Starwars could go lower - but it has. TLJ has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. None. At least the prequels had Darth Maul!<br /><br />The script falls so short, and is so nonsensical, that I actually felt sorry for the actors. <br /><br />The approval score of 7.1 is obviously fake - as the only people that actually liked this film were those that have no appreciation of cinema at all, and would get amped about going to see Transformers or Fast and Furious 28 after a lengthy session eating McDonalds at the foodcourt. <br /><br />The fan reviews speak for themselves. Who are you trying to fool?<br /><br />I wanted a Starwars film. Nothing much to ask - just a space opera that continues the saga that we all grew up with, and also features (pays tribute) to the timeless characters that we all know and love. This film is an insult to the senses - and also an insult to the memories of the actors, writers, crew and fans of every single film made previously. <br /><br />I grew up loving Starwars, and was so excited to be at the global premiere of this appalling film. Personally, it wouldn't have taken much to please me, and send me to the 'Galaxy far, far away' once again. I wasn't there to critique, I was there to relive my childhood. My childhood (and every other fanboy's) was totally disregarded, and my love of Starwars tainted forever - and my excitement for ANY new Starwars films is now non-existant.<br /><br />Yet I walked out of this film silent, with my heart broken - wondering what I had just witnessed?<br /><br />The only thing that is even remotely interesting is how they will come back after such a terrible film that made SO much money? If you liked it, you are an idiot. Sorry, but it's the truth.<br /><br />I'd give it no stars, but I have to put one star in to make the review viewable.<br /><br />Shame on you Rian Johnson. You should be held accountable and globally shamed for this atrocious excuse for a Starwars film. You are the 'dubstep' of cinema - a flash in the pan that was sub-par throughout, and only cherished by those that never experienced the magic of the golden years. I would not shake your hand - not ever. You sicken me. <br /><br />Solo - who cares!! The next film - meh!! I'm done.<br /><br />Goodbye Starwars, I loved you once."
4645,1,Jumped the Shark,"This film was horrible. Wow! That was bad. It made me realize just how addicted to the Star Wars franchise I am. I'm still gonna watch the next one to come out, because I like Star Wars, I like the Force, I like Spaceships, I like talking robots and light sabers, and hyperspace jumps...I'm like a junkie. The original Star Wars (from the 70's) was so good, it's been carrying the franchise ever since. <br /><br />The only thing missing in this movie is Luke Skywalker, on water skis, wearing a leather jacket, and jumping over a shark...a shark with frickin laser beams!"
4646,3,You go in to see a Star Wars movie... But get a sloppy directed Disney movie,"When I went to the theater to watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi I was expecting an awesome adventure that Star wars always seemed to deliver to us before (Except the Attack of the clones). But somehow it fell flat on its face, to say that this was a great movie would be a crime against humanity! J.J. Abrams lifted Star wars out of the prequels so it could become something better. But Rian Johnson kicked it back into the DIRT! The first act was good, I was engaged and excited... Untilllll Leia, who somehow learned how to use the force suddenly saved her self from death. That brought me out the movie! Then it regained my interest, everything was going great, the tension was building up, the plot was falling into place. Rey goes to Snoke, we get a couple minutes of Snoke torturing Rey, then asked Kylo to kill her. What does Kylo do!? Turns a lightsaber besides Snoke on to CUT HIM IN HALF! Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea!? After that, you think Kylo was done with the dark side but nooooooo. He goes right back and becomes the new supreme leader. And Rey, she just helps her friends and is exactly where she was at the end of the last movie. Luke was the worst tragedy of this film by far, he goes out by using the force to have a force hologram thing show up in the battle to distract Kylo. After that, he dies! WTF!!!!! They really needed someone to supervise this movie, because Rian Johnson made this move a complete wreak. There is a lot more I could have talked about but I'm done for now... Don't watch it!"
4647,2,Admiral,New Stars wars Movie is full of women that are always right theology! It's already proven on the battle field woman aren't built for battle field or war; Lucus wouldn't stand for such an error in writing. Likely supported by an AI that knows it need to appeal more to a heroic female character.
4648,4,A doomed franchise,"The previous installment left me with a bitter taste and I came into this movie hoping they could redeem it by doing something interesting with the newly established characters. Without going into spoilers, they've basically ruined any chance for good character development to take place and the focus has shifted instead to mindless action scenes without much cohesion and plot to support it."
4649,5,Worst Star Wars movie to date,"A lot of things don't make sense in this movie (ie. Luke's story arc), nothing really happens in this film, you can pretty much just skip it and hope Episode IX will be worth watching. Definitely not a fan of Rian Johnson."
